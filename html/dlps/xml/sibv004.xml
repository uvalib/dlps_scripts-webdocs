                                   <p>THE EDITOR WHO APPROACHES <hi rend="italic">ROMEO AND
                                                 Juliet</hi> must carefully consider the first
                                          quarto, Q1, published in 1597, and the second quarto, Q2,
                                          published in 1599. Q1 is in its entirety a substantive
                                          edition. It was at no point printed from any document now
                                          extant. Granted the fact that, as we shall see, Q2 depends
                                          directly on Q1 at certain points, it is nevertheless
                                          abundantly clear to the most superficial observation that,
                                          as a whole, Q2 is not a reproduction of Q1. Q2 depends
                                          also on some other, non-extant, source&mdash;presumably a
                                          manuscript. In the main Q2 is also a substantive edition.
                                          Only Q1 and Q2 have the status of substantive
                                          editions.</p>

                                   <p>Q1 is a 'bad' quarto, and Q2 is a 'good' quarto. It is
                                          generally agreed, I believe, that Q2 gives a text taken in
                                          the main from an authentic documentary source. As regards
                                          the Q1 text, I subscribe to what I take to be a common
                                          view&mdash;namely, that it is a memorial
                                          reconstruction&mdash;the work of a reporter or
                                          reporters.</p>

                                   <p>The first question which I should like to discuss
                                          is&mdash;what exactly was the nature of the copy for
                                          Q2?</p>

                                   <p>It is well known that there are some conspicuous
                                          bibliographical links between the two quartos. They
                                          indicate that, at any rate at certain points, Q2 was
                                          printed from a copy of Q1.</p>

                                   <p>Indubitable and impressive links are to be found in an
                                          extended series in the passage stretching from I ii 57 to

                                                 >4</hi></ref> in my view convincingly, that here we
                                          are dealing, not with independent derivation of the two
                                          printed texts from the same document, but with a direct
                                          dependence of Q2 on the printed pages of Q1.</p>
                                   <p>Noting a number of links in this passage, Miss Hjort
                                          apparently sprang to the conclusion that Q2 in its
                                          entirety was printed from a copy of Q1 which had been
                                          corrected by an editor by comparison with another
                                          document. I am not the first to point out that this could
                                          not be so, since there are some pages in Q1 which simply
                                          could not have been altered in pen and ink in order to
                                          yield the Q2 text: more alterations and additions would
                                          have been required than there would have been room for on
                                          the Q1 pages. Miss Hjort's theory will not do as regards
                                          the nature of the copy for Q2 <hi rend="italic">as a
                                                 whole</hi>. Sir Walter Greg subsequently suggested
                                          that the copy for Q2 consisted of (i) a first quarto,
                                          corrected by an editor, in handwriting, as far as the end
                                          of sheet B, and (ii) from that point on, a transcript of a
                                          playhouse manuscript. Here are Sir Walter's own words: "It
                                          seems clear that some editor was commissioned to prepare
                                          the copy for an authorized quarto, and for this purpose
                                          was provided with the 1597 edition and a playhouse
                                          manuscript. He began by taking the printed text and
                                          elaborately correcting and expanding it by comparison with
                                          the manuscript, but when he got to the end of sheet B he
                                          decided that it would be less trouble to make a transcript
                                          of the latter. This he proceeded to do through the
                                          remainder of the play, though I will not say that he may
                                          not have used other fragments of the printed text, and I
                                          am certain that he consulted it on occasions when the
                                          manuscript was obscure."<ref target="f004.01.05" n="5"

                                   <p>Now in the article which I have cited Mr. Thomas makes a point
                                          which seems to me sound, and which necessitates a
                                          modification of Sir Walter Greg's theory. Let us consider
                                          the relationship between the two quartos up to the end of
                                          Q1 sheet B, leaving <pb n="004.005"/> the Prologue out of
                                          account until further notice. From the first line of the
                                          first scene of the play up to the end of Q1 sheet B, there
                                          are no bibliographical links between the two quartos
                                          before I ii 57. There is nothing between I i 1 and I ii 56
                                          which in any way necessitates the view that Q2 depends on
                                          Q1. From I ii 57 to I iii 36 there is a considerable
                                          amount of impressive evidence indicating a direct
                                          dependence of Q2 on Q1. Some of this evidence consists of
                                          errors in Q1 which are reproduced in Q2. On the one hand
                                          these errors were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> corrected:
                                          and on the other hand there is no textual difference
                                          between the two quartos in the relevant passage which need
                                          be regarded as a correction by an editor. Between the two
                                          points with which we are here concerned, I ii 57 and I iii
                                          36, the two quartos show only a handful of verbal
                                          differences. At I ii 68 Q1 has an "and" which Q2 lacks (Q1
                                                 <hi rend="italic">"my faire Neece</hi> Rosaline <hi
                                                 rend="italic">and Liuia</hi>, Q2 <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >my faire Neece</hi> Rosaline, Liuia,); but the Q2
                                          compositor could easily omit a single word by accident,
                                          and it is highly probable that the Q1 "and" is correct,
                                          since the context appears to be verse, and the "and" is
                                          necessary for metrical smoothness. At I ii 77 we have the
                                          variant Q1 "thee", Q2 "you" (Q1 "Indeed I should haue askt
                                          thee that before", Q2 "Indeed I should haue askt you that
                                          before"). The Q2 compositor may well have made the
                                          substitution unconsciously himself as he carried a group
                                          of words in his head while setting up type. Or perhaps his
                                          eye caught the "you" in the next line. At I iii 12 we have
                                          Q1 "a", Q2 "an". Q2 is right, for the next word is "houre"
                                          (Q1 <hi rend="italic">"Faith I can tell her age vnto a
                                                 houre",</hi> Q2 <hi rend="italic">"Faith I can tell
                                                 her age vnto an houre"</hi>); but the Q2 compositor
                                          could easily make the obvious correction on his own
                                          responsibility. At I iii 33 Q2 has a definite article
                                          which is desirable from the point of view of sense, and
                                          which is absent from Q1 (Q1 <hi rend="italic">"to see it
                                                 teachie and fall out with Dugge",</hi> Q2 <hi
                                                 rend="italic">"to see it teachie and fall out with
                                                 the Dugge"</hi>); but, again, the Q2 compositor
                                          could easily have supplied it on his own initiative. And
                                          these four appear to be the only verbal variations between
                                          the two quartos in the passage extending from the first to
                                          the last bibliographical link in this portion of the
                                                 play.<ref target="f004.01.06" n="6"><hi
                                                  rend="super">6</hi></ref> The position is, then,
                                          that in this passage certain errors in Q1 were not
                                          corrected in the <pb n="004.006"/> copy for Q2, while the
                                          few small verbal alterations that there are in Q2 can all
                                          be attributed to the Q2 compositor himself. It looks,
                                          then, as if between I ii 57 and I iii 36 Q2 was printed
                                          from Q1 unrevised by scribal intervention.</p>


                                   <p>Now Mr. Thomas argues<ref target="f004.01.07" n="7"><hi
                                                  rend="super">7</hi></ref> that, before and after
                                          this passage, Q1, up to the end of sheet B, could hardly
                                          have been corrected to yield the Q2 text, for more
                                          alterations and additions would have been required than
                                          there is room for in Q1. I agree. And so I believe that
                                          Sir Walter Greg's theory of the relationship of the two
                                          quartos up to the end of Q1 sheet B must be modified. Q1
                                          sheet B ends at I iii 100. My view of the copy for Q2 up
                                          to this point (excluding the Prologue) is as follows: from
                                          I i 1 to I ii 56 Q2 depends on manuscript copy; from I ii
                                          57 to I iii 36 Q2 depends on Q1 unrevised; from that point
                                          to I iii 100 Q2 again depends on manuscript copy. This I
                                          take to be Mr. Thomas's view, and I think he is right.</p>


                                   <p>It is interesting to speculate on the question of why, at I ii
                                          57, Q2 should suddenly begin to depend on Q1 instead of on
                                          the copy on which it has hitherto been depending, and why,
                                          at I iii 36, it should suddenly revert to copy other than
                                          Q1. An obvious suggestion is that between these two points
                                          a manuscript ultimately or directly underlying Q2 was
                                          mutilated or illegible, so that recourse had to be had, by
                                          editor or compositor, to the previously printed edition.
                                          Mr. Thomas, the most recent scholar to discuss this
                                          matter, has advanced this explanation. "The manuscript
                                          from which Q2 was printed," he declares, "either lacked
                                          the leaves which contained the lines [in question] or was
                                          completely illegible at that point."<ref
                                                 target="f004.01.08" n="8"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >8</hi></ref> Mr. Thomas is here reiterating the
                                          explanation given by the earliest critic who noticed the
                                          connection between the two quartos here&mdash;Robert
                                          Gericke. But I am not quite happy about this explanation,
                                          for the following reason. Round about the point where Q2
                                          here ceases to depend on Q1, in the midst of a long speech
                                          by the Nurse, the Q1 text changes its character. Up to I
                                          iii 36 the Nurse's lines in Q1 have, I think, been
                                          metrically quite satisfactory. At I iii 36 Q2 suddenly
                                          ceases to depend on Q1, and only five lines further on we
                                          find that, while Q2 is still metrically <pb n="004.007"/>
                                          satisfactory, Q1 shows a definite metrical breakdown.<ref
                                                 target="f004.01.09" n="9"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >9</hi></ref> Does this not at least suggest to us
                                          the idea that perhaps Q2 is dependent on Q1 in the passage
                                          with which we are concerned because that passage is in Q1
                                          satisfactory in the main, whereas Q2 leaves Q1 at I iii 36
                                          because Q1 becomes no longer satisfactory? That is what I
                                          tentatively suggest.</p>



                                   <p>Q2 leaves Q1 at I iii 36. Almost immediately Q1 shows memorial
                                          corruption. In Q1, immediately after Q2 has left it, the
                                          Nurse speaks of how Juliet could have "wadled vp and
                                          downe". In Q2 she speaks of how Juliet could have "run and
                                          wadled all about". I believe that in Q1 we have here an
                                          anticipation of II v 51 where the same speaker, the Nurse,
                                          refers to herself, in Q2, as catching her death with
                                          "iaunsing vp and downe". Q2 has no sooner left Q1 here in
                                          I iii than Q1&mdash;immediately&mdash;shows memorial
                                          corruption. Now we must be very careful. Immediately Q2
                                          leaves Q1, Q1 has memorial corruption. But it may be
                                          suggested that Q1 has memorial corruption in the passage
                                          in which Q2 copies it&mdash; memorial corruption not
                                          detectable because there is nothing with which to compare
                                          the Q1 text (that of Q2 being the same). We must, then, be
                                          careful. The argument I should advance is this. In Q1,
                                          from the beginning of I iii up to I iii 36 the Nurse's
                                          part is satisfactory metrically: at I iii 36 Q2 leaves Q1:
                                          within five lines of this we find that Q1 is metrically
                                          unsatisfactory, whereas the different text of Q2 continues
                                          metrically sound: this suggests that Q2 may leave Q1
                                          because, whereas Q1 had been satisfactory as a whole
                                          heretofore for a time, it no longer was. But why should Q2
                                          leave Q1 four lines before the metrical breakdown in Q1?
                                          Well, in the very second line after Q2 leaves it, Q1 shows
                                          a memorial error. I admit that my suggestion is without
                                          absolute proof. But I should say that it seems to me
                                          reasonable to suppose that Q2 leaves Q1 at I iii 36 not
                                          because the manuscript behind Q2 has suddenly become
                                          legible again, where before, for a considerable stretch,
                                          it has not been legible, but rather because before I iii
                                          36 Q1 for a time gave a text in the main satisfactory,
                                          whereas after that it does not.</p>

                                   <p>I should suggest, then, the following hypothesis, very
                                          tentatively. A person who may be called the Q2 editor, or
                                          Scribe E, was entrusted officially with the task of
                                          preparing copy for Q2. He <pb n="004.008"/> was equipped
                                          with an authentic manuscript, and also with a copy of Q1.
                                          At I i 1 he began transcribing the authentic manuscript.
                                          But he continually looked at Q1, comparing it with the
                                          authentic manuscript. When he came to I ii 57 he read
                                          ahead in Q1, comparing it with the manuscript, and he
                                          found that for some time thereafter&mdash;up to I iii 36,
                                          in fact&mdash;Q1 was of good quality. He saw that after
                                          that point Q1 deteriorated sharply. And so, having up to I
                                          ii 56 been copying the authentic manuscript, he now tore
                                          out of his Q1 the two leaves, B3 and B4, which contained
                                          the patch of text he had found to be satisfactory. He drew
                                          his pen through the text on B3<hi rend="super">r</hi> up
                                          to and including I ii 56, and he drew his pen through the
                                          text on B4<hi rend="super">v</hi> after I iii 36. Then he
                                          simply put the two printed leaves, so dealt with, in the
                                          pile of leaves, hitherto manuscript, which he was
                                          producing to form the copy for Q2. We note, of course,
                                          that, while Scribe E found the Q1 text satisfactory
                                          between the two points, he neglected to correct
                                          (presumably even to notice) certain errors which Q1 in
                                          fact contained there: it is less satisfactory to us than
                                          it seemed to him.</p>

                                   <p>I cannot forbear referring to the well-known fact that a
                                          troublesome and interesting feature of this sheet B
                                          passage in which Q2 depends on Q1 is that in it the
                                          Nurse's lines are printed in italics in both quartos. The
                                          Nurse begins speaking at I iii 2, and that it is her first
                                          line in the play.</p>

                                   <p>Now since Q2 is dependent on Q1 in this passage, it is easy to
                                          say that the Nurse's lines are here printed in italics in
                                          Q2 because they are so in Q1. That, I think, is correct.
                                          The awkward question that must be faced is&mdash;why were
                                          they printed in italics in Q1 in the first place? I can
                                          only assume (and I do not think I am the first to do so)
                                          that in the manuscript behind Q1 the Nurse's lines in this
                                          section of text were written in the Italian type of
                                          handwriting, the speeches of the other characters being
                                          written in the English type of handwriting. The Q1
                                          compositor reproduced this calligraphic distinction
                                          typographically. Now why should the Nurse's lines be
                                          written in any manuscript in a different type of
                                          handwriting from those of the other characters? I cannot
                                          see that it can be held in the least probable that anyone
                                          writing the play out straight ahead would on his own
                                          initiative vary his handwriting in this way. I take it,
                                          then, that at this point there lies behind Q1 a <pb
                                                 n="004.009"/> composite manuscript. One of the
                                          persons involved wrote the Italian type of hand. He wrote
                                          out the Nurse's lines, but not those of the other
                                          characters. What sort of manuscript would contain the
                                          speeches of only one character? Clearly, one presumes, an
                                          actor's manuscript <hi rend="italic">part</hi>. The
                                          following theory would explain the facts. The persons
                                          responsible for producing the copy for Q1 had in their
                                          possession a manuscript fragment containing the beginning
                                          of the Nurse's part. This was written in an Italian hand.
                                          One of the persons involved in the production of the copy
                                          wrote the intervening speeches of the other characters
                                          into this manuscript fragment. He used an English hand.
                                          The result would be a scrap of manuscript in which the
                                          Nurse's lines appeared in one type of handwriting, and the
                                          intervening speeches of the other characters in the other
                                          type of handwriting. A compositor who decided to reproduce
                                          this difference typographically would produce a printed
                                          text such as we find in fact in Q1. Using Q1, the Q2
                                          compositor, reproducing the typography of his copy, would
                                          produce what we find in fact in Q2. Such a manuscript
                                          fragment as I am suggesting would, one supposes, have
                                          originally contained cue-words, and these presumably were
                                          also written in Italian handwriting. But it is easy to
                                          suppose that in the composite fragment the cue-words were
                                          deleted when the complete intervening speeches were
                                          inserted in English handwriting.</p>

                                   <p>In connection with the italics in the Nurse's part a further
                                          point must be noted. Q2 leaves Q1 at I iii 36. Scribe E
                                          doubtless reverted to the production of manuscript copy.
                                          After I iii 36, sig. B4<hi rend="super">v</hi> of Q1 could
                                          hardly have been corrected by hand so as to produce the Q2
                                          text&mdash;there is not enough room. But Q2 continues to
                                          set up the Nurse's lines in italics for a while (up to the
                                          end of sheet B). That, I imagine,&mdash;and the suggestion
                                          does not originate with me,&mdash;is to be attributed to
                                          the Q2 compositor deciding to go on, on his own
                                          responsibility, making a typographical distinction no
                                          longer rooted in his copy.</p>

                                   <p>Italics for the Nurse cease in Q1 at the end of sheet C.
                                          Again, of course, it is not necessary to assume that, for
                                          the Nurse's speeches, Q1 depends on copy in Italian
                                          handwriting right up to the end of sheet C. The
                                          fragmentary manuscript part which we have postulated may
                                          have broken off before that, and the Q1 <pb n="004.010"/>
                                          compositor may have continued his italics on his own
                                          responsibility until the absurdity of the procedure
                                          occurred to him or was pointed out to him.</p>

                                   <p>I have spoken of a fragment of a manuscript part: but I would
                                          point out that I have not claimed that it was <hi
                                                 rend="italic">authentic</hi> at any point. Scribe E
                                          accepted the Nurse's first 28 lines or so from Q1, and, as
                                          we have seen, they are metrically satisfactory; but that
                                          may be attributable simply to good reporting.</p>

                                   <p>A final word remains to be said about another detail of the Q1
                                          italics problem in I iii. In Q1 the scene ends with a
                                          three-line speech by the Clown, and it is printed in
                                          italics. It is not so printed in Q2. The question
                                          is&mdash;does Q1, as regards this three-line speech by the
                                          Clown, rely on copy in Italian handwriting? I do not think
                                          it necessary to assume that it does. The Clown's italics
                                          may be laid solely to the charge of the Q1 compositor. For
                                          quite a time he has been setting alternate passages in
                                          italic and roman. The Nurse's final speech in the scene is
                                          in Q1 followed by a single-line speech by Lady Capulet, in
                                          roman, and then by a three-line speech by Juliet, also in
                                          roman. Then comes the Clown's three-line speech, in
                                          italics. It is quite conceivable that the Q1 compositor
                                          simply decided, on his own initiative, that it was time
                                          for italics again.</p>

                                   <p>Q1 sheet B finishes at I iii 100. Sir Walter Greg's theory was
                                          that up to this point Q2 was printed from a copy of Q1
                                          corrected by hand. That theory we must, I think, reject;
                                          and we must substitute the following. From I i 1 up to I
                                          ii 56 Q2 was printed from manuscript copy: from I ii 57 to
                                          I iii 36 Q2 was printed from Q1 uncorrected by Scribe E:
                                          and from that point to I iii 100 Q2 was printed again from
                                          manuscript copy.</p>

                                   <p>It will be recalled that Sir Walter Greg's theory had it that
                                          after the point in the text which coincides with the end
                                          of Q1 sheet B the copy for Q2 consisted of a transcription
                                          of a playhouse manuscript&mdash;"though," Sir Walter
                                          declares, "I will not say that [the scribe] may not have
                                          used other fragments of the printed text, and I am certain
                                          that he consulted it on occasions when the manuscript was

                                          with the question&mdash;what was the nature of the copy

                                   <p>In 1919 Messrs. Pollard and Dover Wilson produced a set of
                                          articles on the Shakespearian bad quartos. <ref
                                                 target="f004.01.11" n="11"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >11</hi></ref> In these articles they discussed the
                                          origin of the bad quarto texts, and they advanced a highly
                                          ingenious theory. It was a very gallant attempt at
                                          explaining a very puzzling group of texts, and it was
                                          based on some acute observation. But it was wrong, as Mr.
                                          Dover Wilson is now the first to admit. Yet, as regards
                                                 <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet,</hi> in
                                          enunciating and endeavouring to uphold their theory,
                                          Messrs. Pollard and Dover Wilson noted something which is
                                          undeniably true&mdash;that there are bibliographical links
                                          between the two quartos in two passages subsequent to the
                                          end of Q1 sheet B. These links are to be found at II iv
                                          36-43 and III v 26-35. The passages occur in Q1 on leaves
                                          E1 and G3 respectively. In these two passages, admittedly
                                          short, there is between the two quartos a remarkable
                                          degree of agreement in the use of initial capitals and in
                                          the placing of colons; yet there are verbal differences in
                                          each case. Mr. Thomas suggests<ref target="f004.01.12"

                                          two passages we have examples of the Q2 editor consulting
                                          Q1 because the manuscript he was copying was illegible. I
                                          cannot myself think that this is a very likely explanation
                                          here. Consider the first of the two passages, II iv 36-43.

                                   <p>Mr. Thomas's theory assumes that when he came to the words
                                          "Without his Roe, like a dryed Hering" Scribe E found his
                                          manuscript difficult to read. So he looked at Q1. He
                                          copied these words from Q1, reproducing Q1's
                                          capitalisation. He then proceeded with the speech, copying
                                          Q1, copying its capitals and its colons. But he must have
                                          had his eye on his manuscript too, for he made changes in
                                          the text of the Q1 passage. Of course, it might be
                                          suggested that not all the alterations are his work.
                                          Perhaps in a given case the Q2 compositor made an
                                          alteration owing to carelessness. But we could not
                                          possibly hold that the Q2 compositor was responsible for
                                          all the changes in this short passage: there are too many
                                          changes in too short a passage to make that in the least
                                          likely. For at least some of the changes Scribe E must be
                                          responsible. But again, it might, I suppose, be suggested
                                          that Scribe E, copying Q1 here because his manuscript was
                                          illegible, altered Q1 memorially. That is certainly
                                          possible. But there is no positive evidence to indicate
                                          this hypothesis here, and it would, I think, be unsafe to
                                          have recourse to it. I think we must assume that some, if
                                          not indeed all, of the Q2 alterations in this passage came
                                          from the authentic manuscript used in the preparation of
                                          the copy for Q2. Now what of the suggestion that in this
                                          passage Scribe E consulted Q1 because the manuscript he
                                          was copying was illegible? If we accept that suggestion we
                                          must, I think, be prepared to take the following, for
                                          example, as sufficiently likely to be acceptable. Consider
                                          the portion of text beginning with the words "<hi
                                                 rend="italic">Laura</hi> to his Lady". Owing to
                                          illegibility in the manuscript before him, Scribe E
                                          applied himself to the task of copying out of Q1 the words
                                                 "<hi rend="italic">Laura</hi> to his Lady was but a
                                          kitchin drudg, yet she had a better loue to berime her:".
                                          He followed Q1 sufficiently closely to reproduce the
                                          capitalisation and the colon; but at the ninth and tenth
                                          words the manuscript before him suddenly became
                                          sufficiently legible to show him that instead of Q1's
                                          "drudg" he must write "wench", and instead of Q1's "yet"
                                          he must write "marrie". Having taken these words from the
                                          manuscript which was allegedly difficult to read, he
                                          returned to Q1, continuing to accept its capitals and its
                                          colons, but introducing other verbal alterations from the
                                          manuscript. I cannot say that this appears to me a very
                                          likely theory. I should rather say that the most
                                          reasonable explanation of the relationship between the two
                                                 <pb n="004.013"/> quartos in this passage is that
                                          Q2 was printed from Q1 itself, the latter having been
                                          corrected by Scribe E by comparison with his manuscript
                                          (which was not illegible).</p>

                                   <p>Of course, if any critic feels that the agreements in
                                          capitalisation and punctuation between the two quartos in
                                          the passage we are dealing with can be explained as simply
                                          a matter of coincidence, then he will not be much
                                          impressed by the above suggestion. I myself cannot regard
                                          them as a matter of pure coincidence. To postulate pure
                                          coincidence would be to strain credibility too far. For
                                          one thing, in the passage we have been examining there is
                                          a remarkable agreement between Q1 and Q2 in the matter of
                                          the setting up of proper names in italic or roman type. It
                                          is not only that the same words have initial capitals in
                                          both texts, and that the colons appear in exactly the same
                                          places: we also have to reckon with the fact that in both
                                          texts all the proper names in the passage are italicised
                                          except three&mdash;the same three in both
                                          texts&mdash;namely, Petrarch, Dido, and Cleopatra. In Q1
                                          the first letter of "Dido" is in italic, the other three
                                          in roman: in Q2 all four letters of the name are in roman:
                                          but it is an essential agreement. I am sure that the name
                                          "Dido" appears in roman in Q2 because it does
                                          (essentially) in Q1, and that the names "Petra (r) ch" and
                                          "Cleopatra" appear in roman in Q2 because they do in Q1.
                                          Q2 surely depends directly on Q1 in this passage; but the
                                          Q1 passage has been altered editorially.</p>

                                   <p>I have not the space to examine the other passage I referred
                                          to&mdash;III v 26-35. I can only say that a comparison of
                                          the two versions of it seems to me to indicate the same
                                          conclusion.</p>

                                   <p>Now, having decided that in these two short passages Q2 is
                                          dependent on an edited copy of Q1, we naturally look
                                          carefully at the two leaves of Q1 involved&mdash;E1 and
                                          G3. We look at each in its entirety. And I should claim
                                          that it is possible, in pen and ink, to correct these two
                                          Q1 leaves in their entirety so as to give the Q2 text. I
                                          think it reasonable, then, to suggest, and I do suggest,
                                          that part of the copy for Q2 consisted of leaves E1 and G3
                                          of Q1, corrected by hand in accordance with an
                                          authoritative manuscript, and then torn out of the
                                          particular first quarto used, and placed in the bundle of
                                          papers that formed the copy for Q2.</p>

                                   <p>It may be suggested that certain other leaves of Q1 were also
                                                 <pb n="004.014"/> torn out and, in an edited state,
                                          used as copy for Q2. I should like to suggest that Q1 leaf
                                          D1 may well be a case in point. This leaf includes the
                                          passage II ii 40-43. In Q1 it runs&mdash; <q>
                                                 <l>Whats <hi rend="italic">Mountague</hi>? It is
                                                  nor hand nor foote,</l>
                                                 <l>Nor arme, nor face, nor any other part.</l>
                                                 <l>Whats in a name? That which we call a Rose, <hi
                                                  rend="italic">etc.</hi></l>
                                          </q> In Q2 we have&mdash; <q>
                                                 <l>Whats <hi rend="italic">Mountague</hi>? it is
                                                  nor hand nor foote,</l>
                                                 <l>Nor arme nor face, &ocirc; be some other
                                                  name</l>
                                                 <l>Belonging to a man.</l>
                                                 <l>Whats in a name that which we call a rose, <hi
                                                  rend="italic">etc.</hi></l>
                                          </q> The Q2 version seems hardly satisfactory. There is
                                          nothing necessarily suspicious about the fact that in Q2
                                          the half-line "Belonging to a man" stands as a metrically
                                          incomplete line. But some readers&mdash;and I am among
                                          them&mdash;consider that the phrase "some other name
                                          Belonging to a man" seems rather odd. I suggest that Q2
                                          here depends on the Q1 page corrected by Scribe E. He
                                          wanted to indicate on his Q1 page the following version: <q>
                                                 <l>Whats <hi rend="italic">Mountague</hi>? It is
                                                  nor hand nor foote,</l>
                                                 <l>Nor arme, nor face, nor any other part</l>
                                                 <l>Belonging to a man. O be some other name.</l>
                                                 <l>Whats in a name? That which we call a Rose, <hi
                                                  rend="italic">etc.</hi></l>
                                          </q> To indicate this, he had to insert a complete line
                                          into his first quarto&mdash;"Belonging to a man. O be some
                                          other name.". I suggest that he put in the words
                                          "Belonging to a man." directly under the words "Nor arme,
                                          nor face,". I suggest that he inserted the words "O be
                                          some other name." in the right-hand margin. He drew a line
                                          connecting the beginning of this right-hand marginal
                                          insertion to the end of the interlinear insertion. This
                                          connecting stroke accidentally scored through the words
                                          "nor any other part", and the result was that the Q2
                                          compositor thought that the words "O be some other name"
                                          were intended to <hi rend="italic">replace</hi> the words
                                          "nor any other part", and he thought that these words, "O
                                          be some other name", were intended to be followed by the
                                          interlinear insertion, "Belonging to a man". The
                                          conflation, traditional since Malone, is I believe,
                                          correct. This may perhaps be regarded as tenuous evidence
                                          for the theory that here Q2 depends on an edited leaf of
                                                 <pb n="004.015"/> Q1. But that seems to me the best
                                          explanation of the textual conditions. The whole of Q1
                                          leaf D1 <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be corrected by hand in
                                          such a way as to produce the Q2 text&mdash;there is
                                          sufficient room for all the necessary alterations.</p>

                                   <p>I have suggested that part of the copy for Q2 consisted of
                                          leaves D1, E1, and G3 of Q1, corrected by Scribe E in the
                                          light of an authentic manuscript which was part of his
                                          equipment. Here I would mention the Prologue to the play.
                                          The text differs substantially in the two quartos, but
                                          there are similarities in the setting up. Both versions
                                          are set up in italics with a large initial letter in line
                                          1; and both have brackets round line 2. I take it that
                                          this is a case of a page printed in Q2 from an edited copy
                                          of Q1. The Q1 text would have had to be altered
                                          extensively: but there is plenty of room on the page in
                                          Q1, even if the Prologue were to be almost completely
                                          rewritten; and I imagine that that was done.</p>

                                   <p>In dealing with the text up to I iii 100 (the end of Q1 sheet
                                          B) we contended that part of that stretch was in Q2
                                          printed not from Q1, edited or unedited, but from
                                          manuscript copy. It is abundantly clear that at certain
                                          other points, later on, Q2 was again set up from
                                          manuscript copy. There are points where we can say with
                                          confidence that there would not be nearly enough room on
                                          the Q1 pages for the insertion of the necessary
                                          alterations and additions.</p>

                                   <p>It should be noted, however, that it is possible that at a
                                          given point, writing out manuscript copy, Scribe E may
                                          have consulted Q1 and imported into his transcription a Q1
                                          reading. A case in point occurs, I believe, at II i 13.
                                          The two texts of II i 10-14 run as follows: </p>

                                   <p>(In Q1 the passage occurs on sig. C4<hi rend="super"
                                          >v</hi>.)</p>

                                   <p>Here, I think, Q2 was printed from manuscript copy. The <pb
                                                 n="004.016"/> word "prouaunt" is a misreading of
                                          "pronounc (e)" handwritten, and "day" is a misreading of
                                          "doue" handwritten. Now we can easily imagine Scribe E
                                          correcting the printed Q1 in the light of his authentic
                                          manuscript&mdash;misreading the word "doue" in the
                                          manuscript as "day"&mdash;scoring through the perfectly
                                          correct "Doue" in Q1, and substituting "day". But take the
                                          Q2 "prouaunt", a non-existent word. Suppose that Scribe E,
                                          correcting Q1, comes to the word "Pronounce" in it. He
                                          looks at the authentic manuscript. It is badly written,
                                          and it seems to him to read "prouaunt". But that is a
                                          non-existent word. Can we suppose that he drew his pen
                                          through the familiar word "Pronounce" in Q1, and
                                          substituted the nonsense-form "prouaunt"? It is possible,
                                          certainly, but, I think, hardly very likely. It is more
                                          probable, in my opinion, that, thinking at first that the
                                          manuscript read "prouaunt", and not recognising that as an
                                          existent word, he would be guided by Q1 to pause, examine
                                          the manuscript word very carefully, and realise that in
                                          fact it was "pronounce." He would not, then, alter Q1. But
                                          if the Q2 compositor were at this point setting up from
                                          handwritten copy, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> might easily
                                          decide that a badly written "pronounce" was in fact
                                          "prouaunt", and so he would set that up. Elizabethan and
                                          Jacobean compositors sometimes did set up nonsense-words,
                                          owing to misreading of manuscript copy. For instance, in
                                          Q1 <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> (1608), at III iv 119,
                                          the compositor originally set up "nellthu night more"
                                          instead of "mett the night mare". What he set up can have
                                          meant absolutely nothing to him: yet he set it up,
                                          assuming that he was following his copy. So, I imagine, as
                                          regards "prouaunt" in Q2 <hi rend="italic">Romeo</hi>. I
                                          doubt if Scribe E would do this sort of thing. Later on in
                                          this paper it will appear that I think of him as a member
                                          of the company of actors to which Shakespeare belonged.
                                          Doubtless he was an actor. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> would
                                          not cancel "Pronounce" in Q1 and substitute the absurd
                                          "prouaunt". I think that "prouaunt" represents a
                                          misreading by the Q2 compositor of manuscript copy written
                                          out by Scribe E. Scribe E wrote "pronounce" and the Q2
                                          compositor misread it. Yet the Q2 <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >"Abraham: Cupid"</hi> doubtless comes straight
                                          from Q1. <hi rend="italic">"Abraham"</hi> may or may not
                                          be correct; but the curious colon between <hi
                                                 rend="italic">"Abraham"</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >"Cupid"</hi> certainly constitutes a link between
                                          the two quartos which, to anyone accepting the position
                                          taken up in this paper, must in Q2 indicate direct
                                          derivation <pb n="004.017"/> from Q1, presumably by Scribe
                                          E. In this passage, it seems to me, Q2 depends on
                                          manuscript copy written by Scribe E: the latter was
                                          copying an authentic manuscript; but for <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >"Abraham: Cupid"</hi> he was indebted to a
                                          consultation of Q1.</p>

                                   <p>At certain points, then, I think Scribe E furnished the Q2
                                          compositor with copy in the form of leaves of Q1 corrected
                                          by comparison with an authentic manuscript. At certain
                                          other points he furnished him with copy which consisted of
                                          his own transcription of the same authentic
                                                 manuscript.<ref target="f004.01.13" n="13"><hi
                                                  rend="super">13</hi></ref> What was the nature of
                                          this authentic manuscript which underlies Q2?</p>


                                   <p>In all probability it was a manuscript, in Shakespeare's
                                          handwriting, which had not itself been used as a
                                          prompt-book. In Q2 we find that in stage-directions and
                                          speech-headings Lady Capulet is referred to by half a
                                          dozen different titles (in full or abbreviated) &mdash;
                                          Wife, Capulet's Wife, Lady, Old Lady, Lady of the House,
                                          Mother. The late R. B. McKerrow pointed out that this sort
                                          of thing would tend to confuse a prompter, and would not
                                          be likely to appear in an official prompt-book.<ref
                                                 target="f004.01.14" n="14"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >14</hi></ref> In a prompt-book a given character
                                          would tend to be indicated consistently by one
                                          designation. A diversity of titles would, however, be
                                          quite natural in a playwright's own manuscript. At one
                                          point Shakespeare, thinking of the character in her
                                          relationship with the heroine, would call her "Mother"; at
                                          another point, thinking of her in her relationship with
                                          Capulet, he would call her "Wife"; and so on. Uniformity
                                          of designation would probably be substituted for this
                                          diversity in a transcription of the author's manuscript
                                          (with adaptation) which would constitute the prompt-book.
                                          Other suggestions that the manuscript behind Q2 was an
                                          author's manuscript which had not itself been used as a
                                          prompt-book are to be found in the fact that some
                                          necessary indications of entrances and exits are wanting
                                          in Q2, and in the fact that on occasion Q2 is capable of
                                          printing two different versions of the same passage.</p>


                                   <p>To sum up as regards the nature of the copy for Q2: the person
                                          who produced it, Scribe E, furnished the compositor with a
                                                 <pb n="004.018"/> pile of papers, some printed,
                                          some handwritten. The handwritten leaves were probably
                                          transcribed from a Shakespearian autograph manuscript. The
                                          printed leaves were torn from a copy of Q1. Some of them
                                          Scribe E corrected by comparison with the same
                                          Shakespearian autograph manuscript. As regards one
                                          passage, contained in two contiguous leaves of Q1, he left
                                          the Q1 text unaltered, contenting himself with the
                                          cancellation of the material which in the Q1 leaves
                                          preceded and followed the passage he accepted. Thus behind
                                          Q2 there lie three different types of copy&mdash;(i) Q1
                                          unaltered, (ii) Q1 edited by comparison with a
                                          Shakespearian manuscript, and (iii) direct transcription
                                          of that Shakespearian manuscript.</p>

                                   <p>I should greatly like to discuss Q1 at length, but I must be
                                          brief. I have no doubt that Mr. Hoppe is in most respects
                                          correct in his recent book about this text.<ref
                                                 target="f004.01.15" n="15"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >15</hi></ref> His book is a most valuable
                                          contribution. The Q1 text is full of the kinds of error
                                          that we associate with reported texts&mdash;anticipations
                                          and recollections, inversions, vulgarisations, weak
                                          synonym-substitutions, paraphrase, metrical breakdown, and
                                          so on. Mr. Hoppe has marshalled much of this evidence very
                                          impressively. This or that individual example of
                                          corruption, we may say, might in itself be scribal or
                                          compositorial. But there are far too many egregious
                                          memorial corruptions to make it possible to avoid the
                                          formula of memorial reconstruction. The play has no sooner
                                          begun than we have in Q1 a remarkable example of the
                                          absurdity in which memorial corruption can on occasion
                                          result. In the first line of the Prologue, Q2 speaks,
                                          sensibly, of "Two housholds". Q1 has, instead, "Two
                                          houshold Frends", which in the context clearly makes
                                          nonsense. There is little doubt in my mind that behind the
                                          absurd reading of Q1 there lies a reporter's memory of a
                                          much later passage&mdash;III i 161. From the authentic
                                          version of the Prologue the reporter remembered "Two
                                          housholds", and the fact that enmity between them was
                                          involved. His mind sprang forward to III i, where,
                                          describing an affray between the two enemy households,
                                          Benvolio speaks in Q2 of how Romeo called aloud "Hold
                                          friends, friends part". The syllable "hold" constituted a
                                          memorial link which had the effect of bringing the word
                                          "friends" from Act III into the Q1 version of the first
                                          line of the Prologue, <pb n="004.019"/> with nonsensical
                                          results. The Q1 text is not always so bad as this. There
                                          is some good reporting. Indeed Mr. Thomas, noting that
                                          "the first two acts and part of the third are remarkably
                                          well reported", has stated that he is inclined to believe
                                          that "the pirate had access to a manuscript there".<ref
                                                 target="f004.01.16" n="16"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >16</hi></ref> But even where the Q1 text is at its
                                          best, it seems to me that there is rather too much
                                          memorial corruption to allow of the theory of direct
                                          derivation from an authentic manuscript; and I am content
                                          with the theory of remarkably good reporting at some
                                          points, made up for by some exceedingly bad reporting
                                          elsewhere, notably towards the end of the play.</p>



                                   <p>Since in Q1 we are dealing with a memorially transmitted text,
                                          we must be very careful before we say that a given passage
                                          in Q1 represents a Shakespearian first draft, and the
                                          corresponding Q2 passage a Shakespearian revision. We
                                          cannot say this unless at a given point we are confident
                                          that the Q1 version can hardly be a corrupt version,
                                          indebted for its phrasing to the reporter or reporters.
                                          Now I confess that there are just one or two cases (no
                                          more than that) where Q1 contains a word (different from
                                          the Q2 reading) which seems to me rather unlikely as a
                                          reportorial substitution. For instance, at I iv 56 (in the
                                          "Queen Mab" speech) Q1 has "Burgomaster", Q2 "Alderman". I
                                          am not sure that the word "Burgomaster" would be likely to
                                          be substituted by a reporter on his own initiative. It
                                          could have been, I dare say. But some people might suggest
                                          rather that Shakespeare originally wrote "Burgomaster" and
                                          then, in a revision, changed it to "Alderman", that being
                                          a word more familiar to English audiences. Yet, if
                                          Shakespeare <hi rend="italic">did</hi> originally write
                                          "Burgomaster", it may well be that "Alderman" is a change
                                          made, not by him, but by Scribe E (or someone else),
                                          intent on making the text fully clear to English readers.
                                          At no point in the play can I say that it seems to me
                                          necessary to suppose that there was any Shakespearian
                                          revision between the texts represented by Q1 and Q2.</p>

                                   <p>The theory that Q1 represents, accurately or inaccurately, a
                                          Shakespearian first draft has been not infrequently
                                          advanced by critics in the past. There are passages in
                                          which the two quartos diverge completely or almost
                                          completely, and such passages might <pb n="004.020"/> at
                                          first sight tempt one to entertain the revision theory.
                                          But I am greatly attracted by Mr. Hoppe's suggestion<ref
                                                 target="f004.01.17" n="17"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >17</hi></ref> that the passages in Q1 which
                                          diverge widely from the phrasing of Q2 are to be explained
                                          as the work of a reporter who had at one time known the
                                          full version of the play&mdash;who had more recently known
                                          an abridged version, with these passages excised, and who
                                          therefore had a much dimmer memory of them than of the
                                          rest of the play&mdash; and who was in them, therefore,
                                          thrown back on his own phraseological invention more than
                                          elsewhere.</p>


                                   <p>Mr. Hoppe in his book suggests the possibility that Henry
                                          Chettle may be regarded as a "candidate for the office of
                                                 reporter-versifier".<ref target="f004.01.18" n="18"

                                          Mr. Hoppe, Mr. Thomas has also advanced the view that
                                          certain of the passages in Q1 which diverge radically from
                                          Q2 are the work of Chettle.<ref target="f004.01.19" n="19"
                                                  ><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> I cannot discuss
                                          the evidence here. Suffice it to say that I think it very
                                          possible that Chettle may have been involved in, for
                                          example, the Q1 version of II vi. But, if he was, he must
                                          be regarded as just as liable to be called a "reporter" as
                                          the person who produced the non-Shakespearian verse in the
                                          bad quarto of <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>: for, at

                                          followed. As Mr. Hoppe showed so well in 1938,<ref
                                                 target="f004.01.20" n="20"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >20</hi></ref> parts of Q1 II vi are to be
                                          explained as mosaics of recollections of different
                                          passages scattered throughout the authentic text of the
                                          play. Take for example the following lines in the Q1

                                          </q> Here Juliet refers to herself as "Day" and to Romeo
                                          as the "Sunne". I believe that the person who wrote this
                                          passage had at the back of his mind two passages in other
                                          scenes in the Q2 version, and he inverted the Romeo and
                                          Juliet roles in both cases. In Q2, at II ii 3, <pb
                                                 n="004.021"/> Romeo, seeing Juliet at her window,
                                          exclaims "<hi rend="italic">Iuliet</hi> is the Sun". In
                                          the Q1 passage under discussion Juliet refers to Romeo as
                                          her "Sunne". Then secondly, at III ii 17 in Q2, Juliet, in
                                          soliloquy, exclaims "Come night, come <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Romeo</hi>, come thou day in night". Here Juliet
                                          refers to Romeo as "day", and, in the passage in Q1 under
                                          discussion, she refers to herself as "Day". I venture to
                                          suppose that there can be little doubt that in the passage
                                          under discussion in Q1, which here diverges completely
                                          from the corresponding Q2 text, we have to deal with the
                                          work of some person who, knowing the play, brings together
                                          reminiscences of two widely separated passages, and
                                          combines them with his own invention into new composition.
                                          We find this sort of thing in the bad quarto of <hi

                                          also. It is a not unusual kind of reporter-work. Chettle
                                          may have been responsible for it here. If so, as I say,
                                          Chettle is as much a "reporter" as the actor of the parts
                                          of Marcellus and Lucianus in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>

                                   <p>Mr. Thomas thinks that Q1 II vi, after the entry of Juliet, is
                                          from the aesthetic point of view good, and indeed even
                                          better than the Q2 version. Speaking of the final line and

                                          then we have to reckon with a couple of remarkable
                                          coincidences.</p>


                                   <p>A moment or two ago, I spoke of the theory that a
                                          Shakespearian revision lies between the texts represented
                                          by Q1 and Q2, Q1 giving us the text of a Shakespearian
                                          first draft. I do not believe this theory. Now in
                                          connection with the revision theory, I should mention,
                                          briefly, that there is of course a case for regarding not
                                          Q1 <pb n="004.022"/> but Q2 as giving the first version,
                                          and for regarding Q1 as giving a reflection (admittedly
                                          distorted, but at a given point possibly accurate owing to
                                          good reporting) of a Shakespearian revision. Mr. Hoppe
                                          refers to this possibility in the introduction to his
                                          "Crofts Classics" edition of the play.<ref
                                                 target="f004.01.24" n="24"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >24</hi></ref> He thinks of only two lines, present
                                          in Q1 but not in Q2, as possibly "a later insertion by
                                          Shakespeare"&mdash;the lines containing the phrase
                                          "without booke Prologue" (I iv 7-8). But of course,
                                          regarding these lines as genuine (on account of their
                                          literary quality), or as reflections of genuine lines, we
                                          may easily suppose their omission from Q2 to be
                                          accidental. I know of nothing which positively indicates a
                                          revision theory either way.</p>


                                   <p>Having spoken of the nature of the copy for Q2, and of the
                                          nature of the transmission of the Q1 text, let us now
                                          consider the final question of what is to be the procedure
                                          of a modern editor of this play. I am at present engaged
                                          on the production of a modern-spelling edition of the
                                          play. That being so, and my space here being limited, I
                                          shall concentrate on the problems facing a modern-spelling
                                          editor, leaving out of account the special problems
                                          confronting an old-spelling editor.</p>

                                   <p>Let us take first the passage in which Q2 is dependent on Q1
                                          as it stands without interference by Scribe E (I ii 57-I
                                          iii 36). Q2 here ranks as a reprint of Q1. In fact in this
                                          passage Q2 is not substantive at all, but derivative. Not
                                          a single alteration in Q2 in this passage need be referred
                                          to anyone other than the Q2 compositor. Clearly, then,
                                          where Q2 contains a reading different from that of Q1, we
                                          must accept the Q1 reading, unless in a given case we feel
                                          inclined to accept that of Q2 as a desirable conjectural
                                          emendation.</p>

                                   <p>Let us now briefly glance at two modern editions and see what
                                          they do as regards the four verbal variants between Q1 and
                                          Q2 which we enumerated earlier in this paper. The two
                                          modern editions we shall look at are the old Cambridge
                                          edition and Mr. Hoppe's recent "Crofts Classics" edition.
                                          (They are both modernspelling editions.) Both follow Q2 in
                                          adopting the phrases "an hour" (I iii 12) and "with the
                                          dug" (I iii 33) instead of "a hour" and "with dug" (Q1).
                                          They are right to do so. In these two cases <pb
                                                 n="004.023"/> the Q2 compositor has, on his own
                                          responsibility, made necessary corrections in Q1. Next: as
                                          regards the line which in Q1 runs "<hi rend="italic">my
                                                 faire Neece</hi> Rosaline <hi rend="italic">and
                                                 Liuia</hi>," (I ii 68). Q2 lacks the "and". The old
                                          Cambridge edition, wrongly, follows Q2 and omits the
                                          "and". Mr. Hoppe, rightly, follows Q1 and inserts the
                                          "and" (printing the passage, correctly, as verse).
                                          Finally: as regards the variant Q1 "thee" Q2 "you" in I ii
                                          77. Both the old Cambridge edition and Mr. Hoppe follow Q2
                                          and read "you" instead of "thee". Now I regard the Q2
                                          "you" as purely compositorial, and I confess that I can
                                          see nothing in the least objectionable about Q1's "thee".
                                          The Q2 compositor's "you" is not, in my opinion, a
                                          necessary emendation. I should read "thee". Mr. Hoppe
                                          doubtless had a reason or reasons for reading "you", but
                                          any possible reasons that occur to me can, I think, be
                                          successfully refuted. It is a small point, of course; but
                                          it is a matter of principle.</p>
                                   <p>In this passage, then, circumstances have resulted in our
                                          having only one substantive text, and in our having to
                                          include in our editions of <hi rend="italic">Romeo</hi> a
                                          bad quarto passage of not inconsiderable
                                          length&mdash;material which at one stage has been
                                          transmitted purely memorially. Obvious errors we can
                                          emend. Corruption is not, however, always self-evident:
                                          and at a given point in this passage it is possible that
                                          Shakespeare's intentions are irrevocably lost, and that
                                          our texts will remain corrupt to the end of time.</p>

                                   <p>Nowhere else in the play does an editor have to reckon with
                                          the same state of affairs as in this passage. Let us leave
                                          it now, and concentrate on the rest of the play&mdash;the
                                          great bulk of the play.</p>

                                   <p>I have suggested that some other leaves of Q1 were torn out
                                          and, in an edited state, used in the copy for Q2. As
                                          regards these passages we have in Q2 a good text which
                                          stands in the same relationship to an antecedent bad text
                                          as does the folio version of <hi rend="italic">King
                                                 Lear</hi>. The folio text of <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Lear</hi> was printed from a copy of the quarto
                                          which had been corrected by an editor.<ref
                                                 target="f004.01.25" n="25"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >25</hi></ref> Now, as Sir Walter Greg has pointed
                                                 out,<ref target="f004.01.26" n="26"><hi
                                                  rend="super">26</hi></ref> there is in such a case
                                          a greater presumption of genuineness in a good text
                                          reading where it differs from the bad text reading than
                                          where it agrees with it. That is true; but I want to
                                          emphasise that even where the good text reading differs
                                                 <pb n="004.024"/> from that of the bad text, we
                                          must carefully scrutinise the pair of variants and
                                          consider whether the good text reading does in fact seem
                                          to us to be the right one.</p>



                                   <p>I have said that I think that part of the copy for Q2 <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Romeo</hi> was leaf D1 of Q1,
                                          corrected in handwriting. Now at one point in Q1 leaf D1
                                          (on the <hi rend="italic">verso</hi> side) we have the
                                          following passage: <q>
                                                 <l>For thou art as glorious to this night beeing
                                                  ouer my</l>
                                                 <l>As is a winged messenger of heauen (head,</l>
                                                 <l>Vnto the white vpturned woondering eyes,</l>
                                                 <l>Of mortals that fall backe to gaze on him,</l>
                                                 <l>When he bestrides the lasie pacing cloudes,</l>
                                                 <l>And sailes vpon the bosome of the aire. (II ii
                                                  26-32)</l>
                                          </q> The Q2 text agrees with this verbally in the main,
                                          but for the Q1 "lasie pacing cloudes" Q2 has "lazie
                                          puffing Cloudes". Now at first thought one might suggest
                                          the following: the Q2 text was printed from an edited copy
                                          of the Q1 leaf&mdash;the corrector, Scribe E, altered the
                                          Q1 "pacing" to "puffing" because "puffing" was the reading
                                          of his authentic manuscript&mdash;and so we must accept
                                          "puffing" as the genuine reading. But I cannot do this: I
                                          think that Q1's "pacing" is the correct reading.</p>

                                   <p>The image of lazy pacing clouds is a very good image. Now it
                                          may be said that the image of lazy puffing clouds is also
                                          a good image. One can, poetically, imagine a cloud, in a
                                          lazy mood, puffing from one point to another, pausing
                                          there, lazily, and then after a time puffing on to yet
                                          another point, and so on. But I believe that the context
                                          shows that Shakespeare is thinking of a much <hi
                                                 rend="italic">smoother</hi> motion than that would
                                          necessitate. "When he bestrides the
                                          lazy&mdash;something&mdash;clouds And sails upon the bosom
                                          of the air." Sailing upon the bosom of the air suggests a
                                          very smooth motion. There is something awkwardly
                                          incongruous in proceeding from lazy puffing clouds to
                                          smooth sailing on the bosom of the air. I repeat: consider
                                          the passage carefully, and it must surely seem that Q1's
                                          "pacing" (a smooth enough motion) fits in better with the
                                          context than does Q2's "puffing". The Q2 "puffing"
                                          suggests something rather jerky, which jars in a context
                                          otherwise devoted to smoothness.<ref target="f004.01.00" n="*"><seg type="note-symbol"></seg><hi rend="super">*</hi></ref></p>


                                   <pb n="004.025"/>

                                   <p>Now, assuming that Q2's "puffing" is corrupt, I believe it is
                                          possible to show how the corruption arose. I think it is a
                                          memorial corruption. At I iv 96 Mercution talks of dreams
                                          which are begot of nothing but vain fantasy; and this vain
                                          fantasy is <q>
                                                 <l>as thin of substance as the ayre,</l>
                                                 <l>And more inconstant than the wind who wooes,</l>
                                                 <l>Euen now the frozen bosome of the North:</l>
                                                 <l>And being angerd puffes away from thence,</l>
                                                 <l>Turning his side to the dewe dropping South.</l>
                                          </q> That is the Q2 version; but the word "puffes" occurs
                                          in the passage in Q1 also. This word, with its suggestion
                                          of a jerky movement, is entirely appropriate here, for the
                                          wind is angered. We have the notion of a petulant, jerky
                                          movement: it is admirable.</p>

                                   <p>Now we are dealing with a passage in a later scene and a
                                          passage in an earlier scene. In the passage in the later
                                          scene I suspect that the Q2 word "puffing" is wrong. In
                                          the earlier scene the word "puffes" occurs (in both texts,
                                          note) with admirable appropriateness. I think that the
                                          presence of "puffing" in the later scene in Q2 is due to
                                          Scribe E having remembered "puffes" from the earlier
                                          scene. And I can claim that it is very likely that the two
                                          passages, the one in the later scene and the one in the
                                          earlier scene, could have been associated in the mind of a
                                          scribe or editor who knew the play;<ref
                                                 target="f004.01.27" n="27"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >27</hi></ref> for there is a clear phraseological
                                          link between the two passages: in the later passage we
                                          have the phrase "the bosome of the ayre", and in the
                                          earlier passage we have the "ayre", and, two lines later,
                                          the "bosome of the North". This suggests that the Q2
                                          "puffing" is not a straightforward misreading of the word
                                          "passing" in handwriting, as, in his "Crofts Classics"
                                          edition, Mr. Hoppe apparently considers it to be.<ref
                                                 target="f004.01.28" n="28"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >28</hi></ref></p>



                                   <p>The passage involving the "lasie pacing cloudes" occurs in <pb
                                                 n="004.026"/> Q1 on leaf D1. I think that Q2 was
                                          set up from copy which included Q1 leaf D1 corrected by
                                          comparison with an authentic manuscript. But, if I am
                                          right, in our passage Q1 already contained the true
                                          reading. The corrector, Scribe E, must have substituted
                                          "lazie puffing Cloudes", not because his manuscript read
                                          that (for it did not), but because he himself had an
                                          impression that that was the right reading. He was wrong:
                                          his impression was based on faulty memory. But he had that
                                          impression, and it induced him to alter Q1's perfectly
                                          correct reading, and substitute a wrong reading. If his
                                          authentic manuscript was at this point difficult to read
                                          he would have some excuse for relying on his own
                                          (admittedly defective) knowledge of the play. Perhaps it
                                          was.</p>

                                   <p>As regards passages of the play, then, in which Q2 was printed
                                          from edited leaves of Q1, what is a modern-spelling editor
                                          to do? Where Q2 agrees with Q1 he must be watchful. In a
                                          given case Scribe E may have negligently failed to make a
                                          necessary correction. The modern editor must be prepared,
                                          where he considers it necessary, readily to emend a
                                          reading in which the two quartos agree. He will of course
                                          accede to the necessity of doing so where the reading in
                                          question in itself gives evidence in its context of being
                                          corrupt. Where there is no self-evident corruption, the
                                          modern editor will doubtless accept readings in which the
                                          two quartos agree. But corruption is not always
                                          self-evident, and the modern editor will agree that in a
                                          given case in which he accepts a reading exhibited by both
                                          Q1 and Q2 he may in fact be accepting a non-Shakespearian
                                          reading. It is not possible to produce a text which we can
                                          guarantee to be free from corruption.</p>

                                   <p>Now, as regards passages printed in Q2 from edited leaves of
                                          Q1, the modern editor must, where Q2 disagrees with Q1,
                                          assume that the Q2 reading comes from the authentic
                                          manuscript which Scribe E had as part of his equipment,
                                                 <hi rend="italic">unless</hi> in a given case there
                                          seems a strong enough reason for supposing that the Q2
                                          reading is an error introduced by Scribe E or by the
                                          compositor. If a Q2 reading which differs from Q1 <hi
                                                 rend="italic">does</hi> appear to a modern editor,
                                          for good reason, to be corrupt, he must decide whether to
                                          accept the Q1 reading or whether to propose a reading
                                          differing not only from Q2 but also from Q1. There are
                                          various possibilities. Scribe E may have altered a
                                          perfectly correct Q1 reading owing to his <pb n="004.027"
                                          /> having misread the same word in the authentic
                                          manuscript before him. Scribe E may have failed to
                                          decipher the manuscript, and, through faulty memory, on
                                          his own responsibility, he may have altered a perfectly
                                          correct Q1 reading. Scribe E may even on his own
                                          responsibility have sophisticated a reading in which Q1
                                          and his authentic manuscript agreed. Scribe E may have
                                          altered an erroneous Q1 reading by substituting, in the Q1
                                          page, a misreading of a different word in his authentic
                                          manuscript. Scribe E may have replaced an erroneous Q1
                                          reading by a word which he wrote so badly that the Q2
                                          compositor misread it. All these various possibilities add
                                          up to this&mdash;that the modern editor must scrutinise
                                          each variant as a case in itself. He will be prejudiced in
                                          favour of Q2. If no reason for rejecting Q2 appears to
                                          him, he will accept Q2. But he must always be prepared to
                                          accept a Q1 reading, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> good reason
                                          can be shown. A reporter may, by chance, correctly
                                          reproduce a Shakespearian reading which the authentic
                                          transmitters corrupt.</p>

                                   <p>Finally, at certain points Q2 was printed from a transcript of
                                          Shakespeare's manuscript, and is independent of Q1 except
                                          for possible occasional consultation of Q1 by Scribe E or
                                          the Q2 compositor. Apart from such cases of possible
                                          consultation, agreement between the two quartos is now a
                                          presumptive guarantee of authenticity. In a given case of
                                          agreement here, we may say that Scribe E, copying
                                          Shakespeare's manuscript, derived a certain reading from
                                          it. Quite independently, the Q1 reporter, relying only on
                                          his memory, conveyed the same reading. Scribe E and the
                                          reporter thus corroborate each other. And yet really the
                                          position is not so good as that. For there is always that
                                          troublesome factor of possible occasional consultation of
                                          Q1 by Scribe E or the Q2 compositor. Any given agreement
                                          between Q2 and Q1 <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be
                                          explained as a case of such consultation. Thus a modern
                                          editor should still scrutinise every word of the text,
                                          where the two quartos agree, in order to determine whether
                                          emendation is desirable.</p>

                                   <p>Next: where Q2 (set up from manuscript copy) differs from Q1,
                                          we must assume, unless in a given case there is any reason
                                          against doing so, that the Q2 readings are derived from
                                          the Shakespearian manuscript, and are thus genuine. This
                                          is so. Yet we must still reckon with the possibility that
                                          in a given case the Q1 <pb n="004.028"/> reporter's memory
                                          was good, so that he correctly remembered the
                                          Shakespearian reading, whereas Scribe E or the Q2
                                          compositor corrupted it.</p>

                                   <p>Just as on one occasion when he was correcting Q1 Scribe E put
                                          in a reading ("puffing") which was in fact a memorial
                                          corruption, so I believe he did on one occasion when he
                                          was transcribing the Shakespearian manuscript. I think it
                                          would be difficult to suppose that Q1 leaf D3 was
                                          corrected by hand to form copy for Q2. I think that here
                                          Q2 depends on manuscript copy. Now at the end of II ii (on
                                          that leaf) Romeo says, according to Q1, "Now will I to my
                                          Ghostly fathers Cell". In Q2 he says "Hence will I to my
                                          ghostly Friers close cell". I am concerned with the latter
                                          half of the line. The Q2 version seems to me odd. The
                                          words "ghostly Friers" are awkwardly tautologous. Sir
                                          Walter Greg agrees that the Q2 line is corrupt. He says
                                          that its ending "can only have originated, one supposes,
                                          in inability to decipher the playhouse manuscript"<ref
                                                 target="f004.01.29" n="29"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >29</hi></ref> i.e., in our belief, the
                                          Shakespearian autograph manuscript. Whether it was a
                                          matter of Scribe E failing to decipher the authentic
                                          manuscript or not (and it may well have been), I believe
                                          that the words he penned in his transcript owed their
                                          existence in his mind to a memorial anticipation of V iii
                                          254, where the same Friar referred to speaks of having
                                          meant to keep Juliet "closely at my Cell" (Q2 only).<ref

                                   <p>If, in a portion of the play printed in Q2 from manuscript
                                          copy written out by Scribe E, a modern editor can argue
                                          cogently that a given reading in Q1 is good, and that the
                                          corresponding reading in Q2 is corrupt, and if he can
                                          explain how the allegedly corrupt reading in Q2 might have
                                          arisen in the light of his general theory <pb n="004.029"
                                          /> of how the Q2 text was transmitted, then he is, I
                                          think, entitled to adopt the Q1 reading, unless it can be
                                          suggested that a better case can be made out for a third
                                          reading, consisting of an emendation of the Q2 reading to
                                          a reading different from that of Q1.</p>

                                   <p>It seems to me, then, that in editing <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Romeo</hi> one has to have Q1, an edition of
                                          little authority in general, on one's desk all the time,
                                          as well as Q2, an edition of very much greater authority
                                          in general. I do not think that, editing the play in
                                          accordance with the principles I have been discussing, one
                                          will find oneself introducing very many readings from
                                          Q1&mdash;just a handful, I imagine. The Q1 text is in the
                                          main a manifestly inferior text. But I submit that as one
                                          proceeds with the work one must be prepared to consider
                                          the adoption of a Q1 reading in a given case, even though
                                          Q1 is a bad quarto. If one adopts a Q1 reading in
                                          preference to a Q2 reading, one must be prepared to state
                                          strong and cogent reasons for so doing. These reasons may
                                          in a given case be literary. I do not think that a textual
                                          critic can ignore literary considerations. But I
                                          repeat&mdash;the reasons must be strong and cogent. Yet,
                                          if there <hi rend="italic">are</hi> strong and cogent
                                          reasons, the modern editor should not ignore them on
                                          grounds of timidity.</p>

                                          <p>Mr. Fredson Bowers suggests to me that perhaps I have
                                                 not done justice to the claims of Q2's "puffing".
                                                 He thinks that it may be more appropriate in the
                                                 context than I have allowed. The word may be
                                                 intended, as he points out, not so much to refer to
                                                 locomotion as to call up in the hearer's or
                                                 reader's mind "the frequent pictures of clouds in
                                                 the shape of cherubic heads with lips pursed as if
                                                 puffing breezes and winds to earth." It is an
                                                 excellent point. And yet, despite this, I cannot
                                                 resist the feeling that the excellence of Q1's
                                                 "pacing", and the fact that "puffes" occurs in I iv
                                                 in a passage sufficiently like the present one to
                                                 make memorial confusion eminently possible, render
                                                 at least not unreasonable the view which I have
                                                 taken above.</p></note>

                                          <p>The Q2 compositor can hardly be responsible for
                                                 associating two passages so far apart. It must
                                                 surely have been Scribe E. I take it that Scribe E
                                                 must have known the play. I dare say he was a

                                          <p>Since there is a memorial error in a portion of Q2
                                                 which depends on handwritten copy, it would seem
                                                 clear that that handwritten copy was a <hi
                                                  rend="italic">transcription</hi> of the
                                                 Shakespearian manuscript, and not leaves of that
                                                 manuscript itself. See note 13 above. Incidentally,
                                                 I cannot forbear referring to a third case in which
                                                 I think there is memorial corruption in Q2. This is
                                                 a case in which I cannot be sure whether Q2 was set
                                                 up from an edited page of Q1 or from manuscript
                                                 copy. It occurs at III i 118. Tybalt has killed
                                                 Mercutio. Benvolio tells Romeo that Tybalt is
                                                 coming back again. Romeo says, in Q1, "A liue in
                                                 triumph and <hi rend="italic">Mercutio</hi>
                                                 slaine?"&mdash;which makes good sense. In Q2, he
                                                 says, rather strangely, "He gan in triumph and <hi
                                                  rend="italic">Mercutio</hi> slaine,". I presume
                                                 that "gan" is an error for "gon". It is odd that
                                                 Romeo should speak of Tybalt as "gone" when he has
                                                 just been told that Tybalt is coming back. But at
                                                 III i 87-88 Mercutio, dying, says "I am sped, Is he
                                                 gone and hath nothing." (Q2). I think that at the
                                                 later point Scribe E was influenced by a
                                                 recollection of this. The words "Is he gone" are
                                                 entirely appropriate at the earlier point, since
                                                 Tybalt has there just fled.</p></note>

                                          title-page border 160, which has at top a compartment
                                          enclosing the Royal Arms between Fame and Victory;<ref
                                                 target="f004.02.04" n="4"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >4</hi></ref> I shall refer to copies with this
                                          title-page as the "Royal Arms issue." The other is printed
                                          with McKerrow and Ferguson border 177, which has at the
                                          top "IHS" in a circular glory;<ref target="f004.02.05"

                                          this title-page will be called the "IHS issue." Since the
                                          verso of both title-pages is blank and the collation of
                                          most copies is <hi rend="super">i</hi>1 B-Z<hi
                                                 rend="super">4</hi>, with the text beginning on
                                                 B1<hi rend="super">r</hi>, it is not easy to
                                          determine how the two title-pages were printed.</p>



                                   <p>1. The most economical method would have been to set up the
                                          two pages simultaneously and print them together with one
                                          pull of the bar, after which they could be separated and
                                          attached indifferently to the text. It seems unlikely that
                                          Short did this, for the two title-pages were printed on
                                          several different kinds of paper, and among the copies I
                                          have had the opportunity to examine carefully I have found
                                          no one variety of paper used to print both kinds of
                                          title-page. Furthermore, the surviving copies of the book
                                          have the IHS page in the ratio of two to one. Finally,
                                          there are at least two copies which have a blank leaf
                                          conjugate with the title-page&mdash;Professor Hazen
                                          reports this of the IHS copy at Columbia University, and
                                          Mrs. Richmond of the IHS copy in the Chapin.</p>

                                   <p>The problem of the priority of the title-pages is complicated
                                          by the fact that the book did not sell as rapidly as the
                                          author and publisher might have wished, with the result
                                          that in 1599, when Waterson had Short print <hi

                                          unsold copies of <hi rend="italic">The First Fowre

                                                 Danyel . . . , 1599</hi>. In some copies of <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Poeticall Essayes, The First Fowre
                                                 Bookes</hi> retains the Royal Arms title-page;
                                          others, the IHS title page; while yet others have a cancel
                                          title, <hi rend="italic">The Ciuill Wars of England . . .
                                                 , 1599</hi>. The ratio in copies known to me is
                                          seven to sixteen to ten, respectively.</p>

                                   <p>2. If <hi rend="italic">The First Fowre Bookes</hi> did not
                                          sell rapidly, did Waterson attempt to improve sales by
                                          cancelling the original title-page <pb n="004.033"/> page
                                          at some time between 1595 and 1599 and having Short print
                                          a cancel? This seems unlikely, because copies of <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Poeticall Essayes</hi> (1599) are
                                          known in which <hi rend="italic">The First Fowre
                                                 Bookes</hi> has now one and now the other 1595
                                          title-page.<ref target="f004.03.06" n="6"><hi
                                                  rend="super">6</hi></ref> This would indicate that
                                          Waterson's remainder stock in 1599 must have included
                                          copies of the 1595 book in both issues, an unlikely state
                                          of affairs if he had decided to insert a new title-page at
                                          some time after 1595.<ref target="f004.02.07" n="7"><hi
                                                  rend="super">7</hi></ref> At first he issued
                                          copies of <hi rend="italic">Poeticall Essayes</hi> (1599)
                                          with whichever 1595 title-page came to hand, but after a
                                          time he substituted the cancel title-page dated 1599 to
                                          disguise the fact that approximately half of the book
                                          consisted of remainder sheets.</p>



                                   <p>3. A third possibility is that the change from one title-page
                                          to the other was made when the book was being printed in
                                          1595.<ref target="f004.02.08" n="8"><hi rend="super"
                                                  >8</hi></ref> Of the copies I have examined, none
                                          has a blank leaf conjugate with the title, and although
                                          others may exist I have a record of only the Columbia
                                          University copy referred to above, in which an IHS page is
                                          followed by a conjugate blank A2 (the watermark is
                                          tentatively identified as a dog), and the Chapin copy, in
                                          which the IHS title-page&mdash;without watermark&mdash;is
                                          preceded by a conjugate blank leaf. Mr. Sellers assumes
                                          the presence of such a blank but cites no copy containing
                                          it. It is possible, therefore, that most of the blank
                                          leaves were removed and used to print the second
                                          title-page. Or the substitution of one page for the other
                                          may have come as a stop-press correction. I incline to
                                          this last explanation and suggest that the Royal Arms page
                                          was displaced when not more than a third of the edition
                                          had been printed. At this point the IHS page was
                                          substituted, and copies were delivered to Waterson for
                                          sale in the proportion of one with Royal Arms to two with
                                          IHS title-pages.<ref target="f004.02.09" n="9"><hi
                                                  rend="super">9</hi></ref>
                                          <pb n="004.034"/> As has been stated, unsold copies of <hi
                                                 rend="italic">The First Fowre Bookes</hi> were
                                          incorporated into the volume issued as <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Poeticall Essayes</hi> in 1599. It is not my
                                          purpose to prepare an edition of either work, and so I
                                          have not collated the text; but there is no reason to
                                          suspect that it varies except as stop-press corrections
                                          were inserted.<ref target="f004.02.10" n="10"><hi

                                   <p>The second problem is presented by Daniel's Book V. This is
                                          known in two different printings, as Sellers points out,
                                          but he leaves unanswered several pertinent questions: what
                                          is the relation of one edition to the other; when were the
                                          two editions printed; and by whom? It is obvious at a
                                          glance that neither edition was intended to have an
                                          independent existence. There is no title-page in either
                                          edition and no colophon. Each begins with a head-title
                                          which serves to identify it, the spelling in one being
                                          "fift" and in the other "fyft." The collations are
                                          identical, Aa-Ee<hi rend="super">4</hi>; and the foliation
                                          in each is 89-108, consecutive with that of <hi
                                                 rend="italic">The First Fowre Bookes</hi>.</p>

                                   <p>It is clear, I think, that Book V is a later continuation, for
                                          both 1595 title-pages mention only four books, and it is
                                          safe to assume that both editions were in existence in
                                          1599 when <hi rend="italic">Poeticall Essayes</hi> was
                                          published, for the cancel title-page bearing that date
                                          which Waterson prefixed to <hi rend="italic">The First
                                                 Fowre Bookes</hi> reads, <hi rend="italic">The
                                                 Ciuill Wars of England</hi>. Within these limits,
                                          the date of composition&mdash;and first printing&mdash;of
                                          Book V is unknown. Whenever it came from <pb n="004.035"/>
                                          the press, one would expect the author to insist upon a
                                          cancel title-page to advertise his augmentation of the
                                          text, and the publisher to accede in order that a
                                          slow-moving, but now more expensive book might be made
                                          more attractive to customers. Yet not until 1599 was an
                                          inclusive title-page prepared, and it is not present in
                                          all copies of <hi rend="italic">Poeticall Essayes</hi>.
                                          Collation of the two texts will satisfy anyone that one
                                          edition was printed from the other. For example, the
                                          erroneous catchword "Of" on Bb3<hi rend="super">r</hi> is
                                          found in both editions, as is the misspelling "mimens"
                                          (for "immens") in stanza 52 line 5. Two curious spellings,
                                          common to both editions, may also be noted: "We'ill" in
                                          88.9 and "Be'ing" in 105.2 (in 116.3, "fift" book reads
                                          "be'ing" but "fyft" book "being"). The variant in stanza
                                          116, line 3 suggests that the spelling "be'ing" is

                                          edition, which normalizes it to "being" is derivative, <hi

                                          suggestion is supported by the fact that while "fift" has
                                          an erroneous catchword, "Thus" on Dd1<hi rend="super"

                                   <p>There is other than textual evidence, however, and in my
                                          opinion it not only confirms the priority of editions just
                                          suggested but also shows that the editions did not come
                                          from the same printing house and that neither was printed
                                          by Peter Short. In the first place, three different fonts
                                          of type were used in printing (a) <hi rend="italic">The
                                                 First Fowre Bookes</hi>, (b) the "fift" book, and
                                          (c) the "fyft" book. The printer's measure for the books
                                          in the order just listed is 101 mm., 103 mm., and 94 mm.
                                          And an eight-line stanza measures respectively 45 mm., 45
                                          mm., and 48 mm. This evidence is, of course, not
                                          conclusive, but it is significant that throughout Books
                                          I-IV, Short uses a digraph oo,<ref target="f004.02.12"

                                          cherubs playing a lute and a viol was used frequently by

                                          haste in what I take to be the first edition of Book V
                                          puzzles me. It would not be surprising in a small second
                                          edition, run off when it was discovered that the first
                                          edition was nearly sold out. But the ratio of survival of
                                          the two editions, 16 to 6, points clearly to <hi
                                                 rend="italic">The fift Booke</hi> as the earlier
                                          and larger edition.</p>

                                   <p>Next we may consider the identity of the printer of <hi

                                          There is no head ornament to help identify the printer,
                                          but the watermarks resemble closely those in Edward
                                          Guilpin's <hi rend="italic">Skialetheia</hi> which was

                                          have used paper from the Bayonne area about this time, and
                                          so the identification of Roberts on this evidence cannot
                                          be considered final. Waterson employed Roberts to help
                                          print <hi rend="italic">STC</hi> 6254, Daniel's <hi

                                          the same year Roberts printed for him <hi rend="italic"

                                          Relations between the two men were continuous in the
                                          period in question, and, as we shall see, Roberts was
                                          almost certainly the printer of a disjunct leaf of "Faults
                                          Escaped in the printing" which is found in a number of

                                          The paper is unlike that used elsewhere in <hi

                                          title-pages or text, having chain lines very wide
                                          apart&mdash;35 mm. Unfortunately, no copy examined has a
                                          watermark. My conclusion is that James Roberts was the
                                          printer of <hi rend="italic">The fyft Booke</hi> and also
                                          of the leaf of Faults Escaped, and that they were produced
                                          in 1599, when Waterson discovered that he had an
                                          insufficient quantity of <hi rend="italic">The fift

                                          book. The leaf could not have been printed, then, until at
                                          least one edition of Book V was in existence,<ref

                                          both editions of Book V preceded it, for neither edition

                                   <p>So much for certain of the bibliographical puzzles connected
                                          with the variant title-pages of <hi rend="italic">The

                                          they are solved. For as Sir Walter Greg has demonstrated,

                                          based on the author's manuscript; in it will be found the
                                          closest approximation to what he wrote&mdash;his spelling,
                                          his punctuation. The other text is wholly derivative.
                                          Moreover, until we know with the greatest possible
                                          certainty how much time elapsed between the writing of
                                          Books I-IV and Book V of <hi rend="italic">The Civil
                                                 Wars</hi> it is impossible to estimate Daniel's
                                          development as a poet. Is the historical point of view in
                                          Book V the same as in the earlier books? If there was a
                                          long interval before the writing of Book V, were Daniel's
                                          thought or his verse modified by the English historical
                                          plays being acted on the London stage or <pb n="004.039"/>
                                          by the various complaints and heroical epistles being
                                          published by other poets? Until a dependable chronology,
                                          supported by bibliographical evidence, can be formulated,
                                          there is no answering these and cognate questions.</p>


                                   <p>Now let us turn back to <hi rend="italic">The First Fowre
                                                 Bookes</hi> and consider briefly a problem that I
                                          have not attempted to solve, but upon which it is possible
                                          to make a few observations. The text of this book was
                                          printed on various kinds and qualities of paper. One
                                          Folger copy (HH 65/29) is printed on a cheap paper that
                                          has turned quite brown. The watermarks are generally alike
                                          throughout the book, and the chain lines are about 25 mm.
                                          apart. The paper in another Folger copy (HH 65/30) is
                                          markedly superior; one kind of watermark appears in sheets
                                          S and Y and another elsewhere in the book, but neither
                                          resembles those in HH 65/29; and chain lines are about 30
                                          mm. apart. In the other three Folger copies, much the same
                                          kind of paper is used throughout, to judge by the
                                          watermarks and by the chain lines, which are about 27 mm.
                                          apart. But the paper is quite different from that in HH
                                          65/30 and HH 65/29. I suspect that a few copies were
                                          printed on cheap paper, the bulk of the edition on good
                                          paper, and perhaps a small number of copies on fine, large
                                                 paper.<ref target="f004.02.25" n="25"><hi

                                          paper copies first because in HH 65/29, the Folger copy
                                          printed on thick paper, the marginal gloss on Q4<hi
                                                 rend="super">r</hi> is improperly located, as noted
                                          above; but this same copy has the corrected headline on
                                                 Z3<hi rend="super">v</hi>. One should really
                                          collate all copies of the book and after tabulating the
                                          uncorrected and corrected states of the formes should
                                          correlate the data with a complete listing of the
                                          watermarks in every copy. Since I am not engaged in
                                          editing the book, I have not collated all copies; and it
                                          will surely be agreed that I have no right to impose upon
                                          busy curators of rare book collections by asking for a
                                          report on the watermarks. This is a study that should be
                                          undertaken, however, for Daniel's <hi rend="italic">Civil
                                                 Wars</hi> merits reprinting, and we know all too
                                          little about fine-paper editions of Elizabethan books.</p>

                                                 editions of which were printed by 1599, but it
                                                 should be evident that if Waterson needed to arouse
                                                 interest in a slow-selling book, he would mention
                                                 the presence of additional material in any cancel
                                                 title-page he might elect to issue.</p></note>

                                          <p>It may be argued that the scarcity of the Royal Arms
                                                 title-page is to be explained by the fact that the
                                                 IHS issue came first, after which Waterson had the
                                                 Royal Arms title-page printed as a cancel but sold
                                                 relatively few copies. Then in 1599 the stock of
                                                 Royal Arms title-pages was replaced by the 1599
                                                 cancel <hi rend="italic">Ciuill Wars</hi>
                                                 title-page. This seems to me unlikely.</p></note>

                                          <p>It is not surprising, nor need it be significant, that
                                                 so few copies of the book have a blank leaf
                                                 conjugate with the title, for most copies have been
                                                 rebound. The Pforzheimer copy of <hi rend="italic"

                                                 the blank, which might have been considered
                                                 objectionable, coming as it does after several
                                                 pages of preliminaries.</p></note>

                                          <p>Attention is directed to several formes in which
                                                 variants have been noted. In the Manwood-Folger
                                                 copy, inner E reads "The" at I, 91, 5, as
                                                 prescribed in the list of Faults Escaped, while the
                                                 other copies examined read "Tho". Inner F has a
                                                 variant in the signature of F2, which frequently
                                                 appears as E2; the F of F2 in the Heber-Folger copy
                                                 appears to differ from that in the Manwood-Folger
                                                 and Harmsworth 65/29-Folger copies&mdash;perhaps
                                                 the original F was dislodged and replaced
                                                 carelessly by an E, which in turn was corrected to
                                                 F. Inner Q has a variant in the position of the
                                                 marginal gloss on Q4<hi rend="super">r</hi>, which
                                                 in HH 65/29-Folger occurs improperly opposite lines
                                                 1 and 2 of stanza 91, but in other Folger copies is
                                                 placed correctly opposite line 1 of stanza 90. In
                                                 the Folger copies, the headline of V1<hi
                                                  rend="super">v</hi> is "THIRD" instead of
                                                 "FOWRTH"; the same error occurs on X1<hi
                                                  rend="super">v</hi> and X3<hi rend="super">v</hi>;
                                                 the error reappears on Z3<hi rend="super">v</hi> of
                                                 the Manwood-Locker-Harmsworth-Folger, the
                                                 Heber-Harmsworth-Folger, and the
                                                 Huth-Harms-worth-Folger copies but is corrected in
                                                 the Brooke-Harmsworth-Folger and the Folger cs. 82
                                                 copies. This is not the only variation in inner Z;
                                                 there is a slight change in the position of the
                                                 numerals of stanza 104 on Z1<hi rend="super">v</hi>
                                                 and a greater one in the numerals of stanza 119 on
                                                 Z4, the copies agreeing as before. (Prof. Griffith,
                                                 who first noted the last variant, reports that in
                                                 the Texas copy, Wg/D226/595faa, there is no comma
                                                 after "amities" in 121.2 on this page; it is
                                                 present in the other Texas and the Folger
                                                 copies).</p></note>

                                          <p>It is possible that the list of Faults Escaped was in
                                                 existence before the second edition of Book V was
                                                 printed and that it was ignored in the reprint,
                                                 just as the list of Faults Escaped in the 1590

                                                 was ignored by Richard Field (and Edmund Spenser)
                                                 in the second edition of 1596. If so, we should
                                                 have to postulate that the Roberts edition preceded
                                                 the Windet edition, for in spite of the
                                                 dissimilarities in paper it seems likely that the
                                                 errata leaf was printed at the same time as one of
                                                 the editions of Book V and by the same

                                   <p>OF THE MANY PROBLEMS THAT HARASS THE bibliographer of
                                          eighteenth-century literature, perhaps the most vexing are
                                          those involving the proper discrimination and ordering of
                                          multiple editions. In this period undenominated reprints
                                          are to be suspected everywhere, among elaborate editions
                                          running to several volumes, among popular books of any
                                          length, even among casual works of lesser size and
                                          consequence. Though it would be futile to suggest an
                                          occasion for all of this duplication, an explanation for
                                          some may be found in a reported conversation between
                                          Andrew Millar, a prominent bookseller of the day, and
                                          several members of the clergy at St. James. When asked
                                          what he thought of David Hume's essays, Millar replied, as
                                          he later informed the philosopher, "I said I considered
                                                 y<hi rend="super">r</hi> Works as Classicks; that I
                                          never numbered y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Editions as I did
                                          in Books We wished to puff."<ref target="f004.03.01"
                                                 n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> From this we
                                          may presume that, for Millar and others of similar intent,
                                          multiple editions may appear as the result of a deliberate
                                          policy among the booksellers to disguise reprints of
                                          standard works. The greater the importance of a book, they
                                          must have reasoned, the less the necessity for pushing its
                                          sale, and the more the inducement for duplicating the
                                          original issue. A close facsimile would be readily
                                          accepted by those who wished to buy the first,
                                          authoritative printing. A close facsimile was, then, what
                                          they oftentimes attempted to produce.</p>


                                   <p>If Millar's statement can be inferred as expressing a general
                                          policy, then we have not only been forewarned as to what
                                          we may <pb n="004.042"/> expect in Hume's works and
                                          advised as to what actually happened in those of
                                          Fielding's which Millar published, but given some reason
                                          for the presence of two or three concealed editions in
                                          practically every major production in the eighteenth
                                          century, and some anticipation of further discoveries and
                                          other difficulties in this neglected province of
                                          bibliography.<ref target="f004.03.01a" n="1a"><hi
                                                  rend="super">1a</hi></ref></p>


                                   <p>For the presence of other reprints, however, Millar's
                                          observation will not suffice, since it excludes all works
                                          not considered&mdash;in the eighteenth-century
                                          view&mdash;as classics. But where there are two or three
                                          hidden editions of the major works, there seem to be among
                                          certain kinds of minor productions as many as four, five,
                                          or six, all very much alike and often undiscriminated in
                                          bibliographies. The occasion for multiplicity of this
                                          order arises, perhaps, from economic rather than literary
                                          considerations. For obvious reasons, a publisher would be
                                          reluctant to invest in such ephemera as topical poems,
                                          plays, and political tracts, and would accordingly prefer
                                          to underprint, and print again as necessary, than to
                                          overproduce a lot of sheets which would then remain
                                          unsold. Paper, in these days, was an expensive item,
                                          amounting to forty per cent of the cost of production for
                                          small issues, over sixty per cent for larger ones,<ref

                                          casual effusions of uncertain reception. Hence we may see
                                          why Lawton Gilliver printed four limited editions of
                                          Bramston's <hi rend="italic">Art of Politicks</hi> (1729),

                                          a prolific purveyor of literary trifles, found it
                                          necessary to print five editions of Lord Lyttelton's <hi

                                   <p>In addition to the literary and economic reasons, already
                                          presented, another and more significant occasion for
                                          reproduction in the eighteenth century is the removal of
                                          all legal restrictions upon the size and frequency of
                                          issue and the use and reuse of type. With the expiration
                                          of the Licensing Act in 1695 and the gradual abrogation of
                                          the powers exercised by the Stationers' Company, the
                                          esoteric "arte and mysterie" of printing, as it was called
                                          in the earlier period, became in this a common trade,
                                          subject to few prohibitions, and producing on a scale of
                                          greater extent and complexity than anything witnessed
                                          before. Despite the laws of copyright, or perhaps because
                                          of them, the publishers duplicated their own issues, not
                                          infrequently copied those of their competitors, and, with
                                          notable exceptions, resorted to the term "edition" for
                                          successive issues only as an expedient for moving the
                                          book. Thus for one reason or another, or for no reason at
                                          all, reprinting became a custom, evident, as I have
                                          indicated, among first editions of any sort, and, as well,
                                          in several other categories: (1) among subsequent editions
                                          properly described, as in the two fourth editions of
                                          Gray's <hi rend="italic">Elegy</hi> (1751), the two second

                                          undifferentiated in the present accounts, the three third
                                          editions of Pope's <hi rend="italic">Epistle to

                                          <hi rend="italic">Traveller</hi>; and (3) in outright
                                          piracies, as in the three undiscriminated 1797 editions of
                                          Burke's <hi rend="italic">Letter to Portland</hi><ref

                                                 >7</hi></ref> and the four misrepresented 1770

                                          be reported for relatively few books, to be observed in
                                          many, to be suspected in all.</p>




                                   <p>If multiple editions in different settings of type represent a
                                          problem too often ignored in contemporary accounts, even
                                          more of a problem, but one accorded even less recognition,
                                          is that of multiple impressions from the same setting of
                                          type. Where the seventeenth-century compositor, with a
                                          limited amount of type at his disposal, usually had to
                                          break down a setting after every sheet in order to recover
                                          sorts for further use, the eighteenth-century compositor,
                                          with apparently unlimited quantities of type at hand,
                                          could on occasion set as many as 350 pages and allow this
                                          enormous aggregate of metal to remain intact for
                                          innumerable impressions. Some of these are labeled second
                                          and third editions, some are not so dignified. Some appear
                                          with substantial textual alterations, some without the
                                          alteration of a comma. In one printing house no less than
                                          94,900 pieces of type were composed for a certain book and
                                          then retained for a series of impressions, all published
                                          within seventeen days. The paper which went over the
                                          presses in these seventeen days I conservatively estimate
                                          at 137,500 sheets.<ref target="f004.03.08" n="8"><hi

                                   <p>For such extensive reimpression as this there is no precedent
                                          in the sixteenth or seventeenth century, hitherto no
                                          exposition of an expedient means for detecting it in the
                                          eighteenth, and consequently, no reliable method for
                                          interpreting the complexities in printing which have
                                          developed over the years. To illustrate the resulting
                                          confusion, let us consider the voluminous bibliographical
                                          literature on Samuel Johnson, and particularly the
                                          commentary on those of his works published by Thomas
                                          Cadell. Since Cadell was an apprentice to Andrew Millar,
                                          and later his successor, we should expect some
                                          irregularity. And something is amiss, both in the
                                          bibliographies and in the books. Of four works published
                                          between 1770 and 1775 a "second edition," not otherwise
                                          described, is recognized from its designation in the books
                                          I will call A, C, and D, <pb n="004.045"/> and presumed
                                          from the existence of a "third edition" in B. Actually
                                          all, including B, have at least one "second edition," but
                                          of a kind quite different from that which the term
                                          implies. In A and the unknown B it consists of a partial
                                          resetting and a partial reimpression; in C, a complete
                                          reimpression; and in D, no less than three distinct
                                          reimpressions. With the evidence now at our disposal, and
                                          shortly to be divulged, all of this is easily perceived.
                                          Without it, the second edition of B remains "suppressed,"
                                          as we are now informed,<ref target="f004.03.09" n="9"><hi

                                          editions (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, impressions) of D
                                          undiscriminated, and the problems inherent in all of these
                                          entirely undisclosed.</p>


                                   <p>From this example of misinformation we now turn to
                                          bibliographies in which, though more may be expected,
                                          occasionally less is fulfilled. In S. L. Gulick's account
                                          of Chesterfield&mdash;recommended, I might add, by no less
                                          an authority than R. W. Chapman as a model of accuracy

                                                  >10</hi></ref>&mdash;an examination of seven works
                                          discloses all manner of confusion: two impressions
                                          erroneously classified as states, two sets of two
                                          editions, each described as one, and a third set entirely
                                          overlooked. Similarly, in R. H. Griffith's bibliography of
                                          Pope, a survey, again confined to seven works, reveals two
                                          states classified as impressions, three sets of two
                                          editions, each described as one, and one set of three,
                                          likewise represented as a single entity. This production
                                          has also been approved in the reviews, including, for
                                          instance, those by George Sherburn and A. E. Case,<ref
                                                 target="f004.03.11" n="11"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >11</hi></ref> where it is reported in one (and
                                          implied in the other) that the copies at Chicago and Yale
                                          are identical with the ones described, when, as a matter
                                          of fact, they differ from these, from others accessible to
                                          the reviewers, and indeed from others in the same
                                          collection. If this is the situation in the bibliographies
                                          of Johnson, Chesterfield, and Pope, all of which are
                                          considered as definitive, what may we expect to find in
                                          those not so recognized? And what, we may inquire, is the
                                          status of scholarly commentary based on the premises of
                                          these bibliographies? To these questions we may
                                          individually provide the answers which seem
                                          appropriate.</p>



                                   <p>Having the temerity to proceed thus far in what may be taken
                                                 <pb n="004.046"/> as a general indictment, I must
                                          go a step further. No one, least of all the present
                                          writer, should presume to say what has happened without
                                          suggesting the cause and the cure. As any insinuation of
                                          incompetence would, of course, be irrelevant for
                                          bibliographies regarded as authoritative, this may be
                                          discounted and two other reasons advanced. For one, the
                                          standards of examination so readily accepted ten or twenty
                                          years ago, and so often in evidence today, have been
                                          superseded by those which require, among other things,
                                          some facility in the interpretation of various
                                          technicalities, the comparison of such differenti&aelig;
                                          as headlines, the use of control copies or something that
                                          will serve as a control, and&mdash;whatever the
                                          inconvenience to the person concerned&mdash;the inspection
                                          of numerous copies in addition to the several represented
                                          in special collections. For the other, the books to be
                                          examined, in the eighteenth century, are, as I have
                                          intimated, the products of conditions of greater
                                          complexity than those which apply in the earlier periods,
                                          and therefore occasionally require supplemental techniques
                                          for their analysis. It has not been sufficiently realized
                                          that printing, in this century, has progressed beyond the
                                          era of the simple handicraft and now represents one of
                                          mass production, where not a few but hundreds of pages of
                                          type may be retained and repeatedly returned to press,
                                          where not one or two individuals but batteries of pressmen
                                          and compositors may produce, in a matter of hours,
                                          editions running into thousands of copies, where not one
                                          but several books may be put to press and worked
                                          concurrently by the same personnel. These practices,
                                          though extraordinary in the seventeenth century, have
                                          become commonplace in the eighteenth, and now demand a
                                          consideration frequently evaded or ignored in our present
                                          studies.</p>

                                   <p>The only procedure that fully accounts for the altered
                                          circumstances of book-production in this period is one
                                          that utilizes the evidence peculiar to these
                                          circumstances. Evidence of this sort, we may be assured,
                                          is usually not to be found in the <hi rend="italic"

                                          tend to be standardized and uniform, but in the actual <hi

                                          suppositions as to their original use to the printer and
                                          their present use to the bibliographer. Contrary to
                                          McKerrow's prediction that they would prove to be of
                                          little importance, recent investigation has shown that
                                          they may be interpreted as signs of cancellation, variant
                                          states, half- or fullpress operation (indicating the

                                          in succession, or two men working both simultaneously,
                                          impressions interrupted for one reason or another,
                                          reimpressions or resettings of the book, in whole or in

                                          involving an increase in the number of sheets machined for
                                          certain gatherings in order to meet an unanticipated
                                          demand for copies, and underprints consisting of a
                                          decrease in the number of sheets in order to reduce the

                                          are displayed in the figures, these various ramifications
                                          in composition and presswork may not be overlooked by any
                                          editor cognizant of his responsibilities, for here and
                                          there in a process so involved he should expect to find an
                                          unnoticed reading, an altered passage, or an entirely
                                          different edition from that on record.</p>


                                   <p>Since the figures disclose so much of possible textual
                                          significance which might otherwise remain unrevealed, they
                                          are, notwithstanding McKerrow, of some importance, not
                                          only in the discrimination and analysis of concealed or
                                          known editions, but in the bibliographical description of
                                          the books examined. If the figures are included in the
                                          record, any variant unknown to the compiler can be
                                          immediately detected and appropriate measures taken to
                                          establish its relationship to others in the series. If
                                          they are not included, then, of all the variants already
                                          mentioned, the most elaborate description will permit the
                                          identification of only a few of the editions and none of
                                          the impressions.</p>

                                   <p>An interesting example of the relative value of the figures
                                          and of the more conventional means of discrimination is
                                          afforded by <pb n="004.048"/> Burke's <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Reflections on the Revolution in France</hi>
                                          (1790). According to Gathorne-Hardy's account, which is
                                          duly offered on the basis of differentiae in catchwords,
                                          ornaments, the spacing of type, and the length of a rule
                                          preceding the text, the first two editions of this book
                                          consist of sheets in two settings of type separate or
                                          mixed in several combinations.<ref target="f004.03.13"

                                          figures intimate, however, and as an inspection of the
                                          discrepant copies will disclose, the type for this book
                                          exists in one to four settings, each occurring in one to
                                          four impressions, and all combined in a strange and
                                          wonderful manner to produce five distinct variants. Among
                                          these we may identify two editions&mdash;A, comprising a
                                          single impression throughout, and B, comprising four
                                          impressions, of which two (B1-B2) are undesignated and two
                                          (B3-B4) called a "Second Edition." Now, with all of this
                                          decided, unequivocally, the editor can proceed, in the
                                          manner that Sir Walter Greg suggests, to select as his
                                          copytext what is identified as the first edition, and then
                                          to add to this the revisions which Burke introduced in the
                                          edition called the "Third," an edition disregarded in the
                                          previous commentary, and also, in part, a reimpression.
                                          Though this is the required procedure, it has not been
                                          followed for the <hi rend="italic">Reflections</hi> or for
                                          numerous other works of a similar nature simply because
                                          the problems incident to their manufacture have been
                                          ignored or misconstrued.</p>


                                   <p>Even when the variants are known, however, their relationship
                                          may be undetermined, again for want of appropriate
                                          bibliographical techniques. In some cases, as with the <hi

                                          editions and impressions can be ordered on the evidence of
                                          the figures alone, without reference to copy. In others,
                                          the later edition may be identified by the usual criteria,
                                          such as the inclusion of textual matter in the preliminary
                                          gathering of the <hi rend="italic">Deserted Village</hi>

                                          several approaches can be subjected to a mechanical
                                          demonstration, such as the one Fredson Bowers exemplified
                                          for Dryden's <hi rend="italic">Wild Gallant</hi> in his

                                   <p>Nevertheless, with all of these techniques at our command, we

                                          which continue to be bibliographically intransigent. These

                                          conjectures and misconceptions. To produce the results
                                          desired, we should, once again, abandon the conventional
                                          methods of attack, all of which would seem to be of little
                                          avail, and devise for our purpose some unconventional
                                          tool.</p>


                                   <p>The one I would propose concerns the use of a third text of
                                          known date and provenance, deriving independently from and
                                          therefore identifying the first of the several editions
                                          under consideration, yet, paradoxically, extraneous to
                                          these editions, to their printer, and to the author, and
                                          thus, in a strict sense, of no editorial or
                                          bibliographical significance whatever. This anomalous text
                                          is that provided by the literary reviews which, beginning
                                          with those to be found in the early numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman's Magazine,</hi><ref target="f004.03.015a" n="15a"><hi rend="super">15a</hi></ref> usually appear
                                          shortly after the publication of the first edition and
                                          occasionally cite passages of considerable length "for the
                                          interest of their readers," and now, we may say, for our
                                          interest too. When the readings in the abstracts are
                                          collated with those in the indeterminate editions they
                                          will, of course, collate only with those in the text from
                                          which they were copied, and thus establish the <pb
                                                 n="004.050"/> priority of that edition in the
                                          sequence. It is rather surprising that evidence so
                                          abundantly available in the periodicals should be so
                                          rarely employed. In fact, so far as I can recall, only one
                                          scholar, Austin Dobson, has ever resorted to the reviews
                                          for the purpose I recommend, and on that
                                          occasion&mdash;some thirty years before the discovery of
                                          the printer's ledger confirmed his decision&mdash;he was
                                          able to demonstrate by a simple collation that, contrary
                                          to normal expectation, the expurgated version of
                                          Fielding's <hi rend="italic">Voyage to Lisbon</hi> (1755)
                                          was issued prior to the one with the original text.<ref target="f004.03.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref></p>



                                   <p>Of the many books which can be ordered through reference to
                                          the journal readings, several may be mentioned here. The
                                          first, Smollett's <hi rend="italic">Humphry Clinker</hi>
                                          (1771), has long confounded every attempt at analysis. For
                                          the last twenty-five years a succession of bibliographers
                                          have undertaken the disheartening task of collating the
                                          800 pages in this novel, amassed reams of worthless notes,
                                          and eventually confessed their failure to establish the
                                          precedence of the editions.<ref target="f004.03.17" n="17"
                                                  ><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> For this, as for
                                          numerous other works, a mixture of corrupted and corrected
                                          readings precludes a demonstration of priority.</p>


                                   <p>Undoubtedly, any approach to a solution in the case of <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Humphry Clinker</hi> has been
                                          somewhat impeded by an uncertainty as to the number of
                                          existing variants. Once the true editions are disengaged
                                          from sophisticated copies, variant states, and "ghosts,"
                                          all of which have crept into the discussion of this
                                          riddle, it will be noted that there are, essentially, four

                                          original publication, either for A or for B, and September
                                          1, the approximate date that work was completed on the

                                          pages represent 138 readings, all differing from those in
                                          B, and all agreeing with those in A, the conclusion
                                          follows that A is unmistakably the first of the two
                                          editions. With the order of these determined, the

                                          after years of misdirected activity, a little effort, very
                                          little, has here provided a certain decision.</p>



                                   <p>No less certain are the results to be obtained by the use of
                                          figures and reviews, independently or together, in the
                                          reconsideration of problems already known and decided. Two
                                          instances may be cited, one reported within the past
                                          several months, one on record for the last twenty years,
                                          both entertaining versions of the kind, number, and order
                                          of variants, and both entirely contrary to fact. The
                                          first, appearing in the latest catalogue issued by Peter
                                          Murray Hill, is a brief notice of <hi rend="italic">The

                                          about which Millar has given us ample warning. Concerning
                                                 <pb n="004.052"/> this, Hill reports two "issues,"
                                          with the first containing a reading "himself" and the
                                          second containing the reading supposedly corrected to
                                          "myself." Actually these are not "issues," as they are
                                          called, or states, as we might infer from the description,
                                          but separate editions, of which the figures indicate
                                          different settings of type and the reviews a different

                                   <p>For the second instance, Edward Moore's periodical, <hi
                                                 rend="italic">The World</hi> (1753-56), the current
                                          explanation is as simple as the one I have just refuted,
                                          but the circumstances of printing somewhat more complex.
                                          In J. H. Caskey's account we are informed that there were,
                                          apparently, two simultaneous "issues" of every one of the
                                          209 numbers.<ref target="f004.03.21" n="21"><hi

                                          came the issue bearing a vignette, and then, set from
                                          proof-sheets of this, the one containing a headpiece of
                                          printers' ornaments. Though the reasons for this facile
                                          hypothesis are not made explicit, they seem to rest on a
                                          reference to the fact that 2500 copies were required of
                                          some numbers. Perhaps it was thought that Robert Dodsley,
                                          the publisher, needed to have two settings for an
                                          impression running over the limit established by
                                          regulation, or that two were necessary in order to shorten
                                          the time at press. From the point of view of those dealing
                                          with the literature of the sixteenth or seventeenth
                                          centuries, either explanation would appear to be
                                          plausible. From our vantage ground in the eighteenth, both
                                          must be considered irrelevant.</p>


                                   <p>The size of an impression was certainly not determined, at
                                          this time, by directives of the Stationers' Company. That
                                          these had long since become inoperative is attested by the
                                          printers' own accounts: William Woodfall cast off 4500

                                          satisfied, is of a single impression. Nor can it be argued
                                          that there was insufficient time to <pb n="004.053"/>
                                          produce an issue of <hi rend="italic">The World</hi> from
                                          one setting of type. If two presses were used for the full
                                          sheet, one for printing, the other for perfecting, and a
                                          third press for the half-sheet, even as many as 2500
                                          copies could be easily completed within three days, well
                                          within the schedule for a weekly paper. With the liberty
                                          and the time to do what he pleased, the publisher would
                                          hardly put himself to the expense of a second, unnecessary
                                          setting at the time of publication. The only reasonable
                                          explanation therefore seems to be that the variant "issue"
                                          was set at some time after publication to meet an
                                          unexpected demand for certain numbers.</p>


                                   <p>If the variants are, thus, nothing more than occasional
                                          reprints, they should occur irregularly in the sequence of
                                          numbers and not, as the previous hypothesis would require,
                                          in every number. What, then, is the situation, and to what
                                          extent may it be explained by the usual method of
                                          analysis? Examination discloses that, among the copies I
                                          have examined, the variants are not precisely two to a
                                          number, nor can they be considered as "issues," nor were
                                          they printed in the sequence described. From the 19th to
                                          the 209th and last, all numbers bear the vignette. Among
                                          the first eighteen numbers one encounters the usual
                                          disorder in what is assumed to be entirely regular: three
                                          editions of the first and second numbers, two from the
                                          fourth through the eleventh, one from the twelfth to the
                                          seventeenth, and two of the eighteenth. A distinguishing
                                          characteristic of some of these editions is the headpiece,
                                          of which there are, not two, but three variants: <q>
                                                 <l>A Five rows of ornaments</l>
                                                 <l>B Vignette of author at his desk</l>
                                                 <l>C The same vignette, broken diagonally</l>
                                                 <l>across the center of the block</l>
                                          </q> Whenever one copy differs from another in any of
                                          these respects it also differs in setting. And whenever
                                          the settings B and C are found for the same number of the
                                          periodical, we may assume from the evidence of the
                                          fractured block that C was printed at a later date than B.
                                          This date is fixed by the progressive deterioration of the
                                          vignette in the numbers which exist as a single edition.
                                          From the 19th to the 23rd number the block is sound; from
                                          the 24th to the 87th it is broken in one place, as in
                                          variant C; and beginning with some copies of the 88th
                                          number a second break appears. Thus <pb n="004.054"/> the
                                          C edition of the earlier numbers, though dated January,
                                          1753, must have been printed after June 7 of that year,
                                          the date of the 23rd number, and before September 5, 1754,
                                          the date of the 88th.</p>

                                   <p>Whereas B and C have the vignette in common, a collation of
                                          the readings indicates that they are separated by an
                                          intermediate text A without vignette. The precise
                                          relationship of the three editions, wherever they occur in
                                          the periodical, therefore corresponds to one of these
                                          three stemma: <!-- <figure entity="sb04541"/> --> Further than this
                                          we cannot proceed by the critical method, for the
                                          potentialities of that method have now been exhausted. But
                                          if we choose to apply collateral evidence, a second series
                                          of texts is made available, and the analysis can then
                                          continue to a conclusion.</p>

                                          accidental, amounting to a few changes in capitalization.
                                          Among those of the second, however, the variation is

                                          arrangement of the editions in others. Without reference
                                          to the reviews any determination, even for one number, is
                                          impossible.</p>


                                   <p>From the evidence adduced in this and the preceding examples I
                                          would suggest that by one method or another, and sometimes
                                          by these methods alone, we are now in a position to
                                          discover and decide problems presently unknown or
                                          unresolved. To such a declaration it is hardly necessary
                                          to add that these several techniques do not constitute a
                                          panacea for all of the duplications and disorders to be
                                          encountered in eighteenth-century literature. Some books
                                          requiring differentiation are unfigured, figured in
                                          uninformative patterns, or, in rare instances, exactly
                                          reiterated in their figures. Some requiring arrangement
                                          are unreviewed, reviewed by a synopsis not subject to
                                          collation, or cited in portions where there are only a few
                                          or no discrepancies. For these exceptional cases other
                                          procedures must be found, or the project abandoned as
                                          insolvable. For all except these, however, the methodology
                                          now available will facilitate a solution to any problem
                                          concerning the discrimination, description, and
                                          classification of variants. Even in these elementary,
                                          though fundamental preliminaries to editorial endeavor
                                          there is much to do in the eighteenth century, and much of
                                          what has been attempted must be done again.</p>

                                          <p>1a As this goes to press still another reason is
                                                 suggested by the recollection that many of the
                                                 contributors to the 5th and 6th volumes of
                                                 Dodsley's <hi rend="italic">Collection of Poems by
                                                  Several Hands</hi> were much displeased by his
                                                 production, some insisting that their material was
                                                 included without their consent, others that what
                                                 they had entered must be extensively revised in a
                                                 second edition. Faced with these protests and
                                                 demands, Dodsley surreptitiously published another
                                                 uncorrected edition so much like the first as to
                                                 remain undetected then and thereafter. [See my

                                          <p>15a Mr. John Cook Wyllie reminds me that the
                                                 periodicals, especially this one, were also
                                                 frequently reprinted, sometimes as many as
                                                 twenty-five years after the date assigned. Just
                                                 recently I discovered, in what appeared to be a
                                                 first edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                                                  >Magazine,</hi> a reference in the February 1733
                                                 number to a citation in a number issued in the
                                                 following year. When the alteration involves
                                                 nothing more than this, the reprint may still be
                                                 used as an index to the <hi rend="italic"
                                                  >princeps</hi> of a book, since new errors would
                                                 derive independently of the texts. But when the
                                                 reprint substitutes one passage for
                                                 another&mdash;one perhaps in greater esteem than
                                                 the one originally printed&mdash;the replacement
                                                 may originate in a text later than the first
                                                 edition. The periodicals should therefore be used
                                                 with some discretion.</p></note>

                                   <p>MOST EARLY BOOKS ARE PRINTED ON A VARIETY of papers. They
                                          contain a number of different watermarks. Though now and
                                          then a small volume has "one mark throughout," and a tall
                                          folio shows a single stock of fine paper, the majority of
                                          books are not so consistent. Often a well-printed folio,
                                          starting out with a run of grape paper (say), shifts to
                                          crown or fleur-de-lis paper by the time it reaches its
                                          second alphabet. In other folios, no less proud ones, the
                                          preliminaries alone disclose several marks, and the text a
                                          dozen or sixteen more, with alternation of marks through
                                          successive sheets. And, as for quartos, the next play one
                                          leafs through may offer an assortment of seven watermarks
                                          within eleven sheets. Those who have examined the
                                          papermarks in early books know these things are so.<ref

                                          feature of books printed on handmade paper. A volume

                                          fifty different marks.<ref target="f004.04.04" n="4"><hi

                                   <p>There have been explanations. Sometimes (it has been said)
                                          printers bought cheap job lots of paper.<ref
                                                 target="f004.04.05" n="5"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >5</hi></ref> Such an explanation neatly fits the
                                          bibliographically famous Shakespearian quartos of 1619.
                                          Sir Walter Greg showed, in 1908, that these nine quartos
                                          contain at least twenty-seven watermarks, so distributed
                                          as to prove all were printed in one year, though their
                                          imprints read variously "1600," "1608," and "1619."<ref

                                          been proved, and may not be necessary to account for the
                                          multiplicity of marks.</p>





                                   <p>The moderate mixture of papers generally found in books allows
                                          a <hi rend="italic">sui generis</hi> explanation. It lies
                                          in the manner in which paper was manufactured, packed in
                                          quires and reams, gathered by factors into bales,
                                          transported by waggon or boat, and shelved in warehouses.
                                          As a generalized procedure is hard to visualize, let us
                                          think in terms of books printed in England in the
                                          seventeenth century&mdash;though the implications extend
                                          beyond these limits of time and place. For in the
                                          seventeenth century the ordinary papers used in English
                                          books came mainly from just across the Channel, from
                                          Normandy and Brittany.<ref target="f004.04.09" n="9"><hi

                                          we find here a reasonable explanation of the diversity of

                                          seen in a sequence of such marks. Paper watermarked with
                                          the arms of France and Navarre may appear in a series of
                                          sheets, all of one pattern but with the labels of various
                                          papermakers attached.<ref target="f004.04.13" n="13"><hi

                                          according to make and mark. And no doubt the piling into
                                          cargo boats, the unloading at London, the stacking in the
                                          warehouse of the London paper merchant and later on the
                                          shelves of the printer he sold paper to&mdash;all this
                                          handling contributed to the mixture of papers we find in
                                          books. And much might happen in laying out tokens of paper
                                          for the presses. All in all, it is hardly surprising there
                                          were few books consistent in their paper, hardly
                                          surprising that sometimes reams of differently marked
                                          papers were used in the printing of individual
                                                 edition-sheets.<ref target="f004.04.15" n="15"><hi

                                   <p>Yet this is not all. Within the reams themselves the paper was
                                          in a sense consistent. But a subtle variation occurred,
                                          due to the number of moulds, and occasionally the number
                                          of vats, used in its making.</p>

                                   <p>Students of the history of paper know that <hi rend="italic"

                                          Regularly, if not inevitably, two similar moulds were
                                          employed together, in all mills, in the making of all
                                          sizes and qualities of paper. It is so today for homemade

                                          another felt for the following sheet. Meanwhile, the
                                          vatman has taken up a second mould, added the deckle, and
                                          is forming the next sheet as he formed the first. The
                                          process goes on all day, the vatman passing the mould with

                                          returning the companion mould empty to the vatman. A good

                                          efficiently at their equal jobs, and produce up to eight

                                   <p>Documentary and material evidence shows that moulds were made
                                          and used in pairs from at least the early seventeenth
                                          century. Louis Le Clert, citing records of the region of
                                          Troyes in Champagne, tells us that "Dans l'inventaire

                                   <p>The double moulds (<hi rend="italic">Doppelformen</hi>) or
                                          divided moulds mentioned above were a development of the
                                          eighteenth century, in which two moulds usually of small
                                          format (such as foolscap) were placed side by side, so
                                          that a skilled vatman might dip two sheets at a time.
                                          Schulte has discussed their use in Germany,<ref

                                          such a mould exhibit similar watermarks, as Schulte's and
                                          Labarre's illustrations show. But double moulds themselves
                                          were made and used in pairs, as we can see from the
                                          Willcox purchase of 1783.</p>




                                   <p>Although some early accounts of papermaking make no mention of
                                          pairs of moulds, the standard accounts, of course, do.

                                          moulds in use can plainly be seen.<ref

                                   <p>Though historians of paper have thus stressed the fact of
                                          companion moulds, not much attention has been paid to the
                                          companion watermarks produced by such moulds. (Are they
                                          identical? Are they different?) Relatively few collectors
                                          have taken note of them; and bibliographers, at least in
                                          the English-speaking world, have seemed oblivious of them.
                                          A reason perhaps is that McKerrow, in the bibliographer's
                                          bible, makes no mention of pairs of moulds, though he
                                          gives a short description of papermaking.<ref

                                          indistinguishable, what follows has a <hi rend="italic"

                                   <p>Watermarks result from designs made of wire and attached to
                                          the moulds. Le Clert points out that "La confection des

                                          artisans set up as makers of moulds and supplied the needs
                                          of a papermaking region. Less often they were papermakers
                                                 themselves.<ref target="f004.04.35" n="35"><hi

                                          moulds, such as those at the Dard Hunter Paper Museum,
                                          leaves little doubt that European mould-makers came to be
                                          exceedingly clever workmen, seasoning the wood and
                                          securing the laid wires and buttressing the chain wires as
                                          they did.<ref target="f004.04.36" n="36"><hi rend="super"
                                                  >36</hi></ref> They fashioned the watermark
                                          patterns out of brass wire and sewed them to the moulds
                                          with finer wire.<ref target="f004.04.37" n="37"><hi
                                                  rend="super">37</hi></ref> Though the ordinary
                                          wireform was not a work of art, particularly after a
                                          period of use, it was sufficient and not unattractive; and
                                          it was often so neatly duplicated as to deceive students
                                          into supposing that companion marks are the same marks.
                                          Thus cataloguers of incunabula or Renaissance books who
                                          state categorically "This copy has the same watermark
                                          throughout" are usually, if not invariably, wrong.</p>





                                   <p>The maker of moulds can hardly have intended to deceive
                                          anyone. It was enough if a pair of moulds resembled each
                                          other so closely that the vatman would always know them
                                          for mates. What was important was that the <hi
                                                 rend="italic">formier</hi> should cut the mould
                                          frames precisely alike, so that the single deckle would
                                          fit them both neatly. But the twin watermarks might vary
                                          somewhat in height or position or details of design
                                          without affecting the certitude of their belonging
                                          together. Indeed, as we shall see, the mould-maker must
                                          sometimes have intended a distinction, as when he put the
                                          handle of a pot once on the left, once on the right. Some
                                          more patent <pb n="004.065"/> differences may have
                                          resulted from two mould-makers working together, or from a
                                          papermaker improvising a filigree in imitation of one that
                                          was lost. Even when a skilled artisan took special pains
                                          with moulds for fine paper (as sometimes he did), the
                                          complexity of the design, differences in chains and
                                          lettering, and wear of the wireforms in use prevented one
                                          watermark from being or continuing to be a replica of the
                                          other. Standardization was not yet. With good sight,
                                          undiffused light, and a millimeter scale, the
                                          bibliographer today can train himself to distinguish the
                                          watermarks from companion moulds, except where heavy print
                                          or close binding serve to defeat him.</p>

                                   <p>Though some have not pondered his words, Briquet spoke clearly
                                          on these matters, out of years of experience: <q>. . .
                                                 chacun sait que dans l'ancienne mani&egrave;re de

                                          misleading, this is the lesson of the master, and the
                                          reader would do well to examine the indicated pairs of
                                          marks before entering the forest.</p>


                                   <p>It is convenient to refer to Briquet's several categories of
                                          degree as <hi rend="italic">twin</hi> watermarks, a term
                                          suggesting either identical or ordinary pairs of twins.
                                          The term <hi rend="italic">companion</hi> watermarks also
                                          has useful connotations. But for purposes of efficient
                                          analysis and description, I have found it necessary to
                                          observe certain <hi rend="italic">points of
                                                 difference</hi> which recur in twin watermarks.
                                          Among useful points of difference are these: <list>
                                                 <item>1) Difference of mould-end. Often the pairs
                                                  of marks appear in different halves of their
                                                  respective moulds and the sheets of paper made on
                                                  them: variant <hi rend="italic">a</hi> centered in
                                                  the left halfsheet, <pb n="004.066"/>
                                                  <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in the right halfsheet.
                                                  Actually, this is mainly an inference from the
                                                  fact that some marks read <hi rend="italic"
                                                  >in</hi> and some read <hi rend="italic">out</hi>.
                                                  Frequently the inference may be checked by the
                                                  indentations made by the watermark or chain wires.
                                                  Where these are clear, it appears that commonly,
                                                  if not normally, the lettering on the mould itself
                                                  was reversed, as in typography; that is, a
                                                  watermark in a left halfsheet with left-to-right
                                                  lettering usually was impressed by a wireform with
                                                  right-to-left lettering in the right half of the
                                                  mould; for the indented side or "smooth" side is

                                                  mark fits neatly between the chains while its twin
                                                  does not. Or a small mark is centered in one
                                                  instance but touches a chain in the other. Some

                                                  different points. A few are sewn to a chain or
                                                  between chains that do not correspond to those of

                                                 <item>3) Difference of chain-space or
                                                  chain-pattern. When the attendant chains vary as
                                                  much as 2 mm. in their distance from each other,
                                                  this often is the easiest means of telling the
                                                  twins apart. A smaller variation, though usable,
                                                  may prove elusive, because of paper shrinkage or
                                                  vagaries in the parallelism of the line.
                                                  Differences of as much as 4 mm. occur. Actually,
                                                  the chain-structure of two handmade moulds will
                                                  never be precisely alike; thus remote chains are
                                                  sometimes as useful as near ones, if they differ
                                                  markedly in relative position or form.
                                                  Occasionally an end-chain or other margin-chain
                                                  has a wobble or a break that may be seen at a

                                                 <item>4) Difference of slant. At least one of the

                                                 <item>5) Difference of reversed pattern. The

                                                  mirror-image of the other, except for names and
                                                  initials. In the Arms of France and Navarre, for

                                                 <item>6) Difference of label. One mark carries a
                                                  "full name", the other mere initials or a
                                                  name-abbreviation: as DVAVLEGARD and DVG. Or one
                                                  may have initials, the other none. Or a name may

                                                  have different shapes. And occasionally one of the

                                                 <item>7) Difference of countermark. Countermarks
                                                  are of course the smaller marks that appear
                                                  opposite the main marks in the other half of the
                                                  mould or sheet; they are common after 1650 or so.
                                                  When they contain lettering, they vary much as
                                                  labels do. Sometimes one of the countermarks has
                                                  fallen out of its mould. Frequently, though the
                                                  mould-maker has made the main marks "identical,"
                                                  he has taken less trouble with the countermark
                                                  letters and has spaced them differently. And one
                                                  set of countermark letters may be reversed or even
                                                  inverted in respect to the main mark. Those
                                                  countermarks that are letterless differ in detail
                                                  or position as other marks do.</item>

                                                 <item>8) Difference of distinctive detail. One mark
                                                  has an element of design not found in the other. A
                                                  pot may have a fleur-de-lis within its base, its
                                                  companion none. One bunch of grapes may have a
                                                  curved stem, the other a comparatively straight
                                                  one. Such differences may have been original or
                                                  consequent to use. It was easy for separately
                                                  attached bits of the design to break off or drop
                                                  out during the process of papermaking or the

                                                  differences of position may serve to distinguish
                                                  nearly identical marks. When the wire-forms came

                                                  replacement; and the sewings may appear in new
                                                  places. At this same time the watermark itself may
                                                  have been moved, so that it reappears between
                                                  wider chains (say) or even in the other half of

                                                 <item>10) Difference of distortion. Parts of the
                                                  design have been bent out of position. This
                                                  ugliness is less often due to malformation than to
                                                  deterioration. The wireforms commonly went to
                                                  pieces before the moulds to which they were

                                                  unsewn, at one or more points. The result was
                                                  sprung wires, bent wires, shifts in
                                                  position&mdash;and increased differentiation from
                                                  the twin mark. The wires might be further bent in

                                                  The awkward thing is that the shape of a mark may
                                                  change in some difficult-to-describe particular

                                   <p>These ten points of difference, closely observed, serve to
                                          train the bibliographical eye. Those points having to do
                                          with chains are perhaps the most helpful (despite the
                                          vagaries of resewing), and the student soon learns the
                                          advantage of measuring the chainspaces as part of the
                                          routine of examination. Distances of key points from the
                                          attendant chains often repay measurement, though much
                                          measuring wastes time. Slight differences in the overall
                                          size of a watermark prove less useful than differences of
                                          two or five millimeters in a part, for these the eye can
                                          judge. The filigranist will learn not to assume while
                                          looking at one twin what the main point of difference is
                                          likely to be: both twins may be disfigured by a harelip
                                          and yet differ markedly in some unexpected detail. In
                                          note-taking it is important to follow a neat, consistent
                                          practice, to avoid <pb n="004.069"/> ambiguity and
                                          differences that are not differences. Assuming that
                                          papermarks appear "normally" in the left halfsheet, we may
                                          agree to record measurements <hi rend="italic">away</hi>
                                          from the deckle and <hi rend="italic">in</hi> to the
                                          center of the sheet, that is towards the folio fold or the
                                          quarto headlines, or else in the direction of the
                                          lettering or the normal arrangement of a coat of arms,
                                          though then we have to note the direction as <hi
                                                 rend="italic">out</hi>. I have adopted a system of
                                          using square brackets to enclose the breadth of a
                                          significant detail or of a whole design, and vertical
                                          lines (or typewriter colons) at need to show the relevant
                                          position of chains; and I find this system avoids later
                                          misinterpretation of notes. Thus the crescent or fleuron
                                          in the superstructure of a pot may measure :3[13]5: or,
                                          more simply, 3[13]5&mdash;which means that the part is 13
                                          mm. wide, centered between chains 21 mm. apart, 3 mm. from
                                          its outer chain and 5 from its inner chain (unless we are
                                          reading <hi rend="italic">out</hi> with the lettering). It
                                          may be useful to insert the name of the part: 3[Crescent
                                          13]5. Similarly, [4:3] or 4:3 indicates a detail split by
                                          a chain; and [2:20:22:2]-out measures a shield extending
                                          over chain-spaces of 20 and 22 mm., and 2 mm. on either
                                          side of them, reading towards the deckle. When the edges
                                          of the mark coincide with chains, the measures can be set
                                          down as [:20:22:] or o[20:22]o or even [20:22]&mdash;if
                                          the missing detail is understood. [Fl 17:23:] or 5[Fl
                                          17:23]o describes a royal fleur-de-lis 40 mm. across its
                                          petals, cut left of center by one chain, and just touching
                                          its inner chain. Luckily, most papermarks appear upright
                                          on or between chains and so may readily be measured
                                          consistently in one direction, <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >across</hi> the chains, in both folios and

                                   <p>The student may observe examples or possible examples of twin
                                          watermarks in various published collections, though the

                                          their basic nature better than some later men. Though
                                          Samuel Leigh Sotheby may not have <pb n="004.070"/>
                                          inspected papermoulds, his observant eye had noted that
                                          watermarks in incunabula turn up in twos and multiples of
                                          two: <q>The Sieves appear to have been procured either in
                                                 pairs, fours, sixes, eights, or twelves, and about
                                                 the centre of each, prior to its being used, the
                                                 watermark was fastened, by the workman of the
                                                 paper-maker, on the inside of the form, between the
                                                 upright or cross-wires . . .; an operation which,
                                                 it is almost needless to observe, can never be so
                                                 accurately executed as not to present some shades
                                                 of difference every time, even when it has to be
                                                 repeated with the <hi rend="italic">same
                                                  identical</hi> instrument; not to speak of the
                                                 difference that must exist when the duplicates are
                                                 employed. Accordingly, it is only by comparing them
                                                 together, with reference to this disposition of
                                                 their component parts, that their actual
                                                 differences can be satisfactorily determined. Thus,
                                                 when the tracing of one is placed over the
                                                 fac-simile of another of the same device, no
                                                 difference is frequently discernible, except in its
                                                 position with regard to the upright or cross-wires,
                                                 being in some more oblique, or at a greater
                                                 distance, than in others; a difference sufficient,
                                                 however, to show that the sheets of paper were not
                                                 made from the same sieve.<ref target="f004.04.43"

                                          watermarks, and an overstatement of their similarity, this
                                          is all very good; and it is surprising that such remarks,
                                          published in 1858, have so little influenced collectors
                                          and bibliographers. Briquet, Weiss, Schulte, and Dard
                                          Hunter have added something to the subject; but Ataide e
                                          Melo, Churchill, Nicola&iuml;, and Heawood (among
                                          collectors) have shown little awareness of this thing
                                          which is part of the essential nature of watermarks.
                                          Heawood, to be sure, frequently reproduces a number of
                                          marks from one volume, and sometimes adds a variant detail
                                          or countermark "from another sheet," without noting their
                                          implications, yet thus furnishes the clue to companion

                                          notes suggest that in the period before countermarks the
                                          watermark was oftener on the right side of the mould, and
                                          thus in the left halfsheet of the paper, reading in;
                                          except that certain seventeenth-century mould-makers put
                                          one mark of a pair on the left and one on the right. The
                                          point is worth further study. It is not easy to be certain

                                          for some marks no doubt had their lettering left to right

                                   <p>The manuscript, written in various German hands, deals with
                                          property-holdings at a village near Vienna. The first
                                          entries are dated 1556. Sixty-nine leaves of script (some
                                          crossed out) are followed by eighty or so blank leaves,
                                          and a few apparently have been lost. The paper is coarse,
                                          rough, slightly sized, with leaves measuring 7&frac34; x 6
                                          inches (198 x 154 mm.). The watermark, as the illustration
                                          shows, is a small shield of about 18 x 16 mm. centered
                                          between chainlines 26-27 mm. apart. There are two
                                          varieties, and they may be distinguished at a glance.
                                          Variant <hi rend="italic">a</hi> slants to the right, and
                                          variant <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to the left, at angles of
                                          about 80&deg;; and further particularization is
                                          unnecessary. As there are no other marks in the volume, it
                                          is instructive to note how many instances of each variant
                                          there are. Expectations are neatly satisfied: <hi
                                                 rend="italic">a</hi> occurs 17 times and <hi
                                                 rend="italic">b</hi> 16 times. The arms, two
                                          six-pointed stars separated per bend, appear to be those
                                          of Kaufbeuren (see Heawood, 490, 509), a city fifty or so
                                          miles southwest of Munich. Luckily the mark occurs just
                                          above the middle of the sheet (higher in variant <hi
                                                 rend="italic">a</hi>) and is not caught in the
                                          quarto fold. Judging by the position of the end-wires or

                                          centuries, underwent a thousand permutations. Here is a
                                          style not illustrated in Heawood, nor elsewhere,
                                          apparently. Many a Norman pot is topped by a

                                          with alternate trefoils and single balls, has bars across
                                          its bowl and a bell-shaped base; but the name-label below
                                          is certainly rare, though it occurs often enough in grape,
                                          shield, and fleur-de-lis marks. The handle is more
                                          commonly on the left; and it is the handle here that
                                          readily distinguishes the twin variants. In variant <hi
                                                 rend="italic">a</hi> the lower part of the handle
                                          curls neatly 2 mm. within the attendant chain, whereas in
                                                 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> it is broken or sprung and
                                          extends 3 mm. across the line. A short examination reveals
                                          other differences. Though both pots measure 81 x 46 and
                                          are nicely centered on a chain, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>'s
                                          chain-spaces are 20.5:20.5 and <hi rend="italic">b</hi>'s
                                          19.5:19.5. The crescent in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is
                                          relatively open and marred by a loose sewing-wire, and
                                          measures 5:4. That in <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is more
                                          circular and measures 4:5. The foliage on <hi
                                                 rend="italic">a</hi> measures 7[13:14]6 and the
                                          more luxuriant flowering on <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                                          4[15:16]3. Several differences show up in the lettering:
                                                 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> being distinguished by a
                                          label that touches the left chain and is cut by the right
                                          chain along the right of the N. In checking pot watermarks
                                          in quartos, it is important to note points of difference
                                          in both halves of the mark. I am uncertain on which side
                                          the deckle was in this instance. The label P. LEGRAND
                                          gives us the name of a papermaker, presumably Norman, not
                                          mentioned by Heawood or Bourde de la Rogerie.<ref

                                   <p>This pair of foolscap watermarks is such as to delight a small
                                          boy, if not a bibliographer. For watermarks are not
                                          lacking in humor. In variant <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the
                                          Fool has thrust his long nose up to a chainline; in <hi
                                                 rend="italic">b</hi> he has pushed it quite 4 mm.
                                          over. Though this may be difference enough for all parties
                                          concerned, the pair illustrate several other points of
                                          difference. Fool <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (92 x 58) has
                                          the five (Norman) points of his coat well separated,
                                          though the back one is squeezed and others are bent; while
                                          Fool <hi rend="italic">b</hi> (94 x 58) has two of his
                                          points hanging together so that a bell touches the
                                          reversed 4 below. Where Fool <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is a
                                          roundhead, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is a flathead with a
                                          larger cephalic index. The main chain-spaces of <hi
                                                 rend="italic">a</hi> measure 22:25 <hi
                                                 rend="italic">in</hi>, those of <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >b</hi> 24:23.5; and the mid-chain of <hi
                                                 rend="italic">a</hi> splits one of the three balls,
                                          while that of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> merely touches it.
                                          Each of these Fools is accompanied by a countermark, a
                                          label reading MPX, and these labels are also readily
                                          distinguishable. Countermark <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (11
                                          x 33) is cut by a chain 16:17 out, along the back of the
                                          P; and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> (10 x 34) is cut 16:18
                                          between the M and P. In both endpaper sheets the watermark
                                          appears in the left leaf and the countermark in the right,
                                          and the leaves measure 11&frac78; x 8&frac18;" (301 x 208
                                          mm.), with some deckle remaining at the fore-edges.
                                          According to Heawood, the initials MPX stand for M.

                                   <p>The crowned shield with quarterly a fess and three lions is
                                          one of the more intriguing of French marks. Though the
                                          design may have come out of the Rhine country,<ref
                                                 target="f004.04.60" n="60"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >60</hi></ref> the style here is certainly French.
                                          The date 1610 sometimes found in the base of the shield
                                          may denote the first regnal year of Louis XIII. Other
                                          shields of the time have Norman name-abbreviations within
                                          the fess, but the initials FM have not been identified.
                                          The oddest thing about the present pair is&mdash;what the
                                          reader will have seen at once&mdash;the reversed date of
                                          variant <hi rend="italic">b</hi>. Though the initials
                                          appear in a customary position in the first quarter, and
                                          the lions ramp regularly to the left, the year has got in
                                          backwards, except for the numeral 6.<ref

                                          prettiest examples of the mould-maker's art, for they have
                                          suffered some deterioration, but they well illustrate

                                          the conventionalized <hi rend="italic">toison d'or</hi>
                                          below. Such complex designs invite differences. Shield <hi

                                          well centered on a line between spaces 19:20. Shield <hi

                                                 rend="italic">a</hi> has a deeper fess and taller
                                          letters, and has lost the outer wire from its second
                                          quarter. Shield <hi rend="italic">b</hi> has extended
                                          horns, a tailless lion in its second quarter, and a
                                          smaller sheepskin below. And so on. The differences
                                          provide practice in observation. As these endpapers have
                                          been cut down, it is uncertain whether the shields are
                                          from left or right halves of their moulds.<ref

                                   <p>A recent acquisition of the University of Chicago Libraries is
                                          a thin folio volume neatly bound in morocco, stamped with
                                          pots and the initials <pb n="004.075"/> IP, and containing
                                          3 unnumbered and 83 hand-numbered leaves of blank paper.
                                          The pages measure 10&frac34; x 6&frac34;" (272 x 169 mm.)
                                          and are of a good, creamy-white paper. The unnumbered
                                          leaves and leaves 1-44 are watermarked with the handsome
                                          arms of William III, with simple countermark Crown GR; and
                                          leaves 45-83 similarly with the arms of Queen Anne after
                                          the Union with Scotland (1707), with countermark GR in a
                                          wreath and oval. That is, 55% are of the one and 45% of
                                          the other. In each instance the papermaker, whether Dutch

                                          extraordinary attempt to produce identical watermarks; and
                                          a bibliophile examining the volume might never note the
                                          difference.</p>


                                   <p>King William's arms consist of a crowned oval and shield
                                          quartered with the arms of England, Scotland, Ireland,
                                          England, with an inescutcheon of the Lion of Nassau, the
                                          motto "Honi Soit Qui Mal Y Pense" in the surround and
                                          "Semper Eadem" below. The whole measures 5 inches tall, or
                                          126 x 81 mm. Both shields of the pair are carefully
                                          centered on a chain that splits crown and shield; and the
                                          shields fit precisely between attendant chains spaced
                                          24-25 mm. (nearly an inch) apart. Differences are not
                                          readily distinguishable within the shields; but in <hi
                                                 rend="italic">a</hi> there is a space below the
                                          harp, and the Scotch lion is higher within its tressure
                                          flory. The lettering betrays a discongruity. In <hi
                                                 rend="italic">a</hi> the O of HONI is opposite the
                                          S of SEMPER; in <hi rend="italic">b</hi> nearly opposite
                                          the E. In <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the I of SOIT slants.
                                          In <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the Q of QVI is low. In <hi
                                                 rend="italic">a</hi> the R of SEMPER almost touches
                                          the center chain; in <hi rend="italic">b</hi> it lacks 2
                                          mm. or so. This last is perhaps the point most easy to
                                          note in turning the pages; for some variations transpire
                                          only when the photographs are placed side by side. The
                                          countermarks (not illustrated) are even more difficult to
                                          distinguish; but one has a longish foreleg on its R, the
                                          other a slightly curved foot. So much for King
                                          William.</p>

                                   <p>This is the feminine counterpart, on slightly thicker paper.
                                          The designs measure nearly 3&frac34; inches tall, or 94 x
                                          64 mm., on chain-spaces as before. Again the crowns and
                                          shields are carefully centered, with the inner oval this
                                          time fitting within the attendant chains. The quartered
                                          arms consist of the three leopards of England impaled with
                                          the lion of Scotland (with tressure on three sides) in the
                                          first and fourth, the lilies of France in the second, and
                                          the harp of Ireland in the third, with merely the HONI
                                          SOIT motto in the band. Again differences within the
                                          shield are hard to see; but in variant <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >a</hi> the right side of the shield is noticeably
                                          wider, and the harp is <pb n="004.076"/> perhaps larger
                                          and closer to the lower edge. The buckle below shield <hi
                                                 rend="italic">a</hi> is certainly broader. Easy
                                          points of difference reside in the word MAL. Not merely
                                          does the line cut at a different place, but the A is broad
                                          in one and narrow in the other, and in <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >b</hi> the L seems to be broken. The countermarks
                                          (not shown) are similar to that in Heawood 448 and may be
                                          distinguished by a break at the top of one oval. It is
                                          interesting to note that the main marks of William are
                                          distributed 11 and 12, and those of Anne 10 and 10. But
                                          just why the two papers were thus combined in one
                                          writing-book is not very clear.<ref target="f004.04.64"

                                                 >Stonehenge</hi> is a tall, baroque pot, surmounted
                                          by a circular crescent and a large fleuron (or
                                          quatrefoil), with five lobes and sets of trefoils emerging
                                          from an embroidered pot-cover, with a fleur-de-lis on its
                                          throat, a crescent C on its bowl, and another fleuron
                                          within its derby-shaped base. It, of course, is twins. But
                                          that is not all. Each twin lives and grows old. Fig. 7<hi
                                                 rend="italic">a</hi>1 shows one of these glorious
                                          pots (109 x 47) as it emerged proudly from the <hi
                                                 rend="italic">atelier</hi> of the <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >formaire,</hi> perfect in every detail, except for
                                          the leftist position of its base fleuron. Its top crescent
                                          is centered, its handle is a symmetrical S, its bowl and
                                          its base are polished and unscratched. But pots lead a
                                          hard life, whether in the tavern or the papermill, and
                                          pictured next (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>2) is the same pot
                                          after its handle has been banged, its bowl dented, and its
                                          derby base woefully crushed; and then (<hi rend="italic"
                                                 >a</hi>3) this pot in a further state of
                                          degradation. Actually, I have distinguished as many as six
                                          states! Where at first its crescent is placed neatly
                                          between chains reading 4[15]4 <hi rend="italic">in</hi>,
                                          in later states deformed it appears with the crescent sewn
                                          beside a chain, or cut by it, or recentered, sometimes
                                          reading <hi rend="italic">out,</hi> sometimes <hi
                                                 rend="italic">in</hi>. In one the handle is
                                          distorted, but the base looks still good. In others the
                                          base is wrenched first one way, then the other. Strangest
                                          is the state (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>3) in which the top
                                          crescent is once again centered, reading <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >in,</hi> and the crescent C on the bowl has been
                                          resewn so it looks reversed! Still reasonably sound of
                                          body though infirm of limb, this pot might yet live
                                          through further accidents into age and ugliness.</p>

                                   <p>All the while this pot has a twin that also experiences some
                                          of life's hard knocks. Of almost identical size (111 x
                                          47), it is distinguished by a thickish crescent above, a
                                          flattened left petal, a thinner crescent C on an eggshaped
                                          bowl, a higher bar on the A and a fleuron nicely centered
                                          within the base. Its letters consistently read <hi
                                                 rend="italic">out</hi>. The plate shows four
                                          states: <hi rend="italic">b</hi>1 with the handle prettily
                                          curled and tacked to the chain; <hi rend="italic">b</hi>2
                                          in the same position <pb n="004.077"/> but with the points
                                          of the top crescent separated and the lower line of the
                                          handle broken and sprung; <hi rend="italic">b</hi>3 with
                                          the top crescent and fleuron sewn to a chain at their
                                          right and with the handle repaired and sagging; and <hi
                                                 rend="italic">b</hi>4 with the pot bent and impaled
                                          on a line and the handle sagging farther. There is even a
                                          variety, between <hi rend="italic">b</hi>1 and <hi

                                   <p>All this is extraordinary. The volume is a thin folio of 60
                                          leaves (A-P4), with portrait and 5 folding plates (two on
                                          larger paper with shield watermarks). My copy measures
                                          11&frac18; x 7&frac12;'' (282 x 190 mm.); ICU is slightly
                                          cut down and lacks the portrait and some plates. A smaller
                                          Pot C/AB appears sporadically (AHS M3, clear), Pillars CG
                                          (?) turn up once (AHS O3), and in gatherings P and A a
                                          fine Cardinal's Hat IVL, as twins. Yet much of the
                                          life-story of the big C/AB pots is enacted before our
                                          eyes, with late states the commoner for both. In other
                                          folios I have encountered variations in sewing, a second
                                          or even a third state&mdash;but nothing like this. Yet
                                          reasons are not far to seek. The paper is clearly "fine
                                          pot." As paper improved with age, the papermaker may have
                                          stacked his reams for some months before selling; so that
                                          reams made weeks or months apart came into James Flesher's
                                          printing-house together. Flesher printed plates and early
                                          sheets on deformed pots, and later sheets mainly on the
                                          earlier states. Then finally he ran out of pots and began
                                          using hats; or else he wanted his finest paper at
                                          beginning and end. (The illustrated pots are
                                          asterisked.)</p>

                                   <p>The identification of the papermaker CAB is hardly possible
                                          now; but there are clues. His fondness for the crescent
                                          may have something to do with his name. The smaller C/AB
                                          pot in the Stonehenge volume has <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >three</hi> crescents: one aloft, one in the neck,
                                          one in the initial C. Heawood illustrates an undated C/AB
                                          pot with an open, two-lined C (3601); and I have noted a
                                                 <pb n="004.078"/> pair of pots with a like C in
                                          Dudley North's <hi rend="italic">Forest of Varieties</hi>
                                          (R. Cotes, 1645) (CSmH). As for the letters AB, possibly
                                          they stand for ABADIE, a family which within our century
                                          has continued to run a papermill at Theil-sur-Huisne
                                          (Orne), near the eastern confines of Old Normandy.<ref

                                   <p>CARDINAL'S HAT IVL. Jones, <hi rend="italic">Stone-heng</hi>
                                          (1655), as above. Fig. 8.</p>

                                   <p>This watermark well illustrates the normal use of printed
                                          folios in the study of twin watermarks. Though the mark
                                          occurs only in the final and preliminary gatherings (P and
                                          A, in fours) &mdash;thus neatly showing the preliminaries
                                          were printed last&mdash;and the letterpress of the
                                          dedications mars the photographs, the variants can be
                                          compared in detail. The Cardinal's Hat is from
                                          ecclesiastical heraldry, and thus often appears as a crest
                                          above shields in watermarks&mdash;as in Heawood 681-683,
                                          691, 792-800. As a separate watermark the Hat was used for
                                          two decades or so: Heawood lists or illustrates a dozen
                                          varieties from 1649 on;<ref target="f004.04.66" n="66"

                                          Cardinal paper was for a time regarded as a fine pot
                                          paper.</p>




                                   <p>In the illustrations the hats can be distinguished both by
                                          their shapes and by their positions relevant to the
                                          chains. Hat <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (59 x 65), is spread

                                          crown cut by the center chain. Hat <hi rend="italic"

                                          between lines 24 mm. apart. The tassels differ too. The
                                          letters IVL probably stand for I. Vaulegeard,<ref

                                          myself) the watermarks will throw further light on the way
                                          in which <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> went through the
                                          press. After an examination of two copies the answer seems
                                          to be No: this is a book with "one watermark throughout."
                                          It is in fact a model of consistency, and its watermarks
                                          verily deserve Briquet's rank of <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >filigranes identiques</hi>. They are neat small
                                          pots, with bars and the letter P etched upon their bowls.
                                          If there are further letters I have not made them out,
                                          because of tight binding in the Lenox-New York copy and
                                          inlaying in the Kemble-Devonshire-Huntington copy. They
                                          are typical Norman pots of the time, with slender necks,
                                          handles at left, and round bowls. A chainline cuts these
                                          pots from top to toe, and provides a subtle means of
                                          distinguishing the variants, there being scarcely more
                                          than a millimeter's difference in its relative positions.
                                          These are the chain-positions, reading up: <table>

                                          In the light of new experience this remark now suggests

                                          uncertain.</p>




                                   <p>In a similar manner most of the other Shakespearian watermarks
                                          of 1619 turn out to be pairs. Pot R/LM (Greg 2) and Pot BP
                                          (Greg 5) are particularly worthy of study. The RG Shields
                                          (Greg 15 &amp; 16) are themselves twins; but the RG/D
                                          Shield (Greg 18) may be quadruplets. These matters are
                                          somewhat complicated and deserve separate treatment.<ref

                                   <p>The Camden twins are much alike. We find them first neatly

                                          above the front of the R (as in Heawood 576); in <hi
                                                 rend="italic">b</hi> it is spaced between the R and

                                   <p>So far, good. Now we examine further maps&mdash;and make twin
                                          discoveries. Both shields have a second state. Finding <hi

                                          (ICU), we note that this shield, though again centered on
                                          a chain, has different attendant chains and looks as if
                                          shifted 2 mm. to the right. The letters and date still
                                          read <hi rend="italic">in</hi>. Meanwhile <hi
                                                 rend="italic">b</hi> turns up in Buckingham and
                                          Cheshire, no longer centered, but 2 mm. to the left with
                                          respect to the fleur-de-lis bud at top and the vent in the
                                          sheepskin below. And <hi rend="italic">now</hi> this
                                          shield reads <hi rend="italic">in</hi>, like its mate. As
                                          with the C/AB pots there has been a piece of resewing,
                                          though it is hard to say which state came first. Perhaps
                                          the centering was done by the mouldmaker and the resewing
                                          by a workman in the mill. Photographic comparison might
                                          reveal some slight deterioration, but to the roving eye
                                          all the lions look as fresh as a May morning.</p>

                                   <p>Certain other maps in the volume contain three-lion shields
                                          with the initials IG (for I. Ganne?) in the base point,
                                          but these are distorted beyond <pb n="004.082"/> pity and

                                                 >82</hi></ref> is a paltry thing, yet it nicely
                                          illustrates an important point of difference. It
                                          presumably is intended for a small crown with fleur-de-lis
                                          over fifteen grapes in a triangle, being a degenerate form
                                          of Heawood 2343 ff. If the double stems, though, are meant
                                          for a W, it makes no sense in a French mark. Turn the
                                          thing around and it looks like grapes inverted over the
                                          letter M and a pendant. What it is hardly matters, but a
                                          small crown over SM and grapes (ICN 3M4, 2X1) and another
                                          over NG and grapes (ICU 3S1, TxU 3M4) perhaps show its
                                          archetype. The prevailing marks measure about 34 x 18 mm.
                                          Though each varies slightly in position (from resewing),
                                          the pair are distinguishable throughout the volume by the
                                          fact that one bestrides a line and the other wobbles about
                                          in a space. In mark <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the tip of
                                          the grapes is on the line between 20 mm. spaces, and the
                                          lily bud (or pendant) shifts slightly within the line.
                                          Mark <hi rend="italic">b</hi> commonly measures 1.5[17]1.5
                                          across the grapes, but sometimes it measures 3[17]0 in.
                                          The W or M varies in its bends. These vagaries are
                                          instructive to study but tedious to describe. They do
                                          persuade the bibliographer to expect small variations in
                                          watermark position within a long run of one paper.</p>


                                   <p>The other watermarks in this Ovid deserve careful study. In

                                          Shields with Lions turn up in Book X. Usually the plates
                                          contain the ordinary crown/grape watermark (one CSmH, ICN,
                                          TxU), but the Chicago copy offers a procession of lions in

                                                  rend="super">92</hi></ref>&mdash;from the last
                                          decade of pots in English printing. Except for its
                                          engraved title and its map, the book is (according to one
                                          way of looking at it) a gallery of tall and fancy pots, of
                                          which one catches glimpses beside delightful engravings of
                                          Lapps.</p>


                                   <p>There are three pairs of pots and one unmated pot (in the
                                          copies examined). The thing they all have in common is a
                                          handle on the deckle or outer side, though some
                                          inscriptions read in and some out. The commonest is a POT
                                          P/DB, which always reads in. Its variants may be
                                          distinguished by (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) a top crescent
                                          violently wrenched to the right, and (<hi rend="italic"
                                                 >b</hi>) letters slanting down. This last is
                                          Heawood 3637, except that the upper D should be P: the
                                          point can be checked in the companion mark. The letters
                                          suggest the Debon family, with a mill (later) at St.
                                          Bath&eacute;lemy, between Sourdeval and Mortain (Manche).

                                   <p>More attractive are the POTS R/GD, G/PR, and G/CH, all
                                          ornamented with fleurs-de-lis top and base, in a late
                                          Norman style. R/GD and G/PR prettily illustrate the
                                          fashion of making the matching moulds so that one mark is
                                          on the left side, one on the right; one reads in and one
                                          out; one handle on the left side of its pot, one on the
                                          other. I can hardly imagine a <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >formaire</hi> planning all this and then affixing
                                          one of the wireforms to its mould with letters reading the
                                          wrong way&mdash;though that might happen later in the
                                          mill. Pot G/CH occurs once in each copy, reading in (AHS
                                          A2, ICU P2). As, judging by its good looks and supple
                                          curves, it may have been shaped by the same artisan, its
                                          companion when found may be expected to read
                                          out&mdash;towards its handle and the deckle.</p>

                                   <p>Reversal of pot handles occurs as early as 1640. A modest Pot
                                          G/RO (for G. Rouxel?) appears among the mixed watermarks
                                          in plays of Fletcher, Shirley, Habington (a pot folio)
                                          printed by Thomas Cotes in that year. In this case one
                                          mark reads up <hi rend="italic">away</hi> from the handle,
                                          and the other also up <hi rend="italic">towards</hi> the
                                          handle; so that both appear in the <hi rend="italic"

                                   <p>The name-abbreviation R/GD in Scheffer may be attributed to

                                          west of Sourdeval in Normandy, though some of the family
                                          had migrated to Brittany by 1629.<ref target="f004.04.95"

                                          but G/CH suggests the Chastel family, which figures in a
                                          pillar mark, H 3516. The G/CH pot is perhaps H 3685.</p>

                                   <p>This is not the best edition of Jonson: only the one with the

                                          reversal of a coat of arms. The commonest marks in it show
                                          the three fleurs-de-lis of France with the long label of
                                          D. VAVLEGARD (style of H 635-636, 654), a maker of

                                          show the combined escutcheons of France and Navarre in a
                                          conventionalized form&mdash;the first with the three
                                          fleurs-de-lis reduced to two fishlike bearings, the other
                                          with the chains of Navarre in wheel-form. These appear in
                                          the preliminaries and in the fourth alphabet carrying the
                                          label of I. CONARD, whose mill may have been near
                                          Vaulegard's. The striking difference among these marks is
                                          that some have France on the left and Navarre on the right
                                          (ICN &amp; ICU A3) while others have the contrary
                                          arrangement (ICN A6, ICU A3). All the labels read out, but
                                          they differ in size and chain-position. The common pair
                                          measure 8[58]12 and 12[65]1; but mixed with them seems to

                                          seventeenth-century <pb n="004.086"/> books printed in
                                          England on Norman paper. It turns now to a famous book
                                          printed in England on English-made paper: the
                                          Bartholom&aelig;us of 1495 or 1496.</p>

                                   <p>Briquet did not look at it: he lifts his illustration from
                                          Jenkins, and calls it "Fleur &agrave; 8 p&eacute;tales,"
                                          which may be right. Ames and Jenkins offer engine-turned

                                          show between, centered neatly on a chain, the breadth of
                                          the mark is hard to measure, and the attendant chains are
                                          ambiguous. After much peering and turning of leaves, the
                                          bibliographer decides he can distinguish two variants: one
                                          with a bump on (the lower side of) its rim; the other with
                                          circles unevenly spaced. Yet in most of the pages these
                                          points are obscured, uncertain.</p>


                                   <p>All the while he has missed a difference that can be seen at a
                                          glance. <hi rend="italic">Regardez les pontuseaux!</hi> In
                                          one particular the two chain-patterns are remarkably
                                          different. The normal chain-space, as in the unwatermarked
                                          leaves (or halfsheets), is about 35 mm. but the spaces on
                                          which the wheel is centered are 24-27 mm. (about an inch)
                                          each. (No doubt these closer chains gave better support to
                                          the watermark.) Now, the notable difference between the
                                          moulds lies in the chain-space on the deckle side of the
                                          attendant chains. In the sheets with the bumped rim this
                                          outer space is the usual 35-36 mm. wide; but in the sheets
                                          with the spread rim it is only 28-29 mm. wide. Thus,
                                          whereas Wheel <hi rend="italic">a</hi> measures
                                          36:10[17:16]8:35 in, Wheel <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                                          measures 28:8[16:17]8:36 in. These measurements are merely
                                          approximate, of course, for the chains are not strictly
                                          parallel. But the indicated difference of 7-8 mm. is
                                          something anyone can see.</p>

                                   <p>As I examined the handsome Britwell-Newberry copy,<ref
                                                 target="f004.04.100" n="100"><hi rend="super"
                                                  >100</hi></ref> my wonder grew. Here is a folio in
                                          sixes and fours running through nearly three alphabets of
                                          signatures&mdash;478 leaves, as Duff notes<ref

                                                  >101</hi></ref>&mdash;the paper of which was
                                          manufactured on just one pair of moulds and imprinted by
                                          Wynkyn de Worde <pb n="004.087"/> within a year of his <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Vitas Patrum</hi> with its alleged
                                          fifty marks. Than the Bartholom&aelig;us there are few
                                          finer English-printed books, and few thicker folios with
                                          just one paper all the way.</p>



                                   <p>The Newberry Library also has a fragment of the <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Legenda Aurea</hi> of Jacobus de
                                          Varagine, which book Wynkyn de Worde dated 8 January 1497.
                                          It is the only other book known to have been printed on
                                          paper with the wheel (or star or flower) watermark of John
                                          Tate. It is amusing to note that this fragment, consisting
                                          of nine random leaves has five without marks and four with
                                          wheels; and these four are divided two and two between the
                                          two chain variants. There seems to be no deterioration in
                                          the marks. Now looking back at the Bartholom&aelig;us I
                                          count 51 instances of variant <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and
                                          48 of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> (with one remargined and
                                          uncertain) within the first alphabet and the first eleven
                                          books. This is known as normal distribution.</p>

                                   <p>This study has now been carried far enough to place in the
                                          hands of bibliographers who work among books of particular
                                          times and places. Some of its observations may thus grow
                                          into generalizations; while others may suggest useful
                                          analogies.</p>

                                   <p>The student of early printed books may take heart from the
                                          Bartholom&aelig;us: a case of <hi rend="italic">filigranes
                                                 identiques</hi> which proves simple to analyze. He
                                          may wish to begin with that incunabulum incunabulorum the
                                          42-line Bible, whose three watermarks, as can be inferred
                                          from the plates of Sotheby and Dziatzko,<ref
                                                 target="f004.04.102" n="102"><hi rend="super"
                                                  >102</hi></ref> are each from a pair of moulds.
                                          The Bull's Heads differ in the spacing of the eyes, the
                                          Grapes in size and stem (one looped and one cut), and the
                                          Bullocks in the form of eye and tail. Though only three or
                                          four copies seem to have been studied, it is at once
                                          evident that pairs of moulds were in use at the inception
                                          of printing by movable type.</p>


                                   <p>Whether pairs of moulds were used from the beginning of
                                          European papermaking is a question for those who live with
                                          manuscripts. The oriental papermaker has always used a
                                          single unwatermarked mould. Nor does twelfth-century
                                          Spanish paper have watermarks; yet recurrent impressions
                                          of wire defects may show whether two moulds were used
                                          together at X&aacute;tiva. One of the earliest paper books
                                          I have examined, a quarto manuscript of the Four Gospels
                                          in Greek, "The Isaac Gospels," of the first half of the
                                          fourteenth century, and owned by the University of Chicago
                                          [BS 3552 1350], has thick, yellowish paper with two very
                                          crude <pb n="004.088"/> watermarks: a pear or top-like
                                          figure and a circle with a bar extending from it. But
                                          their order in the volume does not make me certain that
                                          they derive from companion moulds. A

                                          represent paper produced at companion vats. Two Morgan
                                          manuscripts of the fifteenth century naturally offer
                                          clearer evidence. Gerbert de Montreuil's <hi rend="italic"

                                          chain-spaces of 40 and 42 mm. More attractive and varied

                                          a pair of Dogs with flowers and looped tails (one with the
                                          flower 9 mm. from the head, the other with a larger flower
                                          just 3 mm. from the head); a pair of Crowned Shields
                                          quartered with the arms of the Dolphin; and others. Such
                                          pairs of marks can usually be studied more readily in
                                          manuscripts than in printed books; and Briquet is an
                                          ever-present help. Thus from manuscripts on paper we may
                                          learn something more concerning its manufacture in late
                                          medieval times.</p>

                                   <p>For the student of sixteenth and eighteenth-century books the
                                          illustrations and analyses in these pages will suggest
                                          parallel lines of study, though the primitive pots of 1525
                                          have little in common with the ornate and spreading eagles
                                          of 1775&mdash;except that the moulds were made in pairs.
                                          Possibly the ten points of difference will dissolve some
                                          mysteries of both centuries, or lead to techniques that
                                          will. Such study should throw further light on the
                                          original positions of wireforms, the nature and speed of
                                          their deterioration, the manner of their resewing, the use
                                          of two or more vats, and all consequent variations in a
                                          stock of paper. In the long run we may know a good deal
                                          about the life-story of watermarks.</p>

                                   <p>It will be asked&mdash;it should and will!&mdash;what use it
                                          is to know that watermarks like wrens go in pairs. This is
                                          no time and place for a chapter on the bibliographical
                                          significance of twin watermarks: that may come hereafter.
                                          Yet it is evident at once that even the <pb n="004.089"/>
                                          negative implications of twin watermarks are important.
                                          Though certain investigations may come to no harm through
                                          treating <hi rend="italic">filigranes identiques</hi> as
                                          the same mark,<ref target="f004.04.103" n="103"><hi

                                          bring perplexity or disaster upon himself by supposing
                                          that <hi rend="italic">filigranes divergentes</hi> imply
                                          different reams or papermakers. He must take into
                                          consideration even the possibility that twin watermarks
                                          may differ in the names on their labels, bearing the names
                                          of partners or of a husband and wife, or of a papermaker
                                          and his factor.<ref target="f004.04.104" n="104"><hi
                                                  rend="super">104</hi></ref> Certainly in the long
                                          run it simplifies matters to pair off the papermarks that
                                          belong together and that denote one consistent stock of
                                          paper. The basic equation is: Two watermarks equal one
                                          paper. It brings assurance and control into any study of
                                          mixed watermarks which seeks to answer questions of
                                          edition size, methods of press work, and time of printing.
                                          My purpose has been to rid watermarks of one besetting
                                          ambiguity.</p>



                                   <p>On the positive side several uses or advantages have been
                                          mentioned in these pages, and others can be found. It is
                                          worth knowing that the Bartholom&aelig;us and the Pide
                                          Bull <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> were machined
                                          (apparently) in continuous printing
                                          operations&mdash;though each has two watermarks. The
                                          historian of paper will relish the inference that John
                                          Tate's vatman and coucher applied themselves diligently at
                                          a single vat for six weeks or so to provide sufficient
                                          paper for a volume of nearly 500 leaves in an edition of
                                          perhaps 500 copies. But admittedly the homogeneity of the
                                          watermarks throws no light on the size of that edition,
                                          except to suggest it was not large. The Shakespearian
                                          quartos of 1619 have been touched on sufficiently to
                                          suggest that a realization of the binary nature of their
                                          watermarks in 1908 would have improved Greg's
                                          demonstration that plays dated 1600 and 1619 were printed
                                          in the same year. For no one would have argued that a <hi
                                                 rend="italic">pair</hi> of moulds might remain the
                                          same (without distortion or resewing) over a score of
                                          years, or that a mould-maker might have imitated the

                                          imply the importance of checking the lettering on the
                                          companion marks if we wish to learn the exact sources of
                                          paper. And from the investigation of geminate
                                          case-histories begin to emerge facts which should prove
                                          helpful in the analysis of books. In which halfsheet does
                                          the watermark appear? Evidently the mould-artisan
                                          sometimes affixed the wire-designs to the contrary halves
                                          of a pair of <hi rend="italic">formes;</hi> and on
                                          occasion someone at the mill inverted one or resewed them
                                          both to the same end. Was paper piled consistently in
                                          quires and reams? Resolution of a run of paper into its
                                          component variants&mdash;noting the reversal of
                                          pot-handles and of the bearings on escutcheons, the
                                          differences of In and Out&mdash;reveals not infrequently a
                                          marked consistency in the arrangement of sheets.</p>


                                   <p>Such facts, such realizations serve also to sharpen
                                          conventional uses of watermarks. If papermarks can be used
                                          in dating (and their possibilities have been
                                          overestimated), it may be important to watch for the
                                          reappearance not of a watermark but of a pair of
                                          watermarks. In cases of cancels or standing type, if the
                                          authenticity of a leaf or sheet has been questioned
                                          because of a mark "different" from marks in contiguous
                                          sheets or other copies, the questioned mark may prove to
                                          be the unappreciated mate of one of these. In the analysis
                                          of quartos, where questions of conjunction arise, it is
                                          hardly sufficient to point out that two related leaves
                                          "show a watermark": they must show corresponding halves of
                                          the same member of a pair. One suspects that T. J. Wise
                                          and other purveyors of madeup play-quartos, while
                                          complacently matching pot tops with pot bottoms, have
                                          seldom distinguished between the marks that result from a
                                          pair of moulds.<ref target="f004.04.106" n="106"><hi

                                   <p>Recognition of the true state of its watermarks brings the
                                          dignity of individuality to each book printed on handmade
                                          paper. <pb n="004.091"/> Forty years ago Falconer Madan
                                          uttered his belief and warning: <hi rend="italic">"There
                                                 is no such thing as a duplicate</hi>." (Librarians
                                          have scarcely heeded him.) We see new truth in his words.
                                          In terms of mixed watermarks, twin watermarks, press
                                          variants, cancels, and the gathering of sheets, every copy
                                          of every book (above the rank of mere pamphlet) may be
                                          expected to differ from all others. Even a thin
                                          play-quarto "with one watermark throughout" yields
                                          startling arithmetical combinations. The variant-patterns
                                          soar into the millions and beyond. <hi rend="italic">Every

                                          <p>Various writers have noted the mixture of watermarks in
                                                 books. Dard Hunter says: "In examining old books a
                                                 great profusion of watermarks may be noted in the

                                                 watermark runs through the whole volume, and in
                                                 many cases the variety is astonishing. Thus, in a

                                                 hypothesis: "The middleman bought large stocks of
                                                 paper from the manufacturer and sold comparatively
                                                 small parcels of various sizes to printers. The
                                                 inevitable result was that he was left with a
                                                 number of oddments, remainders of various sizes, on
                                                 his hands. These he simply stacked together and
                                                 sold off cheap." [W. W. Greg, "On Certain False

                                                 McKerrow concluded: ". . . it seems quite clear
                                                 that many printers bought their paper in job-lots,
                                                 and it is common to find a number of different
                                                 watermarks in a book about the printing of which
                                                 there appears to have been nothing abnormal."

                                                 remarked: "It seems . . . as if the dealer was
                                                 willing to sell off odd quires cheaply, and it may
                                                 be for this reason that so many sixteenth-century
                                                 books contain a number of different watermarks."

                                          <p>Sir Walter Greg examined an early nineteenth-century

                                                 within an edition of perhaps 1000 copies. But
                                                 consider the watermarks. One paper with twin
                                                 watermarks in 9 1/2 sheets means 2<hi rend="super"

                                                 allow a different watermark sequence for each copy.
                                                 And now it may be pointed out that a pot can have
                                                 its top or base in any one of the four leaves of a

                                                 many? What chance? If such is the case with
                                                 single-paper books, then what of books printed on a
                                                 variety of papers, books with mixed watermarks!
                                                 Clearly the possible combinations are astronomical,
                                                 even if we assume only one or two pairs of marks

                                   <p>THE FOURTH FOLIO OF SHAKESPEARE (1685) was printed in three
                                          sections by three different printers, the first of whom
                                          Professor Bowers has recently shown to have been Robert
                                          Roberts.<ref target="f004.05.01" n="1"><hi rend="super"

                                                 >2</hi>. Roberts' section, which, as Bowers
                                          demonstrates, includes the preliminary sheets, contains
                                          the Comedies and ends with Z4; the second section contains
                                          the Histories and <hi rend="italic">Troilus, Coriolanus,
                                                 Titus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Romeo</hi> and
                                          ends with *3E8; the third contains the rest of the
                                          Tragedies and the apocryphal plays. In the second section
                                          errors in signatures are uncommonly numerous, and some of
                                          these are not without interest. The most serious of the
                                          errors consist of the misprinting of sigs. 2B1 through 2C3
                                          as B, B2, B3; C, C2, C3. 2D3 is printed D3. 2E3 is not
                                          printed. 2O1 is printed Pp. *3E1 and *3E2 are printed
                                          without the asterisks; but *Eee3 and *Eee4 are correctly
                                          so printed. Being important in the gathering and folding
                                          of sheets, signatures are in most books printed much more
                                          carefully than pagination; we do not often meet with such
                                          gross carelessness as these sheets exhibit. Nor was it
                                          here allowed to pass unnoticed. On the contrary, once
                                          these errors were discovered the printer took drastic
                                          steps to correct at least those most likely to make
                                          trouble. The discovery appears to have occurred while 2O1
                                          was in the press and near the <pb n="004.094"/> end of its
                                          run, for in only about fifteen per cent of the
                                          thirty-seven copies which I have examined at the Folger
                                          has a press correction been made. In all the rest of the
                                          thirty-seven the misprinted signature has been corrected
                                          with a pen. No other press corrections were, so far as I
                                          have found, made, but in every copy 2B1 and 2C1 have been
                                          amended by pen, likewise 2C3 (but not 2B3 or 2D3). In many
                                          copies 2C2 has been amended by pen, and in most 2E3,
                                          omitted in the printing, has been written in. A typical
                                          specimen copy may be seen in the Methuen facsimile, where
                                          all the corrections noted above except 2C2 will be found.
                                          The hand&mdash;most readily recognizable in the added
                                          2E3&mdash;is the same in all copies which I have seen. The
                                          press correction of one, and only one, of these
                                          errors&mdash;and that the last significant one
                                          made&mdash;together with the pen correction of the
                                          misprinted copies of this sheet, strongly suggests that
                                          the earlier errors were not discovered until this point
                                          was reached and that all the other pen corrections were
                                          ordered forthwith and effected in this unknown printer's
                                          shop. Sections 1 and 3 contain no significant errors in
                                          signing.</p>


                                   <p>The pagination of the volume is A1-H6, 1-96; I1-O1, 99-160;
                                          O2-X5, 163-254; X6-Z3, 253('243')-272; 2B1-*3E8, 1-328,
                                          3A1-4C2, 1-302. In addition to the errors indicated in
                                          this formula which affect the total count of Section 1,
                                          the following simple errors occur in all copies (ten in
                                          number) in which I have examined the pagination: 109 is
                                          printed for 107, 111 for 109, 186 for 190, 187 for 191,
                                          221 for 219, 234 for 246, 243 for 253 bis. In nine of the
                                          ten copies 33 is misprinted 23, and in three 164 is
                                          misprinted 160, and 169-171. This carelessness in the
                                          printing of page numbers is not uncommon either in kind
                                          or, I believe, in degree. Far more unusual is the
                                          excellent pagination in Section 2, where I have found no
                                          errors of any kind. Section 3 falls but little short of
                                          this ideal, having, so far as I have found, only one
                                          simple misprint: 176 for 167. All the errors in Section 1
                                          noted above (as well as that in Section 3) may be seen in
                                          the Methuen facsimile, with the exception of pp. 164 and
                                          169.</p>

                                   <p>Discovery of the reprinted sheets (which for the sake of
                                          brevity I will hereafter call F5, since they constitute a

                                          even longer were it not for an obvious clue. For some
                                          obscure reason the side rules and the foot rules were in
                                          the printing of the F5 sheets omitted.<ref

                                                 >4</hi></ref> Each <pb n="004.096"/> normal page is
                                          boxed with rules, side, head, and foot, with an additional
                                          horizontal rule beneath the headline and a vertical rule
                                          between the two columns of text. The reprinted leaves
                                          uniformly lack the side rules and the horizontal foot
                                          rule,<ref target="f004.05.05" n="5"><hi rend="super"
                                                  >5</hi></ref> though all others are as in the
                                          original F4 printing.</p>



                                   <p>The absence of the rules is the conspicuous difference between
                                          the two states of the sheets&mdash;the flag which gives
                                          notice of their presence. A further comparison shows that
                                          one state is a reprint of the other. Except for the rules
                                          they do not differ notably in general appearance, but upon
                                          close inspection innumerable small differences become
                                          apparent throughout. Collation reveals just such variants
                                          as we might except.<ref target="f004.05.06" n="6"><hi

                                          to which kind of sheets are the reprinted ones&mdash;the
                                          rules tell us that much. Collation of the original F4
                                          sheets with the corresponding sheets of F3 (1663-4) and F5
                                          give the expected results: F4 was printed from F3, F5 from
                                          F4. In F5 obvious F4 misprints are in the main corrected.
                                          Its text shows a marked tendency towards modernization of
                                          spelling and towards a regular use of the apostrophe in
                                          possessives. New misprints are about as numerous as
                                          corrections. None of the alterations point to the hand of
                                          anyone but the compositor.</p>


                                   <p>The explanation for the reprinting is not far to seek. The
                                          distribution of F5 sheets in the six copies
                                          affected&mdash;with fifteen in Folger 28 and only one in
                                          NYPL Lenox&mdash;suggests that the printer of this middle
                                          section of F4 either carelessly or fraudulently
                                          under-printed these sheets. When the gathering of all
                                          sheets into volumes was nearly finished and the stacks
                                          were all getting low, a few stacks were exhausted or it
                                          was seen that they soon would be, leaving a stock of
                                          something more than two hundred different good
                                          sheets&mdash;how many of each I will explore presently. At
                                          what time in relation to the original printing the
                                          discovery of the shortages and the subsequent reprinting
                                          are likely to have taken place can be determined <pb
                                                 n="004.097"/> only conjecturally. Several avenues
                                          of approach to this problem must be investigated.</p>

                                   <p>First, what significance can be attached to the omission of
                                          side and foot rules? The complete boxing in of type pages
                                          with rules was first commonly practised toward the end of
                                          the sixteenth century and became increasingly popular in
                                          the early decades of the seventeenth, until, by 1630, it
                                          was almost universal&mdash;though never quite so&mdash;in
                                          books printed in England. Soon after 1640 we begin to find
                                          unruled pages with increasing frequency. Charles Edmonds'
                                                 <hi rend="italic">Commentaries of Julius
                                                 C&oelig;sar</hi>, 1655, though a folio with double
                                          columns is entirely without rules. Burton's <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Anatomy</hi>, 1676, a folio printed
                                          in double columns, is ruled exactly as are the pages of
                                          F5&mdash;horizontal above and beneath the headlines,
                                          vertical between columns. <hi rend="italic">The Works of
                                                 the Learned Sir Thomas Brown, Kt.,</hi> 1686, a
                                          folio in single columns, is printed with double head-rules
                                          only, except in the index, the pages of which are ruled
                                          exactly as those of F5 are. In fact I have found folios so
                                          ruled in every decade from 1600 to 1720. Clearly then the
                                          rules of the F5 pages cannot be regarded as direct
                                          evidence as to the date of printing. It does seem safe to
                                          say, however, that they do indicate <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >either</hi> a date substantially later than the
                                          original printing in 1685 <hi rend="italic">or</hi> a
                                          different printing house. For if Herringman had discovered
                                          the short count of seventeen or more sheets soon after
                                          their delivery to him he would presumably have demanded
                                          that the printer of the central section make the
                                          deficiency good, and it is scarcely conceivable that the
                                          same printer would then have produced reprints so
                                          strikingly different from the originals in appearance as
                                          these are. We may well ask why any printer at any probable
                                          time would have done so, and this is a question to which I
                                          can furnish no very satisfactory answer. That the printer
                                          did not have enough rules is out of the question. It must
                                          have been simply a mistake of some sort. Perhaps the
                                          workman actually responsible for the make-up of the
                                          formes, not fully aware of the nature of the job in hand,
                                          only followed the custom of the house for folio printing
                                          in two columns prevailing at that period. Had the printing
                                          been done in the shop that had produced the original F4
                                          sheets, and with no considerable lapse of time, such an
                                          error would not be likely.</p>

                                   <p>Evidence derived from watermarks leads to much the same <pb
                                                 n="004.098"/> conclusion. Virtually all of the
                                          normal sheets of the volume&mdash;not only in the middle
                                          section but in all three&mdash;show some variety of a
                                          group of watermarks bearing the name DVAVLEGARD beneath a
                                          large shield surrounded by a sort of ruffled or fluted
                                          collar. I have found here only one completely different
                                          and unrelated mark&mdash;a small, plain, crowned shield
                                          bearing a simple fleur-de-lis and the initials RO, beneath
                                          which is the name N. Porte or O. N. Porte.<ref
                                                 target="f004.05.07" n="7"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >7</hi></ref> No watermark which I have seen in F4
                                          occurs in any F5 sheet. There, instead, are five different
                                          marks&mdash;three forming a related family, the other two
                                          another family.<ref target="f004.05.08" n="8"><hi
                                                  rend="super">8</hi></ref> Since I have not
                                          succeeded in finding any of these elsewhere they yield no
                                          direct evidence as to the date at which the F5 sheets were
                                          printed. But they again argue <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >either</hi> for a date later than 1685 <hi
                                                 rend="italic">or</hi> for another printer.</p>



                                   <p>Finally there is the evidence of spelling and the regular use
                                          of the apostrophe in possessives. The spelling shows a
                                          good deal of what might be called modernization: <hi
                                                 rend="italic">will</hi> for <hi rend="italic">wil,
                                                 Doll.</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Dol., Country</hi>
                                          for <hi rend="italic">Countrey, warlike</hi> for <hi
                                                 rend="italic">warlick, Lion</hi> for <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Lyon,</hi> and the like. The last
                                          decades of the seventeenth century and the early years of
                                          the eighteenth were a period of marked standardization of
                                          spelling&mdash;probably not to be matched in any like
                                          period before or since. This tendency did not begin in
                                          1685; indeed it had no beginning, but was in my opinion
                                          accelerating more or less steadily in the second half of
                                          the century. Such changes as I have listed, with the
                                          possible exception of the use of apostrophes, would be
                                          expected, or at least would not be surprising, at any date
                                          after 1650. In fact the same sorts of modernization abound
                                          in F4, the actual count of spelling changes (from the F3
                                          text) per <pb n="004.099"/> page being there higher than
                                          in F5. As we should expect, the F4 compositor, while
                                          conforming in general to the standardizing trend of the
                                          day was not consistent and left many relics of the F3
                                          spelling. The F5 compositor or compositors carried on in
                                          the same direction. Much the same may be said too of the
                                          increased use of the apostrophe in possessives: the F4
                                          compositor introduced a few of these; the F5 compositor
                                          was more consistent and carried this modernization
                                          further.</p>

                                   <p>It can hardly be said then that we have any clear direct
                                          evidence of a substantially later date for F5 than for F4.
                                          The most that we can say is that the absence of side and
                                          foot rules, the completely different watermarks, and a
                                          strong tendency towards modernization of spelling, taken
                                          all together, make it appear highly probable that F5 was
                                          printed either in a different shop or at a date a good
                                          deal later than the printing of F4. But the employment of
                                          another printer would in itself be strong evidence of the
                                          passage of time between the two printings. The two come to
                                          much the same thing.</p>

                                   <p>And if I reconstruct the probable history of the sheets of the
                                          volume correctly it seems unlikely on the face of it that
                                          the need for reprinting would have been observed at once.
                                          The volume was issued with a variety of
                                          imprints&mdash;three in all: <list>

                                          </list> Henry Herringman owned in 1685 at least a half
                                          interest in the copyrights of most of Shakespeare's plays,
                                          and the fact that his name, and only his, appears in all
                                          the imprints, always in the first position, makes it
                                          appear that he was the principal if not the sole
                                          capitalist in the publication.<ref target="f004.05.09"
                                                 n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> The other
                                          booksellers named were probably small investors, each
                                          receiving a stipulated number of <pb n="004.100"/> copies.
                                          It is significant that all the copies containing F5 sheets
                                          possess, or probably did possess, title-pages with the
                                          first and commonest of the three imprints.<ref
                                                 target="f004.05.10" n="10"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >10</hi></ref> This fact does not in itself, of
                                          course, prove that the shortages were not soon discovered,
                                          for it is natural to assume that the stipulated numbers of
                                          sheets to go to the booksellers named in the imprints
                                          would be counted out for them at once upon publication.
                                          Herringman, primarily a wholesale dealer, would retain the
                                          greater part of the stock, and except for a number of
                                          sheets gathered into volumes for immediate sale I suspect
                                          that the rest would have gone into his warehouse in
                                          bundles of ungathered sheets. Nothing is known about the
                                          date at which the edition was exhausted, but we may safely
                                          assume that a work as big and as dear as this remained in
                                          print for fifteen or twenty years; had it been otherwise,
                                          presumably, another edition would have been called for
                                          before 1709, the year in which Tonson brought out Rowe's
                                          edition. By 1700, fifteen years after publication, the
                                          smaller investors would long since have disposed of their
                                          stocks, the principal publisher would have got his money
                                          back, and sales, each one of which would be cash in his
                                          pocket, would have slowed to a trickle. Herringman's
                                                 successor,<ref target="f004.05.11" n="11"><hi
                                                  rend="super">11</hi></ref> whoever he was, would
                                          have in his warehouse 229 bundles or stacks of ungathered
                                          sheets, from which, as need arose, a dozen or so copies
                                          would be made up. It seems to me a reasonable if untested
                                          hypothesis that at some such time the shortage of some
                                          sheets was discovered. Sheet 2O3:4 may well have been the
                                          first exhausted. A count then revealed that others were
                                          near exhaustion, and a calculation of <pb n="004.101"/>
                                          costs and of the probability of future sales showed that
                                          it would be profitable to go to the expense of reprinting
                                          the seventeen or more sheets required to make the
                                          remaining stock good.</p>




                                   <p>The only questions yet to be considered are how many copies of
                                          the good sheets of F4 remained and how many different
                                          sheets were underprinted. No precise answers can of course
                                          be given, but some calculations can be made on the basis
                                          of the table above.</p>

                                   <p>While not attempting a census of extant copies, I have myself
                                          examined fifty-seven and have received reliable reports on
                                          nine others.<ref target="f004.05.12" n="12"><hi
                                                  rend="super">12</hi></ref> Six of these, or
                                          approximately ten per cent, contain one or more F5 sheets
                                          (if we count Folger 13, which, though its single leaf is
                                          not indigenous, represents a copy with a whole sheet).
                                          Sixty-six is a large enough number to be considered
                                          representative, and I therefore assume that something like
                                          ten per cent of all copies now or at any time existing
                                          would contain one or more of the F5 sheets. This means
                                          that the most deficient of the sheets of the middle
                                          section of F4&mdash;probably 2O3:4&mdash;was approximately
                                          ten per cent short. If this is substantially correct,
                                          then, supposing that the publisher's contract with each of
                                          the three printers called for two thousand copies, printer
                                          number two delivered only 1800 copies of 2O3:4. Even if
                                          the impression was only half this size there remained when
                                          2O3:4 was exhausted one hundred copies of each of the good
                                          sheets. There could have been no question then of the
                                          profitableness of reprinting the short sheets, assuming
                                          that sales were still at an even moderately good
                                          level.</p>


                                   <p>At least seventeen different sheets required reprinting. Were
                                          there probably more? The table gives us every reason for
                                          believing that there were and that others still exist and
                                          will be found.<ref target="f004.05.13" n="13"><hi

                                          or gone to another collection not seen by me I <pb

                                          seventeen sheets. Folger 33 contains another apparently
                                          unique example. The mathematical probability that others
                                          would be found if sixty-five further copies were examined
                                          is so high as to amount almost to certainty. Since two out
                                          of the six copies shown in the table contain four
                                          apparently unique examples I am inclined to believe that
                                          the number of sheets reprinted in 1700 (or whenever it
                                          was) must have been somewhere in the neighborhood of
                                          twenty-five.</p>

                                          of the 12-point used elsewhere throughout the volume, no
                                          one has been sufficiently curious about it to work out the
                                          explanation, or at any rate, thought it worthwhile to
                                          print it.<ref target="f004.05.14" n="14"><hi rend="super"

                                          all copies, including the Methuen facsimile, are in this
                                          respect alike.</p>


                                   <p>Throughout F4 normal columns contain 74 lines of type. The
                                          four columns of pp. 123-124 contain 91, 90, 91 and 90
                                          lines. All other pages of the L gathering, including those
                                          of L6, the leaf conjugate with L1, are printed in the
                                          usual type and with the usual number of lines.</p>

                                   <p>The explanation is not difficult. Printing began with the
                                          inner sheet, L3:4, probably with its inner forme. L2:5 was
                                          printed and perfected next. Then the working off of either
                                          the inner or the outer forme of L1:6 was begun. At this
                                          point the proofreader discovered that a block of text had
                                          been omitted and that some resetting would be required. If
                                          possible the resetting must be confined to L1, since L2<hi
                                                 rend="super">r</hi>:5<hi rend="super">v</hi> was
                                          already printed off or so far along that any resetting
                                          here would involve the discarding of much valuable paper
                                          as well as presswork. And, as we can see, it proved to be
                                          possible. Had the printing of L2<hi rend="super"

                                          or well along, the resetting could have been, and would
                                          have been, spread out so as to avoid such unsightly pages
                                          as 123-124 are.</p>

                                   <p>For their unsightliness is not caused only by the smaller
                                          type. Additional compression has been accomplished by the
                                          elimination <pb n="004.103"/> of all of the usual white
                                          spaces at stage directions, by the printing of two very
                                          short speeches in one line (in seventeen places), and (in
                                          one place) by forcing three lines of verse into two type
                                          lines. A further small gain resulted from the fact that
                                          much of the first column of p. 123 is prose, which allows
                                          more words to the line in the smaller type. Thus no true
                                          measure of the total compression obtained is to be arrived
                                          at by the mere counting of lines and the discovery that
                                          the four reset columns contain 362 lines instead of the
                                          usual 296.</p>

                                   <p>But in another way we can calculate the amount of compression
                                          almost precisely. The text which now fills pp. 123-124
                                                 (<hi rend="italic">L.L.L.</hi> V.i.13 to ii.254, in
                                          the Globe edition) occupies 425 lines in F3, counting all
                                          white spaces at stage directions. If we assume that this
                                          was originally set up in the same way in F4&mdash;that is
                                          with the same spacing&mdash;296 lines would have been
                                          accommodated, leaving a balance of 129 lines. Since F3 is
                                          set 66 lines to the column, 129 lines is almost exactly
                                          one page. We can safely assume then that what the
                                          proofreader found missing from the F4 had been one page of
                                          the F3 text. This means that the omission was due to the
                                          compositor, for only he could have been concerned with F3
                                          pages. Nothing about the F3 text of the passage involved
                                          suggests any reason for the omission or any clue as to
                                          which page was omitted. We have no way of knowing
                                          certainly that the whole first forme, presumably the
                                          inner, of L1:6 was not actually wrought off before the
                                          detection of the omission. But it appears probable that
                                          had this been the case L1 would have been cancelled so
                                          that L6 could be salvaged, reducing the loss of paper by
                                          fifty per cent. That no such cancellation was made
                                          suggests that the omission was discovered in the first
                                          forme in the press.</p>

                                                 (Hilversum, 1950), reproduces (nos. 654, 671) two
                                                 very similar but not identical DVAVLEGARD marks.
                                                 Others may be seen in the second folio Beaumont and

                                                 are various and always complex and unheraldic in

                                          <p>The validity of my statistical approach to this
                                                 question would be affected adversely if it were to
                                                 be assumed that H. C. Folger was aware of the
                                                 existence in some copies of the reprinted sheets
                                                 and made special efforts to acquire copies
                                                 possessing them, but all indications are that he
                                                 was not aware of them and that he acquired the four
                                                 copies just as he did the other thirty-three. The
                                                 fact that four out of the thirty-seven copies
                                                 contain F5 sheets, then, is the result of pure
                                                 chance which might equally well recur in any other
                                                 thirty-seven copies. I hope that owners or
                                                 custodians of Fourth Folios not mentioned in note
                                                 12 who find F5 sheets will communicate their
                                                 findings to me or to Professor Bowers or otherwise
                                                 make them known.</p></note>

                                                 Stedfastnesse</hi> are in substantial agreement on
                                          most readings, they divide into two groups at lines 5, 10,
                                          and 28. One group reads <hi rend="italic">ben no thyng
                                                 on</hi> (l. 5), <hi rend="italic">ffor now
                                                 adayes,</hi> (l. 10), and <hi rend="italic">dryue
                                                 thi peple</hi> (l. 28); the other, <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Is no thing lyke, For amonge vs

                                          The choice between the first two pairs of
                                          readings&mdash;everyday phrases, practically
                                          synony-mous&mdash;is relatively inconsequential. With the
                                          third pair, however, the variation between 'drive' and
                                          'wed' considerably affects the interpretation of the poem,
                                          for each indicates a different attitude toward
                                                 kingship.<ref target="f004.06.01" n="1"><hi
                                                  rend="super">1</hi></ref></p>


                                   <p>Both sets of readings are in passably Chaucerian English; and
                                          previously, so far as manuscript evidence was concerned,
                                          editors have virtually been forced to toss a coin when
                                          considering these lines. Hence one finds Furnivall, Holt,
                                          MacCracken, and Koch supporting the first set; Skeat,
                                          Brusendorff, and Robinson, the second; Heath, both (in the
                                          belief that they derived from 'separate originals').<ref

                                                 >2</hi></ref> With the discovery of a new
                                          manuscript, however, it is now possible to show that one
                                          set of readings is the work of scribes.</p>


                                   <p>This new text&mdash;an eighteenth-century transcription of the
                                          burnt Cotton manuscript <hi rend="italic">Otho A.
                                                 XVIII</hi>
                                         <ref target="f004.06.03" n="3"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >3</hi></ref>&mdash;reads the lines in question as
                                          follows: <hi rend="italic">Is no thynge oon, Amonges vs
                                                 nowe</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">dreve</hi>
                                          <pb n="004.106"/>
                                          <hi rend="italic">thy folke</hi>. As a moment's inspection
                                          will show, these readings are almost beyond doubt a
                                          transition between the two groups of variants given above.
                                          It follows, of course, that only one of the two groups can
                                          be Chaucerian. But unfortunately the readings from <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Otho A. XVIII</hi> do not reveal
                                          which group that is.</p>


                                   <p>Even so, the knowledge that one set of variants is of scribal
                                          origin is sufficient, I believe, to allow one to solve the
                                          problem, and in the end to arrive at a firmly established
                                          text for the poem. To accomplish this aim, however, one
                                          must analyze anew the <hi rend="italic">Lak of
                                                 Stedfastnesse</hi> manuscripts&mdash;a desirable

                                          solely upon the distribution of the variants, since in so
                                          doing we can not only keep distinct the kinds of evidence
                                          with which we have to deal but can also reduce the number

                                          seven. These relationships are as follows: <!-- <figure

                                   <p>Although we cannot relate D to any of the other texts at this
                                                 <pb n="004.115"/> point, we can remark that it
                                          agrees with Ht <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in reading <hi

                                          note that the general badness of D's text&mdash;its
                                          beginning with the envoy and proceeding backwards through
                                          the next two stanzas, its many unique and obviously
                                          incorrect readings&mdash;make it unthinkable that D was
                                                 <hi rend="italic">copied</hi> from a Ms. Almost
                                          certainly D's scribe was writing from an imperfect memory
                                          of the poem.</p>

                                   <p>A glance at the italicized lines (indicating unique variants)
                                          in the 'significant readings' given above for Ht, Co, D,
                                          and the reconstructed parents of H<hi rend="super"
                                                 >1</hi>-R<hi rend="super">1</hi>, B-M, R<hi
                                                 rend="super">3</hi>-Th, and H<hi rend="super"
                                                 >2</hi>-F-A-C will show that none of these can be
                                          the parent of any extant text. Hence we have seven
                                          authorities, none of which can be directly descended from
                                          any of the others.</p>

                                   <p>We have carried our study of the relationships of the Mss
                                          about as far as we can solely on the basis of the
                                          distribution of the variants. We have established certain
                                          relationships, and in so doing have reduced our original
                                          fifteen authorities to seven&mdash;three actual Mss and
                                          four postulated ones. If we continue our procedure of
                                          determining kinship by shared variants, we soon arrive at
                                          the impasse mentioned in the first paragraph of this
                                          paper. On the one hand, we have Ht <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >a</hi> D reading, in lines 5, 10, and 28, <hi
                                                 rend="italic">ben no thyng on, ffor now
                                          adayes</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">dryue thi peple</hi>;
                                          on the other, <hi rend="italic">d f h</hi> reading <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Is no thing lyke, For amonge vs
                                                 now</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">wed thi folk</hi>.
                                          In between lies Co, with its transition readings, <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Ys no thing oon, Amonges vs
                                          nowe</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">dreve thy folk</hi>,
                                          showing that only one of the above sets can be Chaucerian.
                                          But the only readings uniquely common to Ht <hi
                                                 rend="italic">a</hi> D are their variants for lines
                                          5, 10, and 28; and, similarly, the only readings uniquely
                                          common to <hi rend="italic">d f h</hi> are <hi
                                                 rend="italic">their</hi> variants for lines 5, 10,
                                          and 28. Distributional study, then, leaves us in a
                                          dilemma. If we are to relate the seven authorities to each
                                          other, as shown in the tree on page 107, we must seek
                                          other means.</p>

                                   <p>II. So far we have not examined the headings for the poem.
                                          Only five Mss have titles. These are Co Ht L R<hi
                                                 rend="super">1</hi> H<hi rend="super"
                                          >1</hi>&mdash;with the exception of Co, the Mss which read
                                                 <hi rend="italic">ben no thyng on, ffor now
                                                 adayes</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">dryue thi
                                                 peple</hi>. If we study these titles, we find a
                                          similarity between them which suggests that the five texts
                                          are related closely. <list>

                                          </list> We note that the three texts which mention the
                                          poet's name spell it -<hi rend="italic">ier</hi>, not -<hi
                                                 rend="italic">er</hi>. We also note that Co and
                                                 R<hi rend="super">1</hi> are similar in that each
                                          calls the poem a ballad royal, and that Ht and H<hi
                                                 rend="super">1</hi> are alike in asserting that
                                          Chaucer sent the poem to the king. Further, since H<hi
                                                 rend="super">1</hi> and R<hi rend="super">1</hi>
                                          are sister texts on strong evidence, we are justified in
                                          assuming that their parent, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, read
                                          much as does H<hi rend="super">1</hi> but began, say,
                                          'Ballad Royal . . .,' as do R<hi rend="super">1</hi> and
                                          Co. If we attempt to classify these texts on the basis of
                                          their titles, we have the following arrangement: <!-- <figure
                                           entity="sb041161"/> --> The readings <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >ben no thyng on, ffor now adayes</hi>, and <hi
                                                 rend="italic">dryue thi peple</hi> thus appear to
                                          have been begun by the scribe who wrote <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >c</hi> and then 'improved upon' by the scribe who
                                          wrote <hi rend="italic">b</hi>.</p>

                                   <p>But before accepting this explanation, we should certainly
                                          like additional, and stronger, evidence. Nor have we far
                                          to go to find it. In the manuscript books of Ht (and L),
                                          Co, and H<hi rend="super">1</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Lak of

                                                 >1</hi> it immediately precedes it. Again we find a
                                          similarity in the titles.<ref target="f004.06.15" n="15"
                                                  ><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> More important,
                                          however, we find from a purely distributional study of <pb
                                                 n="004.117"/> the text that the copies of <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Truth</hi> are related in one or the
                                          other of two ways:<ref target="f004.06.16" n="16"><hi

                                    <!-- <figure entity="sb041171"/> --> As one can see, the second
                                          tree is identical with that proposed above for <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Lak of Stedfastnesse</hi>. The
                                          coincidence between the trees virtually proves that the
                                          two poems, side by side in the manuscripts, have the same

                                   <p>III. There is no evidence whatsoever for the alternate

                                          </list> With the other group of texts&mdash;Heath's,
                                          Holt's, Koch's, and Mac-Cracken's&mdash;the differences
                                          are of course numerous, but there seems little point in
                                          cataloging them here since the manuscripts on which they
                                          based their texts have been shown to be poor authorities.
                                          It is interesting, however, and perhaps instructive, to
                                          examine the reasoning which led them into error. <q> The
                                                 last important difference is to be found in the
                                                 final line of the poem, where Skeat has 'wed thy
                                                 folk' and I have adopted the reading of the H S Hat
                                                 [H1 R1 Ht] group, 'Dryve thy people.' . . . The
                                                 obvious reason why I have adopted the H S Hat
                                                 reading is that the verb 'Dryve' makes sense where
                                                 the other does not seem to do so. I quote from line
                                                 26: <lg>
                                                  <l>Shew forthe thy swerde of castigacion,</l>

                                                 the people to stedfastnesse; is this not more
                                                 sensible than to draw his sword and wed his folk to

                                   <p>The weakness of this reasoning is apparent if one asks oneself
                                          the question, Why should a scribe emend a reading which
                                          'makes sense' to one which 'does not seem to do so'?</p>



                                   <p>If one reads the line in its true context, however, 'wed'
                                          makes much better sense poetically than 'dryve.' I quote
                                          from the beginning of the envoy: </p>

                                   <p>Since three scholars have misinterpreted this passage, I hope

                                                 Skeat did not attempt a classification, but his
                                                 text is similar to Robinson's.) Only Koch, Heath,
                                                 and Holt published actual trees; only Holt argued

                                                 at the tree will show, there is every reason to
                                                 believe that Chaucer's text read <hi rend="italic"

                                                 the reading of <hi rend="italic">f</hi>.

                                                 same variant in R3 and B, it is in fact not an
                                                 explanation, for it merely shifts the problem from

                                          <p>Although the coincidence seems to be too striking to be
                                                 due to chance, we cannot positively reject the
                                                 first tree. Both trees explain the evidence
                                                 reasonably well, but the first, which requires us
                                                 to make fewer assumptions, would ordinarily be
                                                 preferred on the ground of simplicity. Whichever
                                                 tree we accept, however, these Mss. are obviously

                                          <p>But strong contradictory evidence has forced us, from
                                                 time to time, to regard some readings as
                                                 non-significant; and since there is no absolute

                                                 of the variant itself. The number of metrically
                                                 satisfactory substitutes for <hi rend="italic"
                                                  >worthynesse</hi> is extremely small. Hence if any
                                                 number of scribes decide to emend the reading
                                                 (because, say, their copy is illegible), the
                                                 chances are that a large proportion of them will
                                                 hit upon <hi rend="italic">rightwesnesse</hi>.
                                                 Further, 'truth and righteousness' has a kind of
                                                 obvious force which 'truth and worthyness' lacks,
                                                 and thus might seem to a scribe an improvement
                                                 worth making. Second, the nature of the Mss reading
                                                  <hi rend="italic">rightwesnesse</hi>. Ht has every
                                                 appearance of being a faithful copy. R3, however,
                                                 is quite corrupt and is clearly not the work of a
                                                 professional scribe (it is written on a flyleaf of
                                                 a book of medical receipts and is preceded by a
                                                 stanza, likewise corrupt, from <hi rend="italic"
                                                  >Gentilesse</hi>). Such variants as <hi

                                                 (5), and <hi rend="italic">by sum maner

                                                  collusioun</hi> (11) show that R<hi rend="super"
                                                  >3</hi>'s scribe was either having difficulty
                                                 reading his copy or was writing from memory. As for
                                                 the third Ms, <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, which
                                                 survives in the late 16 century texts B and M,
                                                 emendation seems almost to have been the rule (see
                                                 p. 110 above). At least in R<hi rend="super">3</hi>
                                                 and <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, then, it is not
                                                 surprising to find some other reading than <hi
                                                  rend="italic">worthynesse</hi>, and, since the
                                                 substitutes are few, not especially surprising to
                                                 find <hi rend="italic">rightwesnesse</hi> in both.
                                                 Nor have I assumed contamination to explain the
                                                 agreements between D and R<hi rend="super">3</hi>
                                                 (Th). It is quite possible that D's scribe was
                                                 familiar with two versions of the poem and that
                                                 these had fused in his very faulty memory. But with
                                                 two such corrupt texts as D and R<hi rend="super"
                                                  >3</hi>, a question mark, I feel, more exactly
                                                 expresses the situation than a dotted line. Whether
                                                 or not my reasoning in this footnote is correct, I
                                                 should like to express indebtedness, for the method

                                   <p>IN MILTON'S COMMONPLACE BOOK APPEAR SEVENTEEN notes on his
                                          reading in Machiavelli's <hi rend="italic">Discorsi;</hi>

                                          dictated these entries, scholars have not agreed. In his
                                          classic study of the Commonplace Book, Hanford<ref
                                                 target="f004.07.02" n="2"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >2</hi></ref> implied that the notes were entered
                                          sometime within the eleven-year period between 1648/9 and
                                          1660, possibly between 1648/9 and 1652. Liljegren,<ref

                                                 >5</hi></ref> however, have offered the entries as
                                          proof that Milton knew Machiavelli in the early 1640's and
                                          derived from his writings some of the ideas found in the
                                          anti-espiscopal tracts. And Bryant,<ref
                                                 target="f004.07.06" n="6"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >6</hi></ref> finally, has argued that Milton's
                                          knowledge of the <hi rend="italic">Discorsi</hi> came
                                          "relatively late" in the poet's career. In their
                                          discussions, however, none of these scholars has given
                                          close attention to the handwriting found in the entries
                                          and in other Milton manuscripts; and preserved at
                                          Oldenburg are certain of Milton's private letters in which
                                          the handwriting enables us to date the <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Discorsi</hi> notes with some degree of assurance
                                          within a fairly limited space of time.</p>







                                   <p>None of these seventeen entries is in Milton's autograph. They
                                          are rather all the work of his amanuenses, though the
                                          exact number of these scribes I have not been able to
                                          determine. Certain of the notes show significant
                                          similarities of handwriting which indicate that these
                                          entries constitute groups, or blocks of notetaking, <pb
                                                 n="004.124"/> made by a single scribe at a single
                                          sitting.<ref target="f004.07.07" n="7"><hi rend="super"
                                                  >7</hi></ref> But while these groups tend to
                                          differ from one another in general appearance, they
                                          sometimes show similarities of letter formation and habits
                                          of lifting the pen which suggest that in some instances
                                          the notes were written by scribes who employed more than
                                          one style of handwriting.<ref target="f004.07.08" n="8"
                                                  ><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> In this puzzling
                                          complex of hands, however, there are two clearly
                                          distinguishable groups which would seem to furnish clues
                                          as to the date at which Milton dictated the whole corpus
                                          of his <hi rend="italic">Discorsi</hi> notes.</p>



                                   <p>The first of these is the group listed in footnote 7 as Group
                                          2. In chronological order of entry, it is probably the
                                          second set of notes dictated by Milton;<ref

                                          from Milton's <pb n="004.125"/> reading of Book I, chapter

                                          73, Fasc. 5, no. 8. As Plate I reveals, the Commonplace
                                          Book note and the letter show the same angularity of
                                          script and the same idiosyncrasies of formation in certain
                                          individual letters: for instance, the <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >M</hi> with the slanted serif in "Machiavel." and
                                          "Miltonio" and the <hi rend="italic">t</hi> in "mortales"
                                          and "postquam", which resembles somewhat the figure <hi
                                                 rend="italic">4</hi>. The date of the letter, as
                                          Plate I also shows, is "Feb: 13<hi rend="super">tio</hi>
                                          1651", that is, 1652.</p>




                                   <p>The second of these two clearly distinguishable groups is that
                                          listed in footnote 7 as Group 9. In chronological order,
                                          it seems the last of Milton's <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Discorsi</hi> entries; and it consists of a single
                                          note on p. 198, deriving from Milton's reading of Book
                                          III, chapter 34 of the <hi rend="italic">Discorsi</hi>.
                                          The scribe of Group 9 has yet to be identified; but as
                                          Plate III shows, his hand likewise appears in the original
                                          of Milton's letter to Mylius numbered in the Columbia

                                          least four other of Milton's letters to Mylius not

                                          4, 5, and 7. The dates of these five letters run from
                                          November 7, 1651, to February 10, 1652.<ref

                                   <p>Such, then, are the similarities that exist between the
                                          handwriting found in two groups of the <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Discorsi</hi> notes and in six of the Milton
                                          letters preserved in the Oldenburg archives; and these
                                          similarities would seem to suggest the following
                                          conclusions. Between November 7, 1651, and February 13,
                                          1652, Milton had in his service two amanuenses to whom he
                                          dictated six of his letters to Mylius written between
                                          those two dates. To these scribes, he also dictated two of
                                          the nine groups of his notes from Machiavelli, for their
                                          hands are found not only in the six letters but also in
                                          Groups 2 and 9 of the <hi rend="italic">Discorsi</hi>
                                          entries. The hands of these two scribes, furthermore,
                                          appear in conjunction only in these two instances<ref
                                                 target="f004.07.15" n="15"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >15</hi></ref>&mdash; in the Mylius correspondence
                                          and in the <hi rend="italic">Discorsi</hi> notes. We may
                                          assume, therefore, that the letters and the two groups of
                                          notes belong to the same period of Milton's intellectual
                                          activities. And since the Group 2 and the Group 9 entries
                                          seem to represent not only the second but also the ninth
                                          and last stage of Milton's recorded reading in
                                          Machiavelli's treatise, we may likewise assume that the
                                          whole body of <hi rend="italic">Discorsi</hi> notes belong
                                          close to, if not actually within, this same period. If
                                          these two assumptions are justified&mdash;and they do not
                                          seem contrary to the logic of historical inference&mdash;,
                                          then the seventeen entries from Machiavelli's <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Discorsi</hi> should be tentatively
                                          assigned to the four-month period covered by the letters,
                                                 <pb n="004.127"/> to November and December, 1651,
                                          and January and February, 1652. And there these entries
                                          should remain until new evidence shows clearly that they
                                          belong to a different period of Milton's studies and
                                          political evolution.</p>

                                          <p>I suggest the following groups. Group 1: two notes from

                                                 notes from I, 10 on p. 197. Group 3: two notes from

                                                 2 on index page of Commonplace Book. Group 4: two

                                                 the difference in appearance of the two notes
                                                 resulting from the fact that the note on p. 185 has
                                                 been crowded in between two earlier entries. Group
                                                 5: four notes from I, 58, II, 10, and II, 12 on p.

                                                 24 on p. 242. Group 8: note from III, 1 on p. 198.
                                                 Group 9: note from III, 34 on p. 198.</p></note>

                                          <p>The close similarity of the cancelled note on p. 193
                                                 and the recopied form of it on p. 195 offers
                                                 convincing proof that Groups 1 and 3 are by the
                                                 same scribe; and a comparison of words and word
                                                 forms common to these two groups and to Groups 4,
                                                 6, and 9 (the citations of Machiavelli, the words
                                                 for "prince", and inflectional endings, such as
                                                 "-are" and "-ere") suggests that Groups 4 and 6 are
                                                 perhaps, and Group 9 very likely, also the work of
                                                 the Groups 1 and 3 scribe. For a somewhat
                                                 different, but likewise tentative, grouping, see

                                          <p>Both the reading and the dictation of the notes seem
                                                 for the most part to have been done consecutively.
                                                 The position of the notes on p. 198 indicates that
                                                 the entry from I, 58 (Group 5) was made earlier
                                                 than the entry from III, 1 (Group 8) and III, 34
                                                 (Group 9), and the index entry for the two notes
                                                 from I, 10 on p. 197 (Group 2) was made by the
                                                 scribe who entered the notes from I, 2 and I, 10 on
                                                 p. 195 (Group 3). Normally the scribe writing the
                                                 heading of the new page was responsible also for
                                                 the index entry in the back of the book; but the
                                                 Group 2 scribe failed to make this entry, and it
                                                 was left for the Group 3 amaneunsis to supply this
                                                 omission later. This fact would seem to establish
                                                 the priority of Group 2 to Group 3 even though the
                                                 notes overlap. The two Group 2 notes, which come
                                                 from <hi rend="italic">Discorsi</hi> I, 10, derive
                                                 from passages printed on pp. 56 and 60 of volume II
                                                 of the <hi rend="italic">Opere di Niccol&ograve;
                                                  Machiavelli</hi>, Milano, 1804, while the note in
                                                 Group 3 from I, 10 comes from a passage printed on
                                                 p. 59 of the same volume. The work of the Group 3
                                                 scribe seems to have been that of gathering up
                                                 loose ends: the recopying of the I, 2 note that he
                                                 had entered on the wrong page while making the
                                                 Group 1 notes, and the entering of a new note from
                                                 a chapter already covered by the Group 2 scribe. A
                                                 similar overlapping is present in Groups 4 and 5.
                                                 The Group 5 entry from I, 58 on p. 198 of the
                                                 Commonplace Book derives from earlier pages of the

                                                 entry in Group 4, but I have put Group 5 later than
                                                 Group 4 because the other three entries in Group 5
                                                 come much later in the <hi rend="italic">Opere</hi>
                                                 than the second Group 4 entry.</p></note>

                                          <p>Plate I shows only the first of these two notes, but
                                                 those who wish to check the similarity of the
                                                 handwriting found in the two notes may consult the
                                                 facsimile edition of the Commonplace Book, cited in
                                                 note 1. Compare, for instance, "Religione" and
                                                 "esse" as they appear in both entries, and
                                                 "laudatiores", "Respub:", and "Machiavel. discors
                                                 l. 1. c. 10" in the first entry with "laudat",
                                                 "Repub:", and "Machiavellus . . . discors. l. 1. c.
                                                 10" in the second. Horwood identified the scribe of
                                                 these two notes as Daniel Skinner. Hanford,
                                                 however, rejected this identification and
                                                 suggested, "though not without hesitation," that
                                                 the amanuensis was Edward Phillips. As a comparison
                                                 of Plates I and II shows, Skinner's script is less
                                                 angular and more ornate than that appearing in the
                                                 Commonplace Book notes and in the example of
                                                 Phillips' hand reproduced in Plate II. For further

                                          <p>To this same scribe may also belong a seventh letter,
                                                 FE., LXV, noted in the Columbia edition, XII, 376,
                                                 411-12, preserved as no. 9 under the same Oldenburg
                                                 pressmark, and dated "Feb. 21<hi rend="super"
                                                  >mo</hi> 1651", that is 1652. In the six Oldenburg
                                                 letters we have a fairly clear case of a scribe who
                                                 writes in more than one hand. The hand appearing in
                                                 FE., L differs considerably from the hand appearing
                                                 in FE., LV; but the two hands appear juxtaposed in
                                                 the text of FE., LIIa, which seems to be the work
                                                 of only one scribe. To my knowledge, none of these
                                                 letters has been reproduced except the seventh,
                                                 LXV, which appeared in facsimile in <hi
                                                  rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, Dec, 31,
                                                 1927; but anyone wishing to check my conclusion
                                                 that these letters are all by the same scribe, who
                                                 also made the Group 9 entry in the Commonplace
                                                 Book, should compare the Group 9 entry with
                                                 "inserere", "dare", "perlegendam", "prolixiorem",
                                                 "quandoquidem", "rem", and "remittatur" appearing
                                                 in FE., LV, and "Comitem", "qua", and "rem" in FE.,
                                                 LVII, with "quam" and "res" in FE., LIX.</p></note>

                                                 that Edward Phillips's hand appears in the

                                                 the handwriting of the Group 9 scribe is somewhat
                                                 suggestive of that found in the May 2, 1652 entry

                                          in the tradition a division into what became archetypal
                                          volumes, whence the text descended along separate lines. A
                                          careful description of these manuscripts has been
                                          published by Professor J. J. H. Savage.<ref
                                                 target="f004.08.02" n="2"><hi rend="super"

                                   <p>The extent of Servius Danielis is considerably greater than
                                          that of the vulgate Servius. The relation between the two
                                          can best be seen by examining the pages of the single
                                          published volume of the so-called "Harvard <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Servius</hi>,"<ref
                                                 target="f004.08.03" n="3"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >3</hi></ref> the only edition purporting to do
                                          full justice to both forms of the commentary without
                                          prejudging their respective claims to venerability. It
                                          will be found that they have a great many scholia in
                                          common. These the Harvard editors print the full width of
                                          the page. Others are peculiar to one or the other form of
                                          the commentary&mdash;many (accounting for its greater
                                          total length) to Servius Danielis, a few to the vulgate
                                          Servius. These the Harvard editors print in columns
                                          three-quarters the <pb n="004.130"/> width of the page,
                                          Servius Danielis flush with the left margin, vulgate
                                          Servius flush with the right. Still others embody what
                                          appears to be parallel comment on the same passage in
                                          Vergil, and are printed side by side in half-width
                                          columns, Servius Danielis again on the left and vulgate on
                                          the right.</p>


                                   <p>From the moment of the appearance of Servius Danielis there
                                          has been the greatest diversity of opinion concerning the
                                          origin and value of the additional scholia. Daniel himself
                                          thought that his <hi rend="italic">Servius auctior</hi>
                                          was, if not the genuine commentary of Servius, at least a
                                          better representative of it than the vulgate, which he
                                          viewed as an abridgment, like Paulus' of Festus, that had
                                          driven the original almost or entirely out of circulation.
                                          Thilo, on the other hand, whose late nineteenth-century
                                          edition of Servius<ref target="f004.08.04" n="4"><hi

                                          standard, saw in the Danieline additions merely
                                          interpolations gleaned from various sources and more or
                                          less artfully grafted upon Servius. From this
                                          understanding of the matter he took license to butcher
                                          Servius Danielis sometimes beyond recognition in tailoring
                                          it to fit the convenience of a vulgate-centered
                                          edition.</p>


                                   <p>It may be taken as established by modern scholarship<ref
                                                 target="f004.08.05" n="5"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >5</hi></ref> that the new material presented by
                                          Servius Danielis is not a miscellany of ancient lore, but
                                          derives from a single source, the antiquity of which is
                                          attested by, among other things, the large number of
                                          citations of authors whose works were quite certainly no
                                          longer extant even in the early Middle Ages. Further, this
                                          source seems quite clearly to have been an entirely
                                          different commentary on Vergil, some characteristics of
                                          which, as distinguished from those of Servius', can still
                                          be discerned. To mention only an obvious one,
                                          cross-references within the <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >additamenta</hi> show that the unidentified
                                          commentary treated the works of Vergil in the order <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Eclogues, Georgics,</hi> and <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, whereas Servius dealt
                                          with them in the sequence <hi rend="italic">Aeneid,
                                                 Eclogues</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Georgics</hi>.
                                          Servius Danielis, then, represents a <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >contaminatio</hi>, or fusion, of the genuine
                                          (essentially the vulgate) commentary of Servius with some
                                          other ancient commentary, of which we may say that it is
                                          probably more ancient than Servius' own, probably one from
                                          which Servius himself drew extensively <pb n="004.131"/>
                                          enough so that there were long passages of coincidence
                                          suggesting the possibility of combining the two in a
                                          composite edition, and probably not the lost commentary of
                                          Aelius Donatus on Vergil, as Professor Albert H. Travis
                                          has shown by a careful comparison of the style of Servius
                                          Danielis with that of Aelius Donatus' extant commentary on
                                                 Terence.<ref target="f004.08.06" n="6"><hi

                                          non-Servian forebear of Servius Danielis D, the vulgate
                                          Servius S, and Servius Danielis, as a composite of the
                                          two, DS.</p>




                                   <p>If what has been said about the nature of DS is true, and if
                                          DS possesses, as it were, an integrity of its own, it
                                          becomes manifestly important that its text be constituted
                                          with all possible accuracy, a thing that Thilo did not
                                          even aspire to do. The attempt to accomplish this,
                                          however, runs immediately a-foul of the difficulty
                                          inherent in the small body of manuscript evidence. For <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> III-V, to which I confine
                                          myself in this study, there is only one complete DS
                                          manuscript, the Bernensis, bibl. publ. 172 (saec. IX/X),
                                          which Thilo designates by the siglum <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >F.</hi> Others provide only occasional help: a
                                          Leidensis, bibl. publ. Voss. F 79 (saec. IX ex.), which
                                          contains an exceedingly meagre abridgment of DS text; a
                                          "Virgil of Tours" (Bernensis, bibl. publ. 165, saec.
                                                 IX),<ref target="f004.08.08" n="8"><hi rend="super"
                                                  >8</hi></ref> in the margins of which, along with
                                          a great deal of miscellaneous matter, are found bits of
                                          DS; and a puzzling manuscript of Cassel (bibl. publ. ms.
                                          poet. fol. 6, saec. IX/X), which merits an article by
                                          itself for the DS affinities which it exhibits in what, by
                                          "Harvard" usage described above, would be common or
                                          parallel text, but for the most part does not include the
                                          DS additions to the Servian vulgate.</p>


                                   <p>There is a fifth manuscript, another Bernensis, bibl. publ.
                                          167, approximately contemporary with <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >F</hi> (saec. IX/X), which has been found to
                                          contain a little over half of the DS scholia found in <hi

                                          new importance assumed by DS in the light of the

                                          the whole question of the relationship between these two
                                          manuscripts with the hope of vindicating the authority of
                                          Bern. 167 (which may be called <hi rend="italic">G</hi>)
                                          as a new witness to the DS text for the <hi rend="italic"

                                                 >Aeneid</hi> III, 1-707, and <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Aeneid</hi> V, 9-826,<ref target="f004.08.14"
                                                 n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref> within which
                                          limits I have personally re-collated their text. I have
                                          also been aided by having the photographs of all the other
                                          important Servius manuscripts for <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Aeneid</hi> III and V, both the DS and the S, so
                                          that I have been able to weigh the testimony of <hi
                                                 rend="italic">F</hi> and <hi rend="italic">G</hi>
                                          in the light of the full tradition. Finally, loan has been
                                          made to me of some unpublished notes of the late Professor
                                          E. K. Rand, of Harvard University, and Mr. George B.
                                          Waldrop, of Shady Side Academy, Pittsburgh, who once
                                          undertook but did not complete a similar study, using a
                                          much smaller section of text<ref target="f004.08.15"
                                                 n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> as their
                                          sample. To these and to conversations with both of the
                                          gentlemen mentioned I am indebted for many stimulating
                                          suggestions.</p>



                                   <p><hi rend="italic">F</hi> and <hi rend="italic">G</hi> have
                                          both been described by Savage.<ref target="f004.08.16"
                                                 n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref>
                                          <hi rend="italic">F</hi> has text in three columns. The
                                          center column is occupied by the text of Vergil, with
                                          ordinarily twenty-four lines to a page. The outer columns
                                          contain the scholia of Servius Danielis. The scribe
                                          followed no principle that I have been able to discover in
                                          assigning scholia to one column or the other. Since the
                                          order of the scholia was in most cases clearly fixed by
                                          the order of occurrence in Vergil <pb n="004.133"/> of the
                                          words that were being commented upon, it was not important
                                          that he should. His sole consideration seems to have been
                                          to transcribe each note as near as possible to the line of
                                          Vergil in which the lemma occurred, and he used whichever
                                          margin afforded the requisite amount of space. <hi
                                                 rend="italic">G</hi>, on the other hand, has text
                                          in two columns, the inner one (as the book was bound)
                                          containing the text of Vergil, usually with thirty to
                                          thirty-three lines on a page, and the outer one something
                                          more than half of the DS scholia <hi rend="italic">ad
                                                 loc</hi>. At first glance, the selection seems
                                          quite arbitrary, but as long ago as 1867 it was noted by
                                          Hermann Hagen, cataloguer of the manuscripts at Bern,<ref

                                                 >G</hi> are the ones found in the <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >left</hi> margin of <hi rend="italic">F</hi>. So
                                          scrupulous was the scribe of <hi rend="italic">G</hi> to
                                          reproduce all of these that on occasion, when space failed
                                          him, he went so far as to transcribe on scraps of
                                          parchment, now interlarded with the gatherings of <hi
                                                 rend="italic">G</hi>, notes for which otherwise he
                                          would have had no room,<ref target="f004.08.20" n="20"><hi
                                                  rend="super">20</hi></ref> and we may theorize
                                          that on other occasions, when there is a break in <hi
                                                 rend="italic">G</hi> in what would be the sequence
                                          of scholia from the left margin of <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >F</hi>, he did the same thing, but the scraps have
                                          since become lost.<ref target="f004.08.21" n="21"><hi

                                          disregarded so systematically that I have found only three
                                          of them in <hi rend="italic">G</hi> within the entire
                                          compass of <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> III and V.<ref

                                   <p>Over the intriguing question why and under what circumstances
                                          anyone should so undiscerningly have perpetuated about
                                          half of the DS commentary and ignored the rest it is not
                                          necessary to linger. Perhaps the scribe had in mind some
                                          other manuscript, in which there really was a distinction
                                          between scholia of <pb n="004.134"/> one sort in one
                                          margin, and of another in the other. It is, of course,
                                          true that the present state of <hi rend="italic">G</hi>
                                          would be explained if the scribe who made this unfortunate
                                          selection had been copying directly from <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >F</hi>. The distribution of scholia between the
                                          left and right margins of <hi rend="italic">F</hi>,
                                          however, is quite as likely to derive from <hi
                                                 rend="italic">F</hi>'s source as to have been
                                          original with <hi rend="italic">F</hi> itself, and the
                                          coincidence which we observe proves nothing more than that
                                          the two manuscripts are in the same line of descent. The
                                          same may be said of the large number of demonstrably
                                          corrupt readings which they share. In <hi rend="italic"

                                          afford no support for the contention of Thilo and Savage,

                                   <p>It is, as every textual critic knows, exceedingly difficult to
                                          prove that one text was taken from another, in the absence
                                          of direct evidence on the point. There are at least two
                                          minimum requirements, one positive, the other negative.
                                          Positively, there must be a substantial number of false
                                          readings in the supposed copy which could most readily be
                                          explained from some ambiguity or peculiarity that might
                                          plausibly be considered unique in the supposed original.
                                          Negatively, there must be an absence in the alleged copy
                                          of correct readings not found in the suspected source
                                          (except such as might be the product of scribal
                                          emendation). Even if these two conditions are met, the
                                          hypothesis remains vulnerable to attack from many
                                          quarters, as, for example, if it can be shown that the
                                          "copy" contains any considerable number of divagations
                                          that would not normally result from copying this
                                          "original," but would be likely if the scribe had been
                                          looking at another kind of script.</p>

                                          significant are the cases (A. III, 67; A. III, 337) where

                                          appears in <hi rend="italic">F</hi>. The first of these is
                                          an uncommonly long line at the foot of the page, extending
                                          the width not only of the "left margin" but also of the

                                          46, 46, 52 letters). They can be explained most easily on
                                          the assumption that the writer of <hi rend="italic">G</hi>
                                          missed a whole line of his original. If that is so, his
                                          original was not <hi rend="italic">F</hi>. If his original
                                          was not <hi rend="italic">F</hi>, however, it must have
                                          been a manuscript very much like it, to account for the
                                          regularity with which he reproduces only those scholia
                                          that appear in the left margin of <hi rend="italic"
                                          >F</hi>. It must have been a manuscript which, like <hi
                                                 rend="italic">F</hi>, had space in the scholia
                                          column for about 46 letters to the line. It may even have
                                          been the source of <hi rend="italic">F</hi>. We may
                                          theorize that in seven instances the eye of the writer of
                                                 <hi rend="italic">G</hi> skipped over a whole line
                                          in his exemplar. Two of these happen also to be whole
                                          lines in <hi rend="italic">F</hi>, as would be natural
                                          enough if <hi rend="italic">G</hi>'s exemplar was the
                                          parent of <hi rend="italic">F</hi> also. By the theory,
                                          the passage from A. III, 241, would be an incomplete line
                                          in the original of <hi rend="italic">G</hi>. The evidence
                                          of omissions, then, would, if my reasoning is correct,
                                          serve to refute rather than to support the contention that
                                                 <hi rend="italic">G</hi> was taken directly from
                                                 <hi rend="italic">F</hi>.</p>




                                   <p>The rest of the evidence comprising "positive" support for
                                          this <pb n="004.138"/> thesis carries little more
                                          conviction. "Possessi" (A. III, 67) may have been the
                                          reading that was seen by both <hi rend="italic">F</hi> and
                                                 <hi rend="italic">G</hi>; <hi rend="italic">G</hi>
                                          adopted it, <hi rend="italic">F</hi> (copying with an eye
                                          for the sense) emended almost unconsciously to
                                          "possessio," but then perhaps caught himself and deleted
                                          the 'o'. Haplographies (A. III, 420; A. V, 245) and
                                          dittographies (A. III, 93) are common enough in all
                                          conditions of text, as are omissions by homoeoteleuton (A.
                                          III, 229). "Aut" and "autem" (A. III, 351) are very
                                          frequently confused in text transmission.<ref

                                          see later is likely on other grounds.<ref

                                   <p>Negatively, the postulate of direct descent fares no better.
                                          It is true that <hi rend="italic">G</hi> makes few
                                          substantial improvements upon the readings of <hi
                                                 rend="italic">F</hi>. In view of the closeness of

                                          not be expected that it would. It is true, too, that the

                                                  on "dignate" (A. III, 475). Neither has anything
                                                  to do with what goes before. But the important

                                   <p>To complete the refutation, it is possible to cite an imposing
                                          number of cases where <hi rend="italic">G</hi> is corrupt
                                          and <hi rend="italic">F</hi> affords no grounds whatsoever
                                          for misunderstanding. A conspicuous example occurs early
                                          in <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> III, where <hi

                                          note, HOSPITIVM ANTIQVVM aut carum . . . regi (A. III, 15;
                                          Th. 338, 4-6), followed by the note on DVM FORTVNA FVIT

                                          two notes, as a sign of cross-reference from the lemma in
                                          Vergil, <hi rend="italic">F</hi> has the symbol

                             <p>PRINTERS HAD LABORED AT THE OLD WOODEN hand press for three hundred and fifty years, and
                             it was time for someone to make improvements.  The age of machinery was dawning.
                             Here and there&mdash;in Europe, England, and America&mdash;some inventive 
                             mechanic would experiment, but the lack of sufficiently accurate machine tools, 
                             and the disposition of printers to avoid change, served as a drawback.</p>
                             
                                   <p>In Hartford, Conn., Dr. Appolos Kinsley, in 1796 made a
                                          machine press, entirely new in principle, which had a
                                          predicted speed of 2000 sheets per hour, as compared to
                                          200 or 250 for the hand press. From the description, it
                                          must have looked like the modern Miehle Vertical, with
                                          vertical bed but with two impression cylinders, and
                                          arranged to print two sheets at once. It was hand fed, of
                                          course, and not automatic. Only one press was built, and
                                          we can guess why the work ended there, since facilities
                                          for making accurate machinery just did not exist. Kinsley
                                          must have been greatly handicapped without suitable inking
                                          rollers. The composition roller did not reach this country
                                          until almost 25 years later.</p>

                                   <p>Benjamin Dearborn, John Sawin, Thomas Wait, Benjamin Metcalf,
                                          W. Elliot, Zach Mills, D. Pearson, and probably a number
                                          of others, during the following quarter century made or
                                          patented improved presses. All showed considerable
                                          ingenuity, but most of them were ahead of their times. The
                                          first machine press to be regularly made in this country
                                          was the invention of Daniel Treadwell, a young Boston
                                          mechanic.</p>

                                   <p>Treadwell was not a printer, and therefore not bound by
                                          tradition. He had studied mechanical movements and their
                                          possible application to ease the labor involved in certain
                                          trades. The old <pb n="004.144"/> wooden press, he
                                          decided, was wasteful of power and slow in operation. In
                                          1818 he built, but did not patent, an improved press which
                                          worked by a foot treadle instead of a hand lever. It
                                          involved a very ingenious mechanism, which undoubtedly
                                          would have saved labor, but its appearance was decidedly
                                          against it. Today, it would have been called a Rube
                                          Goldberg. It took up the space of three ordinary presses
                                          and involved a number of long levers, braces, bearings,
                                          and other parts.</p>

                                   <p>Treadwell demonstrated the press to friends and a few
                                          printers, who seemed sufficiently interested to warrant
                                          his going ahead with the manufacture of the machine.
                                          However, instead of attempting to push it further in this
                                          country, the inventor decided that England offered a
                                          larger field for the promotion of his press, and
                                          accordingly he set out for London in November, 1819.</p>

                                   <p>The decision to go to England might have been arrived at owing
                                          to the experience of George Clymer, the first American to
                                          manufacture an all-iron hand press. Clymer had completed
                                          his experiments in 1813 and attempted to market his press.
                                          When he did not achieve the success he expected, however,
                                          he went to England in 1817, where his press was received
                                          very favorably. British printers had become aware of the
                                          advantages of the iron press, as the Stanhope, an all-iron
                                          press, had appeared there in 1800.</p>

                                   <p>Treadwell, after arriving in London, arranged to have one of
                                          his presses built by Napier, a well-known English press
                                          builder. This took time, however, and it was the late
                                          spring of 1820 before he could demonstrate his treadle
                                          press to London printers. Although his press received
                                          favorable comment, and much interest was shown, the buyers
                                          did not appear. Treadwell blamed the lack of sales on the
                                          inability of the British printer to change his habits.
                                          Possibly one or two additional presses were built and
                                          sold, but this was not sufficient encouragement and
                                          Treadwell returned to Boston in September, 1820.</p>

                                   <p>His English visit, however, had changed his views. While
                                          there, he had seen the new steam-driven newspaper presses,
                                          just coming into use. Here was something bigger, something
                                          far more revolutionary, which the American printers could
                                          not do without. Probably on the voyage home, Treadwell
                                          planned his power press.</p>

                                   <pb n="004.145"/>

                                   <p>The English steam-driven presses were of the cylinder type,
                                          very much like the press now called the flat bed cylinder.
                                          The platen or impression cylinder was mounted on a fixed
                                          horizontal axis and the bed carrying the type form moved
                                          back and forth under the cylinder. The inking was
                                          accomplished automatically by rollers covered with roller
                                          composition, which had been discovered or invented about
                                          the time of the first successful use of the press in 1814.
                                          At the time of Treadwell's visit, the power presses were
                                          used almost exclusively for newspaper work, where speed
                                          was of primary importance.</p>

                                   <p>
                                    <!-- <figure entity="sb041451"/> -->
                                   </p>

                                   <p>Surprisingly, Treadwell did not follow the English scheme
                                          involving the use of the cylinder. There are no records
                                          extant which explain why he adopted an entirely different
                                          plan for his press, but enough has been left us so that we
                                          may piece out an explanation. The press which he designed
                                          and built was based on the old principle of the flat
                                          platen pressing down on the type form below it. It was a
                                          glorified hand press, with a lot of mechanism added to
                                          move the bed in and out from under the platen&mdash;to
                                          press down the platen automatically at the proper
                                          time&mdash;and to ink the form. It was described as a mass
                                          of levers, cranks, straps, cog wheels, and shafting.
                                          Fortunately, we have a diagram which explains the working.
                                          (All sketches reproduced here are by the author.)</p>

                                   <p>Undoubtedly, Treadwell realized that a cylinder press,
                                          following the English style, could not be built in this
                                          country. The machine shops were limited to a few lathes
                                          and drill presses, and even these were of small size and
                                          not too accurate. In making his first power press,
                                          Treadwell reported that there was not a lathe in Boston
                                          large enough to face the underside of the platen. It was
                                          necessary, therefore, to follow the form of construction
                                          of the old wooden press and to use a slab of stone for the
                                          bed, and a platen <pb n="004.146"/> made of wood. This
                                          must have limited the size and capacity of the press.
                                          Later, iron was used for these important parts.</p>

                                   <p>Treadwell's friend and neighbor, Phineas Dow, deserves
                                          considerable credit for the development of the press. Dow
                                          had a machine shop in Boston, and had the reputation of
                                          making excellent fire engines and other machines of the
                                          period.</p>

                                   <p>
                                    <!-- <figure entity="sb041461"/> -->
                                   </p>

                                   <p>The first power press was completed, with some difficulties,
                                          in 1821. Since a steam engine was not available, a horse
                                          was used as motive power. A large vertical shaft, which
                                          drove the press, extended down through the pressroom
                                          floor, to a basement below. A horizontal lever extended
                                          out from the lower end of the shaft and to this the horse
                                          was hitched, thus limiting the travel of the beast to a
                                          circular path. The first press was without a flywheel. At
                                          the moment just before the impression was made,
                                          considerable extra power was required to keep the entire
                                          mechanism in motion. At this particular point in the
                                          cycle, the horse was always at one place in his path, and
                                          he came to know just when this extra power was required.
                                          If unattended, he took the course of least resistance, and
                                          stopped. It was soon found necessary to provide a boy with
                                          a stick, who was stationed at the proper point to keep the
                                          motive power going.</p>

                                   <pb n="004.147"/>

                                   <p>In addition to the boy, an experienced pressman and a woman
                                          feeder were required, making a total of three hands
                                          employed at the press. The speed was 500 to 600 sheets per
                                          hour, which was somewhat faster than twice the speed of
                                          the hand press. The latter, however, required both the
                                          puller (feeder) and the beater (inker) to be skilled
                                          workmen.</p>

                                   <p>Later, and more improved models, were made as double presses;
                                          that is, they consisted of two presses set back to back,
                                          and driven by one common shaft. The total labor bill was
                                          somewhat reduced by this arrangement.</p>

                                   <p>As was the case with his treadle press, Treadwell found
                                          printers only lukewarm in their interest. Not finding a
                                          buyer, he determined to become a printer himself. With the
                                          backing of two Boston men, he set up a complete
                                          establishment for book printing. A second press was added
                                          in 1822, and contracts were made with Boston publishers
                                          for the printing of a number of books. After having been
                                          in successful operation for about a year, the printing
                                          office was sold to a Boston printer, who, later, purchased
                                          two more presses. A total of four presses were purchased
                                          by another Boston office, which a short time later burned
                                          to the ground with total destruction of all equipment. It
                                          was thought, although not proved, that the fire had been
                                          started by printers who feared the machine would
                                          ultimately take away their livelihood.</p>

                                   <p>Daniel Fanshaw was probably Treadwell's best customer. He
                                          conducted one of the largest offices in New York, since he
                                          handled the printing for the American Bible Society. At
                                          one time, twenty Treadwell presses were operating in
                                          Fanshaw's office. Isaac Ashmead of Philadelphia had at
                                          least eight Treadwell presses&mdash;all double
                                          machines&mdash;and there were similar presses in Baltimore
                                          and Washington. Probably as many as fifty Treadwell
                                          presses were built up to 1830. Eventually they were all
                                          operated by steam power.</p>

                                   <p>Apparently, after the business was well started, Treadwell
                                          handled only the sale of the rights to purchase or make
                                          the press, and his friend Dow contracted for the actual
                                          manufacture. There is some evidence to indicate that not
                                          all the presses were made in Boston. A few may have been
                                          made in southern cities.</p>

                                   <p>Although the first press was put in operation in 1821, a
                                          patent was not obtained until 1826. By delaying the issue
                                          of the patent, <pb n="004.148"/> Treadwell hoped to extend
                                          its life and hence earn protection for as many years as
                                          possible.</p>

                                   <p>As early as 1825, Treadwell became interested in other
                                          ventures. He developed a number of other machines, and in
                                          1829 disposed of his interest in the power press.
                                          Evidently, no improvements were made in the press; as a
                                          consequence, the field became wide open for other
                                          inventors. In 1830, the R. Hoe &amp; Co. advertisement
                                          indicated they were makers of the Treadwell press, but
                                          their later advertisements omitted mention of the
                                          press.</p>

                                   <p>In 1835, Treadwell became a professor at Harvard, where he
                                          remained for many years. He died in 1872, at the age of 81
                                          years.</p>

                                   <p>By modern standards, the Treadwell presses were crude
                                          machines, the main framework consisting of heavy wooden
                                          timbers. They were not efficient in their use of power.
                                          For each impression the entire bed carrying the type form
                                          had to be moved out from under the platen, inked, and then
                                          returned to its place. At first, the leather straps, which
                                          performed this office, jerked the bed back and forth
                                          without a gradual application of power. Later, cam wheels
                                          were employed to make the motion smoother, and to ease the
                                          shock on the frame.</p>

                                   <p>Treadwell employed a revolving disk as the distributing table
                                          for the inking rollers. This is of interest, as its use
                                          seems to have been forgotten until some twenty-five years
                                          later, when George P. Gordon suddenly re-discovered the
                                          idea and found it admirably suited for his later
                                          well-known job press.</p>

                                   <p>The Treadwell press could handle a sheet about 18 inches by 23
                                          inches. This sheet was too small for the requirements of
                                          the next decade, but this drawback was only one of the
                                          reasons for the later unpopularity of the press.</p>

                                   <p>Jonas Booth, of New York, the next builder of power presses,
                                          followed soon after Treadwell. His first press was built
                                          in 1822, and, in principle, was much like Treadwell's,
                                          with the exception that it was a "double feeder." One type
                                          form only, was used, and there was a frisket frame at each
                                          end to carry the paper under the platen. The paper was
                                          placed on the exposed frisket at one end of the press,
                                          while the other frisket was under the platen, receiving
                                          the impression. Since the bed, containing the type form,
                                          moved out from under the platen to be inked, it was
                                          reported that the wooden <pb n="004.149"/> frame was not
                                          strong enough to resist the continued stopping and
                                          starting of the heavily loaded bed.</p>

                                   <p>Booth did not obtain a patent until 1829, when the names of
                                          Jonas Booth, Sr., as well as his five sons, appear on the
                                          patent papers. His last presses were probably an
                                          improvement on his early ventures. The bed was stationary,
                                          which was a step in the right direction. Since Booth seems
                                          to disappear from the history of printing presses soon
                                          after this time, we may infer that the competition forced
                                          him out of business. In all, Booth's business was confined
                                          to New York or its vicinity, and it does not appear that
                                          he made many presses.</p>

                                   <p>Both Isaac Adams and Otis Tufts, at one time or another,
                                          assisted in making Treadwell presses in Phineas Dow's
                                          machine shop in Boston. Tufts later established his own
                                          shop and made presses himself. Part of Isaac Adams's work
                                          was to help set up new presses and make them work
                                          properly: he was what is now known as a "trouble shooter."
                                          He saw the disadvantages of the Treadwell press and
                                          thought about correcting them. His brother Seth was a
                                          machinist in Boston, and it was in Seth's shop that Isaac
                                          worked out his ideas for a better press. After obtaining a
                                          patent in 1830, he put his press on the market. It was a
                                          double ended press, with feeders laying on the sheets at
                                          both ends. There was but one form and one platen, but the
                                          form was stationary so that the press did not have to
                                          withstand the shock of the moving bed. Wood was used for
                                          the construction of the main frames. Although in
                                          appearance it was not a great improvement on Treadwell's
                                          or Booth's presses, it was faster and proved its
                                          superiority to the older styles. Adams guaranteed a speed
                                          of 1000 sheets per hour, but two feeders were required at
                                          the press. The original patent model for this press is now
                                          on exhibition at the Smithsonian.</p>

                                   <p>Shortly after, Tufts produced a somewhat similar press, but of
                                          heavier construction and better finish. A few years later
                                          he improved it considerably by discarding the wooden
                                          frames and using iron throughout, at the same time
                                          shortening the length by placing both frisket frames at
                                          the same end of the press. One frisket was placed under
                                          the other, so that when one was moving in, under the
                                          platen, the other was moving out. Two hands, however, <pb
                                                 n="004.150"/> were required for the
                                          feeding&mdash;one man to take off the sheet and the other
                                          to place the unprinted sheet in position.</p>

                                   <p>Tufts's patent on this press was obtained in 1834. Printers
                                          who saw the press in action were most enthusiastic in
                                          their praise, as the machine was excellently constructed
                                          and much smoother in operation than its clumsy
                                          forerunners.</p>

                                   <p>Tufts's success was short-lived, however. A year or two later,
                                          the Adams brothers brought forth their final
                                          attempt&mdash;a press which was to hold its popularity for
                                          the next fifty years, and which was destined to handle all
                                          the best book and magazine work for many decades. The
                                          patent granted to Isaac Adams was dated March 2, 1836.</p>

                                   <p>
                                    <!-- <figure entity="sb041501"/> -->
                                   </p>

                                   <p>The improved press required only one person to feed the
                                          sheets. The delivery was automatic. Adams had worked out a
                                          device for successfully removing the sheets from the type
                                          form and frisket by means of a blower, and a device known
                                          later as a fly. This consisted of a number of long wooden
                                          fingers placed parallel, like a fork with many prongs,
                                          which flapped the printed sheet from the frisket frame
                                          over on to the delivery table.</p>

                                   <p>Although the speed by later standards was slow, from 600 to
                                          900 sheets per hour, the press required a minimum of
                                          attention and did perfect work. This press proved that for
                                          runs of any length, the power press was definitely more
                                          economical than the iron hand press. Harper Brothers, who
                                          used hand presses until 1837, <pb n="004.151"/> were
                                          forced to adopt the Adams press. Theirs was probably the
                                          last large establishment to change over.</p>

                                   <p>In America, the development of the power press had followed
                                          along different lines from those in England. Over there,
                                          the first power press employed a cylinder for the
                                          impression; whereas, here, the early presses were all of
                                          the platen type, involving a flat impression between two
                                          plane surfaces. The cylinder press was faster and required
                                          less power, but unless the machine work was most carefully
                                          done, the quality of its output was inferior. Probably,
                                          England was ahead of this country in the early days of the
                                          last century, in its ability to produce larger and better
                                          machine tools. The cylinders of their presses had to be
                                          very accurately made and geared perfectly to the moving
                                          bed, or a slurred impression would result. Treadwell,
                                          early, had undoubtedly realized that the facilities to
                                          make a satisfactory cylinder press could not be found in
                                          America.</p>

                                   <p>R. Hoe &amp; Co., of New York, who had been making iron hand
                                          presses and other equipment for printers, became
                                          interested in the cylinder press in the late twenties. The
                                          concern sent a man to England to obtain as much
                                          information as possible, with the result that in 1832 they
                                          offered to build cylinder presses for printers in America.
                                          The type they chose to make was similar to the press made
                                          by Napier in England, although the Hoe Company did not
                                          apply the Napier name to their press. However, for a
                                          number of years, all cylinder presses made in this country
                                          were called Napiers.</p>

                                   <p>Hoe, and later other concerns, built a great many cylinder
                                          presses, but before 1860 their use was confined to
                                          newspapers and the cheaper kinds of printing. The cylinder
                                          had the bad habit of wearing down the type rapidly,
                                          particularly the first few lines at the bottom of the
                                          page, where the cylinder first hit the form in its rapid
                                          movement. The register was not good, and it was impossible
                                          to "back up" the work properly; that is, the impression on
                                          the reverse side of a sheet would not fall exactly even
                                          with the impression on the front.</p>

                                   <p>In the early seventies, improved and better-made cylinder
                                          presses appeared, and it was found possible to do a better
                                          grade of work on these presses. Moreover, they grew in
                                          size, whereas, the <pb n="004.152"/> Adams had reached its
                                          maximum practical limit of platen area. Slowly, the
                                          cylinder press became more commonly used for the better
                                          grade of work.</p>

                                   <p>The Hoe Company, which had assumed the leadership in this
                                          country in the manufacture of large presses for fast
                                          newspaper printing, had for some time attempted to make a
                                          press which would compete in quality of work with the
                                          Adams. In the forties, a few large platen presses were
                                          built which infringed certain features of the Adams
                                          patents. A long drawn out controversy ensued, which
                                          resulted in the Hoe people buying out the Adams business
                                          in 1859. Isaac retired to his boyhood home in Sandwich,
                                          Mass., with a considerable fortune, where he died in 1883.
                                          His brother Seth had died in 1873.</p>

                                   <p>The Hoe Company continued the manufacture of the Adams press
                                          until the late eighties, but a smaller number was made
                                          each year. Compared to the more modern cylinders, the
                                          press was too slow, but a few were still in operation in
                                          New York City in the early years of this century.</p>

                                   <p>It has been estimated that over one thousand of the improved
                                          Adams presses were made. For almost fifty years these
                                          presses handled the bulk of the better printing in this
                                          country. The smaller shops of a hundred years ago, doing
                                          book and newspaper work, would have one Adams press. When
                                          such a press was used for newspaper work, it left its
                                          distinguishing mark on the make-up of the page. In order
                                          to lift the sheet from the form after printing, the
                                          frisket frame contained one or more longitudinal wires,
                                          which supported the center of the sheet. As these wires

                                          it was necessary to provide a groove or channel along one
                                          side of a column rule, about one-eighth to
                                          three-sixteenths inch wide, and to cut the same opening
                                          through the head rules and heading. Six-column papers had
                                          one supporting wire and eight-column papers had two. If

                                                 Schwindel,<ref target="f004.10.03" n="3"><hi

                                          pseudonym of Theophilus Sincerus. If Schwindel actually
                                          saw the book, he appears to have been the first and last
                                          person who ever examined such an edition. There is,
                                          however, an exceedingly persuasive suggestion that, in
                                          this case, Schwindel (either consciously or otherwise) was
                                          simply living up to his name. The 1483 edition by Ratdolt
                                          was nevertheless duly noted by Hain, Pollard, Essling,
                                          Diehl and the British Museum's incunabula catalogue;<ref

                                                 >5</hi></ref> Yet it is curious beyond measure that
                                          no copy of this edition has ever been located! Through the
                                          kind offices of Dr. Elisabeth von Kathen, I have recently
                                          been informed that not even the manuscript of the
                                          unprinted sections of the <hi rend="italic">Gesamtkatalog
                                                 der Wiegendrucke</hi> records the existence of a
                                          single example of Ratdolt's 1483 <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Fasciculus temporum</hi>.</p>







                                   <p>If this Schwindel notation were the only evidence for such a
                                          production, one would quite properly set down this edition
                                          as an error (perhaps a misreading by the cataloguer of the
                                          roman date "M.cccc.lxxxiiij" of a known Ratdolt printing).
                                          But, as the BMC duly points out,<ref target="f004.10.06"
                                                 n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> there is a
                                          statement made by Ratdolt himself which postulates an
                                          edition no copy of which has survived to our day. At
                                          present there are four extant editions credited to
                                          Ratdolt: those of 24 November 1480 (Hain 6926), 21
                                          December 1481 (Hain 6928), 28 May 1484 (Hain 6934) and 8
                                          September 1485 (Hain 6935). In the 1484 edition (PML 334,

                                          <q>In these circumstances, since I have undertaken to

                                                 thrice before this I alone have printed in these
                                                 parts of Italy having set figures and images in
                                                 their due order, I have decided to dedicate this
                                                 work and my labors to you.</q> In the following
                                          year, Ratdolt speaks of the 1485 edition as having been
                                          preceded by four earlier printings.<ref
                                                 target="f004.10.09" n="9"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >9</hi></ref></p>





                                   <p>Since this statement was made by the printer himself, one is
                                          certainly required to believe that Ratdolt printed three
                                          editions before that of 1484, though only his editions of
                                          1480 and 1481 are evidenced by actual copies. While this
                                          appears to point directly to a 1483 printing, it is indeed
                                          amazing that, in the past 215 years, no one has seen an
                                          example of such a production. The other Ratdolt editions
                                          may, without exaggeration, be called quite common works,
                                          and some edition by this printer is almost certainly to be
                                          found in even the most modest collection of
                                          fifteenth-century books. Such <pb n="004.157"/> large
                                          European libraries as those in Berlin, Florence, London,

                                          have arrived in Venice about the year 1476, and shortly
                                          afterwards formed a partnership with Bernhard "Maler" (a

                                          and shortly thereafter Maler and Ratdolt dissolved their

                                          Ratdolt's name disappears from our sight until 1 April

                                          appearance in Venice under the sponsorship of yet another

                                          gothic type very similar to one subsequently found in the
                                          hands of Ratdolt (his type 4:76G). The woodcut capitals
                                          used by Walch were not unlikely the identical ones
                                          employed by Ratdolt before 1479 and after the reopening

                                          Walch, as his very first venture, could turn out such a
                                          work without the assistance of outside and experienced
                                          help? Or could we be justified in assuming that Ratdolt
                                          had a hand in this undertaking, as the practical printer;
                                          that his were the labors which actually produced the 1479

                                          Walch's contribution was limited to supplying the text and
                                          the very necessary capital?</p>





                                   <p>This <hi rend="italic">Fasciculus temporum</hi> with its
                                          numerous technical difficulties was obviously produced by
                                          a professional and can hardly have been the trial effort
                                          of a novice.<ref target="f004.10.18" n="18"><hi

                                          printed with equipment certainly forming part of Ratdolt's
                                          stock-in-trade and was taken in hand just about the time
                                          that Ratdolt disappears from our view. To this
                                          investigator anyway, it seems an altogether likely
                                          solution for the conflicting evidence cited above to
                                          assume that Ratdolt was employed by Walch to print the <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Fasciculus temporum</hi> for him,
                                          though he received no credit for his share in the work in
                                          the colophon of the 1479 edition. Perhaps this irked
                                          Ratdolt, though so long as Walch was still in Venice,
                                          Ratdolt made no mention of his part in the production of
                                          this first Italian printing and no statement to that
                                          effect is found in Ratdolt's 1480 and 1481 editions. But
                                          Walch probably left Venice for his homeland some time
                                          after May 1482&mdash;and in his first printing of the <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Fasciculus temporum</hi> subsequent
                                          thereto (28 May 1484), Ratdolt made the claim set forth
                                          above.</p>


                                   <p>Until a copy of the 1483 printing can actually be produced, it
                                          is my belief that one may treat this edition as a "ghost."
                                          The <hi rend="italic">five</hi> editions printed by
                                          Ratdolt can be identified as the four issued on his own
                                          initiative, plus the 1479 printing for which Walch allowed
                                          him no credit. The theory set forth here would completely
                                          set at rest the problems discussed in this study <pb

                                          to the editions now credited to Erhard Ratdolt. It does
                                          not seem essential, to the present writer anyway, to
                                          postulate the existence of a 1483 Venetian <hi

                                                 "Georgius Walch, a German whose name points to
                                                 Italian ancestry, appears to have been connected in
                                                 some way with Ratdolt, but the precise relation is
                                                 obscure. His first recorded book, Rolewinck,
                                                 Fasciculus temporum, belongs to 1479, when Ratdolt
                                                 had severed his connexion with Maler and
                                                 L&ouml;slein but had not yet resumed printing on
                                                 his own account. Its type closely resembles one
                                                 which Ratdolt employed in the following year for an
                                                 edition of the same work evidently modelled on that
                                                 of Walch, while its woodcut capitals are even more
                                                 like those used by Ratdolt both before and after
                                                 this date and may possibly form part of the same
                                                 sets."</p></note>

                                          re&euml;xamining the Jaggard-Pavier quartos of 1619. As
                                          all the world knows, Sir Walter Greg brilliantly proved,

                                          and 1619, had all been printed in the latter year; and the
                                          most persuasive part of his evidence lay in the complex
                                          mixture of watermarks distributed through them.<ref

                                   <p>On this day forty-two years after,<ref target="f004.11.03"
                                                 n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> I was searching
                                          the Huntington set of 1619 quartos for evidence of twin
                                          watermarks, and finding what I sought: most of the marks
                                          pictured by Greg were turning out to be pairs themselves
                                          or members of pairs.<ref target="f004.11.04" n="4"><hi
                                                  rend="super">4</hi></ref> I had also found several
                                          new marks to add to his list of twenty-seven. Thus, while
                                          leafing through the Church copy of <hi rend="italic">Sir
                                                 John Oldcastle</hi> (dated "1600"), I was not much
                                          surprised to note a new pot in sheet F. It was not a
                                          prepossessing fellow, for it looked more like a pot of
                                          1600 than of 1619, having a simple form, apparently little
                                          superstructure, and a malformed base. But in a narrow band
                                          across the throat was an inscription. I could make out
                                          something like a 6, a sort of lopsided u, and what might
                                          be a tall, thinnish X. Puzzled, I moved on, hoping for
                                          another view of this new thing. But I had none.</p>



                                   <p>Half an hour later&mdash;such is the timing of
                                          coincidence&mdash;I stopped similarly in my sidelong
                                          perusal of the Church copy of <hi rend="italic">Henry
                                                 V</hi> (dated "1608")&mdash;again at sheet F. Here
                                          was another pot not in Greg's gallery. This <pb
                                                 n="004.160"/> one looked more like a Norman pot of
                                          about 1620. It had a candle-like top above a number of
                                          lobes, a fleur-de-lis on its chest, the initials PD on its
                                          bowl, and below them certainly&mdash;a date. The figures 1
                                          and 6 were clear enough. Then came a space where only a 1
                                          could go, and of which only a stub remained. And beyond
                                          that a figure that might be a 7 or 9, the top being
                                          slightly obscured by type. The base was also obscured, but
                                          that hardly mattered. The inscription on the bowl
                                          apparently had once read PD/1617 or 1619. This pot
                                          appeared in no other sheet of <hi rend="italic">Henry
                                                 V.</hi> Only at F1.4, with the date on F4.</p>

                                   <p>Breathless, I reopened the <hi rend="italic">Oldcastle</hi>,
                                          at sheet F. The inscription on the pot throat might also
                                          be a date. Indeed, it looked much like one. 1608. The 1
                                          was a heavy mark just inside the left line of the neck.
                                          The 6 was a 6, with a curved top. The u-like form was the
                                          lower part of an o. The X was an 8 with the ends squared
                                          by the lines of the band. As the paper was thickish and
                                          the imprint of the wire-design none too sharp, I regarded
                                          it doubtfully; yet there seemed to be no other way to read
                                          what was on the band. It was no attempt at ornament; and
                                          from the reverse side it made no sense. The top of this
                                          pot (with the date) was in F4, and the base and part of
                                          the bowl in F1. And on the bowl parts of two letters were
                                          visible, deep in the quarto crack. They might be MO or
                                          MJ&mdash;or BM or LM reversed.<ref target="f004.11.05"

                                          added to the mystery of this curious pot.</p>


                                   <p>Briquet when summoned brought forward several analogies of
                                          dated pots, but none with a dated band high on the throat.

                                          offered in his first pot one remarkably similar to the PD

                                          above clustered lobes, a similar fleur-de-lis throat, a
                                          similar PD on the bowl, and below it 16, apparently a year
                                          date with <hi rend="italic">both</hi> final digits
                                          missing. Whether this <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the same
                                          pot with the 7 or 9 lost, or its twin, or a mark from a
                                          related set of moulds I do not know: such are the vagaries
                                          of tracings; and Churchill does not show the position of
                                          the chains. His note merely indicates that he found it in
                                          a sheet (of manuscript?) which he dates 1618.<ref

                                                 >8</hi></ref> This fact may be one reason for
                                          preferring the reading 1617 on the <hi rend="italic">Henry
                                                 V</hi> pot, though at first I preferred 1619. The
                                          sketches I made show a figure with an open top and a
                                          curved back. Let us call it a 7.</p>




                                   <p>If it seems strange to the reader that one or two figures
                                          should drop out of a watermark, he should note that they
                                          must have been formed of tiny <pb n="004.161"/> pieces of
                                          wire and sewed at either end to the band wires across the
                                          belly of the pot. The constant wear on moulds in use and
                                          the brushing at the end of the day tended to distort the
                                          wireforms and even to break off bits of wire. In this
                                          instance it looks very much as if the 1 had come unsewn at
                                          the top and subsequently broken off near the base; and the
                                          final digit may have been distorted into ambiguity. Just
                                          two weeks later, in examining the plates in Raleigh's <hi

                                   <p>Both dated Shakespeare pots are situated mainly between
                                          chains. The 1608 pot fits within a chain-space of 23-24
                                          mm. Its style is that of Heawood 3548-54. Its crest has
                                          five points with a trefoil on the center one and single or
                                          double circlets on the others. The neckband is 6 mm. high
                                          and the date 9 mm. wide. There is not enough of the bowl
                                          to measure; but the misshapen <pb n="004.162"/> base
                                          measures 6[18]0 reading up. The handle is in normal
                                          position, at the left.</p>

                                   <p>The 1617 pot is centered at top 9.5:9.5 between 19 mm. chains.
                                          The leafed shoot above (if that's what it is) is unlike
                                          that in Greg 17 or Heawood 3545, in that it has sprouts
                                          above and leaves farther down. The five lobes that show
                                          resemble those in Greg 6 or Heawood 3565. The handle is to
                                          the right, outside the chain. The bowl with the precious
                                          date measures 1[18:1] up. The base is hard to make out.
                                          The accompanying illustrations of these two pots are mere
                                          rough sketches.<ref target="f004.11.10" n="10"><hi

                                   <p>Friends at the Huntington who viewed these pots generally
                                          conceded the 1617 date: there could be no doubt of it,
                                          except for the ambiguity of the 7 or 9. When shown the
                                          1608 pot Dr. James McManaway shook his head slightly in
                                          puzzlement; while others said it looked more like a date
                                          than anything else. Obviously a further example of this
                                          tantalizing pot had to be found, if possible. And the PD
                                          pot was not yet complete, for its neck was lost in the
                                          quarto fold.</p>

                                   <p>None of the set of nine Pavier quartos at the Huntington
                                          yielded further instances of these pots; and the Library
                                          had disposed of its so-called duplicate of <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Henry V.</hi> So I turned to the
                                          Clark Memorial Library in Los Angeles. Its copies of <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Oldcastle</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Henry V</hi> had only the pots and shields
                                          illustrated by Greg. A month later in Austin I examined
                                          the <hi rend="italic">Oldcastle</hi> of 1619 in the Wren
                                          Collection: it had no dated pots. In September in New York
                                          I saw the Lenox, Morgan, and Rosenbach copies of <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Oldcastle</hi> and the Morgan copy of
                                                 <hi rend="italic">Henry V</hi>; and later in
                                          Chicago the Newberry <hi rend="italic">Henry V</hi>; but
                                          still I found no pots with dates.<ref target="f004.11.11"
                                                 n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> Recently Dr.
                                          Giles Dawson has kindly checked the Folger Shakespeare
                                          Library copies&mdash;an undertaking, for the Folger has
                                          seven copies of each! Yet his patience has produced no
                                          pots of 1608 or 1617, no jugs that resemble my
                                          sketches.</p>


                                   <p>Thus the conviction grows that these are "intrusive"
                                          watermarks. The 1608 mark appears just once in seventeen
                                          copies examined by Greg, Dawson, and myself; and the
                                          PD/1617 mark once in fifteen. According to the
                                          Pollard-Greg theory the 1619 quartos were printed on a
                                          job-lot of miscellaneous papers supplied by a London paper
                                                 merchant.<ref target="f004.11.12" n="12"><hi
                                                  rend="super">12</hi></ref> I have suggested that
                                          such mixtures may have resulted normally from the
                                          manufacture of paper by a cluster of papermills in
                                          Normandy (or elsewhere) and its periodic collection by a
                                          paper factor.<ref target="f004.11.13" n="13"><hi
                                                  rend="super">13</hi></ref> Yet neither hypothesis,
                                          nor both taken together (which may be the better view),
                                          quite explains these rare dated <pb n="004.163"/> pots.
                                          They imply the inclusion of an odd quire or so in the
                                          paper laid out for an edition-sheet. Either the paper
                                          merchant has thrown in the remnant of a ream, or Jaggard
                                          has swept out his stockroom. In laying out paper for the
                                          press, the outside or "cording" quires were commonly put
                                          aside and replaced by good inside quires from other
                                          reams&mdash;or by quires culled from cording quires.<ref
                                                 target="f004.11.14" n="14"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >14</hi></ref> Further, extra quires were needed
                                          for filling out short quires, for proofs, and for
                                          replacement of "naughty" sheets. And sometimes for copies
                                          allowed in part-payment of the printer's work.
                                          Occasionally, no doubt, the warehouse keeper recovered a
                                          quire or two from some odd corner or pile of
                                          waste&mdash;and thus filled out the count for the
                                          press.</p>




                                   <p>If the 1608 date can be accepted, it looks as if we have an
                                          instance of such an odd quire turning up in Jaggard's
                                          stockroom (or his paper merchant's) ten years after it was
                                          sold out of France. This interval is in accord with
                                          delayed uses noted by Briquet.<ref target="f004.11.15"
                                                 n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> If the other
                                          date is 1617, there has been a proper interval after
                                          manufacture; and it may be that Jaggard had used some
                                          reams of this paper in recent books. If the date is 1619,
                                          the year of issue, the small amount used is less likely to
                                          have come from a broken ream; but it might indicate a
                                          mixture of paper from more than one vat in the
                                          papermill&mdash;though then we should find other PD marks
                                          among the Jaggard-Pavier quartos. A 1619 date would have
                                          interesting implications for the time of printing.<ref

                                          Jaggard's books, may ultimately answer the questions posed

                                   <p>The significance of this small Shakespearian discovery is not

                                          years ago. At that time the ways of the New Bibliography
                                          proved difficult for men of the old school; and the
                                          arguments of A. W. Pollard and W. W. Greg from printers'
                                          and papermakers' ornaments, though they look good now,
                                          provoked an amiable controversy of two years'
                                          duration&mdash;which was smothered in 1910 by William J.
                                          Neidig's evidence from photographic measurement of title

                                          joys of creative bibliography, though it might have
                                          convinced with one thwack schoolmasters in the upper
                                          forms. For anyone at all can see that a <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Sir John Oldcastle</hi> dated 1600 on its title
                                          page but apparently containing a 1608 watermark may not
                                          have been printed in 1600; and that a <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Henry V</hi> dated 1608 but certainly watermarked
                                          1617 (or 1619) was definitely not published before the
                                          latter year. Indeed, so elementary a demonstration may be
                                          useful even today, for some boys have not yet been
                                          promoted to the upper forms.</p>


                                   <p>On the other hand, inasmuch as a paper war was waged and in

                                          1950, might well have gone bowling on the smooth Arroyo
                                          Seco greens. The shade of Shakespeare might have been

                                          twenty years, is so comprehensive that supplements to it
                                          are worthy of attention when they come to light. The
                                          purpose of this article is to name two volumes which
                                          supplement the following sections of Professor Babcock's
                                          study: (1) "Primary Texts," 1770-1774, pages 254-255; (2)
                                          "Shakespeare, Original Genius," pages 123-126; and (3)

                                          is a criticism and an appreciation of Shakespeare's
                                          original genius in the invention of incident, character,
                                          and imagery, and in the expression of the sublime, the
                                          pathetic, the wild and picturesque, and the supernatural.
                                          In addition to the seventy-page discussion in Section III,
                                          other comments upon Shakespeare appear in the book (pp.
                                          95, 120, 197, and 365). The comprehensiveness of Duff's
                                          treatment of Shakespeare makes this volume an essential
                                          supplement to Professor Babcock's bibliography. Added
                                          significance of the supplement derives from the fact that

                                          plays. According to Professor Babcock, "The psychological

                                          which was not mentioned by Professor Babcock and not

                                          to the principles of association: "<hi rend="italic"

                                   <p>Although Gerard had read papers on genius and on the

                                          Richardson's philosophical analysis reached the public

                                          study of Shakespeare was the climax to Gerard's study of

                                          much earlier than 1774 Gerard had in fact applied the laws
                                          of association to Shakespeare's work cannot be precisely
                                          determined, for much of his work between 1758 and 1771 had

                                          to Edward Blount on 7 August, 1618. There is no record of
                                          a transfer of the copy to Thomas Walkley, who published
                                          the first quarto in 1619. The dedicatory epistle addressed
                                          to Sir Henry Nevill which appears only in the first quarto
                                          seems to indicate that the quarto had been printed from a
                                          manuscript which the publisher had secured from Nevill.
                                                <ref target="f004.13.01" n="1"><hi rend="super"
                                                  >1</hi></ref> It is therefore possible that the
                                          first quarto was printed from a private transcript without
                                          the permission of the King's Company. The statement on the
                                          title-page of the second edition of 1625 "And now the
                                          second time Printed, according to the true Copie" may
                                          indicate that the first quarto was not from copy which had
                                          been furnished by the company.</p>


                                   <p>The second quarto, containing many prompt notes, seems to have
                                          been printed from the official book which the actors used
                                          in the playhouse. There are not only many added stage
                                          directions in this edition but also many small deletions
                                          and minor alterations in the text. In spite of the fact
                                          that these circumstances would seem to indicate two
                                          different manuscripts used as copy for the two quartos,
                                          there are a number of curious similarities in the printing
                                          of the two editions. These similarities seem to suggest
                                          that the second quarto was printed from a marked copy of
                                          the first. The differences between the two texts suggest,
                                          furthermore, that the copy for the second quarto was the
                                          official playhouse copy with the prompter's notes.</p>

                                   <p>The title-page of the first quarto reads: "A King and no King.
                                          Acted at the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, by his
                                          Maiesties Seruants. Written by Francis Beamount, and Iohn
                                          Flecher." The second quarto substitutes <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >"Blacke-Fryars"</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >"Globe,"</hi> and adds the statement about the
                                          copy. The arrangement of the title-pages is quite
                                          different, but the curious spelling of the authors' names
                                          is repeated in both quartos.</p>

                                   <p>The first quarto type-page measures 91 mm. from margin to
                                          margin. The Q2 page is narrower, measuring 88 mm. from
                                          margin to margin. The type size is the same in both
                                          quartos. The additional stage directions in the second
                                          quarto make it impossible to print that text within fewer
                                          pages <pb n="004.167"/> than the number occupied by the
                                          text of the earlier edition. Although the number of lines
                                          per page is the same, the second quarto, therefore, could
                                          not be a page for page reprint. Moreover, while the size
                                          of type is the same, the lines of the second quarto are 3
                                          mm. shorter, thus making a line for line reprint
                                          difficult. Yet in spite of this difference in space, the
                                          line endings of the prose passages show a startling
                                          correspondence.<ref target="f004.13.02" n="2"><hi
                                                  rend="super">2</hi></ref> The passage at line 66,
                                          Act V, scene i, has the line endings: laming of, for you,
                                          have a leg, like a, of my con-, like a, verie person,
                                          leave you, are much, in both quartos. Since the lines of
                                          the second quarto are a trifle shorter, however, one would
                                          expect the shorter words like <hi rend="italic">of, you,
                                                 leg, a,</hi> to be carried over to the beginning of
                                          the succeeding line, particularly as the last line of the
                                          paragraph is so very short that the compositor could not
                                          have lost a line of space by so doing. Such
                                          correspondences, then, can hardly be accidental.</p>


                                   <p>In some of these prose speeches, the passage at line 96, Act
                                          III, scene iii, and that at line 31, Act V, scene ii, for
                                          example, the compositor of the second quarto, because of
                                          some variation in spelling, found himself with extra space
                                          at his disposal. Instead of filling up the line as usual,
                                          he sometimes spaced out the words so that the line
                                          arrangement of the first quarto is preserved.</p>

                                   <p>At the beginning of the second scene of Act III, Bessus has a
                                          long prose soliloquy. For the first twenty-five lines of
                                          this speech the second quarto faithfully follows the line
                                          arrangement of the first. Then at line 26 a word is lost,
                                          and by line 35 the second quarto is three words behind the
                                          first. In the following line the words "to account" have
                                          been dropped out, apparently by accident, restoring the
                                          line for line correspondence.</p>

                                   <p>Two other passages may link the first two quartos. At the
                                          beginning of scene iv, Act V, five lines of Arbaces'
                                          speech are omitted in Q2. Instead of printing the half
                                          lines marking the beginning and end of the cut in a single
                                          line of type, Q2 prints them as separate lines, an awkward
                                          arrangement which may refer back to a deletion marked on
                                          the printed page of Q1. A second passage seems to contain
                                          an error perpetrated by the printer of the first quarto
                                          which has been only partially corrected in the second
                                          quarto. At line 118, Act I, scene i, the first quarto has: <q>
                                                 <l>But of her eye <hi rend="italic"
                                                  >Tigranes</hi>.</l>
                                                 <l>Is it the course of</l>
                                          </q> The compositor has here omitted the speech head which
                                          ought to indicate a change in speakers. It looks as though
                                          the manuscript perhaps looked like this: <q>
                                                 <l>But of her eye. <hi rend="italic">Tigranes</hi>.
                                                  Is it the course of</l>
                                          </q> and the compositor attached the speech head to the
                                          last line of Arbaces' <pb n="004.168"/> speech. In the
                                          second quarto the missing speech head has been supplied,
                                          making the passage read: <q>
                                                 <l>But of her eye <hi rend="italic"
                                                  >Tigranes</hi>.</l>
                                                 <l><hi rend="italic">Tigr</hi>. Is't the course of
                                                  <hi rend="italic">Iberia</hi> to vse their
                                                  prisoners thus?</l>
                                          </q>
                                   </p>

                                   <p>A number of errors seem to have been carried over from the
                                          first quarto to the second. The word "Souldier" at line
                                          59, Act I, scene i, is singular in the first two quartos;
                                          it has been corrected to the plural form in subsequent
                                          editions. Line 269 in the same scene, which has been
                                          emended to "To talke but idly," is given in Q1 as "to
                                          balke but I desire," in Q2 as "to balke but I defie." The
                                          misreading "balke" for "talke" thus occurs in all the
                                          early quartos. At line 71, Act V, scene iii, Q1 reads
                                          "slaue, my key" which Q2 partly corrects to "slaue my
                                          toe." Subsequent quartos change the "slaue" of the first
                                          two quartos to "hurts."</p>

                                   <p>Still another correspondence between the first two quartos
                                          should perhaps be noted. At the beginning of the second
                                          Act, and at line 45 of the first scene of Act III, the
                                          stage directions of the first quarto are sufficiently long
                                          that it was necessary to carry the directions into a
                                          second line. This second line, in both instances, is not
                                          centered. The second quarto copies this unusual
                                          arrangement.</p>

                                   <p>The first quarto was printed in 88 pages, the text ending on
                                          M2 verso. There are 38 lines to a page with many stage
                                          directions centered to occupy a separate line of type. The
                                          second quarto was printed in 91 pages, the text ending in
                                          the middle of M3 recto. Again there are 38 lines to a
                                          page, but there are more blank lines setting off stage
                                          directions than in the first quarto, so that the line
                                          arrangement of the first quarto looks more crowded.</p>

                                   <p>In the last two gatherings, however, the arrangement of the
                                          second quarto is quite different from that of the first.
                                          Beginning with signature L, the number of lines per page
                                          is reduced from 38 to 36. From this point onward even
                                          brief stage directions are centered to occupy separate
                                          lines, and the blank space above stage directions is
                                          increased in width. What seems to have occurred is this.
                                          The compositor had before him a copy which seemed to
                                          contain more material than the first quarto. The first
                                          edition, however, had been printed with an initial blank
                                          leaf and two final blank leaves, an arrangement which the
                                          Elizabethan printer considered undesirable since it
                                          required as much labor to print one leaf as four. The
                                          compositor of the second quarto, therefore, eliminated the
                                          initial blank leaf by beginning his text on A2 instead of
                                          on A3. The extra material would doubtless go to fill up
                                          the three blank leaves. Throughout most of the work, the
                                          arrangement seemed to be succeeding until, at signature L,
                                          he was printing material which appeared a page and a half
                                          earlier in Q1. At that point, perhaps because a cut of
                                          five lines reduced the material yet to be printed, the
                                          compositor realized that he would still have an
                                          undesirable number of blank leaves at the end. To prevent
                                          this, he reduced the number of lines per <pb n="004.169"/>
                                          page and stretched out his copy as far as possible. By
                                          this procedure, and with the help of an ornamental tail
                                          piece, he gained a leaf and a half, leaving only three
                                          blank pages instead of the six of the first quarto.</p>

                                   <p>Since misspellings and other errors in the first quarto
                                          reappear in the second, it becomes probable that the
                                          latter was printed from the former. The similarities in
                                          typographical arrangement increase the probability. It is
                                          difficult to explain the unexpected divergence of the last
                                          two gatherings if we postulate a manuscript copy for Q2,
                                          but it becomes easier to account for it if the first copy
                                          were used as copy for the second. The conclusion to be
                                          drawn would seem to be that Q2 is a reprint of Q1.</p>

                                   <p>Q2, however, was printed from the "true copie," to all
                                          appearances from the official stage copy. The nature of
                                          the differences between the two texts thus becomes
                                          significant. Except for one cut of five lines already
                                          referred to, the text has not been noticeably altered. No
                                          appreciable additions have been made, and differences in
                                          readings which do appear are alterations of single words
                                          or brief phrases. No change has been made which affects
                                          plot or characterization. In short, no textual addition or
                                          alteration of sufficient interest to warrant collation of
                                          a printed copy of Q1 with a playhouse MS can be found.</p>

                                   <p>The additions which have been made to Q1 consist of marginalia
                                          which seem to be all of a prompt nature. Nearly every
                                          stage direction has been expanded, usually in such a way
                                          as to make the direction more explicit. Thus "Enter
                                          Arbaces and Tigranes, with attendants" becomes "Enter
                                          Arbaces and Tigranes two Kings, &amp;c. The two
                                          Gentlemen.", and "Enter Panth&aelig;a" becomes "Enter
                                          Panth&aelig;a and 1 Gent." Musical directions have been
                                          added. A few exits which had been unmarked in the first
                                          quarto are marked in the second. At least one entrance
                                          direction, "Flourish, Enter one running." on D3<hi
                                                 rend="super">v</hi> appears only in the second
                                          quarto. For the second quarto the exit directions have
                                          been made more explicit so that characters' names are
                                          frequently added to such directions, and group exits are
                                          frequently broken up. One entrance in the first act has
                                          been printed twice so that a warning of three lines is
                                          given. One very interesting direction in the fourth act
                                          has been expanded to indicate setting: "Enter Tigranes in
                                          prison." In two places the technical prompter's note
                                          "Exeunt cleere" appears in the second quarto. This note
                                          also occurs in the prompt manuscript of Heywood's <hi

                                   <p>It seems unlikely that a publisher would deem these notes of
                                          sufficient <pb n="004.170"/> general interest to hire
                                          someone to collate a copy of the quarto with a theatrical
                                          manuscript to secure them. If, however, the publisher had
                                          acquired a copy of the quarto which had been used as
                                          prompt text, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> "the true copie,"
                                          the prompter's notes would be carried over into the
                                          printed page, giving us just such a text as we have in
                                          Q2..</p>

                                   <p>The existence of a copy of the first quarto which had been
                                          used as the official stage copy would seem to indicate
                                          that the King's Men, on some occasions at least, used a
                                          printed copy for the official book. One may conjecture,
                                          however, that the original manuscript was lost, or
                                          destroyed in the Globe fire in 1613, thus necessitating
                                          the use of a private transcript as copy for the first
                                          quarto. The existence of a copy of Q1 with manuscript
                                          playhouse notes which was later used as copy for the
                                          second quarto would imply that there was an unrecorded
                                          revival of the play, possibly at the Blackfriars, between
                                          1619 and 1625.</p>

                                                 >1</hi></ref> which is worth recording because it
                                          can throw some light on the theatrical practice and on the
                                          production methods of the King's Company, and possibly on
                                          the manner in which they revived their plays after the
                                          disastrous fire of 1672 had destroyed their stock of
                                          scenery, costumes, and, presumably, acting scripts.</p>


                                   <p>The prompt copy consists of a normal quarto of the second
                                          edition of <hi rend="italic">Tyrannic Love</hi> (1672),
                                          and it is my assumption that this particular quarto
                                          represents the prompt book for the King's Company, which
                                          would have had to prepare a new one after the destruction
                                          of their entire properties by the fire on January 25,
                                          1671/2. Dryden had revised this second edition by adding
                                          thirty-nine lines and reviewing the whole.<ref
                                                 target="f004.14.02" n="2"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >2</hi></ref> Unless the 1672 edition were chosen
                                          simply because it was most readily available, its use as a
                                          prompt copy may imply that an effort was made by someone
                                          who knew his business to secure the best text. The Folger
                                          quarto has been bound in boards and is generally in good
                                          condition. The lower quarter of leaf A4 has been cut away,
                                          but the Prologue and the Cast of Characters, which appear
                                          on this leaf, are intact. On several pages a few letters,
                                          and on one page a few words, of the manuscript notations
                                          have been cut away by the binder.</p>

                                   <p>Three hands appear in the volume. Hand A, written in ink which

                                          character of the notations, which are more extensive than
                                          any others in the volume, reveals him to be an educated
                                          man, probably not connected with the theatre. His
                                          notations consist of poetic scraps, both in English and in
                                          Latin, and a few lines and speeches copied from the text.
                                          Hand B, written in a faded brown ink, is immature and
                                          sprawling; apparently the writer was using the book as a
                                          model from which to practice writing. Hand C, written in
                                          ink which is still very black, is an old-fashioned,
                                          seventeenth-century hand, clearly belonging to the
                                          prompter or stage manager. From the markings in Hand C,
                                          the only ones worth recording, we can get a fairly good
                                          notion of how <hi rend="italic">Tyrannic Love</hi> was
                                          produced after 1672.</p>

                                   <p>The stage direction of the opening scene is a curious one in
                                          the printed text, for it reads "<hi rend="italic">A Camp
                                                 or Pavillion Royal</hi>," as though Dryden had left
                                          the actual setting up to the producers. It is clear that
                                          the latter alternative was used, for C's notes specify
                                          that "Staires" and a "Greate Dore" shall be used in this
                                          scene. At the opening appears the manuscript notation "The
                                          Curten drawes &amp; Discovers,"<ref target="f004.14.03"
                                                 n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> followed by the
                                          stage direction as printed. The play thus opened to a
                                          crowded stage with some representation of a Pavillion
                                          Royal. The impending entry of the army at the line, "And
                                          this way travels, shews some Army near," is heralded by a
                                          "Flourish very short." Albinus' exit at the next line is
                                          "to y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Staires," and his reentry is
                                          marked "Flourish agen" (p. 4 [338]). A Flourish follows at
                                          Charinus' speech, "I am not for a slothful envy born/I'll
                                          do't this day, in dire Visions scorn." Another occurs at
                                          Porphyrius' entry attended, "Flourish agen at y<hi
                                                 rend="super">e</hi> Greate Dore" (p. 5 [338]).</p>


                                   <p>After the tribute to Porphyrius and the beginning of the
                                          complicated love intrigue, the printed stage direction
                                          calls for a dead march within. This is amended by the
                                          prompter to read "Dead March at Greate Dore," and Albinus'
                                          entry, presumably through the "Greate Dore," is marked by
                                          "Agen Dead March" (p. 6 [340]). The remainder of the act
                                          contains no further entries in Hand C except for the
                                          notation "Call y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Musique" at the
                                          end of the act.</p>

                                   <p>Act II shows no mark of the stage manager's notations except
                                          for the word "Musique," written before the printed
                                          direction "Exit" at the end of the act.</p>

                                   <p>Act III returns to the Pavillion Royal where we have the great
                                          door and the stairs, but again the only notation is
                                          "Musique" at the end of the act.</p>

                                   <p>In Act IV the setting is the Indian Cave. According to C, it
                                          is represented <pb n="004.172"/> by "The bl[ack]
                                                 Curten,"<ref target="f004.14.04" n="4"><hi
                                                  rend="super">4</hi></ref> and an attempt is
                                          apparently made to bring off some of the mysterious
                                          quality by sound effects, as we find the note "Call y<hi
                                                 rend="super">e</hi> Thund[er]" written in at
                                          Placidus' statement, "Remember you oblige an Emperour."
                                          Four lines further down appears "After y<hi rend="super"
                                                 >e</hi> Thunder ca[ll] for y<hi rend="super">e</hi>
                                          Song" (p. 29 [360]). The song must be one of those used to
                                          tempt St. Catharine to the ways of love, as at least one
                                          of the three songs is necessary for the plot, but all the
                                          songs have been marked out, together with the rest of the
                                          Elysium scene. The omissions are marked by vertical lines
                                          and by the manuscript note, "The rest is left out." This
                                          notation appears opposite the printed line, "Fram'd all of
                                          purest Atoms of the Air." The scribbled word "Exeunt"
                                          shows that the stage was cleared for some abridged version
                                          of the temptation scene.<ref target="f004.14.05" n="5"><hi
                                                  rend="super">5</hi></ref> At the end of the cut
                                          appears a long entry in Hand C, part of which has fallen
                                          victim to the binder's shears, but which can be
                                          tentatively reconstructed as "Before Placid [enters shut
                                          ???? y<hi rend="super">e</hi>]/Black &amp; sett up y<hi

                                                 n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> What has
                                          happened here is by no means clear. The omitted scene is
                                          one in which St. Catharine is tempted by the infernal
                                          spirits and saved from weakening by her guardian angel.
                                          Yet it is clear from the call for the song, and from
                                          Placidus' line, "How doubtfully these Specters Fate
                                          fortell," which C has marked "Enter Placid," that some
                                          kind of representation of the temptation scene was
                                          presented. It seems likely that it was played against a
                                          drop of some color other than black, which then closed
                                          down for the remainder of the scene in the Indian Cave.
                                          The note to set up the state was, I feel, a direction that
                                          the state was to be prepared behind the black curtain,
                                          during the progress of the remainder of Act IV, in
                                          preparation for Act V.</p>




                                   <p>The scene which has been cut here is, curiously enough, one
                                          about which we know a good deal. The original scene
                                          picture-drop had been the subject of litigation between
                                          the King's Company and one Isaac Fuller, a painter, who
                                          had been commissioned to prepare a scene of "Elysium" for
                                          the original production of <hi rend="italic">Tyrannic
                                                 Love</hi> in 1669. In final settlement with him,
                                          the company had been forced to pay him the sum of
                                          &pound;335 10s.<ref target="f004.14.07" n="7"><hi
                                                  rend="super">7</hi></ref> After the destruction by
                                          fire of the Theatre Royal in Bridges Street on January 25,
                                          1671/2, the King's Company lost almost all their stock of
                                          scenery and costumes, and the company was in shaky
                                          financial condition. In fact, the losses from this fire
                                          eventually caused them to be swallowed up by the Duke's
                                          Company in the so-called Union in 1682. It would seem
                                          highly <pb n="004.173"/> likely that, after the fire, the
                                          company would restage a play which had been as popular as
                                                 <hi rend="italic">Tyrannic Love,</hi>

                                                 >8</hi></ref> but it seems equally unlikely that
                                          they would again expend a large sum of money for a scene
                                          which at best was brief on the stage and which could not
                                          conceivably be used for any other play. On this basis, the
                                          probability is strong that the Folger prompt copy
                                          represents the manner of presentation of the play after
                                          the fire, and that it was prepared as a substitute for the
                                          manuscript or original prompt copy which had doubtless
                                          perished in the flames.<ref target="f004.14.09" n="9"><hi

                                   <p>Although Act IV contains no further entries except for the
                                          customary "Musique," Act V has another point of interest.
                                          It opens with the notation "Draw y<hi rend="super">e</hi>

                                          Another note on the same page states, "<hi rend="italic"
                                                 >U</hi> y<hi rend="super">e</hi>

                                          48 [376]). Letters in italics have been crossed out). This
                                          chair is probably for Maximin to occupy during the
                                          execution spectacle. On the death of Valerius, after
                                          Maximin "Spurns the body," according to the printed stage
                                          direction, appears the manuscript notation, "Caryded off"
                                          (p. 59 [387]), a necessary direction, as the scene
                                          immediately opens to disclose the spectacle of Berenice on
                                          the scaffold. In this scene there is one important
                                          manuscript stage-direction which moves the entry of
                                          Valeria up eighteen lines so that she enters on the cue,
                                          "But yet remember me when you are dead." This early entry
                                          has much to recommend it, for it enables Valeria, who is
                                          in love with Porphyrius, to overhear him and Berenice
                                          exchanging their vows of eternal love on the scaffold. At
                                          no other point in the play has Valeria discovered the
                                          identity of her rival for Porphyrius, yet after she has
                                          stabbed herself, she says, thinking she sees Porphyrius,
                                          who has left the stage, "Is <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Berenice</hi> still more fair than I?" Berenice
                                          and Porphyrius have been reassuring each other that they
                                          will meet in Heaven, and if Valeria has not overheard
                                          this, then her desire to "sigh her Soul into her Lover's
                                          Eyes" has less meaning than if it is interpreted as a
                                          desire to be in heaven first to beat Berenice there. This
                                          early entry, then, has considerable textual weight, and is
                                          the last significant notation of C, since the only other
                                          entry of his is "Musique" at the end of the play, but
                                          before the Epilogue.</p>

                                   <p>After the death of Betterton, <hi rend="italic">Tyrannic
                                                 Love</hi> seems to have been dropped from the
                                          repertory, and the prompt copy may have passed into the
                                          possession of A. This would seem to be the natural line of
                                          descent, as A <pb n="004.174"/> was still enough
                                          interested in the play to fill the volume with notes and
                                          poetic comments. At some subsequent time B had access to
                                          the volume and completed the marking.</p>

                                   <p>Although the prompter's notations are not so numerous as we
                                          might wish, two significant changes were made: the cutting
                                          of the Elysium scene, and the early entry of Valeria in
                                          Act V. This copy, then, is of some importance for an
                                          editor or student of this play.</p>

                                                 additions had actually been made in at least one

                                                 fairly certain. The four question marks indicate a
                                                 gap before the tail of the "y" which leaves room
                                                 for a word of about four letters of which no trace
                                                 remains. The word "down" might be suggested to fill
                                                 the gap, but I have so little confidence in it that
                                                 I have not ventured to place it in the

                                                 pointed out in his claim that the play had run for
                                                 fourteen days at about a hundred pounds a day
                                                 income, while, he continues, the normal income from
                                                 a play was forty or fifty pounds a performance. See

                                          <p>The evidence presented does not preclude the
                                                 possibility that this prompt copy was made for a
                                                 production in the provinces, but even if this were
                                                 the case, it is likely that any production of the
                                                 play after 1672 must necessarily be something like
                                                 that represented by the markings in the Folger
                                                 copy, and on the basis of this cutting, a
                                                 reasonable idea can be gained of the manner of
                                                 production of the play in London from the time of
                                                 the fire until the death of Betterton.</p></note>

                                          "Adorn'd" and on D4 the catchword is "Thy". In the other
                                          setting, identified as (&sect;), the direction on B1 ends
                                                 "<hi rend="italic">Battel where-</hi>" and B2 is

                                          "Express'd" and "bread"; on D1 the catchword is,
                                          correctly, "Let" and on D4, incorrectly, "They".</p>

                                   <p>The central problem, since it is a matter of prime textual
                                          importance, is to determine the order of setting and
                                          printing these variant sheets: because one is a straight
                                          reprint of the other, only that setting made directly from
                                          the manuscript can have authority. Ordinarily, in an
                                          examination of this sort, one seeks to determine priority
                                          by analytical bibliography, which, if one is fortunate,
                                          may decide the issue on the laws of mechanical evidence
                                          without calling on the less demonstrable inferences of
                                          textual criticism based on the variant readings.<ref

                                          salient features, conforms so strongly to a certain
                                          well-established pattern of printing that an assumption
                                          can be made about priority on this evidence alone.
                                          However, the case is not an open and shut one, for there
                                          remain some difficulties, and at least two alternative
                                          hypotheses can be <pb n="004.175"/> evolved to fit the
                                          facts. As a consequence, it will be more appropriate to
                                          survey the textual evidence first to see whether its
                                          findings will coincide with what seems to be the preferred
                                          bibliographical explanation.</p>


                                   <p>Textual evidence is of two varieties. The first is concerned
                                          with the relative "goodness" or "badness" of the readings
                                          in an attempt to demonstrate that one version of a text is
                                          more correct than another. The second, with less concern
                                          for correctness, tries to determine whether one set of
                                          variants would evolve more naturally from the other than
                                          in the reverse direction. Taking only the substantive
                                          variants between these three sheets, we see that of the
                                          total of nine, a more correct reading is found six times
                                          in (*) against three times in (&sect;). When these are
                                          viewed more narrowly, however, it is apparent that there
                                          is a real difference between the kinds of faults
                                          corrected. Thus (&sect;) properly corrects the simple
                                          misprint of "Doys" to "Days" (B1<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
                                          l. 38), "no" to "not" (B4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, l. 31),
                                          and "thy" to "the" (C1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, l. 12); but
                                          when serious variants occur, such as the dropping in
                                          (&sect;) of "to" in "to <hi rend="italic">Cyrus</hi>" (B2,
                                          l. 15), and the omission of "Was" in "Was <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Hystaspes</hi>" (B4<hi rend="super"
                                                 >v</hi>, l. 29), it is (*) which is always the
                                          correct text, in addition to such variants as the correct
                                          "adorn" (B1, l. 44) in (*) against the "adore" of (&sect;)
                                          or the correct "all my" against "my all" (D2<hi
                                                 rend="super">v</hi>, l. 29). In the matter of
                                          substantive readings there is little question that
                                          (&sect;) is a comparatively degenerate text, and this
                                          deterioration (an almost invariable accompaniment of
                                          reprints) is customarily taken by textual critics as proof
                                          of later typesetting.</p>

                                   <p>The degree of correctness in the accidentals of a text is less
                                          good evidence, for in reprints one may often find
                                          substantive degeneration accompanied by somewhat superior
                                          punctuation, usually in a fuller system. For the record,
                                          however, it may be stated that of the fourteen clear cases
                                          where there can be no question of superiority in the
                                          punctuation by Restoration standards, (*) is the more
                                          correct eleven times, and (&sect;) only three. Of five
                                          cases of elision for metrical reasons against non-elision,
                                          (*) is correct in all.</p>

                                   <p>This evidence for the priority of (*) conforms to our general
                                          experience with texts, but it comes far short of actual
                                          demonstration, since the argument is always plausible that
                                          the earlier setting was particularly careless and has been
                                          corrected in the later. And, in fact, so far as one can
                                          determine from the readings, there is only one (&sect;)
                                          variant&mdash;the omission of "Was" in "Was <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Hystaspes</hi>" (B4<hi rend="super"
                                                 >v</hi>, l. 29) &mdash;which would be really
                                          difficult for a compositor to mend if (*) were, instead,
                                          the later setting.</p>

                                   <p>Other evidence may be adduced, however. For example, on D2<hi
                                                 rend="super">v</hi> the catchword in (*) is "Have"
                                          but in (&sect;) it is correctly "<hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Cyr.</hi>" for the first words on D3 which are
                                                 "<hi rend="italic">Cyr.</hi> Have. . . ." The
                                          setting of a catchword omitting a speech-heading is a not
                                          uncommon characteristic of dramatic texts set from
                                          manuscript but I have not observed it in reprints, in
                                          which a compositor may check on the correctness of a
                                          catchword but seldom alters it in favor of an incorrect
                                          one. Somewhat similar is the incorrect catchword "Adorn'd"
                                          on D1 of (*), which is right for the first word of the <hi
                                                 rend="italic">second</hi>
                                          <pb n="004.176"/> line on D1<hi rend="super">v</hi> but is
                                          properly changed to "Let", the first word of the <hi
                                                 rend="italic">first</hi> line, in (&sect;). Again,
                                          this is an error found in texts set from manuscript, in
                                          which it may probably be assigned to wrong marking of the
                                          stopping point, or to a skip of the eye, but it is not
                                          characteristic of reprints.<ref target="f004.15.02" n="2"
                                                  ><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>


                                   <p>Finally, certain inferences may be drawn from the variant
                                          spellings in the two settings of the sheets, but this can
                                          be applied only in connection with the interpretation of
                                          the bibliographical evidence, and will thus appear
                                          later.</p>

                                   <p>When we move to the bibliographical evidence for the printing
                                          of this book, the following facts appear. <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Cyrus</hi> is a quarto, collating
                                                 A-H<hi rend="super">4</hi> I<hi rend="super"
                                          >2</hi>, the preliminaries occupying sheet A and the text
                                          beginning with a head-title on B1. The text concludes on
                                          I1, followed by an epilogue on I1<hi rend="super">v</hi>
                                          and I2, and advertisements on I2<hi rend="super">v</hi>.
                                          Although there is no break in the text, clear differences
                                          occur in the printing of sheets B-E (including both
                                          settings of B-D) and of sheets F-I. Most prominent is the
                                          fact that though the font of type remains the same, and
                                          the vertical measurements of the type-page are almost
                                          identical, the printer's measure (<hi rend="italic">i.
                                                 e.</hi>, the length of the printer's composing
                                          stick as evidenced by the measurement of a full line of
                                          type) switches from 119 mm. in B-E (including both
                                          settings of B-D) to 123 mm. in F-I. Also, sheet A is set
                                          to this 123 mm. measure. To complete the evidence that
                                          different skeleton-formes were used for the two sections,
                                          this alteration in the typographical layout is accompanied
                                          by different settings of the running-titles in each
                                          part.</p>

                                   <p>Sheet E, then, is the only sheet which was not reset in the
                                          first section composed with the 119 mm. stick, and this
                                          fact becomes of considerable importance. In the (*)
                                          setting of B-D, each sheet was printed with two
                                          skeleton-formes, one for the inner and a different one for
                                          the outer forme; on the evidence of the running-titles,
                                          these two skeleton-formes were also employed to impose the
                                          type-pages of the respective formes of sheet E, thus
                                          establishing a firm link between the printing of invariant
                                          sheet E and the (*) sheets of B-D. In setting (&sect;), on
                                          the contrary, a completely different group of
                                          running-titles is found, not elsewhere repeated in the
                                          book. This group is found in only one skeleton-forme,
                                          however, which was used to impose both the inner and outer
                                          formes of B-D. The running-titles of F-H are in different
                                          settings, and of a different font, from any in either
                                          setting of B-D and of course from E. The group used in the
                                          skeleton for inner F also printed outer G, and that for
                                          outer F appears again in inner H. Inner G and outer H were
                                          each printed from skeleton formes differing from each <pb
                                                 n="004.177"/> other as well as from those in the
                                          rest of the book. The single running-title in half-sheet
                                          I, that on I1, does not seem to be found elsewhere either.
                                          The same typesetting of the words "Cyrus the Great" found
                                          in the head-title on sig. B1 of setting (*) &mdash;but
                                          differing in (&sect;) &mdash;appears as the first line of
                                          type on the title-page on A1. Finally, of the eighteen
                                          copies of this book I have examined to date, six contain
                                          the (*) B-D sheets, and twelve the (&sect;) setting.</p>

                                   <p>If we were acquainted with this book only in the (*) state,
                                          there would be little hesitation in interpreting the
                                          evidence as indicating a book in which the manuscript was
                                          halved and the two parts B-E and F-I plus A were
                                          simultaneously set and printed on two presses. This was a
                                          common way of printing Restoration plays, the division of
                                          pages is nearly equal, and point by point the facts
                                          correspond to the pattern for such printing established in
                                          other books.<ref target="f004.15.03" n="3"><hi
                                                  rend="super">3</hi></ref> The evidence of this
                                          printing is in all essentials so strong that it must, I
                                          think, be taken as the basis for any plausible hypothesis
                                          about the book. If we accept it, at least for the moment,
                                          then under any normal conditions the use of the same
                                          skeleton-formes in sheet E in the same positions as in (*)
                                          B-D would indicate seriatim printing and thus that the (*)
                                          setting is the original one.</p>


                                   <p>This was the tentative conclusion of the textual evidence, and
                                          it may be strengthened by the spelling, which demonstrates
                                          that the compositor of (*) B-D also set sheet E. The
                                          strongest single piece of evidence to this effect is the
                                          spelling "Battels" which occurs three times in (*) B-D and
                                          once in l. 8 of E2<hi rend="super">v</hi>. Interestingly,
                                          we find that the (&sect;) compositor followed the
                                          "Battels" form in its first appearance in the
                                          stage-direction on B1, but in the other occurrences spells
                                          it "Battles." He would not, therefore, seem to be the
                                          compositor of E2<hi rend="super">v</hi>. Correspondingly,
                                          we find that the single occurrence of the word "sence" in
                                          l.3 of D2<hi rend="super">v</hi> is matched in spelling by
                                          "Sence" in line 23 of E3<hi rend="super">v</hi> although
                                          the (&sect;) compositor changed the D2<hi rend="super"
                                                 >v</hi> spelling to "sense." There is probably a
                                          parallel here to the spelling in l.12 of B1 in (*) as
                                          "ascent" but in (&sect;) as "assent." In B1, B2 (twice),
                                          and C4<hi rend="super">v</hi> we find the (*) spelling
                                          "o'er" which also appears on E2, E3, E3<hi rend="super"
                                                 >v</hi>, E4, and E4<hi rend="super">v</hi>. In the
                                          four occurrences noted in B and C, the (&sect;) compositor
                                          changed the spelling to "o're," although he followed
                                          "o'er" under the influence of his copy once on B3<hi
                                                 rend="super">v</hi> and once on D3. I can make
                                          nothing of the differences in capitalization habits
                                          between the two compositors, but it is worth mention that
                                          such characteristic spellings as <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >disclous'd, Genious</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >uncontroull'd</hi> from (&sect;) where (*) is
                                          conventional, find no place in sheet E. Against this
                                          cumulatively invariable evidence that E was set by the
                                          compositor of (*) B-D, the one scrap of negative evidence
                                          is the spelling <hi rend="italic">Stroak</hi> on E3<hi
                                                 rend="super">v</hi> matching up with <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Shoar</hi> on (&sect;) B2 as against
                                                 <hi rend="italic">Shore</hi> in (*).</p>

                                   <p>So far it would seem that the building of the hypothesis has
                                          followed Sir Walter Greg's (and Whitehead's) advice to
                                          "seek simplicity." The book <pb n="004.178"/> conforms to
                                          the standard patterns for two-section simultaneous
                                          printing. Under such conditions, the evidence of the
                                          running-titles and of the spelling characteristics
                                          indicates that sheet E not only was set by the compositor
                                          of (*) B-D but also followed these sheets on the press,
                                          and is, therefore, the original and only authoritative
                                          setting. All that remains is to evolve a satisfactory
                                          theory to account for the resetting of B-D. Here the
                                          pertinence of Greg's full quotation, "Seek simplicity, and
                                          then distrust it," becomes apparent, for no thoroughly
                                          satisfactory theory occurs to me. There are two standard
                                          reasons for such resetting: (1) short printing of the
                                          original sheets either as a result of a miscalculation or
                                          of a decision to enlarge the edition after a certain
                                          number of gatherings had already been machined; (2) an
                                          accident happening to the sheets.</p>

                                   <p>There are various reasons for being distrustful of the first.
                                          If we take it that short printing of B-D occurred by a
                                          miscalculation, we are faced with the uncomfortable
                                          situation of imagining that in a book simultaneously
                                          composed and printed on two presses in the same shop,<ref
                                                 target="f004.15.04" n="4"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >4</hi></ref> a major misunderstanding about the
                                          size of the edition-sheet could go undetected for several
                                          days although the paper was being brought out from the
                                          warehouse and given to each press and the printed sheets
                                          taken away to be dried. Moreover, the number of preserved
                                          copies does not encourage this theory. It is very odd
                                          indeed that of the eighteen I have seen, the proportion
                                          has been two to one in favor of what seems to be the later
                                          setting. With all allowances for the operations of chance,
                                          it would seem that at a minimum the supplementary printing
                                          would need to have been larger than the original, and this
                                          would have meant a remarkably small edition-sheet for the
                                          miscalculating press.</p>


                                   <p>Finally, we should need to assume that sheet E was machined to
                                          the full number of sheets. If so, then the point at which
                                          the change in estimate was made becomes of crucial
                                          importance, for it is a very curious fact that no standing
                                          type appears in reset sheet D. For example, if the error
                                          was discovered during the printing of the first forme of E
                                          to go on the press, it is not very likely that there would
                                          have been time to distribute the type from both formes of
                                                 D.<ref target="f004.15.05" n="5"><hi rend="super"
                                                  >5</hi></ref> If the decision was not made until
                                          sheet E was perfecting, it must have been very early, for
                                          neither forme of E shows any signs of having been
                                          unlocked. Under these circumstances, the first forme would
                                          not have been broken into but would have been held intact
                                          to perfect the additional white paper printed by what had
                                          been the perfecting forme. This is <pb n="004.179"/>
                                          possible, of course, but it still assumes a rapid though
                                          not incredibly expeditious distribution of all of sheet D.
                                          Nevertheless, if it occurred, we may legitimately enquire
                                          why the skeletons of E were not used to impose reset B-D,
                                          for we should expect that the additional sheets of B-D
                                          would be printed immediately. On the other hand, if the
                                          error was discovered early in printing the first forme, we
                                          could believe that the initial forme of B could be quickly
                                          set by casting off copy and would be ready for the press
                                          before any skeleton of E could be released. This theory
                                          would explain the new skeleton, but it does not explain
                                          why none of the type of D was left standing if the change
                                          was made so early. However, one forme of B might still be
                                          set if the decision were made early in the perfecting, so
                                          that even the perfecting skeleton might not be available
                                          when reset B was prepared for its press. Still, it is odd
                                          that&mdash;on the evidence of the spelling&mdash;a new
                                          compositor was assigned for the (&sect;) setting of B-D,
                                          although the original compositor should have been free. In
                                          my opinion the lack of standing type remaining from D, the
                                          construction of a new skeleton-forme for the reset
                                          printing, and the change in compositors all combine to
                                          argue against the immediate printing of reset B-D. It is
                                          true that a delay in this printing, though abnormal, would
                                          not destroy the theory of short printing, but a delay is
                                          better explained by some other hypothesis. To complete the
                                          arguments, one should mention that it is very odd to find
                                          two skeleton-formes employed in setting (*) if the
                                          original edition-sheet was as small as it would need to
                                          have been. On the evidence of the spelling, only one
                                          compositor set (*) B-D, but with about half a normal
                                          edition-sheet, he could not have kept up with the press
                                          and therefore would not have imposed with two
                                                 skeleton-formes.<ref target="f004.15.06" n="6"><hi

                                   <p>The same arguments operate with even added force against a
                                          hypothesis that a decision was made to enlarge the
                                          edition-sheet sometime during the printing of E, for in
                                          such a case there would have been every incentive to
                                          machine reset B-D immediately, and to save as much
                                          standing type from D as possible. In addition, there is
                                          the uncomfortable matter of the proportion of the
                                          preserved copies. But the really crushing argument against
                                          this theory is that it will not conform to the hypothesis
                                          of two-section simultaneous printing, for by the time E
                                          was printed, the workmen assigned to F-I and A must have
                                          finished their job, or been fairly close to the end.<ref

                                                 >7</hi></ref> On the evidence, a sufficient number
                                          of sheets was printed for all of the second section.</p>


                                   <p>The alternative, an accident to a large number of sheets of
                                          B-D, fits the <pb n="004.180"/> case perfectly for a delay
                                          between the printing of sheet E and the reset sheets,
                                          since it allows for D to be distributed as well as the
                                          skeletons of E, and for a different compositor to appear
                                          on the scene. Moreover, there need be nothing odd about
                                          the proportion of copies preserved. The one really
                                          disturbing matter is its vagueness. What kind of an
                                          accident <hi rend="italic">could</hi> affect what seems to
                                          have been an equal number of sheets<ref

                                          not affect the fourth? Moreover, this accident would need
                                          to have occurred after sheet E was printed, but before all
                                          the sheets were folded and collated for delivery to the
                                          publisher.<ref target="f004.15.09" n="9"><hi rend="super"
                                                  >9</hi></ref> No satisfactory explanation occurs
                                          to me save to conjecture that originally only about a
                                          third of the edition, represented by the (*) setting, was
                                          collated for binding in order to satisfy the initial
                                          demand, the remainder being stored packaged by sheets. If,
                                          before these sheets were opened and gathered, an accident
                                          happened to the packages containing B, C and D, they would
                                          need to be reset, and we should find the consistent copies
                                          exemplified by the eighteen examined, with three sheets
                                          either in the (*) or the (&sect;) setting.</p>



                                   <p>It seems necessary, therefore, even at the risk of unduly
                                          extending this examination, to survey as briefly as
                                          possible other theories which might fit the facts to see
                                          if any other is preferable.</p>

                                   <p>If we adhere to the initial hypothesis for two-section
                                          simultaneous printing, then it would seem impossible to
                                          reverse the order of the settings of B-D, even though the
                                          proportion of copies I have seen suits (&sect;) as the
                                          original better than (*). Until sheet E is printed, the
                                          book cannot be bound. If we suppose that the resetting (*)
                                          was not decided on until E was at press, we cannot explain
                                          the construction of new skeleton-formes for E which are
                                          thereupon used in the resetting. Moreover, there is the
                                          fairly clear fact that E was set by the compositor of (*)
                                          and not of (&sect;). Since any tortuous explanation of the
                                          use of the skeleton-formes must necessarily involve the
                                          immediate resetting of B-D, we cannot explain why no
                                          standing type from D was preserved. Finally, we cannot
                                          escape these various objections by supposing that the
                                          decision to enlarge or to overprint was made while D was
                                          on the press. In such a case there would have been an
                                          over-run of at least one forme of D, and preservation of
                                          standing type. Also, if D were on the press, the
                                          compositor would necessarily have already set some of E,
                                          but on the spelling evidence he did not.<ref
                                                 target="f004.15.10" n="10"><hi rend="super"

                                   <p>It will be clear that the original hypothesis advanced must
                                          hold (whatever the explanation) provided we continue to
                                          accept the interpretation <pb n="004.181"/> of the
                                          evidence that the book was simultaneously set and printed
                                          in two sections. It is legitimate to enquire, therefore,
                                          whether a reasonable alternative can be adduced. In fact,
                                          a somewhat plausible set of inferences, of a quite
                                          different cast, can be contrived involving seriatim
                                          typesetting for the whole, at least as the original
                                          plan.</p>

                                   <p>For example, if a decision were made to enlarge the size of
                                          the edition while sheet E was on the press, two-section
                                          printing might have been introduced at this point
                                          consequent upon the necessity to reprint B-D. If this were
                                          so, we should have a situation differing materially from
                                          the first hypothesis. Since the book would not have been
                                          planned from the start as a two-section job, sheets F-I
                                          would not have been printed simultaneously with the first
                                          setting of B-D but, instead, at the same time as the
                                          second setting. In this manner the facts of two-section
                                          printing would be reconciled with the theory of an
                                          enlarged edition, a theory which must be rejected if
                                          two-section printing had been planned from the start.
                                          There is much that is attractive about this hypothesis.
                                          The use of two or more presses in the second section is
                                          explained by the necessity to print four and a half full
                                          sheets while a single press is reprinting three sheets in
                                          smaller quantities. This hypothesis can be maintained,
                                          however, only if we discard the theory that press I (for
                                          the first section) printed (&sect;) B after completing the
                                          last forme of E, for otherwise the compositor would have
                                          used the first wrought-off skeleton from E for his
                                          imposition. If, therefore, (&sect;) B did not follow E,
                                          the alternative is that E (at least as a whole) did not
                                          follow (*) D on the press.<ref target="f004.15.11" n="11"
                                                  ><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> The hypothesis,
                                          then, must be altered to place the decision to enlarge the
                                          edition late in the machining of the second forme of D. By
                                          this time the compositor should have set up to E4 and
                                          possibly even E4<hi rend="super">v</hi>. If, thereupon,
                                          before press I had finished machining (*) D, its
                                          compositor began the resetting which resulted in (&sect;)
                                          B, it would have been possible for press I to have printed
                                          the first forme of E in order to keep busy and then to
                                          have swung over to (&sect;) B, leaving the perfecting of E
                                          to press II or III while its compositors were setting F
                                          and G. The timing would apparently be right for such a
                                          schedule, and the construction of a new skeleton for the
                                          B-D resetting would be explained, together with the
                                          absence of compositor I's setting in F. That F-I did not
                                          thereupon employ the skeletonformes of E would doubtless
                                          result from their changed measure which would have
                                          necessitated the cutting of new furniture reglets.</p>


                                   <p>The prime difficulty in accepting this theory is the fact that
                                          no standing type from (*) D was preserved, although it
                                          would have been available, to save time and money in
                                          printing reset (&sect;) D. This is so inexplicable,
                                          indeed, that it should cause us to be more than ordinarily
                                          suspicious, the <pb n="004.182"/> more especially since it
                                          explains on largely fortuitous grounds the equal division
                                          of a book between two or more presses, which we are
                                          accustomed to view as the result of the simultaneous
                                          printing of the two sections. Moreover, on the spelling
                                          evidence, the compositor of reset B-D was not the same
                                          workman as that of the original sheets, whereas the theory
                                          almost positively requires him to be one and the same.
                                          Finally, the proportion of the respective settings of B-D
                                          in the preserved copies argues strongly against a
                                          hypothesis based on the enlargement of an edition-sheet.
                                          These are such strong reasons that I do not believe we can
                                          accept this alternative.</p>

                                   <p>If, in a last desperate attempt, we reverse the order of the
                                          B-D settings, we are up against the reasonably clear
                                          textual, spelling, and semi-bibliographical evidence that
                                          (*) was the first; we should need to assume that E (on the
                                          evidence of its (*) running-titles) was not machined until
                                          the last operation although it must have been set earlier;
                                          we are faced with the strong probability that E,
                                          nevertheless, was set by the (*) compositor; and we still
                                          cannot explain the lack of standing type in D.</p>

                                   <p>It would seem that the most prominent alternatives involving
                                          any probability in normal printing practice fail to
                                          satisfy the prime requirements for any satisfactory
                                          hypothesis, which must explain (a)- the proportion of
                                          variant B-D sheets in the observed copies; (b) the lack of
                                          standing type in D; (c) the different skeleton-forme in
                                          reset B-D; (d) the equal division of the book between two
                                          or more presses; (e) the change of compositors between the
                                          two settings of B-D.</p>

                                   <p>The only theory which will fit every one of these facts is the
                                          original one, which introduces the plan for two-section
                                          printing from the beginning, and posits a delay before the
                                          reprinting of the reset B-D sheets. The only difficulty in
                                          full acceptance of this hypothesis is the vagueness of the
                                          explanation, involving some peculiar sort of accident to
                                          three successive sheets. But until a better explanation
                                          occurs to someone, I believe this is the theory we must
                                          hold. Regardless of the explanation for the how and why,
                                          however, it would seem sufficiently clear that the (*)
                                          setting of B-D, the details of which were described at the
                                          start, is the original and only authoritative form of the
                                          text in these sheets.</p>

                                          <p>This catchword correction is of some real interest.
                                                 Under ordinary circumstances a compositor of a
                                                 reprint follows regularly the catchword on the
                                                 recto page of his printed copy, since he must turn
                                                 the page to know whether it is right or wrong, and
                                                 thus original variants between catchwords on the
                                                 recto pages of successive editions and following
                                                 words on the versos often become perpetuated. On

                                                 would be most difficult to explain. Simple
                                                 misprints, of course, do occur, as the misprint

                                          <p>It would be much more plausible to find a
                                                 miscalculation about the size of the edition-sheet
                                                 existing if the two sections of the book had been
                                                 printed in different shops. But the fact that the
                                                 standing type from the (*) head-title was used on
                                                 the title-page printed by the workmen of the second
                                                 section is sufficient evidence that the two parts
                                                 were manufactured in one house.</p></note>

                                          <p>Since type was not distributed until its skeleton-forme
                                                 had been stripped, and this stripping was not
                                                 accomplished until the next forme was ready to be
                                                 imposed, we should also need to suppose that the
                                                 compositor had made an almost immediate imposition
                                                 of the second forme of E from the skeleton of the
                                                 last forme of D, although the press would not
                                                 require the forme for some time. However, this is

                                          <p>The pattern of the four (probably five) sets of
                                                 running-titles in F-I is clearly not that
                                                 associated with one-press printing and instead
                                                 indicates that two or more presses were assigned to
                                                 the section. It would, therefore, be printed more
                                                 quickly than B-E if both had started at the same
                                                 moment. But there is nothing against a delay in
                                                 beginning the second section that would cause both
                                                 sections to be finished at about the same

                                          <p>According to Moxon, at this date it was the printer's
                                                 duty to fold the sheets and collate them into

                                                 delivering them to the stationer. Of course we do
                                                 not know that this was the invariable practice, but
                                                 evidence exists to suggest that it may well have
                                                 been the usual one.</p></note>

                                                 most readily explained as inadvertent following of
                                                 the (*) copy by the (&sect;) compositor, whose

                                          <p>The difficulties in the order of (*) D followed by E
                                                 have already been sketched in another connection.
                                                 They consist chiefly in the fact that the
                                                 compositor of E, on the evidence of the measure,
                                                 did not compose any part of F, although shortly

                                                  and by the insertion of 60 lines from the (A)

                                   <p>An examination of these editions, which are all in different
                                          typesettings, reveals in the first place the similarity in
                                          the titles of (I), (II), and (V). They all have 'Corrected
                                          by the Author', 'The Seventh Edition', and practically the
                                          same imprint. Professor Griffith, pointing to the spelling
                                          'Witford' for 'Wilford' (the name of the publisher of the
                                          original genuine edition of the <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                                                 Man</hi>, London, 1733-34), which he considers
                                          intentional, is of the opinion that (I) is a piracy, and
                                          (II) probably a piracy of (I). Though the titles of (V)
                                          and (VI) are different, the identical text readings show
                                                 <pb n="004.186"/> that (VI) must have been printed
                                          from (V), while the words 'A New Edition' may point to an
                                          edition later than 1736. It is clear therefore that (I),
                                          (II), (V), and (VI) are in some way related, and they may
                                          be said to form one group.</p>

                                   <p>Another thing that strikes us is that (IV) is an altogether
                                          different venture. Internally, it is characterized by a
                                          wealth of capitals, against a great scarcity in the other
                                          three printings. It has a frontispiece (bust of Swift), a
                                          separate title for the <hi rend="italic">Verses</hi>, and
                                          there is a greater attempt at ornamentation (ornaments on
                                          the title-pages; a headpiece and decorated capital on page
                                          3 of the <hi rend="italic">Verses</hi>). These details all
                                          make an impression of a production superior to the other
                                          three. Moreover, the title of the <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Essay</hi> is the only one that does not read
                                          'Corrected by the Author', and also the only one that
                                          mentions the <hi rend="italic">Verses</hi> specially, and
                                          adds 'Written by Himself, Nov. 1731', which goes back to
                                          the 1733 [A] edition. The imprint of the <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Essay</hi> says: 'Dublin: Printed', that of the
                                                 <hi rend="italic">Verses</hi> 'Dublin, Printed:
                                          London: Re-printed', which cannot but be a "blind",<ref
                                                 target="f004.16.03" n="3"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >3</hi></ref> because nobody in Dublin could have
                                          had command of the [B] version in 1736, unless it had
                                          secretly been sent there for publication, which is very
                                          improbable. The Bathurst folio of 1739 must have been
                                          printed from it. There is the same wealth of capitals. The
                                          text variations are the same; two corrections are for the
                                          better: 'their Tenderness' for 'his Tenderness', and 'his
                                          Judgment' for 'the Judgment'. On the whole the affinity is
                                          clear and unmistakable.</p>


                                   <p>Only the National Library of Ireland copy, (III), remains. It
                                          is to be regretted that the absence of the title-page (and
                                          perhaps a frontispiece?) robs us of some valuable
                                          evidence. If a complete copy should ever be discovered, I
                                          should not be astonished to find an imprint with 'Dublin,
                                          Printed, &amp;c'. It is a cheap production without
                                          ornamentation or capitals, carelessly set with several
                                          misprints, suggesting a slovenly manuscript, and lack of
                                          skill in compositor or proofreader. If I were allowed a
                                          guess, I should judge it the first printing of all, a
                                          separate publication, secretly handed to the press, and
                                          almost immediately reprinted as an addition to the <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Essay</hi> to both sides, (IV) and
                                          (V), with the advantage decidedly on the side of (IV).</p>

                                   <p>Although we do not know the date on which Swift sent his
                                          manuscript of the [C] version to Dr. William King for
                                          publication in London, there is some indication as to this

                                          Whiteway of Nov. 9, O. S., 1736, where he speaks of two
                                          manuscripts, (1) "the little manuscript", which he had
                                          already received, and which he intended to put to the
                                          press, "and oblige the whole English nation", on his
                                          arrival in London, after Nov. 20; (2) "the History [of the
                                          Four Last Years of the Queen]", which was not sent to King
                                          until some months later,<ref target="f004.16.05" n="5"><hi

                                                 >Verses</hi>, because as we have seen above, some
                                          "edited" editions of it really appeared in 1736.</p>

                                          Bathurst [B] version had just been published, King refers
                                          to "the form in which this poem now appears", making
                                          special mention of the omission of two passages, "the
                                          story of the medals", and "the designs of the Ministry on
                                          the death of Queen Anne", without, however, speaking of
                                          the 60 lines added from the [A] version, which makes us
                                          wonder whether he was aware of them or not; while in a
                                                 letter<ref target="f004.16.07" n="7"><hi

                                          Mrs. Whiteway he says that he had consented to the
                                          alterations "in deference to Mr. Pope's judgment, and the
                                          opinion of others of the Dean's friends in this country .
                                          . .". He also expressed his great fear that Swift might be
                                          dissatisfied with "the liberties I have taken", promising
                                          that he would still have the poem published in its
                                          original shape, if Swift positively wished it.<ref

                                   <p>We cannot waive aside the impression that King, beyond his
                                          function as a "publisher," for which in his letters to
                                          Swift and Mrs. Whiteway he accepted the responsibility,
                                          knew very little about the matter. He knew about the
                                          omissions, but he does not speak of additions. Apparently
                                          he had left the "editorship" entirely to Pope, probably
                                          even the proofreading. And it is certain that about the
                                          clandestine editions of 1736 King knew nothing at all. In
                                          his letter to Mrs. Whiteway of Jan. 30, 1739, occurs this
                                          passage: "It may not be amiss to tell you, that one Gally,
                                          or Gaillie, since this poem was printed, offered it to
                                          sale to a bookseller at Temple Bar; and I am now told that
                                          there are two or three copies more in London. Gaillie
                                          pretends that he is just come from Ireland, and that he
                                          had directions to publish the poem here; so that perhaps
                                          the whole may at last appear, whether he [<hi
                                                 rend="italic">i.e.</hi> Swift] will or not." From
                                          these words it is clear that King thought that Gaillie had
                                          a manuscript of the [C] version to sell which came direct
                                          from Ireland (it does not matter here that his fear was
                                          ungrounded, for this version was never published in
                                          London; and that as to the "two or three copies more in
                                          London", by which only the 1736 editions can have been
                                          meant, he reported no more than hearsay, not knowing what
                                          to make of it).</p>

                                   <p>The evidence adduced yields a procedure similar to that in the
                                          case of the <hi rend="italic">Letters Between Swift and

                                          described by Dilke and later by Elwin; with Pope as the
                                                 <hi rend="italic">auctor intellectualis</hi>, and
                                          King little more than a tool; namely: a
                                          pseudo-surreptitious printing to suggest that a stolen
                                          manuscript had reached the press, (III); followed by a
                                          reprint purported to have been derived from a Dublin
                                          edition, in order to be able to lay the fault there, (IV);
                                          and finally the 'genuine' edition.</p>

                                   <p>The question may be asked: Was Pope to blame for the part he
                                          played? In his <hi rend="italic">New Light on Pope</hi>
                                          (1949), the late Mr. Norman Ault has tried to <pb
                                                 n="004.188"/> exonerate Pope of several cases of
                                          trickery and deceit hitherto laid to his charge; and it
                                          cannot be denied that Ault has succeeded in several
                                          respects. But we are inclined to wonder if, with a
                                          critic's love of his author and his author's works, he has
                                          not gone a little too far. Mr. Ault sees no estrangement

                                          Pope after the publication of Vol. III of the <hi

                                          which still requires a close investigation; and though he
                                          speaks of "the admittedly dubious affair of the <hi

                                                 >10</hi></ref> he finds a good deal of excuse in
                                          Pope's activities even here, and calls Dilke and Elwin's
                                          attempts to clear up this affair "diatribes".<ref

                                                 >11</hi></ref> If Mr. Ault had been acquainted with
                                          the case under discussion, he would no doubt have reasoned
                                          thus: Pope was so careful of Swift's <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Verses</hi> that he treated them as his own and
                                          "edited" them; but being also anxious about his friend's
                                          safety, he took recourse to clandestine publication, which
                                          had the additional advantage of ascertaining the reception
                                          of the poem by the public; only when he saw that the
                                          Government took no offence, he cooperated in the 'genuine'
                                          edition. For the sake of Pope's reputation let us hope
                                          that this is the correct interpretation. However, it
                                          remains strange that King was left uninformed as to the
                                          clandestine publications and that his suspicions were not
                                          even roused.</p>

                                          Guides to the Latin and Greek Classics had long been
                                          available, and Clarke took as his guide in the matter the
                                          popular work by Harwood.<ref target="f004.17.03" n="3"><hi

                                          increasing collection of orientalia, Clarke must have used
                                          a small reference library which was already available for
                                          works in Coptic, Hebrew, Samaritan, Syriac, Chaldean,
                                          Ethiopian, Arabic, Persian and Armenian languages. It is
                                          odd that he fails to mention any of these references by
                                          name, but his labors were greatly facilitated by their
                                          consultation, and in substance his <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Dictionary</hi> became an incorporation of the
                                          titles in these works into one alphabet with, ostensibly,
                                          additions and observations. Since Clarke does not mention
                                          these references they may well be listed: <q>Carl Heinrich

                                          Hebrew materials, for which Clarke found a ready store of
                                          information, his other titles for the Eastern literatures
                                          were largely drawn from the titles listed above with
                                          constant addition from his own collection. The
                                          formidibility of Clarke's <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Bibliographical Dictionary</hi> is indicated in
                                          the simple quantitative comparison of its 25,000 odd

                                          (including Harwood) titles of his sources. Patently, this
                                          was an achievement, and Clarke with some modesty noted
                                          that his "chief aim has been to insert <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >useful</hi> and <hi rend="italic">important</hi>
                                          articles, together with whatever he knew to be <hi

                                                 >scarce</hi>" (Advertisement). He was quick to add
                                          that "those who have the smallest acquaintance with the
                                          difficulty of compiling such a work as the present, will
                                          not be surprised to meet with several mistakes, and will
                                          not be hasty in censuring." (<hi rend="italic"
                                          >idem</hi>).</p>




                                   <p>The <hi rend="italic">Bibliographical Dictionary</hi>, itself,
                                          is in one author alphabet, and the usual entry includes
                                          anecdotes of the author (sometimes with source), notices
                                          of the best edition (s) of the works and, if available to
                                          Clarke, price of editions and recent auction sale records.
                                          Occasionally the author-alphabet is broken for the
                                          alphabetical inclusion of series of volumes (<hi
                                                 rend="italic">e.g.</hi> the Aldine Classics), or
                                          for a collective heading <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>
                                          "Bible." This was recommended, and some of these
                                          collective entries achieve an amazing length and quality.
                                          The collective entry "Bible" occupies pp. 185-288 in
                                          volume I, and is continued in an appendix of 15 pp. (II,
                                          1-15). The fullness of Clarke's references remain
                                          unmatched. Neither Watt in his <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Bibliotheca Britannica</hi> (4vs. Edinburgh, 1824)
                                          nor Lowndes in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliographer's
                                                 Manual</hi> (10vs. rev. Bohn, 1858-64) under their
                                          listing for "Bible" even approach Clarke's entry. Yet both
                                          Watt and Lowndes had used Clarke as a source. Within the
                                          area that it has defined (and its title is the best guide
                                          to this area) the <hi rend="italic">Bibliographical

                                          illustration the entry for Cicero (II, 187-235). The
                                          logical point of comparison would be Harwood, but it is
                                          deficient alongside Clarke. Perhaps T. F. Dibdin's <hi

                                          through four editions, the last in 1827, might be
                                          adjudged, but it too does not equal the wealth of
                                          information found under Clarke's "Cicero," and at times
                                          Clarke even exceeds the expectation, as for example his
                                          quotation of the complete colophon for the Vindelin de
                                          Spira edition of the Ciceronian <hi rend="italic"

                                          important work and then makes some critical judgment. In
                                          many cases by immediate reference to works that he has
                                          cited he is able to illustrate the importance of the work
                                          under consideration in the history of bibliography.

                                          Bibliography" is his general working reference-library for

                                          bibliographical labors in 1806, he turned away with some
                                          reluctance. It is interesting to see that his <hi

                                   <p>In the nineteenth-century business records of the publishing
                                          house of John Murray, in London, are data not elsewhere
                                          available regarding the publication by Murray of George
                                          Crabbe's works after the poet's death.<ref

                                                 >1</hi></ref> These records contain an account of
                                          the reprints of both the eight-volume edition which first
                                          appeared in 1834 and the edition complete in one volume
                                          which was published first in 1847. The information
                                          concerning the number of copies received from the printer,
                                          the dates when they were received, and the rapidity of the
                                          sales should be useful to students of Crabbe's success and
                                          reputation as well as to librarians, collectors, and
                                          bibliographers. For the present this information must be
                                          regarded as a means of checking bibliographical evidence
                                          rather than as definitive material, since even a
                                          superficial preliminary survey reveals discrepancies
                                          between the publisher's records and the bibliographical
                                          facts which can hardly be accounted for without a thorough
                                          study of the extant volumes themselves.<ref

                                   <p>The Murray stock books make clear, however, that the
                                          eight-volume edition came out originally in monthly
                                          numbers, as the dating, February-September, in Huchon's
                                          list of the publications of Crabbe suggests.<ref

                                                 >3</hi></ref> The original printings of the first
                                          two volumes are dated in the stock book February and
                                          March, respectively; and those of the other volumes are
                                          dated specifically the first day of each succeeding month.

                                                  >4</hi></ref> Apparently, Huchon did not make use
                                          of the Murray stock books. I find no mention of them in
                                          his study, the scope of which, indeed, hardly includes the
                                          history of the Murray editions published after Crabbe's
                                          death.</p>



                                   <p>The dates recorded in the stock books for the reprints of
                                          these individual volumes throw doubt upon Bartholomew's
                                          listing of the reprints of 1835 and 1836, in which it is
                                          indicated that the set was reprinted <hi rend="italic">in
                                                 toto</hi> in <pb n="004.193"/> both of these
                                                 years.<ref target="f004.18.05" n="5"><hi
                                                  rend="super">5</hi></ref> The stock books show
                                          that all of the volumes were reprinted once during 1835,
                                          but in three different groups.<ref target="f004.18.06"
                                                 n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> There is no
                                          record in the stock books, moreover, of any reprint of
                                          Volumes III and VIII during 1836. At the moment it is
                                          impossible to say whether any copies of these two volumes
                                          were issued with cancel titles bearing the date 1836. This
                                          seems improbable on account of the variety of dates in
                                          extant copies of this eight-volume set, which suggests
                                          that no effort was made to achieve the appearance of
                                          uniformity.</p>



                                   <p>This variety of dates is accounted for by the indication in
                                          the stock books that between December, 1834, when the
                                          entire set was reprinted, and February, 1847, when it was
                                          reprinted again, there were many reprints of individual
                                          volumes or groups of volumes, but none of the set as a
                                                 whole.<ref target="f004.18.07" n="7"><hi
                                                  rend="super">7</hi></ref> Thus the suspicion of
                                          numerous cancel titles is somewhat allayed, and the
                                          impulse to assume frequent reprints of the whole set with
                                          numerous shiftings, by booksellers and other owners, of
                                          copies from one issue to another is held in check. The
                                          table below summarizes the facts as to the dates of the
                                          reprints.</p>


                                   <p>The records of the number of copies disposed of are a little
                                          less clear than those of the dates of the various
                                          reprints, because some of the entries showing numbers of
                                          copies disposed of seem to represent an accumulation and
                                          not to belong specifically to the dates assigned to them.
                                          This is indicated by several facts: first, that there is
                                          only one entry showing the number of copies of Volume I
                                          presented as gifts; second, that this number and the
                                          numbers of copies in the entries showing coffee-house
                                          sales are comparatively large; third, that these figures
                                          representing accumulations are rather infrequent for some
                                          of the years covered by the records; and fourth, that in a
                                          few cases the number of copies recorded as having been
                                          sold by a certain date exceeds the number recorded as
                                          having been printed by that date. It is possible, however,
                                          to get a fairly trustworthy idea of the rapidity of the
                                          sales of the various volumes of this edition as well as of
                                          the issues that were printed together as sets, for the
                                          total number of copies disposed of plus the number not
                                          disposed of corresponds exactly to the number printed. I
                                          shall give the record of the number of copies printed as
                                          it appears in the stock books, because these entries are
                                          intelligible without interpretation. But instead of
                                          putting down all the various entries in the records of
                                          sales, I shall summarize these and relate them to the
                                          records of printings.</p>

                                   <p>Although the column for each of the volumes in the 1832 stock
                                          book ends with the notation "To new book," I have found no
                                          entries in the next book, the one opened in 1844, for any
                                          of the volumes except the first, and only one for that,
                                                 <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the one for January 1,
                                          1844, given in the table above. Perhaps the phrase "To new
                                          book" refers to the records of the reprints of the set as
                                          a whole, which do appear in the 1844 book; or perhaps when
                                          the new book was opened it was contemplated that there
                                          might be further reprints of the individual volumes. In
                                          any case, I believe that these records as I have given
                                          them are complete, since they extend through 1846, the
                                          year before the set as a whole was reprinted. Regrettably,
                                          the stock books do not indicate whether the type for any
                                          of the volumes was distributed <pb n="004.195"/> and
                                          re-set between 1834 and the last reprint of the set.<ref

                                                 >9</hi></ref> Nor do they show whether all of the
                                          printing was done by Spottiswoode. This writer has seen no
                                          copies of any of the volumes bearing the imprint of any
                                          other printer; and Spottiswoode is mentioned in the 1844
                                          stock book as the printer of the 1847 issue.</p>


                                   <p>The records of sales indicate that up to and including the
                                          year 1846 the individual volumes were disposed of as

                                          as <pb n="004.196"/> carried over to the new book, but the
                                          general trend of the demand for these volumes is clear
                                          enough nonetheless.</p>

                                   <p>It is interesting to note that the Volume I, containing the
                                          memoir of Crabbe, sold better than any of the volumes of
                                          his poetry except Volume II, which contained the poems
                                          that appeared first in 1807, and that Volume I maintained
                                          its position fairly consistently throughout the period
                                          represented by the figures. This fact is accounted for
                                          partly, of course, by the fact that the memoir was a new
                                          work. Although Crabbe's biography can scarcely be expected
                                          to have had a sale comparable with that of Boswell's <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi>, also chronicled
                                          in the Murray stock books, it may nevertheless be worth
                                          mentioning that from 1835, when the house of Murray
                                          brought out the latter in ten monthly volumes, until 1839,
                                          these volumes sold roughly at the rate of 900-1000 copies
                                          each per year.</p>

                                   <p>The superior popularity of Volume VIII is doubtless due also
                                          to the fact that its contents, the Posthumous Tales, were
                                          appearing for the first time. It is to be noted that
                                          Volume VIII tends to lag behind the others after the first
                                          three years following publication.</p>

                                   <p>The principal significance of these figures, of course, is
                                          that they indicate how rapidly the popularity of Crabbe
                                          declined in the years following his death. It is to be
                                          remembered, however, that what we have here is only a
                                          partial record. The publication of Crabbe by other houses
                                          doubtless contributed to the decline of the sale of the
                                          Murray edition; but we cannot say how much.<ref

                                                 >12</hi></ref> Unfortunately no figures are at the
                                          moment available showing the rapidity of the sales of the
                                          editions brought out by other publishers.</p>

                                          </table> The probable meaning of the item "Returned by
                                          Trade" is that some of the copies which had been taken
                                          over by booksellers or coffee houses and recorded as
                                          having left the stock room were returned, so that when
                                          these were again disposed of their number was again added
                                          to the record of copies taken from the stock. The number
                                          of copies returned had to be added to the record of stock
                                          received from the printer in order to make the books
                                          balance. The number of copies of the set printed, then,
                                          was 754 instead of 778.</p>

                                          1867, and since the total number of copies disposed of
                                          equals the number received, the eight-volume set must have
                                          gone out of print at that time, except for a few copies of
                                          volumes printed individually before 1847 which may

                                          Farquharson, of the house of Murray, who has told me that
                                          the volume has not been reprinted since that time, and has
                                          given me the following additional information from records

                                   <p>The Murray records add one reprint, that of December, 1850, to
                                          the list of reprints of the one-volume Murray edition
                                          given by Crabbe's bibliographers. The reprint listed by
                                          Huchon as belonging to the year 1867 may be the title-page
                                          edition of 1866, as the date on the title-page would
                                          probably be 1867 if the edition was issued late in the
                                          year 1866. Bartholomew, however, lists a one-volume
                                          edition for 1866.</p>

                                          </table> It is regrettable that this series cannot be
                                          continued, for it would be interesting to know whether the
                                          slump of sales in 1854 represented a trend. Perhaps it did
                                          not do so any more than did the low figure for 1848.</p>
                                   <p>On the whole these data do not give the impression that all
                                          interest in Crabbe ended with his life. To be sure, the
                                          number of purchasers of his works was small in the years
                                          immediately preceding 1847, when Murray's two complete
                                          editions were published, and in the following years as
                                          well; but the sale of two thousand copies by a single
                                          publisher in 1847 and the comparatively steady sale in the
                                          following years are impressive.</p>

                                          <p>For example, in the New Orleans Public Library there is
                                                 a copy of the eightvolume edition in which the
                                                 title-pages of Volumes IV, V, VI, and VIII bear the
                                                 dates 1845, 1843, 1843, and 1845, respectively; but
                                                 the Murray records do not mention any reprints of
                                                 these volumes in these years. One may guess that
                                                 Volumes IV, V, and VI were dated 1845, 1843, and
                                                 1843, respectively, because they were printed in
                                                 December of the preceding year; but the date of
                                                 Volume VIII cannot be accounted for in this
                                                 way.</p></note>

                                          <p>It will be noted that the totals for Volume III do not
                                                 agree with the figures in the column. Since the
                                                 figures representing sales are not entirely legible
                                                 in the stock book, the discrepancy is probably due
                                                 to an error in my interpretation of these rather
                                                 than to an error in the totals. I have therefore
                                                 given the totals as they appear in the stock book.
                                                 A further argument in favor of these totals is that
                                                 the total number of volumes disposed of plus the
                                                 number carried over to the new book agrees with the
                                                 figure given in the record of printings for the
                                                 total number of copies printed. The validity of
                                                 this argument is perhaps slightly questionable,
                                                 however, since it is not certain that the figures
                                                 showing the number of copies carried over
                                                 represents an actual count.</p></note>

                                                 recorded in the stock books for 1847. The monthly
                                                 dates, however, and the fact that there is no other
                                                 record of sales for 1848, suggest that these belong
                                                 to the latter year.</p></note>

                                                 >2</hi></ref> Dr. Lawrence Starkey has called
                                          attention to the fact that neither the factotum nor the
                                          type used in the <hi rend="italic">Humble Proposal</hi> is
                                          to be found in other products of the Cambridge Press,
                                          although the watermark in the paper on which it is printed
                                          is also found in paper used by this <pb n="004.200"/>
                                          colonial press in its books at approximately the same
                                          time.<ref target="f004.19.03" n="3"><hi rend="super"
                                                  >3</hi></ref> This last is an interesting
                                          coincidence which, if taken alone, might lend support to
                                          Evans' opinion that the broadside was published in
                                          America. However, the more important evidence of the
                                          factotum may now be utilized to demonstrate the
                                          correctness of Winship's assignment of the printing to an
                                          English press.</p>




                                   <p>The factotum is a conventional design measuring 59 x 60 mm. At
                                          the top a column, centered over the mortise, is placed
                                          between two cherubim, below each of which is a cornucopia,
                                          the one on the left of the mortise being topped by a
                                          stylized rose, the other by a thistle. At the bottom a
                                          fleur-de-lis directly beneath the mortise separates
                                          arabesques which extend upward and interwine with the
                                          cornucopias. Finally, the whole design is surrounded by
                                          double lines, the outer much thicker than the other. In
                                          his study of the ornament stock of Thomas Newcombe, Dr. C.
                                          William Miller has reproduced this factotum and identified
                                          it as belonging to the stock that came to Newcombe in 1648
                                          when he married Ruth Raworth, the widow of the printer
                                          John Raworth.<ref target="f004.19.04" n="4"><hi

                                          in Dr. Miller's set of illustrations, is taken from <hi
                                                 rend="italic">The Compleat Ambassador</hi> (Wing
                                          D1453), by Dugley Digges, which Newcombe printed in 1655
                                          for Gabriel Bodell and Thomas Collins. When four years
                                          later the factotum appears in the <hi rend="italic">Humble
                                                 Proposal</hi> (1659), a conspicuous crack, not
                                          present in the earlier occurrence, is to be found at the
                                          top just off-center right in the heavy outer line.</p>


                                   <p>Mr. John Wyllie, Curator of Rare Books at the University of
                                          Virginia Library, has called our attention to the use of
                                          the same factotum in two official documents; (1) <hi
                                                 rend="italic">An Act for Confirming Publick
                                                 Acts</hi> (comprising signatures D and E
                                          immediately following signature C of Wing E994 in the ViU
                                          MacGregor set of Charles II Statutes), dated May 8, 1661;
                                          and (2) the ViU copy of <hi rend="italic">A Proclamation
                                                 of Grace, for the Inlargement of Prisoners called
                                                 Quakers</hi> (Wing C3523), dated May 11, 1661.
                                          Though both bear the imprint of John Bill and Christopher
                                          Barker, the King's Printers, identity of detail and the
                                          presence of the break in the upper edge prove that these
                                          publications contain the same factotum used by Newcombe
                                          and the printer of the <hi rend="italic">Humble
                                                 Proposal</hi> (1659). The latest use of the
                                          factotum Miller records is in <hi rend="italic">The Works
                                                 of Richard Hooker</hi> (Wing H2631), which Newcombe
                                          printed in 1666. In all of these later appearances there
                                          is a noticeable deterioration of the edges of the
                                          mortise.</p>

                                   <p>Mr. Wyllie has also found that the precise book in which the
                                          crack in the edge of the factotum first occurred is John
                                          Rushworth's <hi rend="italic">Historicall
                                          Collections</hi>, which George Thomason entered in the <hi

                                          September 14, 1658, and which Newcombe printed for him in
                                          1659, the <pb n="004.201"/> same year in which the <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Humble Proposal</hi> was printed. On
                                                 B1<hi rend="super">r</hi> of this book the line
                                          around the factotum is unbroken, but on A2<hi rend="super"
                                                 >r</hi> in the preliminaries, which were
                                          undoubtedly machined last, there is present the crack
                                          noted in the 1659 broadside and in all subsequent
                                          publications containing the factotum.<ref
                                                 target="f004.19.05" n="5"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >5</hi></ref> From this evidence it is apparent
                                          that the printing of the <hi rend="italic">Historicall
                                                 Collections</hi> was finished before May 11, 1659,
                                          the date of the <hi rend="italic">Humble Proposal</hi>,
                                          and that the factotum had been cracked between that date
                                          and the preceding September.</p>


                                   <p>Newcombe's ownership of the factotum can easily be reconciled
                                          with its appearance in the two 1661 documents which have
                                          the Bill and Barker imprints. According to Plomer, John
                                          Bill and Christopher Barker, who were reinstated as King's
                                          Printers in 1660, did not themselves print the books whose
                                          imprints bear their names, but farmed them out to their
                                                 assigns.<ref target="f004.19.06" n="6"><hi
                                                  rend="super">6</hi></ref> Furthermore, Newcombe,
                                          as an assign of John Bill, was the printer and manager of
                                          the King's Printing Office from the Restoration until
                                          1677, when he and Henry Hills were appointed King's
                                                 Printers.<ref target="f004.19.07" n="7"><hi
                                                  rend="super">7</hi></ref> This association, then,
                                          explains the presence of the Newcombe factotum in <hi
                                                 rend="italic">An Act for Confirming Publick
                                                 Acts</hi> (1661) and <hi rend="italic">A
                                                 Proclamation of Grace</hi> (1661), both of which
                                          Newcombe must have printed himself.</p>



                                   <p>The constant appearance of the factotum in Newcombe books
                                          identifies him as the printer of the <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Humble Proposal in</hi> 1659. The only
                                          alternative, that the factotum was loaned to the Cambridge
                                          Press to print the broadside and then returned to London,
                                          is sheer fantasy. Its appearance in the books discussed
                                          above is therefore sufficient proof that Winship was
                                          correct in denying the <hi rend="italic">Humble
                                                 Proposal</hi> to the Cambridge Press and assigning
                                          it to England.</p>

                                   <p>On an April day in Boston in 1798, a boy celebrated his
                                          fourteenth birthday by deciding that the time had come to
                                          escape from his unendurable lot in life. After his
                                          father's death, his mother had placed him with his uncle,
                                          and the youngster at this time was working in his uncle's
                                          Boston paint shop. Little Samuel T. Armstrong, waiting on
                                          trade, grinding paints, lugging the family groceries,
                                          blacking boots in the cold winter nights, bitterly
                                          determined to win independence. Chancing to see an
                                          advertisement <pb n="004.202"/> for a printer's
                                          apprentice, the boy called, one evening after work, at the
                                          office of Manning &amp; Loring on Spring Lane. He
                                          explained his plans to James Loring, offering to make his
                                          own agreement, and showed so much ambition and promise
                                          that, in spite of the novelty of the arrangement, he was
                                          promptly signed on as an apprentice.<ref
                                                 target="f004.20.01" n="1"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >1</hi></ref> In February, 1800, when Joseph T.
                                          Buckingham arrived at Manning &amp; Loring as journeyman
                                          printer, he found Armstrong still the youngest apprentice:
                                          "His duty (like that of all youngest apprentices) was to
                                          kindle the fires, sweep the floor, pick up the scattered
                                          types, distribute <hi rend="italic">pi</hi>, and <hi
                                                 rend="italic">tread the pelts</hi>,--an operation
                                          exceedingly filthy and disgusting."<ref
                                                 target="f004.20.02" n="2"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >2</hi></ref> And, as Buckingham recollects, he
                                          "passed through this state of tribulation," finishing his
                                          time of service in April, 1805.</p>



                                   <p>He remained at Manning &amp; Loring as journeyman for
                                          approximately six months, but the job did not satisfy him.
                                          Nor did being a journeyman printer satisfy his friend
                                          Joshua Belcher, twenty-one years old, who had just served
                                          his time on the <hi rend="italic">Independent
                                                 Chronicle</hi>. Belcher and Armstrong, therefore,
                                          decided to enter into partnership as book and job
                                          printers. They bought the <hi rend="italic">Boston
                                                 Magazine</hi> from Gilbert &amp; Dean and in
                                          October, 1805, opened their printing office on the second
                                          floor of an old building at 70 State Street.<ref

                                                 >3</hi></ref></p>


                                   <p>The expenses incurred in the establishment of this office are
                                          itemized in the final pages of Armstrong's journal. The
                                          list contains needed information about the economy of
                                          nineteenth-century American printing, and it is presented
                                          in the hope of stimulating the publication of similar
                                          material. The text is printed in full, but deletions and
                                          insertions are not noted and punctuation has been changed

                                          /> Furthermore, it must be noted that, in addition to the
                                          British importation mentioned here, some type was
                                          purchased from Binny &amp; Ronaldson, for soon after the
                                          opening of business Belcher &amp; Armstrong advertised an

                                          1807, when it was sold to Oliver C. Greenleaf.</p>



                                   <p>The major work of the office seems to have been devoted to
                                          books, job work, and pamphlets. In 1807, the firm joined
                                          with Oliver &amp; Munroe to issue the first Boston edition
                                          of Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi>.
                                          Independently, they issued James Montgomery's <hi

                                                 Love</hi> (1808), and other books. For one

                                                 Selfridge</hi> [1807], the partners showed their
                                          resourcefulness by obtaining professional reporters from
                                          New York or Philadelphia since there were none in Boston.

                                          printing business continued to be a financial struggle. In
                                          April, 1808, they formed a publishing association with W.
                                          P. Farrand, D. Mallory, and J. Morse, and moved the

                                          December, 1808, the firm of Belcher &amp; Armstrong was
                                          dissolved. Though there was much pamphlet and job work,
                                          Armstrong declared in his journal, it enabled him to clear

                                   <p>Joshua Belcher lived in Boston as a printer until he died in
                                          New York on September 4, 1816, at the age of 32.<ref

                                                 >16</hi></ref> Armstrong set up a printing office
                                          in Charlestown, eventually opening a bookstore at 50
                                          Cornhill, Boston, about 1811. There he acquired the wealth
                                          and public esteem he desired. Not only did he retire a
                                          rich and independent man, but he served the community as
                                          Representative to the General Court, State Senator,
                                          Lieutenant Governor, and Mayor of Boston. Armstrong died
                                          in 1850, a prototype of the Horatio Alger hero who raised
                                          himself from rags to riches by the correct combination of
                                          business acumen and virtue.<ref target="f004.20.17" n="17"

                                   <p>James Russell Lowell's extensive critical works cover the
                                          period between Dante and the mid-Victorian era so much
                                          more systematically than those of any other
                                          nineteenth-century American critic, that the
                                          identification of twenty-eight additional critical notices
                                          in the <hi rend="italic">North American Review</hi> would
                                          scarcely be worth publication were it not for a continuing
                                          and lively controversial interest in his critical
                                          accomplishment. Upon Lowell's death in 1891, Stedman,
                                          himself a very active critic, unhesitantly pronounced that
                                          Lowell was thus far the greatest of American critics.
                                          Doubters and detractors quickly appeared; but despite the
                                          attacks which have been made on Lowell's superficiality,
                                          he has continued to the present day to find notable
                                          defenders. The addition of a number of critical notices
                                          and reviews will therefore have some significance: it will
                                          increase our knowledge of his reading habits; and, as the
                                          bulk of his known criticism deals with major authors of
                                          the past, these new pieces will enlarge our knowledge of
                                          his opinions of current literature.</p>

                                          a book-length bibliography in 1906 managed to introduce
                                          more typographical errors than he did new items. Both
                                          Scudder and Cooke used, among other materials, the large
                                          mass of manuscripts and other literary remains which
                                          Lowell left with C. E. Norton. Why they did not use, or
                                          made such poor use of, the 1878 index to the <hi
                                                 rend="italic">North American Review</hi> remains
                                          unexplained, unless, depending on Lowell's papers, they
                                          merely overlooked it. The index was prepared by a Harvard
                                          librarian, William Cushing, and was published quite
                                          separately from the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> itself.
                                          Thus it may have escaped their notice just as it escaped
                                          the notice of a more recent distinguished scholar who was
                                          attempting a complete bibliography of his subject.</p>

                                   <p>The <hi rend="italic">North American</hi> had begun to emerge
                                          from anonymity in 1868, ten years before the index was
                                          prepared, but even after the index appeared, the current
                                          critical notices (as distinguished from the articles)
                                          remained unsigned. Cushing, then, had the dual task of
                                          making an analytical index and of determining the
                                          authorship of articles some of which had been published
                                          over sixty years before. In his Preface he said, "The
                                          fullest sources of information, in regard to past and
                                          present writers, have been opened to me by the past and
                                          present editors . . . except Dr. Palfrey, . . . who is too
                                          infirm to give me any information."<ref
                                                 target="f004.21.01" n="1"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >1</hi></ref> Since some of the past editors were
                                                 <pb n="004.206"/> already dead, the statement is
                                          ambiguous. Nevertheless, as Lowell's editorship was later
                                          than Palfrey's, Cushing obviously means that Lowell, among
                                          others, aided him in determining the authorship of
                                          anonymous articles and reviews.</p>


                                   <p>No matter how accurate or inaccurate the information Cushing
                                          received concerning other contributors, Lowell's list of
                                          his own materials must have been fairly trustworthy. As he
                                          had contributed at least eighty-five items, he could not,
                                          five years after the close of his editorship, have relied
                                          on memory. It would seem that, barring clerical and
                                          typographical errors in indexing, the provenance of the
                                          twenty-nine additions to the canon (in the first list
                                          below) is fairly clear.</p>

                                   <p>There can be only a slight doubt about the seventeen items
                                          which are listed without the comment, "In author index
                                          only." Each of them appears at least twice in the index,
                                          and is attributed to Lowell in each entry.</p>

                                   <p>The authenticity of the remaining twelve, the notices which
                                          are indicated as appearing in the author index only, must
                                          be examined more closely. The index is divided into two
                                          sections, subject and author. The analytical subject index
                                          is much the longer, for some articles and notices are
                                          listed under several headings. However, the author index
                                          is more nearly complete, since Cushing has throughout the
                                          subject index omitted certain critical notices which
                                          appear in the author index. He ineffectually explains in
                                          his Preface that the listing of some of the notices could
                                          serve no purpose. His choices for omission are quite
                                          arbitrary, for he includes some trivial materials and
                                          omits what today at least would be considered far more
                                          important.</p>

                                   <p>In the author index there appears under the name of each
                                          author a chronological list of his contributions,
                                          designated by short title and a numerical reference,
                                          except for the fact that in the case of Lowell and a few
                                          other frequent contributors, some, though not all, of the
                                          critical notices (never any of the "articles") are
                                          gathered at the end of the list where they appear under
                                          the heading "Critical Notices" and are designated only by
                                          issue number and notice number. Here an undetectable
                                          typographical error in one figure would result in the
                                          attribution to Lowell of a piece not his. However, a
                                          reindexing of the sixteen volumes edited by Lowell reveals
                                          in 1600 entries in Cushing's index four typographical
                                          errors in numerical reference, or only one to every 400
                                          entries. The chance of a typographical error, then, in
                                          twelve items is very small. Even if an error occurred, it
                                          would have little chance of escaping detection. Any
                                          reference out of sequence would obviously be wrong;
                                          moreover, all but ten of 500 critical notices are indexed,
                                          and an incorrect attribution of a notice to Lowell would
                                          conflict with one or more entries elsewhere in the index.
                                          There are two errors in page composition affecting the 190
                                          entries of Lowell's contributions, but they are
                                          immediately obvious, and do not concern the new items
                                          listed.</p>

                                   <pb n="004.207"/>

                                   <p>Clerical errors are more numerous in the index. Among 1600
                                          entries covering about 800 articles, reviews and notices
                                          published during Lowell's tenure, six critical notices are
                                          attributed to different authors in different parts of the
                                          index. Two of these affect the Lowell canon.<ref

                                          previously ascribed to Lowell is almost certainly the work
                                          of Norton, the very active associate editor.</p>


                                   <p>A file of the <hi rend="italic">North American Review</hi>
                                          built up at the time of publication by the Widener Library
                                          at Harvard contains penciled notations of authorship. The
                                          inscriptions covering Lowell's editorship are primarily in
                                          two hands, with one item marked by a third hand. It is
                                          apparently unknown who made these notations or to what
                                          extent Cushing relied on them. They confirm the additions
                                          to the Lowell canon listed below, with the exception of
                                          the review of Hale's <hi rend="italic">If, Yes,</hi> and
                                                 <hi rend="italic">Perhaps,</hi> which is not

                                   <p>Yet another record&mdash;Norton's memorandum book, which is
                                          owned by the Houghton Library&mdash;mentions a few of the
                                          items. On a left-hand sheet in the notebook he recorded
                                          the plans for a future issue; later he recorded the actual
                                          contents on the opposite sheet, giving the authors and the
                                          amount they were paid. Norton, in this somewhat sketchy
                                          record, attributes a significant review of Howells' <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Venetian Life</hi> to Lowell, while
                                          Cushing in both sections of his index gives it to Norton
                                          himself. The contradictions concerning this short notice
                                          (the Widener copy gives it to Norton, Scudder does not
                                          include it in his list of Lowell's works, and Cooke gives
                                          it to Lowell) indicate that no published records of
                                          Lowell's unsigned and uncollected writings can be trusted
                                          absolutely.</p>

                                   <p>Cooke, though he gathered much valuable bibliographical
                                          information in the field of New England letters, can never
                                          be trusted where he cannot be checked. Compared with
                                          Cushing's index of the Lowell material Cooke's
                                          bibliography is virtually corrupt. While there are only
                                          four typographical, clerical, and composition errors in
                                          Cushing's 190 entries for Lowell, Cooke, in fifty-eight
                                          entries from the <hi rend="italic">North American,</hi>
                                          makes eleven errors, or proportionally nine times as many.
                                          The errors include wrong page, wrong volume, wrong year,
                                          wrong spelling of names, and the misspelling and
                                          alphabetization of <hi rend="italic">Chaucer</hi> as <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Church</hi>, not to mention the
                                          listing in two different places of a review <hi

                                                 rend="italic">of</hi> one of Lowell's works. He
                                          omits without explanation five reviews (listed below)
                                          attributed to <pb n="004.208"/> Lowell by both Cushing and
                                          Scudder. Judging by Cooke's other work, these omissions
                                          were oversights. Certainly the failure to include the
                                          review of Ward's life of Percival was careless, for Lowell
                                          had already collected it himself.</p>

                                   <p>Internal-external evidence will support Cushing's attributions
                                          of several of the notices. This evidence cannot be
                                          analyzed here, but the student of Lowell will recognize
                                          references to previous criticisms definitely known to be
                                          by Lowell, and he will note numerous links such as that in

                                          has given Charles Eliot Norton credit for writing the most
                                          interesting notice of Howells' first important book;<ref

                                                 >1</hi></ref> yet Lowell almost certainly was the
                                          real author. Although the bibliographers of both Howells
                                          and Lowell have suspected Lowell's authorship,<ref
                                                 target="f004.22.02" n="2"><hi rend="super"
                                                 >2</hi></ref> no one so far has assembled
                                          conclusive data to settle this question. There is,
                                          however, ample evidence, both external and internal, to
                                          show that Lowell undoubtedly wrote the essay.</p>



                                   <p>When Howells was hunting for an American publisher to share
                                          with Tr&uuml;bner and Company of London the risk of
                                          bringing out <hi rend="italic">Venetian Life</hi>, he
                                          asked Lowell's aid in placing the book with James T.
                                          Fields. Lowell, however, was unable to interest Fields in
                                          publishing it and was forced to write: "I did what I could
                                          with F[ields]. about the book, but to no end. I expected
                                          as much. But see if I don't say a good word for it when it
                                          is published. There I have my own way."<ref

                                                 >3</hi></ref> The following year, as advance copies
                                          came from the press, there was no doubt in Howells' mind
                                          that Lowell would review the book, for he wrote his
                                          publisher, M. M. Hurd, in August, 1866: "I shall send it
                                          to Mr. Lowell, who says he will notice it in the next <hi

                                          Norton, who, I think, will review it in the <hi
                                                 rend="italic">Nation</hi>, though of course I
                                          cannot state my expectation to him."<ref

                                                 >4</hi></ref> Howells was correct in believing that
                                          Norton would review his book; the marked file in the <hi

                                          corroborative evidence.</p>

                                                 >Venetian Life</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">North
                                                 American Review</hi> rests on internal evidence
                                          supported by the improbability of Norton's authorship of
                                          both notices. Lowell was the logical person to undertake
                                          this task because of his close personal friendship with
                                          Howells. He had known Howells since 1860, had published
                                          his first contributions to the <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Atlantic</hi>, had accepted his initial offering
                                          to the <hi rend="italic">North American Review</hi>. This
                                          review was obviously written by a man who knew Howells,
                                          for it discusses at length his Midwestern background and
                                          early literary career. It also dwells at length on an idea
                                          which long had fascinated Lowell, the idea of "the
                                          unexhausted West," and to this end it glowingly pictures
                                          Howells as the self-taught Westerner storming the citadels
                                          of Eastern culture. The entire essay, moreover, lavishes
                                          praise in the manner Lowell customarily adopted when
                                          writing about his friends.</p>

                                   <p>In addition to a dissimilarity of tone and content between the
                                          two reviews, there is one factual discrepancy which
                                          virtually eliminates the possibility of single authorship.
                                          This occurs in the matter of referring to Howells'
                                          forty-five month foreign residence. The <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >North American Review</hi> article speaks of his
                                          four years abroad, while the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>
                                          cites his three-year sojourn. Since the former figure is
                                          so nearly correct, it seems inescapable that Lowell, who
                                          was Howells' best friend in Cambridge, wrote the former
                                          review. Howells did not make Norton's acquaintance until
                                          after he returned from Italy and assumed his editorial
                                          duties on the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic</hi>.</p>

                                   <p>Students of eighteenth-century bibliography have for some time
                                          recognized the value of contemporary periodical reviews as
                                          evidence in determining the order of editions or issues of
                                          a book. Such reviews may also have use in determining more
                                          recent "firsts," as the following consideration of the
                                          first printing of Sherwood Anderson's <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Winesburg, Ohio</hi> (New York: B. W. Huebsch,

                                   <p><hi rend="italic">Winesburg, Ohio</hi> is one of the fictional
                                          works of the past fifty years which seems certain to
                                          survive, and as such it has attracted the attention of
                                          those who have been concerned with the study of American
                                          first editions. Merle Johnson in 1929 wrote that the
                                          distinguishing points of the "first issue" (<hi
                                                 rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, impression) of this "high

                                          and a perfect title-page border; the "second issue" (<hi
                                                 rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, impression), he said, was
                                          marked by "a break in the title-page rule border."<ref

                                          he mentioned "perfect type in the word 'the,' p. 251, 1.

                                          possibly influenced by Mr. Bennett's statement the year
                                          before, Mr. Blanck added that "the earliest copies have
                                          perfect type at p. 251, line 3, the word <hi rend="italic"

                                          the dates of the first and second printings are indicated
                                          as "April, 1919" and "December, 1919." (Had such a notice
                                          appeared on corresponding pages of the first and second

                                          course, have been avoided.) On June 1, 1919, the book was

                                          the reviewer railed at Anderson's "very bad English"; he
                                          particularly pointed out the poor grammar in one of
                                          Anderson's sentences: "an intense silence seemed to lay

                                   <p>Any copy of the work, then, which contains the revised reading
                                          "lie", and which has no indication of the date of printing
                                          on the copyright page, must, it seems, be suspect of being
                                          one of the second printing, December, 1919. One has little
                                          difficulty locating copies of this kind; and those which I
                                          have examined have been uniformly distinguished by the
                                          points noted by Mr. Bennett for "the first issue." They
                                          are bound in yellow cloth, with the top of the sheets
                                          unstained. In each there is a break in the outer vertical
                                          rule of the title-page frame, about one and three-eighths
                                          inches up from the lower horizontal rule; in each the type
                                          in the word <hi rend="italic">the</hi>, page 251, line 3,
                                          is perfect.</p>

                                   <p>Furthermore, collation of the copies of the first printing
                                          with those which must now be considered of the second
                                          printing reveals two other points: (1) in the first
                                          printing the type in the word <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >cutting</hi>, page 260, line 9, is perfect; it is
                                          broken in the second printing, although it has been
                                          corrected in the third and all later printings; and (2) in
                                          the first printing the type in the first <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >his</hi>, page 196, line 9, is perfect; the
                                          letters <hi rend="italic">is</hi> are depressed in the
                                          second printing, although they have been raised in the
                                          third and all later printings.</p>

                                   <p>It may be of interest, finally, to note that the break in the
                                          title page rule, mentioned by Mr. Bennett as
                                          distinguishing the first printing, continues to appear in
                                          the third printing (January, 1921) but has been corrected
                                          in the fourth (December, 1921) and all subsequent
                                          printings. The word <hi rend="italic">the</hi>, page 251,
                                          line 3, mentioned by Mr. Bennett as "badly broken in all
                                          later printings [than the first]," actually remains
                                          perfect from the second through the sixth printing (March,
                                          1927), where my investigation ended.</p>

                                   <p>In March, 1947, Professor Willard Thorp of Princeton
                                          University delivered an address, "The Poetry of T. S.
                                          Eliot," at the University of Virginia before a McGregor
                                          Room Seminar. The sponsors proposed to reprint "Gerontion"
                                          in the program, and at first chose the poem as found in
                                          the 1936 Harcourt, Brace edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                                                 >Collected Poems, 1909-1935</hi>. However, when
                                          they consulted a few earlier editions in order to assure
                                          themselves of the correctness of the text, they discovered
                                          that variants existed, and therefore they amused
                                          themselves by constructing an eclectic text for <pb
                                                 n="004.214"/> the program. On a subsequent occasion
                                          the late Peters Rushton showed this program-text to Mr.
                                          Eliot, pointing out to him some of the variants which had
                                          been noticed. Mr. Eliot was interested and marked a copy
                                          of the program, altering two of the readings and
                                          confirming others by checks.<ref target="f004.24.01" n="1"
                                                  ><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> The results are of
                                          some interest, demonstrating that no printed edition up to
                                          the present has conformed in every detail with Eliot's
                                          full intentions. The poem, therefore, offers a neat case
                                          history indicating that the need for critical editing
                                          according to principles of textual criticism is by no
                                          means confined to literature of earlier periods.</p>

                                   <p>The textual history of these editions is made reasonably clear
                                          by this collation. It is obvious that (B) Knopf's first
                                          American edition was set from <pb n="004.216"/> an
                                          author-revised copy of (A) on the evidence of lines 17,
                                          26, 57, 67, 70, 71, and 72, all of which appear to contain
                                          authoritative changes. The omission of the comma in the
                                          heading and the umlaut in line 28, and the repetition in
                                          73, are misprints.<ref target="f004.24.07" n="7"><hi
                                                  rend="super">7</hi></ref> The case is less certain
                                          for the variants in lines 1 and 42, since it is possible
                                          that Eliot inadvertently passed over these in the program,
                                          although his silence may have represented approval of the
                                          altered form.</p>


                                   <p>An interesting change made in the third edition (C) concerns
                                          the exclamation point in line 17. The wrong position in
                                          which this is printed suggests an authoritative attempt at
                                          revision made in proof or in a copy of (B), in which the
                                          substitution of the exclamation for the colon was marked
                                          marginally but the necessary change in position was not
                                          made clear to the printer. The variant in lines 28 and 73
                                          corrects a misprint, but that in line 62 is an error. The
                                          fourth edition (D), by Knopf in 1927, was obviously set
                                          from (B), Knopf's 1920 text, on the evidence of the colon
                                          in line 17. An Americanization creeps into line 8, and the
                                          variant "at" in line 9 is a misprint. This edition,
                                          therefore, has no authority. The fifth edition (E) by
                                          Faber in 1932 used Faber's (C) of 1926 as printer's copy.
                                          The substitution of single for double quotes and the
                                          correct placement of the exclamation point in line 17
                                          might have been made in proof, and appear to be
                                                 authoritative.<ref target="f004.24.08" n="8"><hi
                                                  rend="super">8</hi></ref> Otherwise there is no
                                          change, except for the misprint in line 28 and the
                                          correction of line 62. Faber's expanded collection of 1936
                                          (F) was set from (E), with Eliot making the authoritative
                                          alteration, either in copy or in proof, of "it" to "them"
                                          in line 60. The misplaced umlaut in line 28 is a repeated
                                          printer's error. As we should expect, Harcourt's expanded
                                          edition (G) was set from (F) but with the umlaut
                                          corrected. The one puzzling point is the reversion to
                                          double quotes in line 17. The omission of the period in
                                          line 53 is a misprint.</p>


                                   <p>If we make the assumption, as is very plausible, that the
                                          commas added in (B) in lines 1, 7, and 42 are
                                          authoritative (despite the fact that Eliot silently passed
                                          over the omitted comma in line 1 of the program), the only
                                          crux remaining is the correct position of the exclamation
                                          point in line 17. This is a quasi-substantive matter, for
                                          the meaning is affected by the use of the exclamation as
                                          referring to the quoted material itself or as Eliot's
                                          comment on the quotation. However, it would be rather
                                          perverse to argue that the position outside the quotes in
                                          (C), when the point first appears, is the authoritative
                                          one which was subsequently moved inside by printers' usage
                                          and overlooked in successive proofs. The opposing argument
                                          is very strong, that an actual error was caused in (C) by
                                          a proof or copy annotation indicating the substitution but
                                          neglecting to alter the position from that of the <pb
                                                 n="004.217"/> deleted colon. Finally, it is
                                          possible to conjecture that the punctuation changes in
                                          lines 35 and 37 of (B) were in fact authoritative but
                                          that, subsequently, Eliot came to prefer the original
                                          pointing as found only in (A).</p>

                                   <p>The Quaritch-Folger copy of the Pide Bull Lear apparently has
                                          no letter P in its Pot watermarks, merely two close bars
                                          across the bowl of the twin variants. However, at least
                                          sheet H of the Huntington copy does show a P on the lower
                                          part of the bowl of variant a. It may be that this letter
                                          dropped out in late reams made from mould a. Further
                                          copies may clear up the point. </p>

                                          explanatory footnotes. In this process the editor believed
                                          that he had rechecked the hypothesis for cut-sheet
                                          printing in the light of the new characteristics of the
                                          Streetcr copy, but, if so, he was seriously at fault,
                                          since the hypothesis does not in fact work out although
                                          consistent with the information of the copies at Dr.
                                          Starkey's disposal when he wrote his account. It appears,
                                          therefore, that thc outer half-sheet of the preliminary
                                          gathering was not printed by cut-sheet imposition but,
                                          instead, by ordinary half-sheet imposition, the correction
                                          of the outer forme taking place when less than half of the
                                          white paper had been run, and the correction of the inner
                                          forme very shortly after perfecting had begun. </p>
