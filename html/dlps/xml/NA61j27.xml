                        <title>Letter from Adelaide E. Case to Charles N. Tenney</title>
                    </bibl>
                </head>

                <p>Adelaide E. Case (Addie) writes to Charles N. Tenney (Charlie), of Company H, of
                    the 7th Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry. Tenney entered the service on April
                    25th, 1861, for 3 months. He then mustered out and reenlisted on June 20th,
                    1861, for 3 years. He was wounded in the Battle of Kernstown, Virginia (March
                    23rd, 1862). He returned to duty and died of dysentry at Harper's Ferry,
                    Virginia on June 14th, 1863. In Addie's letter of October 27th, 1861, she writes
                    about a recent death in her home town of Mecca, Ohio and reflects on the
                    uncertainty of life. Her letter is flirtatious and playful. She talks, for
                    example, about another man's interest in her--a member of Tenny's regiment--and
                    says that she would rather be courted by Charlie. She also reflects on whether
                    women prefer flattery to other forms of attention. And she tells him about going
                    to a Ball for the 6th Ohio Cavalry, which she enjoyed, and asks him to guess who
                    she would rather have been with.</p>

                    </salute>

                </opener>

                <p> I again had<lb/> the pleasure of perusing one of your kind<lb/> and interesting
                    letters last saturday<lb/> and I can assure you that it afforded<lb/> much
                    pleasure. Charlie if you could <unclear>witness</unclear><lb/> the eagerness with
                    which I grasp your<lb/> letters you would not hesitate to<lb/> leave your work
                    to write to me. But<lb/> of course I would not ask you to<lb/> if you could not
                    do so with <unclear>convenience</unclear>.<lb/> I think you must have
                    received<lb/> another letter from me since you wrote<lb/>
                    <unclear/> about the 12th of this month.<lb/> This is a beautiful day rather
                    cool<lb/> but not more so than we should expect<lb/> for the season. Mr.
                        James <unclear>Beebe</unclear> of <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0306"/>
                    Ohio Seventh is here. I do not feel so<lb/> much like entertaining him as I do<lb/>
                    <unclear/> Tenney of said <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> and<lb/> therefore
                    act accordingly. He is trying<lb/> to guess who I am writing to<lb/></p>

                <p>There has been quite a<unclear>bereavment</unclear><lb/> in one of the families
                    of Mecca lately<lb/>
                    <unclear>Perry Barton</unclear> of whom
                        I <unclear>mean</unclear> was <unclear>married</unclear><lb/> or, rather,
                    entered <unclear/> into the<lb/> blissful state of matrimony<lb/> about four
                    weeks ago and Saturday<lb/> morning he was found dead in his<lb/> bed. He died
                    in a fit of <unclear>apolexy</unclear><lb/> His brother died about three years
                    ago<lb/> and now as he <unclear>had</unclear> arrived at the<lb/> same age that
                    his brother was, he too is<lb/> cut down. How strange is life and how<lb/>
                    uncertain.</p>

                <p>So you imagined that I would think<lb/> you was writing <unclear/>, did you.<lb/>
                    Well Charlie I know just how much<lb/> flattery and sentimentality to
                    believe<lb/> It is an old saying<del hand="h1">that</del>and <unclear/>
                    <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0307"/> too true that it is natural<lb/> for
                    women to desire<del hand="h1">be</del> some<lb/> flattery. But in many
                    instances<lb/> it fails to prove its self at least<lb/> it does with me for "I
                    had rather<lb/>
                    <unclear>kissed</unclear> than flattered &amp; as the "old<lb/> maids, say.
                    Do not <unclear>turn</unclear> and say "I <unclear>dont</unclear><lb/> doubt that"
                    will you Charlie I feel as<lb/> if you, or I mean, I would enjoy singing<lb/> a
                    little while would you come and assist<lb/> me. Got a cold, did you say? Oh well
                    then<lb/> I will excuse you I attended a<lb/> Union ball last
                        Friday <unclear>evening</unclear><lb/> given in honor of the Sixth Ohio
                    Cavalry<lb/> which will soon go to Warren I enjoyed<lb/> myself very well but
                    should have been<lb/> better pleased if some of my absent<lb/> friends had been
                    present I will<lb/> allow you to guess who I mean</p>

                <p> Oh Charlie I have a compliment<lb/> for you from your Captain. He<lb/> said that
                    Charlie Tenney (do you know<lb/> the gentleman) was the (now prepare for <pb
                        n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0308"/> the worst) best boy--I mean one of<lb/>
                    the best boys in the Regiment </p>

                <p>There I would that I could be there<lb/> and see you turn pale with
                        surprise <unclear>(ahem</unclear> But Dear Charlie I guess you will say<lb/>
                    that I am writing the nonsense<lb/> and you the sense <unclear>wont
                    you?</unclear>
                </p>

                <p> But I will be obliged to close<lb/> for tea is ready will you walk out<lb/> and
                    sup with us? I wish you could.<lb/>
                </p>

                <closer> Take good care of your health And may<lb/> may heaven spread her
                        protection <unclear>over</unclear><lb/>
                    <unclear>thee</unclear>, Dear Charlie, Is the heartfelt<lb/> prayer of your friend<lb/>
