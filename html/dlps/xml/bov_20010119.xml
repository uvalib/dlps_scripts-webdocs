                    AND DIRECTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS RECOMMENDATIONS</head>
                <p>The following resolution was adopted:</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, at its meeting on <date value="2000-02-26">February 26, 2000</date>, the
                    Board of Visitors directed the University Administration to seek ways to promote
                    the good health and strength of the fraternity and sorority systems; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Fraternity Working Group, appointed by the President and composed of
                    students, faculty, alumni and administrators, began work shortly thereafter with
                    the Dean of Students as chair; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Fraternity Working Group has submitted its report and
                    recommendations to the Board, the President and the Executive Vice President and

                <p>RESOLVED that the Board accepts the report of the Fraternity Working Group and
                    commends the members of the Group and the Dean of Students for their
                    comprehensive effort to consider ways to strengthen the fraternity system. In
                    accepting the recommendations of the Group, the Board affirms its support for
                    the values of the fraternity system at the University and acknowledges the
                    importance of fraternity life for students and alumni;</p>

                <p>RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board wishes to emphasize, without equivocation, the
                    conclusion of the Fraternity Working Group that the measures recommended for
                    strengthening the fraternity system can succeed only through the combined
                    efforts of the University Administration and the active and alumni members of
                    the fraternities; financial resources must be contributed by each and the active
                    and alumni fraternity members must bear responsibility and accountability for
                    the upkeep of their houses which the University has helped renovate; and</p>
                <p>RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board directs the President to work toward the goals of the
                    Fraternity Working Group, expressed in their report, and to commit the
                    Administration to exert its best efforts, in partnership with the fraternity
                    alumni, to secure the funding necessary to implement the recommendations of the
