            Well, I’m elected.  The
            Major gave me the once over and
            said I would have to be evacuated
            immediately for any more delay would
            mean an abscess [sic].  Seems that
            am being taken to hospital at
            Bar le Duc this afternoon and
            I do not know what they’ll
            do with me after that.  Will
            keep you posted.  Seems its
            a question of 2 or 3 weeks.  Damn
            shame and my new machine ready
            and waiting.
            </p><p>
            Johnson pulled off an attack
            and had good position but spring
            of mitrailleuse release broke.
            </p><p>
            I gave Norman the hell
            of a call down at supper last 
            night.  He denied the “Cowden to 
            be shot rumor.”  Says all he
            had against you was that you
            wanted to send cable about Cowden
            being in jail.  That it hurt escadrille<unclear>[.]</unclear>
            
            over
            
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            I gave him the hell of a call down
            and put in all the details you
            wanted.
            </p><p>
            I haven’t seen him to day.
            He was out in morning and
            claims to have brought down a
            Boche.  He acted like a wild
            man on landing, turned summersault [sic]
            and yelled.  Boche was so far
            in lines no one saw him.
            Don’t know if it will be official
            or not but any way Norman
            beat it immediately on permission<unclear>[.]</unclear>
            </p><p>
            I inclose [sic] a letter to my
            sister for Pechkoff.
            </p><p>
            Norman will probably look
            you up to apologize.
            </p><p>
            Heard from Page.  Seems Eyre 
            had written Page asking him if
            he would take article written by
            one of us and Page asked
            him to have me do it.  Looks
            
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            as if Eyre had stated it in
            wrong way to me.
            </p><p>
            Nothing new.  Will drop
            you a line from the hospital.
            </p><p>
            Tell Kiffin to play safe
            and not get in my fix.
