            <salute>Dear Marcelle:</salute>
        		</opener>	
            
            <p>
            I was mighty glad
            to get your letter but sorry
            to know you aren’t feeling
            exactly right.  Those depressed
            feelings come to me too and
            I cannot find the source of 
            them.  I felt rather badly
            this morning too until I
            entered and found your letter
            and a letter from Betty’s
            mother telling me that her 
            daughter had shown marked
            improvement.
            </p><p>
            They tell me I am to
            be sent to the reserve as
            soon as my perfectionment on
            the Nieuport is finished.  I
            have done more than is called
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0291" n="[2]"/>
            
            for and am only waiting for 
            Lieut. Chavane to return from
            permission before leaving for
            Plessis-Belleville.  I believe I
            shall have to go directly thru [sic]
            but trust I can get a day
            or two in Paris afterwards.
            I certainly want to see you,
            Marcelle.
            </p><p>
            It seems queer being the
            first to leave over at
            the Nieuport place.  I remember
            so well when I was on
            the Morane there and looked
            up to the Nieuport men.
            Then when on the Nieuport
            23 meter I looked up to
            those on the 18 meter and
            the men that were leaving
            for Belleville I regarded as
            regular pilots.  Now that
            I’m first in the school
            I don’t feel as if I knew [sic]
            much about flying.  Thank
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0290" n="[3]"/>
                        
            goodness I won’t have to
            be perfectioned at Belleville
            and wait around the way
            others have tho [sic] I believe
            that if I am given a 13
            meter I’ll have to put in
            a certain number of hours
            on it.
            </p><p>
            It was nice of 
            Mary Lines to write me in
            detail about Betty’s condition.
            Hope to see her in Paris
            and thank her personally.
            Speaking of Paris I feel a
            sort of shame at going
            there after the exhibition
            I gave the last time I 
            was in the city.
            </p><p>
            Hope to see you in
            a few days.
            </p><p>
            Didn’t you get the photos
            I sent you?
            </p>
