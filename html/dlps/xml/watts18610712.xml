                    I must<lb/>
                    send you again a few words this week<lb/>
                    to let you know of my continued safety,<lb/>
                    th'o I've not recd y'r reply to my last week's<lb/>
                    letter sent from Middleburg.  My mind so<lb/>
                    frequently turns to you both all hours<lb/>
                    of the day, that I can scarcely refrain from<lb/>
                    leaving my work and going over to see you<lb/>
                    But as long as I can labor, I feel that<lb/>
                    I ought to remain and attend, for the<lb/>
                    time may come very soon when I shall<lb/>
                    be compelled to leave.  We are daily <reg orig="ex-|pecting">expecting</reg><lb/>
                    battles to come off on both sides<lb/>
                    of us and the number of the enemy <lb/>
                    opposed to both our armies is much larger<lb/>
                    than ours; but if God be with us as I<lb/>
                    think he is, we will I trust be <reg orig="victori-|ous">victorious</reg><lb/>
                    &mdash; When Pattersons troops came into<lb/>
                    Martinsburg, they commenced plundering and<lb/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002755_0006" n="[page 2]"/>            
                    when they reached the house of a Mr Boyd<lb/>
                    no one was there to defend it but Miss<lb/>
                    Boyd who fired a Pistol five times, killing<lb/>
                    three and then went to work with a <lb/>
                    Buoy <unclear>Knife</unclear> &mdash; but they soon took her <reg orig="pris-|soner">prisoner</reg><lb/>
                    and I am afraid they will deal <reg orig="hard-|ly">hardly</reg><lb/>
                    with her &mdash; It is very hard to study these<lb/>
                    times of excitement my children, yet you<lb/>
                    must try not to give way to indolence, but<lb/>
                    the first thing every morning except Saturdays<lb/>
                    &amp; Sundays, refresh yr'selves with y'r regular<lb/>
                    lessons.  You much forget y'r French Bettie,<lb/>
                    and you will certainly do it, unless you<lb/>
                    review every day &mdash; You too Winkie must<lb/>
                    be sure to study y'r lessons also &mdash; Spend the<lb/>
                    two hours in studying and then sew &amp;<lb/>
                    knit as much as you can, after a <reg orig="rea-|sonable">reasonable</reg><lb/>
                    time for play.  Four hours to<lb/>
                    work and two hours for study must <lb/>
                    be the rule &mdash; I had a very unpleasant<lb/>
                    dream in which you &amp; Wink played a <lb/>
                    part the other night, and tho' you were <lb/>
                    in great danger, neither was hurt.  I awaked<lb/>
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002755_0007" n="[page 3]"/>
                    after it and felt very unpleasant, but<lb/>
                    concluded that it resulted from overeating<lb/>
                    myself at dinner &amp; supper, evening previous<lb/>
                    You two must be guarded in eating and<lb/>
                    particular about y'r knives &amp; forks in<lb/>
                    holding them.  Winkie don't be so fond of<lb/>
                    slipping off to talk with the little chaps<lb/>
                    You are too fond of this, and must try<lb/>
                    to love books &amp; other company better.<lb/>
                    13<hi rend="super">th</hi>.  Well, I reached Helmswood to<lb/>
                    day and was very glad to find yr two<lb/>
                    letters Bettie, altho' you took less<lb/>
                    pains than usual in writing them.<lb/>
                    Wink why did you not write and ask<lb/>
                    about going foot-bare yrself?  I would<lb/>
                    prefer y'r wearing y'r shoes my <reg orig="daugh-|ter">daughter</reg><lb/>
                    as you are rather large, tho' if<lb/>
                    y'r grand Ma agrees to it, I will say<lb/>
                    nothing.  You send love to on unknown<lb/>
                    person Bettie and I delivered it, and<lb/>
                    she requests me to give her love to <lb/>
                    Bettie <add place="top" hand="author">&amp; Winkie</add>. 
                    As to fulfilling y'r wish my<lb/>
                    daughters about marrying the person<lb/>

                    whom you mentioned in y'r letter,<lb/>
                    I think it very doubtful, for these<lb/>
                    War times knock calculations of that<lb/>
                    kind in the head. &mdash; The lady is, I think<lb/>
                    worthy of any one and well calculated<lb/>
                    to fill most any position, but you know<lb/>
                    such ladies are hard  to get &amp;C<lb/>
                    You ask me when I will come over,<lb/>
                    If I can get bro Crop to fill my<lb/>
                    appointment  1<hi rend="super">st</hi> Sunday in Aug: I<lb/>
                    will try and come over the Monday<lb/>
                    before &mdash; But don't look for me as<lb/>
                    I may be disappointed &mdash; Be good<lb/>
                    children, both of you and learn<lb/>
                    all you can &mdash; Good night &mdash;<lb/>
