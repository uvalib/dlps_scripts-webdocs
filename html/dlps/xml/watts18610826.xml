                        After leaving you<lb/>
                        Thursday morning with a sad heart,<lb/>
                        I was soon seated on the cars rolling<lb/>
                        away for my distant field of work.<lb/>
                        It had not been long before I heard<lb/>
                        a scream from a young lady seated in<lb/>
                        my rear, after which with convulsive<lb/>
                        sobs she said "Oh my brother is dead"!<lb/>
                        I ascertained from the conductor that<lb/>
                        she was alone &amp; from one of the southern<lb/>
                        states going to see her brother sick at<lb/>
                        S Moore's Alb:  upon enquiring of him<lb/>
                        about the family, he told her they had<lb/>
                        carried up the day before the corpse of<lb/>
                        a young man from that place, when<lb/>
                        she gave the scream &mdash; For one hour<lb/>
                        she cried as if her <corr resp="lsc6v" sic="her"/> heart would<lb/>
                        break, after which she reached her<lb/>
                        destination.  Poor girl I wept freely<lb/>
                        
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002755_0010" n="[page 2]"/>
                        for her. Oh! who can tell the sorrows<lb/>
                        that must ring the hearts of thousands<lb/>
                        on account of this war!  It is thought<lb/>
                        that there are over ten thousand of our<lb/>
                        soldiers sick in the Armies of Manassas<lb/>
                        I reached my destination that night, and<lb/>
                        next morning mounting Billy made for<lb/>
                        my appointment the Grove.  Reached<lb/>
                        Helmswood Friday night and had <reg orig="satur-|day">saturday</reg><lb/>
                        to prepare my sermons for Sunday<lb/>
                        While I write the cannon are booming<lb/>
                        on the Potomac a few miles the other <lb/>
                        side of Lees burg.  They were firing <reg orig="yester-|day">yesterday</reg><lb/>
                        and one of our men from Richmond<lb/>
                        was killed, and some wounded so I hear<lb/>
                        Don't know how many of the enemy<lb/>
                        are killed.  The enemy in small squads<lb/>
                        have been coming over and our men<lb/>
                        have moved to the rises to stop it.<lb/>
                        Well my children, I reckon er'e you<lb/>
                        receive this you will be with Cousin<lb/>
                        Lizzie and at work among y'r books<lb/>
                        I wanted to say more to you, but<lb/>
                        
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002755_0011" n="[page 3]"/>
                        it did not seem to come to my mind <lb/>
                        sad as I felt.  But if you both can<lb/>
                        realize this great anxiety that I feel for<lb/>
                        y'r welfare, you will try to accomplish all<lb/>
                        you can in the way of studying, as well<lb/>
                        demean y'rselves with strict propriety in<lb/>
                        every thing.  Remember my dear Bettie<lb/>
                        what I told you about &mdash; "notions": I could<lb/>
                        say no more, yet I think you understood<lb/>
                        me.  Be particular about y'r clothes, and<lb/>
                        attend to Cousin Lizzie's directions about<lb/>
                        rules of deportment &amp;C  Above all my<lb/>
                        <hi rend="underline">child don't forget y'r prayers</hi>.  Oh! I<lb/>
                        do want you to be an exemplary Christian<lb/>
                        <unclear>now</unclear>. You must not fail to pray because<lb/>
                        you don't feel like it.  That is the very<lb/>
                        time you ought to pray &amp; pray until you<lb/>
                        do feel like it.  May God bless my child<lb/>
                        and help her by his Spirit &amp; cause her<lb/>
                        heart to love the blessed Savior! &mdash; My dear <lb/>
                        <unclear>[-]</unclear> try to keep <unclear>[-]</unclear> temper, and <reg orig="re-|member">remember</reg><lb/>
                        the last words of y'r dear mother<lb/>
                        as she laid her thin hands on both y'r<lb/>
                        
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000002755_0012" n="[page 4]"/>
                        and committed you to God's care.  Oh:<lb/>
                        my child! Are you not going to try &amp; meet<lb/>
                        her in heaven?  You cannot begin the <lb/>
                        preparation too soon.  Y'r heart is now<lb/>
                        young &amp; tender, and it will be easy to<lb/>
                        give it to God now while if you wait<lb/>
                        it will be growing harder &amp; colder until<lb/>
                        all inclination will be gone &mdash; Say y'r prayers<lb/>
                        regularly &amp; read y'r bible, and remember<lb/>
                        y'r father when you both pray.  The times<lb/>
                        are ominous of great events and we<lb/>
                        will need all this religion we can get<lb/>
                        Pray for you'r country, and for the sick<lb/>
                        Soldiers &mdash; Lessburg is <unclear>crowded with men</unclear><lb/>
                        and at Manassas they are burying them<lb/>
                        every day.  My heart bleeds when I think<lb/>
                        of the suffering &mdash; Write as soon as you<lb/>
                        can after getting this, and direct to<lb/>
                        Upper ville &mdash; After that to Hamilton<lb/>
                        Give my love to Cousins J &amp; L &amp; children<lb/>
