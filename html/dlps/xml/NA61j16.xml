      <title>Letter from Adelaide E. Case to Charles N. Tenney</title>
     </bibl>
    </head>

    <p>Adelaide apologizes for not writing and says she has been very busy, including having just
     returned from the funeral of her uncle, "Old Squire Sperry". She recounts the first snowfall,
     lamenting the fact that sleigh-rides and "kissing parties" are not possible because the snow
     doesn't last. She asks Charlie's opinion concerning an incident involving General Fremont and
     remarks that she believes he has been wronged. Although she complains mildly of having to write
     to so many correspondents, she tells Charlie that he is her favorite, and would not dream of
     burning his letters, as he has suggested, but rather saves them in a special location in her
     trunk. She laments the fact that her friend Dora has gone to Colebrook to visit her sister and
     that she will miss her, and she reveals that she shares some passages of Charlie's letters with
     Dora. She admonishes Charlie to take good care of his health, otherwise she would want to
     attend to his needs, which would be quite impossible. She remarks that she has recently been to
     a musical concert, and has learned a new song, &ldquo;Mother Dear O! Pray for
     Me&rdquo;which she would like to play for him. She sends her salutation, calling Charlie
     "Sojor Boy".</p>

    <salute>Dear <hi rend="underline">Friend</hi> Charlie</salute>
    <p>Is not Addie rather<lb/> dilatory about writing to her absent but<lb/> never forgotten
     friend? If you knew how<lb/> busy she had been you would not wonder.<lb/> We have been bereft
     of a kind and<lb/> dear old uncle during the week and<lb/> I have just returned from his <orig
      reg="funeral.">funeral</orig><lb/> You doubtless, while in <abbr expan="North Carolina"
     >NC</abbr> heard<lb/> of &ldquo;Old Squire Sperry&rdquo; as he was <orig reg="called"
      >called</orig><lb/> We feel his loss most deeply but still<lb/> we could not wish to prolong
     his stay and<lb/> see him suffer as he has during the past<lb/>
      <orig reg="month.">month</orig><lb/>
    </p>
    <p>What a dreary dismal day this <orig reg="is.">is</orig> The<lb/> S snow has fell, almost
     unceasingly all<lb/>
     <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0302"/><orig reg="day.">day</orig> It is the first that
     we<lb/> have had and it comes so driving<lb/> as if old winter's anger was roused at<lb/> the
     delay and wished [n]to throw it's<lb/> vengeance on the innocent and <orig reg="receding"
      >recding</orig><lb/> fall. And then you <hi rend="super">know</hi> how aggravating it is<lb/>
     when we are imagining sleigh-rides and<lb/> kissing parties (redicolous) and all
      &ldquo;su<del hand="h1">g</del>ch good<lb/> things&rdquo; to have the snow melt as
     fast as<lb/> it comes. But let us change the <orig reg="discourse.">discourse</orig><lb/>

     will<lb/> demand an <orig reg="investigation.">investigation</orig> I hope so at <orig

     although the latter may be<lb/> a prudent <orig reg="man.">man</orig><lb/>
    </p>
    <p> I almost envy you your situation<lb/> if you have but one correspondent for<lb/> I have so
     many that I often neglect <orig reg="them.">them</orig><lb/> And Charlie is neglected the least
      of <orig reg="any.">any</orig><lb/> I always take pleasure in writing to you<lb/> more so than

    </p>
    <p> Dear Charlie, I see that I have<lb/> made some ludicrous blunders trying to<lb/> write when
     I could not see, but I will<lb/> take it for granted that you have<lb/> excused them and drop
      the <orig reg="subject.">subject</orig></p>
    <p> Charlie, perhaps Addie is not quite as<lb/> deficient in the knowlede of Military<lb/>
     language as you may imagine, although<lb/> I confess my ignorance in that respect<lb/> to a
     great extent still I flatter<lb/> myself that I know more about it<lb/> now than I did one
      year <orig reg="ago.">ago</orig></p>

    <p> I attended a musical concert a few evenings<lb/> ago. You know that I am a great lover of
     music<lb/> therefore it is needless for me to tell how<lb/> much I enjoyed it. I have learned a
     new piece<lb/> of music entitled "Mother dear O! pray for me"<lb/> I think it grand. Would that
     you were here<lb/> I would play it for you. Do you not like the <orig reg="title?"
