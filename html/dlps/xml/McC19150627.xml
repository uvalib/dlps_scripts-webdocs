            Dear Paul:
            </salute></opener>
        		
        		<p>
            I wrote you a letter
            to go in by staff car, and
            then sent a note via military
            post yesterday.  The staff car
            hasn’t shown up yet but when
            it does I’ll send this and the
            long letter sent Chez M. le <unclear>V___</unclear>
            by it.  I have just received
            your welcome long letter and am
            adding a couple of things to
            my other communication.  First
            let me thank you for scaring 
            up the photos.  I must owe
            you quite a bit on the photo
            end, so please let me know the
            amount and I’ll remit while the
            remitting is good.  I’m anxious to
            see the enlargement of the one 
            showing you and myself.
            </p><p>
            Yes, as I said in my other
            letter I [‘wrote’ scratched out] ^heard from the Vicomte.  Please
            let me know if he got my letter.
            I’m very pleased about what you
            tell me concerning his interest
            in me.  It certainly was damn nice of
                        
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            him to write to me, or to
            concern himself about me at all
            for that matter.
            </p><p>
            Its great that Kiffin’s
            getting on so well.  In one
            way its rough for it will mean
            his return the sooner.  God knows
            he’s done ten times his share and
            then some and I should think they
            would insist on his going in
            some branch that didn’t have all
            the odds against one.
            </p><p>
            So you’re not going to be able to
            plan until August?  Well that
            isn’t far off you know and
            besides what the devil difference
            do a couple of months make in 
            the long run.  I hope they pronounce
            you a hopeless reforme so
            you can’t go out and risk
            your old neck again.  I’d hate
            like hell to see you go.
            You may not know it but
            I haven’t a friend in the 
            world I like better than you
            and am damn glad to have
            you say you find me a good
                        
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            pal ~ Eh Mon vieux.
            By the way where in the
            name of Allah did you scare
            up a G.N.E. pin in Paris.
            The old outfit must have
            an international rep.  Must
            look funny to see Jeanne
            (You don’t mind my referring
            to her that way in letters
            do you?) who is French
            sporting a frat pin around.
            </p><p>
            We’ve been having it too
            quiet around here of late.
            Its about the safest place
            in creation for the last 
            few days.  The Germans have 
            been bombarding the 1st &amp;
            2nd &amp; 3rd line trenches with
            210s a great deal, however,
            and the position is very
            uncomfortable.  The French batteries
            have been silent and they’re
                        
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            not firing on them.  Its all
            hard to understand.  A fellow
            I brought down to day told
            me he’d been at the Marne,
            in Ypres and other places but
            had never seen such hot shelling
            before.  We’ve had no attacks in
            a long time either.  Tho [sic] we
            are all up along the line just 
            back of the trenches we can’t hear
            much on account of the lay of
            the land when it comes from the Boches.
            </p><p>
            Sure, I don’t mind about
            the publicity.  Bull em [sic] along
            if you want to,  but don’t 
            give away any stuff that the
            French might complain about
            my having told.  My reputation
            being in shreds, it can’t be
            hurt.  Would like to see a copy 
            of the item if possible.<unclear>[?]</unclear>
