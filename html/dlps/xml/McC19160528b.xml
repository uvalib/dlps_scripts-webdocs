            <p>
            Well after a long wait 
            the two little boards I needed
            came &mdash; and were for an 18 meter.
            I went then to Belfort and
            had a makeshift made, for I’m
            damned if I’m going to wait
            any longer.  I will get away
            to morrow weather permitting,
            going by way of Toul so as
            to fly over the Bois le Pretre
            where I hope to find a Boche.
            </p><p>
            You, of course, know about
            Kiffin and Thaw.  I understand
            Kiffin’s wound is not at all
            serious and that Bill will
            have an easy time of it.  Great 
            that he brought down a
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001108_0165" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            Fokker.  By George its some
            class to do that and
            then get a nice wound
            to go to Paris with.  I
            am looking forward to
            Verdun with great hopes,
            but as I haven’t yet 
            had any practice you may
            see me coming in on a 
            brancard one of these fine
            days.
            </p><p>
            Prince has smashed
            completely and Hall as well.
            </p><p>
            Yesterday I received a 
            letter from Grundy telling
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001108_0164" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            me that the Sun had
            asked for me as aviation
            correspondent.  He wanted to
            know if I were tied up
            and if not what my
            terms would be.  Sounds
            all right but in the 
            nature of things I can’t 
            do up the correspondent
            game to a fare you well.
            I would have to do it
            sub rosa and trust to
            luck on getting things 
            through.  Then too I
            would want to be free
            to do things now and
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001108_0166" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            then for other sheets and
            ^ All aviation stuff of interest direct to Sun of course.
            possibly magazines.  May I
            ask you to do me the 
            favor of making terms with
            Grundy?  You know more
            about how to frame up 
            a good arrangement than
            I do and I’ll leave it up
            to you.  I’ll write Grundy
            in this same mail explaining.
            One of the main things is
            getting the filthy lucre on
            this side and not waiting
            for publication las bas.  Don’t 
            let anyone know &mdash; not even
            Kiffin &mdash; for they might
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001108_0167" n="[p.5]"/>
            
            raise hell.  Cowden while
            thirsty for printers ink
            doesn’t want anyone else
            as a mouth piece.  He wants
            to ring all the gongs
            himself at once.
            </p><p>
            I understand we are
            to get 20 % of moving
            picture returns but I’ll
            bet we never see it in
            a million years.
            </p><p>
            Do you know if they
            have bought Betty back
            to Paris yet?

            Must chase on down to
            the field now and see 
            about the Bibe so
            until the next.
