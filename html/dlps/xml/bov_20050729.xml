                    DISCUSSION OF THEIR WORK PLANS FOR ACHIEVING THESE GOALS</head>
                <p>The first item on the Agenda was a discussion, in Open Session and
                    led by the respective Board Committee chairs, on the goals of their committees
                    and their work plans for achieving these goals. The written statements of these
                    goals and work plans are on file in the Board Office. </p>
                <p>At the conclusion of the Chairs’ reports, the Rector gave brief
                    summations and then suggested additional items some of the Committees might want
                    to consider. These were as follows: </p>
                <p>Buildings &amp; Grounds: the Committee should provide the Board with a list
                    of University building projects, projected and in progress. </p>
                <p>Diversity: the procurement goals of the Committee should be revisited at the
                    winter meeting of the Board and possibly restated. The Committee should present
                    to the Board at the fall meeting a plan for this reconsideration. </p>
                <pb n="6959"/>
                <p>Educational Policy: issues of student advising should be a goal of the Committee;
                    also graduate student funding. </p>
                <p>External Affairs: the Committee should examine questions of diversity on the
                    Foundation boards and the Foundation guidelines must be reviewed with this in
                    mind. A plan to educate students in the importance of stewardship before their
                    fourth year is to be developed. Mr. Sweeney is to address the importance of
                    small gifts in the next report of this Committee to the full Board. </p>
                <p>Finance: the diversity of firms the University does business with should be a
                    concern of the Committee. </p>
                <p> MCOB: “Land use” for the Medical Center must be considered by the Committee. </p>
                <p>Student Affairs: consideration of graduation rates for athletes should be among
                    the Committee’s goals. The Committee should work with the External Affairs
                    Committee on questions of funding for athletics. A work plan for the athletics
                    portion of the Committee’s work plan must be done. Consideration of alcohol and
                    drug programs should be among the Committee’s goals. </p>
                <p>Wise: Information is needed on diversity at Wise. Mr. Prior will have to approve
                    the Committee’s goals once he arrives to take up his duties as Chancellor. </p>

                <p>The President, citing examples he had observed on recent trips to
                    Southeast Asia, led a brief discussion on the growing importance of American
                    universities’ presence abroad, particularly in Southeast Asia. Typically, he
                    said, these consist of programs established in cooperation with host
                    governments. More and more, American universities in the top rankings are
                    establishing such programs. </p>
                <p>He concluded that the University must think of new ways of

                <p>WHEREAS, the President of the United States, in Homeland Security
                    Directive (HSPD)-5, directed the Secretary of the Department of Homeland
                    Security to develop and administer a National Incident Management System, which
                    would provide a consistent nationwide approach for Federal, State, and local
                    governments to work together more effectively and efficiently to prevent,
                    prepare for, respond to and recover from domestic incidents, regardless of
                    cause, size or complexity; and </p>
                <p>WHEREAS, it is necessary and desirable that all Federal, State, and
                    local emergency agencies and personnel coordinate their efforts to effectively
                    and efficiently provide the highest levels of incident management; and </p>
                <p>WHEREAS, to do this, it is critical that Federal, State, and local
                    organizations utilize standardized terminology, standardized organizational
                    structures, <pb n="6967"/> interoperable communications, consolidated action
                    plans, unified command structures, uniform personnel qualification standards,
                    uniform standards for planning, training, and exercising, comprehensive resource
                    management, and designated incident facilities during emergencies or disasters;
                    and </p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the National Incident Management System operational
                    standards will improve the University's ability to utilize federal funding to
                    enhance local agency readiness, maintain first responder safety, and streamline
                    incident management processes; and </p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks recommended
                    adoption of a standardized Incident Command System; </p>
                <p>RESOLVED, that the National Incident Management System is
                    established as the University of Virginia standard for incident management. </p>
