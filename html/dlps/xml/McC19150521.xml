            Honestly I didn’t complain
            to Rockwell about the number
            of times you had written.  I
            remarked at the time I
            sent him the comment that
            you hadn’t written at all.
            You hadn’t up until then,
            you know.  You’ve been very
            sweet about letting me hear
            from you and I appreciate
            it thoroughly.  Besides even
            if I was disappointed I
            would never say so to you
            or ask you to write more.
            I’ve had three letters from 
            you now and I’ve spent
            three happy weeks reading
            and rereading them.
            </p>

            Poor old Paul Rockwell
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0072" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            is having a hard time
            of it.  First his fiancee
            gets ill and then his
            brother is wounded.  Still
            taking everything into
            consideration I think his
            brother’s case is fortunate.
            He was in a terrible fight
            at Arras.  The regiment fought
            for five hours.  The whole
            thing was wiped out with
            the exception of two hundred,
            all of whom were wounded.
            Kiffin was lucky to be
            in the two hundred, and
            still more fortunate in
            getting wounded only by
            a bullet.  He’s at <unclear>Reimes [sp?]</unclear>
            now in Bretagne.  I
            suppose I’ll get it worse
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0073" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            than that before we
            finish, but of course
            one cannot tell.
        		</p>

            Curtin will give you 
            news of us soon.  He’s
            leaving for America as
            soon as he can get
            his discharge.  His
            family has recalled him.
            I hate to see him go for
            I like him immensely.
            He has come nearer to
            getting killed than any of
            us.  A 220 shell hit
            ten feet from him but
            failed to detonate.  If it
            had we would have peeled
            him off the wall and
            sent him home in an 
            envelope.  He will leave in about
            two weeks.
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0074" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            Two fellows and I are
            to start a service in a 
            few days that I think is
            unique.  We are to take
            the place of the stretcher
            two wheeled carts and run
            up into the woods
            getting the wounded and
            taking them to the different
            Postes de Secours.  Our ambulance
            will then take them to
            hospitals as usual.  We
            come in for a bit of
            rifle fire on the route.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            Rockwell wrote me 
            saying he hadn’t seen you
            and added “I wish to see
            her tho [sic] for she is a 
            dandy girl.”  Our tastes are
            congenial you will please note.
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0075" n="[p.5]"/>
            
            Both Curtin and Lovell
            feel ashamed that they 
            haven’t written to you
            but it is very hard
            to find the time.  Six
            new cars and drivers
            are here now and we
            may have more leisure.
            The new crowd is beginning
            the regular Oh - lead - me - to
            the -shells, - and - I’ll -stand
            on -the - roof, talk.  Wait.
            The little ones, the 77s aren’t
            so bad, but when the
            marmites come in its a 
            different story.  One landed
            on a house two nights
            ago and after that there
            wasn’t anything that 
            resembled a house.
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0076" n="[p.6]"/>
            
            Rockwell is going back
            to the front in three
            months, I am sorry to say.
            He insists on another
            whack at the brutes.
