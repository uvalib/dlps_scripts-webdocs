                <p>The Secretary reported that Dr. Vaughan, as Chair of the Medical
                    Center Operating Board, was authorized by the MCOB at its May meeting to approve
                    credentialing and recredentialing actions when approval is needed between
                    meetings of the MCOB. <name>Dr. Vaughan</name> approved a set of actions on July
                    1st, and the listing is appended to these Minutes as Attachment A. No action by
                    the Board of Visitors is required and the listing is in these Minutes simply as
                    a matter of record. </p>
                <p>The first two items on the Retreat Agenda had to do with the
                    operations of the Board, and were grouped under two headings: “How can the Board
                    of Visitors add greatest value to the University?” and “What is – and is not – a
                    Board issue and why?” Discussion on these was done in Open Session and lasted
                    from shortly after 2:00 p.m., until 4:00 p.m., when the Board recessed. </p>
                <p>In discussion, Members concurred that the new format of Board
                    meetings where much of the Board’s work has been <pb n="6495"/> pushed down to
                    the committee level, is the correct approach but that refinements are needed.
                    Thursday and Friday of Board meeting weekends should be reserved for committee
                    meetings. The President suggested that Members attend conferences and programs
                    organized by the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges
                    (AGB). There was a feeling that the Board needs to be concerned more about
                    academic affairs, recognizing, of course, that there is a line in such matters
                    beyond which the Board should not go. </p>
                <p>The Board resumed its deliberations at 4:15 p.m., with a report
                    from the Special Committee on Diversity made by the Committee Chair, <name>Mr.
                        Thompson</name>. <name>Mr. Thompson</name> presented the following draft
                    mission statement: </p>

                <p>The mission of the Special Committee on Diversity of the Board of
                    Visitors is the encouragement and support of an atmosphere at the University
                    that ensures that the diverse elements of the University of Virginia community
                    are treated equally and fairly. The accomplishment of this mission is essential
                    to creating an educational experience for our students to prepare them for
                    productive and responsible citizenship in the world beyond this community. </p>
                <p>The Special Committee defines diversity to include race and
                    ethnicity, gender, disability status, sexual orientation, religious and national
                    origin, socio-economic status, and other aspects of individual experience and
                    identity. </p>

                <p>Board Members suggested several changes and the Chair and the Board
                    Secretary will work these into a new version of the mission statement. <name>Ms.

                    of the Commission on Diversity and Equity, which is being appointed by the
                    President. </p>
                <p><name>Mr. Farrell</name>, the Vice Rector and Chair of the Special
                    Committee on Governance, reported on matters considered by the Committee over
                    the last several months. </p>

                <p> The Board recessed for dinner at 6:15 p.m.</p>
                <p> The Board resumed its meeting at 8:30 p.m., and after adopting the

                    affecting the University, as provided for in Section 2.2- 3711 (A) (7) of the

                <p>The Board resumed in Open Session and after adopting the following
                    resolution certifying that its discussions had been held in accordance with the
                    exemptions afforded by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, adjourned at
                    9:45 p.m.: </p>
                <p><name>Mr. Rector</name>, I move that we vote on and record our
                    certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public
                    business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were

                <p>The Board resumed in Open Session at 8:45 a.m., on Saturday, April
                    12th. There was a short business session during which the Board ratified its

                <p>From 8:50 a.m., to 9:00, the Buildings and Grounds Committee met
                    concurrently with the full Board to consider six Consent Agenda resolutions:
                    three of these were for architect selections, two for the selection of engineers
                    and the last for an easement. The resolutions are listed below (see also the

                <p>The Board resumed, in Open Session, in Retreat at 9:00 to discuss
                    faculty compensation. In preparation for this discussion at the Retreat, the
                    Finance Committee met on July 7th, to consider a report by Mr. Sandridge on
                    faculty compensation questions raised at the June Board meeting. A memorandum
                    summarizing the Committee’s discussions and Mr. Sandridge’s report was
                    distributed to the Board at the Retreat and formed the basis for discussion (a
                    copy of the memorandum is appended as Attachment B). </p>
                <p>The Board is concerned about faculty and staff morale and the
                    effects of salary freezes, brought on by the State budget crisis, on both salary
                    and retirement plan accumulations. There was strong consensus that compensation
                    of faculty and staff must be competitive with the University’s national peer
                    institutions. There was agreement, however, that more information is needed. The
                    administration is to collect this, under the direction of the President and
                        <name>Mr. Sandridge</name>, and report to the Board at the October meeting.
                    The Educational Policy Committee will consider some of these questions at its
                    meeting on August 29th. </p>
                <p>Following this discussion, there was a brief report by the
                    President on the expansion of the Atlantic Coast Conference. </p>

                <p> The Board recessed at 10:25 a.m., and resumed at 10:35. On motion,
                    the Board then went into Executive Session. </p>

                    <p> The Finance Committee asked the administration during the June 2003 Board
                        meeting to determine the cost of moving faculty salaries to the 60th
                        percentile of the SCHEV rankings; and how to provide the funding. During the
                        July 7 meeting, the Finance Committee a) heard a report that supplemental
                        increases of approximately 3.5% each year for three years, in addition to
                        assumed state authorized increases of 2.25%, are needed to achieve the 60th
                        percentile of the SCHEV rankings and b) received confirmation that funding
                        could be provided from a combination of sources. However, to the extent that
                        the increases were funded from local sources, the actual SCHEV percentile
                        ranking would not be impacted. The Committee also received information on
                        companion salary improvement programs for administrative and professional
                        faculty and classified staff. </p>

                    <p> During the course of the July 7 Finance Committee discussion, it became
                        apparent that there are a series of important questions that should be
                        addressed before a decision is made to commit University funds for special
                        compensation increases. The questions deal with priorities, justification,
                        risk/reward, return on investment/relative value added and strategies, with
                        the objective of developing a Board of Visitors policy statement on faculty
                        and staff compensation and a timeline to address the issue. </p>
                    <p> A series of questions that reflect the Finance Committee’s discussion on
                        July 7, is provided below as a basis for further consideration of this topic
                        during the Retreat: </p><pb n="2"/>

                            <item> 1. What resources are required to be marketcompetitive and to
                                influence faculty recruitment and retention, i.e., salary, benefits,
                                laboratories, facilities, graduate students and spousal hiring? Why
                                do we lose faculty and why are offers not accepted? </item>

                                in faculty? What is the academic process for evaluating teaching
                                loads, research productivity and service (advising, committees,
                                etc.)? </item>

                                across categories of faculty and staff on the basis of merit? What
                                performance assessment processes are used? How does the allocation
                                of compensation increases reflect market factors, academic
                                disciplines and historic funding patterns? </item>

                                graduate support, libraries, technology, etc.? </item>

                                ranks and length of service before deciding what actions are

                            <item> 7. Do we purposely invest in faculty resources that are committed
                                to areas of strength and programs where we aspire to be truly
                                outstanding? How are such centers of excellence identified? </item>

                                analyses necessary to reach sound decisions with regard to

                                support faculty and staff compensation? What can the University do
                                to increase the likelihood that the state will replace institutional
                                funds used to address compensation issues? </item>

                            <item> 10. Can we secure reasonable assurances from the state that the
                                University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors will have the tuition
                                authority to support its decision on compensation increases? </item>

                                Committee, what are the relative risks and advantages of each
                                source? To what degree is each source sustainable? If not
                                sustainable or if sustainable for only a limited period of time,
                                what are the University’s options? </item>

                    <p> Each of the questions and discussion topics require data collection and
                        analysis. Each topic calls for careful deliberation. The purpose of the
                        discussion at the Retreat is to identify additional information needed to
                        support the decision process, highlight good quality assurance practices and
                        note processes that should be strengthened. </p>

                    <p> Many of the questions listed relate to academic priorities, programs and
                        opportunities. It is suggested that the Rector consider asking the
                        Educational Policy Committee (or some combination of Committees) to
                        undertake a review and assessment of the underlying issues with the
                        objective of having the Educational Policy Committee provide a status report
                        and, if appropriate, recommendations to the full Board of Visitors at the
                        October 2003, meeting. </p>
