            Ca y est.  So I shall see you in 
            about a month and a half.  I feel
            it my duty to remain here until
            Salisbury’s return, which will be
            within that time.  On my way
            to the school I will be in Paris
            a couple of days at least, and
            if it is not too cold you
            simply must take a day off
            and lead me around Versailles once
            more.  Tell the leaves the must
            not fall until after I leave.
            </p><p>
            I saw a wonderful sight yesterday.
            Boche aeroplanes had been bothering
            us all day.  One was behind us 
            and an anti-air-craft gun was
            firing at it.  The puffs of shrapnel
            were so close and plentiful they
            blended into a long cloud bank.
            Suddenly a fast French chasseur
            plane shot out of the smoke
            and at a terrific speed made 
            for the enemy plane.  He swerved
            alongside and slightly under.  There
            was the whirr of a mitrailleuse
            and the German plane lurched
            forward.  It pointed nose down
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0188" n="[2]"/>
            
            and fell like a great wounded bird.
            A trail of blue smoke streaked in
            its wake.  It was a jolting, flopping
            fall, but very fast, and as it
            turned this way and that in its
            lifeless descent the sun glittered
            on the under side of the flames.
            Down it came.  It was harrowing
            to watch it knowing that tho [sic]
            the pilote [sic] had been killed  the
            observer was probably living.  It
            crashed into a forest.  I don’t
            know why I said it but I turned 
            to Haviland and remarked “Plunk.  They're
            dead.”  The soldiers set up
            a wild yell of delight crying 
            “Bravo!” and clapping their hands.
            The Frenchman, in the same graceful
            machine you see over the ambulance
            swooped downward in a giant 
            circle; a triumphal circuit it seemed,
            and went over the place where 
            the German had fallen.  One of
            our men was in the woods.  The
            machine fell 400 meters from him.
            He said it was terrible.  There
            was nothing left of the machine.
            The bodies of the two German
            captains in the aero were mangled
            beyond recognition.  The engine had
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0189" n="[3]"/>
            
            fallen on the pilote [sic] and cut him
            in two.  His legs were a bit of 
            a distance off.  His liver was
            stuck on the motor.
            </p><p>
            This morning our man guided my
            aviator friend and the one that
            had done the trick to the scene.
            The victor looked at the mangled
            bodies and took off his hat.  He
            seemed sad.  After that he came 
            to lunch with us.  He’s the
            most modest, retiring little fellow
            you ever met.  I had a piece
            of wing cloth from the machine and
            he signed it for me.  I’m glad 
            I’m to be pilote [sic] and not observer
            for then one is killed at the
            start and doesn’t go through the
            terror of the fall.  The observer’s 
            hands were clinched as if he had
            died in agony.  His eyes were wide
            open and staring.  The Boches
            won’t get so fresh around here
            after this.  Its the first one
            brought down within our lines in
            this army.
            </p><p>
            I suppose you are
            working your pretty titian head
            off these days &mdash; but remember
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0190" n="[4]"/>
            
            if you get a chance to write me
            that you can make me very 
            happy by a note, Marcelle.
