            More news of the tent
            section.  News of the tent
            section swapped for clippings
            <unclear>avent [sp?]</unclear> Nona McAdoo seem to be
            the vogue these days.  Well
            the four ring circus has as
            yet no wounded, but six of
            the ambulances have been detached
            and are to be sent up to
            handle the second stage of our
            evacuation work.  They will
            be located at the town where
            we have been taking wounded
            to the train and will run 
            up as far as our former
            base.  They will be allowed
            no further.  We will then

            remain on the front all 
            the time and not get the
            little refreshing trips down to
            the train as before.  Our Zone
            of work along the lines will
            be increased.  I’m just 
            as anxious as I can be to
            run down to D - and
            jolly that crowd of six &mdash;
            territorials, as I shall call
            them.

            Work has evidently agreed

            I hear you are “as charming

            The Pierce - Arrow has arrived
            at last and has nearly floored
            all the Majors along the route.
            Twenty out of the twenty four
            hours its being inspected.
            One hears always the same
            thing and answers in regular
            formula.  “C’est epatant,” seems
            to be the usual comment and
            we come back with “Oui c’est
            doux, c’est leger, c’est bon pour
            des blesses”<unclear>[.]</unclear>

            By the way do tell me
            what Carb is doing.  Is he
            still at Dunkirk?  So many
            fellows have gone back I can’t 
            keep track of them.
