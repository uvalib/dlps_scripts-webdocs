                  D. Block, L. Jay Lemons, and Ms. Jeanne Flippo Bailes</name>. </p>
            <p> The Rector asked for approval of the Minutes of the Board meetings of <date

                  <date value="2000-10-02">October 2</date>; on motion, approval was given. </p>
            <p> The Rector informed the Board of the annual requirement of the Atlantic Coast
               Conference that he certify that the Board understands that "responsibility for the
               administration of the athletics program has been delegated to" the President; that
               the President "has the mandate and support of the Board to operate a program of
               integrity in full compliance with NCAA, ACC and all other relevant rules and
               regulations;" and the President, "in consultation with the Faculty Representative and
               the Director of Athletics, determines how the institutional vote shall be cast on
               issues of athletic policy presented to the NCAA and the ACC." He advised the Board
               that he was signing the certification that day. </p>

            <p> The Rector asked the President to give his customary report. For the first item of
               his report, the President deferred to <name>Mr. Sandridge</name>, the Executive Vice
               President and Chief Operating Officer. <name>Mr. Sandridge</name> announced that the
               University's bond rating by Moody's has just been raised to AAA. </p>
            <p>The President resumed his report with comments on recent national rankings of the
               University. He noted that for the first time since the State budget cuts of the early
               '90's, the University stands among the top twenty institutions in the country in the
               <hi rend="italic">U.S. News and World Report</hi> ratings.</p>
            <p>The President announced that in response to an initiative by the Student Council and
               its President, <name>Mr. Bilby</name>, it has been arranged to open the Clemons
               Library 24 hours a day. After reporting on the searches in progress (Chancellor of
               The University of Virginia's College at Wise, Vice President and Provost, Dean of the
               School of Law, etc.), the President reported on gifts made to the University between

               of individual gifts of interest.</p>
            <p>The meeting of the full Board was recessed at 10:35 a.m., for a meeting of the

            <p>The full Board resumed its meeting at 12:05 p.m., with <name type="present">Mrs.

               litigation or other legal matter that may develop in the course of the Board's
               discussions requiring his legal advice and counsel, including his legal advice with
               respect to student disciplinary procedures, as provided for in Section 2.1-344 (A)
               (7) of the Code of Virginia.</p>
            <p>That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia go into Executive Session to
               review the performance and present and future assignments of senior University
               administrators, as provided for in Section 2.1-344 (A)(1) of the Code of
               Virginia.</p>
            <p>That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia go into Executive Session to
               discuss with General Counsel and consider acquisition of and investment in certain
               buildings and real property located in Charlottesville, where if made public
               initially the University's bargaining position and financial interests would be
               adversely implicated, as authorized by Section 2.1-344 (A) 3,6, and 7, of the Code of
               Virginia.</p>
            <p>That the Educational Policy Committee of the Board of Visitors go into Executive
               Session for the purpose of discussing personnel matters pertaining to the

               discipline, separation and resignation of specific faculty members of the University
               of Virginia, as provided for in Section 2.1-344 (A) (1) of the Code of Virginia.</p>
            <p>That the Audit Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia go
               into Executive Session to discuss and consider with General Counsel the
               recommendations and reports of the University Auditor and Compliance Officer with
               respect to the Auditor's recently completed performance evaluations of University
               departments and programs, where personnel performance of identifiable employees and
               proprietary business data of the Medical Center will be included, as well as
               requiring an assessment of potential liability, as provided for in Section 2.1-344
               (A) (1) (7), (8) and (23) of the Code of Virginia.</p>
            <p>That the Health Affairs Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of
               Virginia go into Executive Session to discuss the performance and appointment of
               specific public officers, appointees and employees of the University of Virginia
               Medical Center; to discuss and be advised on negotiations regarding the Medical
               Center's provider service contracts and reimbursement for clinical services, and on
               amending and implementing its Clinical Information Systems Contract. The discussion
               of these matters will involve proprietary business-related data of the Medical Center
               and its strategic computer systems information and, if made public initially, the
               competitive position and financial interests of the Medical Center would be adversely
               implicated. These items are provided for in Section 2.1-344(A)(1), (7), (8) and (23)
               of the Code of Virginia.</p>

                  <p>WHEREAS, the General Assembly of Virginia passed an act entitled
                     "Commonwealth of Virginia Higher Educational Institutions Bond Act of 2000"
                     (the "2000 Act") which has been or is expected to be signed by the Governor;
                     and</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS, the 2000 Act may be repealed but the Project, as defined below,
                     continues as an authorized project for bond financing through subsequent
                     legislation (the 2000 Act and any such subsequent legislation, the "Act");
                     and</p>
                  <p>WHEREAS, pursuant to the Act, the Treasury Board of the Commonwealth of
                     Virginia (the "Treasury Board") is authorized, by and with the consent of the
                     Governor, to sell and issue bonds or bond anticipation notes of the
                     Commonwealth of Virginia for the purpose of providing funds, with other
                     available funds, for paying the cost of acquiring, constructing, renovating,

                  <p>RESOLVED that:</p>
          
                        <p>Section 1. The Board of Visitors of the Institution (the "Board")
                           requests the Treasury Board to sell and issue bonds or bond anticipation
                           notes ("BAN's") in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed
                           &dollar;4,800,000 to finance all or a portion of the costs of the Project
                           plus Financing Expenses (individually, the "Project Bonds" or "Project
                           Notes," collectively, the "Project Borrowing"). The Project Borrowing
                           will be identified by amount by the State Treasurer upon issuance of any
                           bonds or BAN's.</p>
                        <p>Section 2. The Board (a) covenants to fix, revise, charge and collect
                           a housing fee and other rates, fees and charges, for or in connection
                           with the use, occupation and services of the Project and (b) pledges such
                           rates, fees and charges remaining after payment of (i) the expenses of
                           operating the Project and (ii) the expenses related to all other
                           activities funded by the housing fee ("Net Revenues") to the payment of
                           the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Project Borrowing.
                           The Board further covenants that it will fix, revise, charge and collect
                           such rates, fees and charges in such amounts so that Net Revenues will at
                           all times be sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, premium, if
                           any, and interest on the Project Borrowing and on any other obligations
                           secured by Net Revenues (such payments collectively the "Required
                           Payments"). The Project Borrowing shall be secured on a parity with such
                           other obligations so secured by Net Revenues (other than any obligations
                           secured by a prior right in Net Revenues). Any Net Revenues pledged
                           herein in excess of the Required Payments may be used by the Institution
                           for any other lawful purpose.</p>
                        <p>Section 3. It is hereby found, determined and declared that, based
                           upon responsible engineering and economic estimates and advice of
                           appropriate officials of the Institution, as shown on the Financial
                           Feasibility Study, the anticipated Net Revenues pledged herein will be
                           sufficient to pay the Required Payments so long as the aggregate amount
                           of net debt service on the Project Borrowing actually payable in any bond
                           year does not exceed the amounts assumed in the Financial Feasibility
                           Study.</p>
                        <p>Section 4. The Board covenants that the Institution will furnish the
                           Treasury Board its general purpose financial statements, within 30 days
                           of their issuance and receipt, audited by a firm of certified public
                           accountants or the Auditor of Public Accounts which shall include a
                           schedule of revenues and expenditures for auxiliary enterprise systems.
                           If Net Revenues are insufficient to pay Required Payments during such
                           period, the Institution shall provide evidence of a plan to generate Net
                           Revenues sufficient to make Required Payments in the future.</p>
                        <p>Section 5. The Board covenants that so long as any of the Project
                           Notes are outstanding, the Institution will pay to the State Treasurer,
                           not less than 30 days before each interest payment date, an amount
                           estimated by the State Treasurer to be due and payable on such date as
                           interest on the Project Notes. The Board covenants that so long as any of
                           the Project Bonds are outstanding, the Institution will pay to the State
                           Treasurer, not less than 30 days before each interest or principal
                           payment date, the amount certified by the State Treasurer to be due and
                           payable on such date as principal of, premium, if any, and interest on
                           the Project Bonds.</p>
                        <p>Section 6. The Board hereby approves and authorizes its Executive Vice
                           President and Chief Operating Officer (officer) to execute and deliver on
                           behalf of the Institution the Payment Agreement, to be completed with
                           such changes as the officer of the Institution executing such Payment
                           Agreement determines to be appropriate and in the best interest of the
                           Institution.</p>
                        <p>Section 7. The Board covenants that the Institution will pay from time
                           to time its proportionate share of all expenses incurred in connection
                           with the sale and issuance of any series of bonds that includes Project
                           Bonds or Project Notes and all expenses thereafter incurred in connection
                           with the Bonds, including without limitation the expense of calculating
                           any rebate to the United States of the earnings derived from the
                           investment of gross proceeds of the Bonds, all as certified by the State
                           Treasurer to the Institution.</p>
                        <p>Section 8. The Board covenants that the Institution will not take or
                           omit to take any action the taking or omission of which will cause the
                           Bonds to be "arbitrage bonds" within the meaning of Section 148 of the
                           Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including regulations issued
                           pursuant thereto (the "Code"), or otherwise cause interest on the Bonds
                           to be includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal
                           income tax purposes under existing laws. Without limiting the generality
                           of the foregoing, the Institution will pay from time to time its
                           proportional share of any rebate to the United States of the earnings
                           derived from the investment of the gross proceeds of the Bonds.</p>
                        <p>Section 9. The Board covenants that the Institution will proceed with
                           due diligence to undertake and complete the Project and that the
                           Institution will spend all of the available proceeds derived from the
                           sale of the Project Borrowing for costs associated with the Project and
                           appropriated for the Project by the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Section 10. The Board covenants that the Institution will not permit
                           the proceeds of the Project Borrowing to be used in any manner that would
                           result in (a) 5 percent or more of such proceeds being used in a trade or
                           business carried on by any person other than a governmental unit, as
                           provided in Section 141(b) of the Code, (b) 5 percent or more of such
                           proceeds being used with respect to any output facility within the
                           meaning of Section 141(b)(4) of the Code, or (c) 5 percent or more of
                           such proceeds being used directly or indirectly to make or finance loans
                           to any persons other than a governmental unit, as provided in Section
                           141(c) of the Code. The Institution need not comply with such covenants

                           procurements. The Medical Center department authorized to undertake these
                           procurements is Materiel Support Services. These procedures implement the
                           Board requirements and those of Chapters 933 and 995 of the 1996 Virginia
                           Acts of Assembly. These procedures shall be effective for all University
                           procurements on behalf of the Medical Center thirty(30)days after the
                           date transmitted to the President and the Board. These procedures are to

                           division of Materiel Support Services, and they shall apply to the

                           and engineering services, by the University on behalf of the Medical

                        <p>In connection with Medical Center procurements and the processes
                           leading to award of contracts, the Medical Center shall adhere to the
                           following principles and guidelines:</p>
                           <list>

                              <item> 1. The Medical Center shall seek and ensure competition to the
                                 maximum practical degree, taking into account the size of the
                                 anticipated procurement, the term of the resulting contract, and
                                 the likely extent of competition.</item>
                              <item> 2. The Medical Center shall conduct all procurements in a fair
                                 and impartial manner, avoiding any impropriety or appearance of any
                                 impropriety.</item>
                              <item>3. The Medical Center shall make procurement rules clear in
                                 advance of any competition to the extent practicable.</item>
                              <item>4. The Medical Center shall provide access to all qualified
                                 vendors, firms, and contractors (collectively referred to as
                                 vendors), with no potential bidder or offeror excluded arbitrarily
                                 or capriciously, while allowing flexibility to engage in
                                 cooperative procurements and to meet the special needs of the
                                 Medical Center.</item>
                              <item>5. The Medical Center shall ensure that specifications for
                                 procurements are fairly drawn so as to not favor unduly a
                                 particular vendor.</item>
                              <item> 6. The Medical Center shall support the goal of the procurement
                                 process to provide for the exchange of information between the
                                 Medical Center, the remainder of the University, and vendors,
                                 firms, or contractors concerning the goods or services sought and
                                 offered while preserving the confidentiality of proprietary
                                 information.</item>
                           </list>

                        <p>These principles and guidelines shall be adhered to and incorporated
                           into the procurement process as outlined in the following
                           procedures.</p>

                  <head type="sub">C. Methods of Contractor Selection</head>

                        <p>All contracts with nongovernmental contractors for the purchase of
                           goods or services shall be awarded by one of the following methods. In
                           all instances, competition should be sought to the maximum practical
                           degree, but no contract award will be reversed based upon the method of
                           contractor selection used. Written records of all procurements shall be
                           maintained. Vendors may be prequalified for particular types of contracts
                           at the discretion of Medical Center Purchasing.</p>
                        <list>

                              <item>1. Small Procurements. Procurements of goods or services to be
                                 obtained at anticipated prices of &dollar;30,000 or less may be
                                 undertaken by any method reasonable under the circumstances, given
                                 the complexity of the transaction, the likely extent of
                                 competition, the term of the contract and the needs of the
                                 requesting department. Methods include informal bidding, including
                                 telephone or other quotes, competitive sealed bidding, competitive
                                 negotiation and sole source. Negotiation with any vendor is
                                 permitted and encouraged, and the agreed price should in all
                                 instances be reasonable under the circumstances. Written records of
                                 sources solicited and prices should be maintained.</item>
                              <item> 2. Procurements Over &dollar;30,000. Procurements of goods and
                                 services anticipated to be priced at more than &dollar;30,000
                                 should be made with such competition, including public notice, as
                                 is practicable under the circumstances. Where requirements are
                                 clear and price is the sole determining factor in the award,
                                 competitive sealed bidding shall be used unless other factors make
                                 this method impractical. In such cases, telephone solicitations,
                                 supported by written documentation to ensure reasonable price and a
                                 reasonable scope of competition, is permitted with the prior
                                 approval of the method and the procurement specifications by the
                                 Director of Materiel Support Services. Other methods may be used as well.<lb/>
                                 <list>
                                    <item> a. Competitive Sealed Bidding. Where competitive sealed
                                       bidding is used, the procurement shall be undertaken pursuant
                                       to an Invitation for Bids ("IFB") which shall prescribe all
                                       relevant contractual requirements, including quantities,
                                       term, conditions, etc. The IFB may be distributed to
                                       prospective bidders identified by Medical Center Purchasing
                                       and notice of the procurement shall be posted in the offices
                                       of Medical Center Purchasing for public view. Other methods
                                       of publication are encouraged where practicable. Variations
                                       of competitive sealed bidding may be used, such as a process
                                       for vendor pre-qualification.</item>
                                    <item>b. Competitive Negotiation. Where factors other than price
                                       are important in selecting a vendor, competitive negotiation
                                       pursuant to a Request for Proposal ("RFP") may be used. In
                                       addition, a system of competitive negotiation pursuant to an
                                       RFP shall be used for procurements of professional services,
                                       as such services are defined in Virginia Code &sect; 11-37.
                                       The RFP shall set out the requirements for vendor
                                       qualification and selection, and describe what is sought to
                                       be purchased. The RFP may be distributed to prospective
                                       offerors identified by Medical Center Purchasing and notice
                                       of the procurement shall be posted in the offices of Medical
                                       Center Purchasing. The competitive negotiation process used
                                       for contractor selection by Medical Center Purchasing shall
                                       ensure that information made available to any offeror or
                                       prospective offeror is available to all other offerors or
                                       prospective offerors. Following evaluation of written
                                       proposals, Medical Center Purchasing shall rank the
                                       proposals, may negotiate with two or more offerors, and may
                                       award a contract upon achieving a reasonable and satisfactory
                                       price and non-price offer from an offeror.</item>
                                    <item>c. Sole Source. Sole-source procurements for procurements
                                       over &dollar;30,000 may be undertaken only after a written
                                       finding that only one source is practicably available for the
                                       goods or services sought, which shall be reviewed and
                                       approved by the Director of Materiel Support Services or
                                       designee. Procurements at auction may be similarly
                                       authorized, based upon a written determination that it is in
                                       the best interest of the University and the Medical Center to
                                       undertake such a purchase.</item>

                                       Center are authorized. To the extent that it is economically
                                       beneficial and lawful to do so, the Medical Center may
                                       participate with other units of the University in the joint
                                       procurement of goods and services, or it may purchase under
                                       blanket University or state contracts. The Medical Center may
                                       also participate in cooperative procurements with other
                                       educational institutions, charitable organizations,

                           President of the University shall (1) designate an individual to whom
                           protests shall be directed, and (2) appoint a Medical Center Procurement
                           Appeals Board to whom appeals shall be directed for review and subsequent

                           experience, one of whom shall be appointed chairperson. The initial Board
                           shall include two members appointed for a term of one year, and three
                           members, including the chair, who shall be appointed for terms of two

                           consider appeals. The Board shall adopt written procedures governing its

                           the provision of information to the vendor by the University, the ten
                           (10) day period shall be tolled upon the vendor's request for such
                           information and shall resume upon the requested information being made
                           available to the vendor. Any protest shall state with specificity the
                           basis of the challenge. Remedies shall be limited to reversal of the
                           action challenged on the basis that it is arbitrary, capricious, not in
                           accordance with law, or not in accordance with the terms and conditions
                           of the solicitation documents.</p>

                           term of debarment, and application of debarment provisions to other
                           parties such as manufacturers or suppliers shall be those set forth

                        <p>Debarment is action taken by the institution to exclude individuals or
                           vendors from contracting with the institution for particular types of
                           goods or nonprofessional services for specified periods of time.
                           Debarment does not relieve the vendor of responsibility for existing
                           obligations.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of debarment is to protect the institution from risks
                           associated with awarding contracts to persons or vendors having exhibited
                           an inability or unwillingness to fulfill contractual requirements, and to
