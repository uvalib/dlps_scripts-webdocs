            <p>
            Thanks for interesting
            letter just arrived.  Good news
            you’re coming up.  Hope to have
            you with us soon.
            </p><p>
            I don’t mean I’m neutral
            in opinion as to the camps here
            but I can’t see any good in
            putting my voice in.  Here’s the
            way I’ve got the outfit sized up.
            </p><p>
            Kiffin, Bill, Chapman et cie [sic] are
            the most serious, Lufbry included.
            They are all one could ask for.
            Prince and Cowden are in it for
            the sport, especially the latter and
            while they do their work, will never
            ring any gongs.  Hall is minus a few
            cogs but runs along in the average.
            Johnson, &amp; Rumsey frankly dislike the
            game and I believe Balsley needs a 
            new pair of drawers when ever he goes
            out.  Hill is a nice sort and I
            believe will try hard.  The only ones
            with the really right feeling are the
            first named.
            </p><p>
            We’ve been trying to get “Skipper”
            out here and I guess he’ll arrive
            soon.  The general run of see-the-
            -war boys from Amerika [sic] are going to
            hurt us like hell by coming in.
            It makes me sore for they are
            (over)
            
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            taking the place of good Frenchmen.
            In other words hurting the cause.
            I feel that way about myself at
            times.  I feel that a French pilot
            would do better than I am able.
            I do not feel that I am a good
            pilot but I cheer up when I
            think that I’m just starting.
            I entered aviation after all the
            crowd here and so being the
            youngest pilot have a little more
            to learn.  At present the only way
            I’m clever enough to get a Boche
            would be to catch him sleeping.
            If he’s awake and shooting I
            can’t dodge well enough to keep
            him from filling me with holes
            as the first chap did.
            </p><p>
            Remember our two mannequin
            friends of a Sunday afternoon.<unclear>[?]</unclear>  I
            dropped Paulette a card &mdash; she was
            the skinny one &mdash; and back she
            comes with a letter asking me to
            look her up.
            </p><p>
            The weather is fierce.  Nothing
            doing for days.  Hope we get some
            change soon.
            </p>
