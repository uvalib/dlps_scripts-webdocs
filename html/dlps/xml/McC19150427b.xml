            Dear Paul:
            </salute></opener>
        		
        		<p>
            Andrew our
            director is out here
            to day and I can
            get a letter back to
            you uncensored.  He
            brought out your
            appreciated letter and
            the photos to me.
            They’re great mon
            vieux, eh?  Let me
            know the damage.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            Well I’ve been
            in it and came out
            O.K.  The French, preparing
            for a violent attack
            in le Bois la Pretre
            at Pout a Mousson, detrained
            train loads of troops
            at our base.  I was on
                       
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            duty here at Dieulouard
            when the shells began
            coming in.  The 
            nearest to us was 30
            yards.  They were
            very high explosive
            shells and raised 
            hell.  Seventeen people
            were wounded and
            there was a call 
            for two ambulances.
            Willis and I volunteered.
            The crowd watched us
            from the tower of
            an old castle and
            the people yelled
            “du bon chance” as
            we went down the
            street.  My blesse
            was in a factory at
                        
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            the side of the 
            track they were
            shelling.  I got
            my car across the
            sidings but couldn’t
            make the main line.
            I had to stop and
            cross over to the
            house.  A shell sizzed [sic]
            down about 75 yds
            off and let go with
            the hell of a crash
            bagging a soldier
            behind a wall.  A 
            group of men were
            inside the house
            crowded against the
            wall.  Another obus
            came in and they 
            ducked.  The poor
                        
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            mangled ouvrier was
            soaking in blood on
            the mattress.  No one
            would help me carry
            him.  Finally an old
            man said he’d show
            me the road around 
            to the door.  We ran
            up the tracks to
            the station.  A shell
            hole was just in
            front.  The blooming
            thing hadn’t gone off.
            We passed the gare
            and made a turn of 
            the factory and I
            was at the door.  I
            loaded the man in
            and got back to
            the hospital.
                        
            <pb n="[p.5]"/>
            
            Willis brought in
            two.  One of his, 
            a young man died
            last night.  Mine may
            live.  That makes 
            four killed and 27
            wounded in five
            days.  So you see
            we’re getting what’s 
            coming to us.  We’ll
            have a worse time
            when they pull the
            big fight at Pont a 
            Mousson where we
            go in shifts of 5
            cars each.  The God
            damned Boche could
            pot us with rifles
            there if they wanted 
            to.  For the love
                        
            <pb n="[p.6]"/>
            
            of Mike don’t tell
            anyone about what
            I’ve written to you
            unless generally, for
            if it got to the
            authorities the whole
            works would be 
            recalled.  The Germans
            shelled until five
            this morning.  They 
            will probably start
            in again this
            afternoon.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            Give my love to
            Mlle. Guerin when
            you see her and
            tell her to drop
            me a line.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            I’m sorry your
                        
            <pb n="[p.7]"/>
            
            fiancee has been 
            delayed in her 
            return to Paris.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            Glad you’re getting
            off some stories and
            I know they’ll make 
            good as hell.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            I rather like the
            outfit here, but
            I’m tired of all this
            damn military stuff,
            saluting about 16,000
            times a day and
            answering fool questions
            for soused soldiers.
            About half the town
            remains pickled all
            the time and grabs
            one around the neck 
            saying: “Come with
                        
            <pb n="[p.8]"/>
            
            me to Le Bois le
            Pritre and we’ll
            kill the Boche.[“]
            I’ve been on my
            good conduct, tho [sic]
            I indulge in the
            most excellent beer
            we have here.
