<p rend="indent">Micajah Woods used this almanac as a daily journal. However, thru the Gettysburg campaign, 
the printed almanac page dates have no relationship to the actual dates of this Civil War Journal. 
The events Micajah Woods are recording in this Journal begin in May 1863.  Therefore, since the 
date on the almanac is 1864 but the Gettysburg campaign occurs in 1863, Micajah must have copied 
his entries from another source. When the actual date is mentioned in this Journal or can be 
determined by the event recorded,  it is enclosed in brackets at the beginning of the entry in 
bold. See also Micajah Wood’s notation on March 31st, 1864.</p>
