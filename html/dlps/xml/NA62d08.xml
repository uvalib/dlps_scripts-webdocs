     that all are safe. She discusses several poems and their authoresses. She expresses her worry
     after hearing of the battle at Winchester. She tells him of several lady friends she will
     introduce him to when he visits next. She wants to know his opinion about her becoming a summer

     <salute>My darling</salute>
     <lb/>
    </opener>

    <p>Happy very happy was I<lb/> last night when father handed me your<lb/> letter of - well <hi
      rend="underline">I</hi> do not know when it<lb/> was written. for it was dated so many
     times<lb/> I think it not necessary for me to fill<lb/> this sheet with expressions of joy and
     pleasure.<lb/> because I was so fortunate as to recieve another<lb/> of your darling missives.
     so I will allow you<lb/> for this time to imagine it.</p>
    <p> Dearest. you say - in speaking of the &ldquo;grand move&rdquo;<lb/> &ldquo;not
     withstanding the &ldquo; Seventh&rdquo; was included we are<lb/> all safe..&rdquo;
     Did you really mean it? was not our<lb/>
     <orig reg="loss">lo&longs;s</orig> at Winchester fearful? Perhaps I did not<lb/> understand
     you.. I too was pleased when you<lb/> wrote me of your <orig reg="success"
     >succe&longs;s</orig> in the &ldquo;letter line&rdquo;<lb/> I love letters it is so
     cheering when far<lb/>
     <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0108"/> from friends to recieve good letters. as you<lb/>
     certainly do <hi rend="underline">if you get mine</hi> (ahem)<lb/> It has been more than one
     week since I<lb/> last wrote you. but I have been from home most<lb/> of the time since then..
     Friday I went to<lb/> Claridon with Dora, and stayed until yesterday<lb/> I am excusable am I
     not dear?</p>

    <p>Charlie. you requested me to send you Laurie's<lb/> poem. &ldquo;A Vision&rdquo;
     Although that was composed<lb/> by Laura <unclear>M.</unclear> Case. still I do not think
     my<lb/> sister. Laura M. Case was the <orig reg="authoress">authore&longs;s</orig>. if
     she<lb/> is she does not tell me so. It is a beautiful<lb/> piece. I will send it to you. I
     intended<lb/> sending the paper but it was destroyed throug<lb/>
     <orig reg="carelessness">carele&longs;sne&longs;s</orig>. but I saved the poem.</p>

    <p>Did you infer dearest from what I wrote of<lb/> &ldquo;Fifty years ahead&rdquo; that
     I was the authoress of<lb/> it? I was not nor do I know who was. but<lb/> I think it was Miss
     Lucy Logan.</p>

    <p>When I see Lucy. I will ask here for a copy of it<lb/> for you. You say you wish me to return
     your love<lb/>
     <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0109"/> as you love. Oh. my darling would that you<lb/> knew
     with what dpeth and tenderness your<lb/> love is reciprocated. yes. <hi rend="underline">would
      that you knew.</hi><lb/>
     <hi rend="underline">I</hi> would not have thought. one year ago that<lb/> any mortal. could
     ever be so dear to me as is<lb/> my idol. my treasure. Can it be that you are<lb/> mortal? I
     feel that your love is not. When I<lb/> think of that wretched week which I passed<lb/> through
     after hearing of the Winchester fight<lb/> I shudder. and wonder how I lived.. Do<lb/> you
     wonder that in the dead of night<lb/> when all was still that tears. which seemed<lb/> to sweep
     away my very heart . would flow.<lb/> and <unclear>murmurs</unclear> such as &ldquo;Charlie
     my darling<lb/> my all why am I not with thee&rdquo; would escape.<lb/> But am I becoming
     tedious? Perhaps I am<lb/> Oh! yes dearest. I will try and enlarge your<lb/> list of lady
     friends. when you come home, which<lb/> I trust will be soon. I have many lady friends<lb/>
      in <unclear>Brumhill</unclear> Co. of whom I never spoke to<lb/> you. There are the <orig
      reg="Misses">Mi&longs;ses</orig> <unclear>Gilbersons</unclear> (please<lb/>
     <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0110"/> ask Will. Braden if he remembers them<lb/> They speak
     of him quite often) also <unclear>
      <orig reg="Miss">Mi&longs;s</orig>
     </unclear><lb/> Belle. Duncan. Lucia Leeland. Libbie Smith.<lb/> Grace Smith. and many others.</p>

    <p>Darling. I wrote to you in <del hand="h1">regard</del> (I meant<lb/> that for regard) to my
     teaching this summer<lb/> Did you recieve the letter: Please write to<lb/> me and let me know
     if you wish me to<lb/> become. &ldquo;school marm&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I have no time to write more now<lb/> dearest for I must send this to the office<lb/> by
     Uncle __ Pa's brother. I have not sent<lb/> your letter to sister over yet therefore she
     probably<lb/> will not write in this. Please write <hi rend="underline">very</hi><lb/> often to
     your own</p>
