            <p>
            It certainly was great
            to see you, even tho [sic] I did
            have but such a short glimpse.
            </p><p>
            Since returning there
            has been but little going on.  Most
            of the flying has been above
            the clouds and those sorties are
            not satisfactory even though pretty.
            Its more like naval work.  One
            feels as if one were manoeuvering [sic]
            in a sea of ice &mdash; snow covered 
            ice.  The tiny machines skirt over
            the glistening surface, dip down into
            holes, disappear behind a tall pillar
            cloud and show up on the horizon.
            Its almost as if one were at sea &mdash;
            I usually am.  There may be enemy 
            machines standing out against the
            white but they are very small
            and you know they are far
            within their lines.  The other day
            I watched a Fokker running back
            and forth like a swift torpedo
            boat.  He was keeping over the
            line of German observation balloons
            afraid that we were going to
            bother them.  What we look
            for are the reglage machines <reg orig="under-|neath">underneath</reg>
            the clouds.  When one shows
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0378" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            beneath a hole then someone dives
            at him.  The little Nieuports turn
            tail up and disappear beneath
            the white like flying fishes falling
            back into the water.  A couple
            of days ago we picqued several 
            times on the Boches but couldnâ€™t
            bring them down.  There were a
            lot that morning and away off
            across the lines I saw the
            black plane of the famous Capt. Bolke.
            The white crosses stand out very
            clearly.  He went further in his
            lines when we went towards him.
            </p><p>
            Kiffin, Hall and Billy were decorated
            to day.  Informal affair which was
            better than having a lot of swank.
            </p><p>
            I hope your mother is already
            feeling better and that you are
            having a good rest.  Be sure and
            let me know just when you
            are coming back.
            </p>

            I found Betty quite weak when I went over

            Have just been up on a false alarm.  Clouds
            made a solid ceiling.
