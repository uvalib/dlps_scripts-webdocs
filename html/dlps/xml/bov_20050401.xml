                        <p> WHEREAS, the University’s existing endowment spending
                            policy, approved by the Board of Visitors in April 2001, must be revised
                            to align with reduced investment return expectations and to allow the
                            University an opportunity to make strategic adjustments from time to
                            time; </p>
                        
                        <p> RESOLVED that the endowment spending policy, effective
                                <date value="2005-07-01">July 1, 2005</date>, shall be as follows:</p>
                            
                        
                                <p> The spending policy calls for a percentage
                                    increase in the annual distribution from the endowment, unless
                                    such increase causes the distribution to fall outside a range
                                    defined as 3.5 percent on the low end and 5.5 percent on the
                                    high end of the market value of the Pooled Endowment Fund. If
                                    the distribution falls outside of this range, the Finance
                                    Committee may recommend either raising or lowering the rate of
                                    increase. The first distribution under the new policy would be
                                    made in January 2006. </p>
                                
                                <p> For Class A shares, the annual increase is
                                    pegged to inflation, where “inflation” is defined as the Higher
                                    Education Price Index or its equivalent. It is set initially at
                                    3.6 percent and will be reviewed in five years. </p>
                                
                                <p> For Class B shares, the annual payout is set at
                                    the level of the June 2005 distribution, until such time that
                                    the payment has been reduced to a unit distribution identical to
                                    that of the Class A shares, from which point the annual
                                    distribution will remain the same for Class A and Class B
                                    shares. </p>
