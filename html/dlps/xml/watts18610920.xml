                    <salute>My dear Bettie,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p rend="indent5">      I have been expecting<lb/>
                    to find a letter from you &amp;Olga since my arrival here,<lb/>
                    in answer to mine sent from Upperville, but thus far<lb/>
                    have been disappointed &mdash; Hope it may come <reg orig="to-|morrow!">tomorrow!</reg><lb/>
                    I know of nothing particularly interesting to write,<lb/>
                    yet must do so in order that paternal restraints &amp;<lb/>
                    love may not be forgotten.  I read a letter from y'r<lb/>
                  G. Father <add place="top" hand="author">J.D.</add>
                  Watts <reg orig="to-|day">today</reg> in which he informs me<lb/>
                    of the death of young S. Turner, and the continued<lb/>
                    illness of Charlie.  Oh! It is sad to see &amp; hear of so<lb/>
                    much sickness among the soldiers!  They are scattered<lb/>
                    all thr'o this neighborhood among the private houses<lb/>
                    Here at Helmswood there are four Mississippians, one<lb/>
                    of whom has been very low with Typhoid fever: the<lb/>
                    others are convalescent &mdash; Lees burg is <unclear>[-]</unclear> with them<lb/>
                    and there are deaths almost every day &mdash; But it is not<lb/>
                    as bad now as it has been with them, for the No.<lb/>
                    of sick is decreasing.  There seems to be no movements<lb/>
                    among our armies at present, and all is expectation<lb/>
                    of a grand move in all parts soon, tho' every thing<lb/>
                    is in the dark to us.  I think Loudoun is pretty<lb/>
                    well defended now as we have a Brigade of soldiers<lb/>
                    among us, sufficient to hold the enemy in check<lb/>
                    About a month &amp; a half from this time, I expect<lb/>
                  
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002755_0014" n="[page 2]"/>
                  to leave Loudoun for Amherst, and shall be<lb/>
                    most glad to see you all and find you both<lb/>
                    much improved.  I have many warm friends here<lb/>
                    whom I dislike very much to leave, but thus it<lb/>
                    must be, and I must seek new ones in a new field<lb/>
                    I hope you are both striving to make good use of<lb/>
                    y'r time knowing that it is very precious, and ought<lb/>
                    to be treasured &amp; improved more than money.  I expect<lb/>
                    much of you both, knowing that you have good minds<lb/>
                    and advantages, which if rightly used, must make<lb/>
                    you useful women.  How are you feeling Bettie<lb/>
                    in y'r religious experience?  I want you to tell me<lb/>
                    of that &mdash; What are y'r greatest besetments &amp; <reg orig="tempta-|tions">temptations</reg>;<lb/>
                    for I know you have them as they are common<lb/>
                    to every body.  Struggle to be a good Christian, <reg orig="perform-|ing">performing</reg><lb/>
                    all your duties; and trust in God for help.  Be kind<lb/>
                    and affectionate to Olga, and don't allow y'rself to be<lb/>
                    fretted.  Be kind to all around you and respectful to<lb/>
                    all persons older than yrself.  I want both of you<lb/>
                    to mind Cousins Lizzie &amp; Mollie in every thing.  Be<lb/>
                    particular in keeping yr'selves neat &amp; clean, washing<lb/>
                    y'r teeth &amp; feet and combing y'r hair.  Don't be rude<lb/>
                    with boys, &amp; when y'r spirits get too high, stop and<lb/>
                    think a little.  Olga, my child, you must not contend<lb/>
                    with y'r sister, nor with any of the girls.  When you<lb/>
                    rise from y'r bed, don't be the first to rush at the <lb/>
                    water but wait for others, and learn to be gentle &amp; polite<lb/>
                    Give my love to both families.</p>
