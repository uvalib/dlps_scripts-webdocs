                <head>SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON DIVERSITY <lb/>2006 - 2007 GOALS </head>
               
                    <p> 1. Development of appropriate language that makes specific
                        reference to the importance of diversity in faculty/administrative hiring
                        and curricular implementation within the Ten-Year Academic Plan that is
                        being formulated by the Office of the Provost. </p>
                       <p>The initial action in this regard that will be taken next
                            year will be the identification of external experts who will meet with
                            the Deans and faculty of each of the schools to help identify steps that
                            might be taken to achieve this goal. </p>
                       <p>A secondary action will be the strengthening of the Carter
                            Woodson Institute through the hiring of a full-time Director who can
                            provide leadership and vision to the unit. </p>
                   
                    <p> 2. Implementation of a Diversity Marketing Strategy</p>
                        <p>A tentative multi-faceted marketing plan is currently being developed by an
                        external consulting firm, and a report with recommendations and projected
                        costs should be available by Fall.</p> 
                        
                       <p>Another action that
                            will be taken to move towards this goal is the forthcoming University of
                            Virginia Symposium on Race and Society, which will provide an
                            opportunity for UVa to be identified as a leading national institution
                            that recognizes the importance of discussing significant racial issues
                            and considerations. This annual forum will provide a venue for such
                            interaction.</p>
                  
                    <p> 3. Identification of specific opportunities to promote
                        diversity at UVa that can be included as a part of the forthcoming campaign.</p>
                           <p>Tentative conversations have already begun about the
                            establishment of ten endowed chairs that can facilitate the enticement
                            of more senior faculty of color to UVa. </p>
                       <p>Other possibilities will be identified at forthcoming
                            meetings of an ad hoc committee that has been established by the
                            Campaign Executive Committee. </p>
                
                <pb n="2"/>
               
                    <p> 4. Direct communication with alumni of color for the
                        purpose of encouraging them to become actively involved in their local
                        alumni chapters. This cultivation of alumni of color would take place with
                        the purposes of having them promote UVa in their local communities as a
                        destination of choice for future prospective students, and ultimately having
                        these alums provide financial support to the University. </p>
                        
                        <p> A communications and action plan will be developed to heighten the
                            knowledge and support, among alumni of current and future activities on
                            the Grounds. The following sites will be the initial targets for
                            reaching out to alumni of color: Washington, DC, Baltimore, Atlanta, and
                            Philadelphia. </p>
                  
                    <p> 5. Consideration of methods to enhance the curricula with
                    additional diversity/multicultural offerings will be undertaken.</p>
                
                <p> Discussions will be initiated with relevant parties,
                            including representatives of the Provost's Office and the Faculty Senate
                            about methods and approaches that can create momentum towards achieving
                            this goal. Since courses of this type are often initiated by faculty of
                            color, increasing faculty and senior administrative hires could increase
                            the momentum in this particular area. </p>
                  
                    <p> 6. Close working collaboration between the Office of
                        Diversity and Equity and the Director of Supplier Diversity to ensure that
                        continued measurable progress is made in the area of minority procurement.
                        The quantifiable objective is to be determined within the next 30 days.
