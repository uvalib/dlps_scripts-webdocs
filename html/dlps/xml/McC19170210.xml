            <p>
            There hasn’t been
            much doing since my
            return, tho [sic] we’ve flown
            every day.  We have orders,
            for some reason or another,
            not to cross the lines, and
            naturally there are not many
            fights.  The other day I went
            over and took a look at 
            Noyou, however.
            </p><p>
            Lieut. de Laage and I
            have volunteered to go “sausage”
            
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            chasing, in case of call.  They 
            asked for two men from
            each escadrille, and as de
            Laage offered his services I
            followed, for I’d do anything
            for him.
            </p><p>
            Biglow is out here now
            and as he is a wonder
            on a piano we have acquired
            one of those instruments.  The 
            trouble is that the Captain
            thinks he can play and
            he drives us all crazy.
            </p><p>
            I had a wonderful time
            in Paris, Marcelle, and I
            
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            have you to thank for
            a great part of it.  I
            appreciated immensely all
            you did for me and the
            time you gave me.  I’ve
            never enjoyed any leave 
            as much.
            </p><p>
            Mrs. Weeks writes
            that she’s coming over
            soon.  I hope so.  Pavelka
            sent me a letter from
            Malta saying he was
            having a great trip.  Fred

            Prince, who’s family object to his 
            being at the front is going to
            Paris to take Cowden’s old job.
            Flying French machines to British
            camps when one feels like it
            and for which one gets 260 fres
            a trip &mdash; filou &mdash; but embusque.
            </p><p>
            Every day I appreciate more &amp;
            more your cigarette case.
