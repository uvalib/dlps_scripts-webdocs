            <p>
            I have just received the
            letter you sent me c/o Paul.
            You see I didn’t stay over
            the extra day for Paris 
            was getting on my nerves,
            and for that reason I
            didn’t get your note.  So
            much the better, for I
            was awfully glad to
            receive word from you
            to day.
            </p><p>
            I suppose that you are 
            very very busy at present
            taking care of our poor
            wounded boys.  Paul writes
            me to the effect that
            there are a thousand beds
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0184" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            in the ambulance.  You
            know don’t you, that the
            remainder of the Americans
            got it in the attack?
            Paul had been occuping [sic]
            himself with that end
            of the worry.
            </p><p>
            I haven’t heard from
            my application as yet &mdash;
            but for one thing I
            do not want to leave here
            for six weeks.  Salisbury
            has had to make a 
            hurried trip to America on a
            family case and before he
            left he told me he was
            counting on Lovell and 
            me to hold things
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0185" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            up.  It would be rather
            a poor action on my part
            to leave before his return.
            He’ll be back in six 
            weeks from to day he
            figures.
            </p><p>
            The issue of Outlook
            with my article was
            sold out and not a
            one can be had in
            Paris, so maybe you
            didn’t see the screed.
            It might interest you
            for it connects up
            many of my letters.
            General Joffre had the thing
            translated, as we have
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0186" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            been informed by the 
            Grand Quartier.  Paul can
            keep you in touch with
            other stuff that’s coming
            out if you care to
            see it.  He has a copy 
            of Outlook too.
            </p><p>
            Mail is fierce these
            days.  Delay of ages.
            </p><p>
            I now couche par terre.
            The days of splendid suites
            are over.  We are so few
            we’re always on duty
            and have to stay at 
            headquarters.  I am satisfied.
            </p>
