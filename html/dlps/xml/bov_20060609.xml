                <head>REPORT BY THE PRESIDENT</head>
                <p> The President said the Governor has signed the restructuring
                    legislation governing the University; the legislation will go into effect July
                    1<hi rend="super">st</hi>. The state budget, however, remains in limbo.</p>
                <p>In the Federal Congress, a $2million appropriation designated for
                    the pedestrian crossing over Jefferson Park Avenue – as part of the South Lawn
                    Project – is in the final House Committee version of the FY2007 Appropriations
                    Bill. The bill will then go to the floor of the House for debate and from there
                    to the Senate.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Virginia Quarterly Review</hi> this spring was nominated for six
                    National Magazine Wards and received two: for fiction; and for general
                    excellence in the under-100,000 circulation category. These awards, the
                    President said, “are the industry’s highest honor, and for a literary journal to
                    receive two awards is exceptional.”</p>
                <p>Turning to the Campaign, the President said the cash flow figures
                    for April are $10.2million, for a year-to-date total of about $192million. Again
                    using figures through April, the Campaign total is $879.9million, or 29.3% of
                    the Campaign goal. These numbers do not include the Ivy Foundation gift of
                    $45million, nor a $5million gift to the Darden and Curry Schools; when these two
                    are added in, the total comes to about $930million.</p>
                <p>The President then told the Board about his travel schedule – in
                connection with the Campaign – over the next several months.</p>

                        an increase of 23% over the same period in the last fiscal year. The

                        School and the Law School all report substantial increases in giving.</p>
                    <p> Among significant gifts which have been made since the April
                        Board of Visitors meeting are a $6million bequest from the estate of
                            <name>Mortimer Y. Sutherland, Jr</name>.; $1million from the estate of
                        Paul Mellon for the Mellon Prostate Cancer Institute in the School of
                        Medicine; $520,000 from the estate of Cornelius DeWitt, III for the College;
                        and a deferred gift of $500,000 for the Jefferson Scholars Foundation.
                        Former Member of the Board of Visitors Mortimer Caplin and his wife, Ruth,
                        pledged $3million for the construction of the thrust theatre; <name>Mr. and
                            Mrs. Caplin</name> pledged another $1million through the Caplin
                        Foundation for the same purpose.</p>

                        $1million to the Darden School Foundation.</p>

                        <p>WHEREAS, on <date value="2005-06-11">June 11,
                            2005</date>, the Board of Visitors approved a resolution committing the
                            University to meet a set of eleven statewide goals as specified in
                            Chapter 4.10, Section 23-38.88 B. of the Restructured Higher Education

                        <p>WHEREAS, the General Assembly in 2006 passed HB346 which
                            added a twelfth goal, “Seek to ensure the safety and security of the
                            Commonwealth’s students on college and university campuses;”</p>

                    <p><name>Mr. Block</name> recalled the Board’s interest in
                        graduate student fellowships and noted that good graduate students are a
                        vital part of the research and education mission of the University.
                        Previously, graduate education at the University had been administered by
                        the individual schools, but a centralized effort was deemed necessary to
                        bring graduate education to the same level of national prominence as the
                        undergraduate and professional schools. Accordingly, in May, 2004, <name>Ms.
                            Roseanne Ford</name>, Professor of Chemical Engineering, became the
                        Associate Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies and was charged
                        with coordinating these efforts.</p>
                    <p><name>Mr. Block</name> introduced <name>Ms. Ford</name>, who
                        gave a presentation on graduate students at the University.</p>
                    <p><name>Ms. Ford</name> made the point that to “rank among the
                        best educational institutions, universities must recruit and retain the most
                        talented graduate students.” Further, “top-ranked universities invest
                        heavily in graduate students by providing consistent and predictable revenue
                        streams.”</p>
                    <pb n="7112"/>
                    <p>She then cited statistics showing the relative rankings of
                        support offered graduate students at various institutions – the University
                        does not rank well in these computations. Graduate student support, which is
                        to say compensation packages, typically includes three elements: tuition and
                        fees, health insurance and stipends/fellowships. Support for students at the
                        University varies among the disciplines: graduate student teaching
                        assistants in Biology, for example, fare better than graduate student
                        teaching assistants in History.</p>
                    <p><name>Ms. Ford</name> made the point that private funding is a
                        significant element in supporting graduate students at some of the
                        University’s peer institutions.</p>
                    <p>The Rector and several other Members commended <name>Ms.
                        Ford</name> on her presentation. <name>Mr. Rainey</name> observed that the
                        needs <name>Ms. Ford</name> outlined are important considerations for the
                        Capital Campaign; the Rector said graduate student support no doubt will be
                        an important part of the Agenda of the Educational Policy Committee in the
                        forthcoming year.</p>

                        are suggested by the department chairs and recommended by the dean of each
                        school. To the extent the annual income from the endowment is not adequate
                        to meet the recommended distribution, the principal of the endowment will be
                        disinvested to provide funds for the approved budgets.</p>

                        increase in the annual distribution from the endowment, unless such increase
                        causes the distribution to fall outside a range defined as 3.5 percent on
                        the low end and 5.5 percent on the high end of the market value of the
                        Pooled Endowment Fund; and</p>
                   
                    <p>WHEREAS, the policy specifies that if the distribution falls
                        outside of this range, the Finance Committee may recommend either raising or
                        lowering the rate; and</p>
                   
                    <p>WHEREAS, the fiscal year 2006-2007 distribution as a

                        for class A and class B shares will be adjusted to 4.0 percent of the market
                        value at <date value="2006-03-31">March 31, 2006</date>, achieving the
                        objective of the payment rate for class A shares that is equal to the payout

                            that of chaotic non-repeatable performances to repeatable mature
                            disciplined software processes. The model focuses on key attributes of

                            used to achieve each level. The goal is to reach an efficient and

                        To help ensure this need is met, decisions affecting these areas must
                        reflect standards, guidelines, and practices found to be effective in the
                        higher education environment. This policy establishes the nationally
                        recognized codes of practice with which the University aligns its IT
                        infrastructure, architecture, and ongoing operations.</p>

                        standards and guidelines align with industry best practices, appropriately

                        endeavors that by their nature may require the use of cutting-edge
                        technology not yet appropriate for normal use. The guidance is descriptive
                        rather than prescriptive to achieve flexibility where needed. The ultimate
