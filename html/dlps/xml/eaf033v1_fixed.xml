                    rise and <lb/> extension after death, prove that his claim to distinction <lb/>
                    are well founded. It is no less the duty than the pleasure <lb/> of friendship,
                    to fortify and sustain these claims. The <reg orig="impar-|tiality"
                        >impartiality</reg>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Charles Brockden Brown</hi> was the highly gifted <reg
                        orig="de-|scendant">descendant</reg>
                    <lb/> of ancestors originally English, who came over to <lb/> this country with
                    the wise and benevolent Penn, and landed <lb/> from the same ship on the banks
                    of the Delaware. Their <lb/> principles, moral, religious, and political,
                    coincided with <lb/> those of their pious and illustrious leader.</p>
                <p>He derived the additional name of Brockden, from his <lb/> uncle Charles
                    Brockden, so respectfully mentioned by <reg orig="Frank-|lin">Franklin</reg>

                    <pb n="iv" entity="eaf033v1_0021" pid="uva-lib:349051"/> in his life, who, to
                    avoid the vengeance of conspirators, <lb/> whose secret conversations he had
                    accidently overheard, fled <lb/> to America, and settled in Pennsylvania, where
                    his industry <lb/> and abilities finally raised him to an important office,
                    which <lb/> he filled with distinguished reputation.</p>
                <p>His parents were pious and respectable members of the <lb/> Society of Friends,
                    and may be presumed to have instilled <lb/> into their beloved offspring, all
                    that simplicity of manners <lb/> and benevolence of sentiment, which so
                    honorably <reg orig="charac-|terize">characterize</reg>
                    <lb/> the religious society to which they belonged.</p>
                <p>He was born in the city of Philadelphia, on the 17th day <lb/> of January, 1771.
                    He had three brothers older than <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>, <lb/> to
                    whom, as well as to every other member of his family, <lb/> he was from his
                    earliest years an object of deep interest, and <lb/> fond affection.</p>
                <p>Of those incidents and circumstances, which, in <reg orig="child-|hood"
                        >childhood</reg>, <lb/> either control the developement or indicate the <reg
                        orig="charac-|ter">character</reg>

                        >distinguished</reg>
                    <lb/> for their talents, and which are not only interesting in <lb/> themselves,
                    but valuable as contributions to the great cause <lb/> of education, it is
                    always desirable to hear. But when he <lb/> whose life they would illustrate,
                    modestly leaves them <reg orig="un-|noticed">unnoticed</reg>, <lb/> the
                    biographer can only have recourse to conjecture, <lb/> or to the recollections
                    of friends. From the facts which <lb/> they furnish he may deduce and infer, but
                    he cannot <reg orig="estab-|lish">establish</reg>
                    <lb/> with certainty. His narrative of these may therefore be <lb/> brief,
                    without subjecting him to censure.</p>
                <p>Of the first ten years of Mr. Brown's life the memorials <lb/> are few, but
                    sufficient. His constitution was unusually <reg orig="deli-|cate">delicate</reg>
                    <lb/> and frail, and his frame slender. Life opened upon <lb/> him with a wan
                    and sickly aspect, and disclosed but <reg orig="doubt-|ful">doubtful</reg>
                    <lb/> prospects of a healthy manhood. The weakness of his <lb/> body was,
                    however, his only weakness. His mind was not <lb/> enervated. There all was
                    activity and strength.</p>
                <pb n="v" entity="eaf033v1_0022" pid="uva-lib:349052"/>
                <p>Debility of body does not necessarily lead to vigor of mind. <lb/> The reverse of
                    this may perhaps be maintained. But he <lb/> whom nature had rendered incapable
                    of much corporeal <reg orig="ex-|ertion">exertion</reg>, <lb/> would almost
                    necessarily be thrown upon his <reg orig="intel-|lectual">intellectual</reg>
                    <lb/> resources for enjoyment.</p>
                <p>This was the case with the lamented subject of this <reg orig="Me-|moir"
                        >Memoir</reg>. <lb/> From his earliest years he was devoted to books and
                    <lb/> reflection. Maps, books and prints were to him, even in <lb/> childhood,
                    objects irresistibly attractive. The study and <reg orig="ex-|amination"
                        >examination</reg>
                    <lb/> of these were the constant and invariable <reg orig="occupa-|tions"
                        >occupations</reg>
                    <lb/> of his juvenile years. His knowledge of geography <lb/> and architecture
                    in his tenth year, was a subject of pride <lb/> and exultation to his friends,
                    and of surprise to strangers.</p>
                <p>He entered the classical school of Robert Proud, the well <lb/> known author of
                    the History of Pennsylvania, in his eleventh <lb/> year, and left it before he
                    had completed his sixteenth. His <lb/> rapid advancement and incessant
                    diligence, while under the <lb/> direction of this gentleman, received, as they
                    merited, his <lb/> warmest commendations. His studies were, however, by <lb/> no
                    means confined to the ancient classics; his application <lb/> was unremitting to
                    the best English models.</p>
                <p>Five years of ardent and intellectual exercise in classical <lb/> studies! What a
                    mass of intellectual treasures may not be <lb/> collected during such a period!
                    What rich materials for <reg orig="fu-|ture">future</reg>
                    <lb/> use may it not afford! Fortunate is the youth of whom <lb/> it may be
                    said, that for five years, he persevered with ardor <lb/> and enthusiasm, in the
                    pursuit of knowledge and the <reg orig="cultiva-|tion">cultivation</reg>
                    <lb/> of his powers. His soul becomes imbued with the love <lb/> of letters and
                    of science, and he is already on the high road <lb/> to distinction and honor.
                    He can hardly become the slave <lb/> of low and grovelling vices.</p>
                <p>Mr. Brown's application during this period, was indeed so <lb/> intense, as
                    seriously to endanger his health; and therefore, <lb/> by the advice of his
                    preceptor, he occasionally relaxed from <lb/>
                    <pb n="vi" entity="eaf033v1_0023" pid="uva-lib:349053"/> the severities of
                    study, and made excursions into the country. <lb/> These journeys he performed
                    on foot; and on account of the <lb/> pleasure and advantage which he derived
                    from them, he ever <lb/> after continued the practice.</p>
                <p>Accustomed as he had been to the confined atmosphere, <lb/> the dusky streets,
                    and unwholesome exhalations of a city, <lb/> the extended prospects, the varied
                    hues, the delicious <reg orig="fra-|grance">fragrance</reg>, <lb/> and the balmy
                    and elastic air of the country, were <lb/> unspeakably grateful and refreshing.
                    Solitary wandering <lb/> leads to thoughtful musing, and this to romantic
                    enthusiasm. <lb/> It would not be difficult to predict the effects which such a
                    <lb/> practice would have upon an imagination ever active, <reg
                        orig="en-|riched">enriched</reg>
                    <lb/> and embellished with elegant literature and various <lb/> knowledge.
                    Habits of reverie and abstraction would be <lb/> insensibly contracted. Present
                    objects would gradually fade <lb/> from the view, and the imagination revel,
                    free and <reg orig="unfet-|tered">unfettered</reg>, <lb/> amidst its own
                    creations.</p>
                <p>He had been diligent in composition before he was sixteen. <lb/> But after he
                    left school he became indefatigable. He wrote <lb/> a variety of essays, both in
                    prose and verse, most of which <lb/> imply considerable powers and uncommon
                    acquisitions, in a <lb/> youth of his age. About this time, too, he invented a
                    system <lb/> of short-hand, and successfully studied French, aided only <lb/> by
                    books.</p>
                <p>But it became necessary that his efforts should be <reg orig="concen-|trated"
                        >concentrated</reg>
                    <lb/> upon a single science. A profession must be adopted. <lb/> The fictions of
                    the imagination, and the enthusiasm of <reg orig="sen-|timent">sentiment</reg>,
                    <lb/> must give place to the sober realities of business. <lb/> With the
                    approbation of his family, he made choice of the <lb/> Law, and became a student
                    in the office of Alexander <reg orig="Wil-|cox">Wilcox</reg>, <lb/> Esq. a
                    distinguished member of the Philadelphia Bar.</p>
                <p>His habits of labor and application, no less than his keen <lb/> discrimination
                    and sound judgment, were admirably fitted <lb/> for his new pursuit, and he
                    entered upon it with his usual <lb/>
                    <pb n="vii" entity="eaf033v1_0024" pid="uva-lib:349054"/> ardor and diligence.
                    He became a member of a law society, <lb/> over whose deliberations he presided
                    with credit and ability. <lb/> The recorded decisions, which his duty as
                    president required <lb/> him to make, evince unusual research, and solidity of
                        <reg orig="judg-|ment">judgment</reg>. <lb/> But polite literature and
                    liberal studies could not be <lb/> relinquished. Law he studied from a principle
                    of duty or <lb/> necessity; but Literature had his secret soul. Though the <lb/>
                    dry abstractions and bewildering subtleties of law, had <reg orig="some-|thing"
                        >something</reg>
                    <lb/> in them which particularly suited his laborious habits <lb/> and
                    speculative ingenuity, his literary propensities were <reg orig="irre-|sistible"
                        >irresistible</reg>. <lb/> He became, at the same time, a member of the
                    <lb/> Belles Lettres Club, whose principal object was improvement <lb/> in
                    literature. In this, also, he became a leader. The <reg orig="vari-|ous"
                        >various</reg>
                    <lb/> addresses which he delivered before this society, are <lb/> creditable to
                    his talents, and indicative of vigor and <reg orig="origin-|ality"
                        >originality</reg>
                    <lb/> of thought.</p>
                <p>During the whole of his noviciate, his pen was in diligent <lb/> exercise. He
                    wrote various essays, some of them of <reg orig="consid-|erable"
                        >considerable</reg>
                    <lb/> merit; and maintained a long and elaborate <reg orig="corres-|pondence"
                        >correspondence</reg>
                    <lb/> with several of his friends. Not satisfied with <lb/> these labors, he
                    kept a minute and copious journal, not <lb/> merely of the incidents and
                    occurrences of the day, but of <lb/> his thoughts, feelings, and reflections. He
                    did this for the <lb/> double purpose of improvement in thinking and in writing.
                    <lb/> Of excellence in style, he was always ambitious, and for it <lb/> he most
                    assiduously labored.</p>
                <p>Of the progress that he made or was qualified to make, in <lb/> the science of
                    law, the decisions before alluded to, afford <lb/> abundant and convincing
                    evidence. His qualifications and <lb/> attainments were unquestionably great for
                    so young a man;&mdash; <lb/> and of moral purity and elevation of sentiment he
                    was a rare <lb/> and signal example. His early associates were selected solely
                    <lb/> with a view to moral and intellectual improvement; for to <lb/> sensual
                    enjoyments and vicious pleasures, he was an utter <lb/>
                    <pb n="viii" entity="eaf033v1_0025" pid="uva-lib:349055"/> stranger. Vice in
                    every shape was loathsome and disgusting <lb/> to him.</p>
                <p>He was now of that age when youth swells into manhood, <lb/> when the
                    dispositions, habits, and propensities of early life, <lb/> become fixed and
                    permanent, or, swayed by novel and <reg orig="un-|foreseen">unforeseen</reg>
                    <lb/> circumstances, assume new directions, or become <lb/> supplanted by others
                    still more powerful. The period came <lb/> when the study was to be succeeded by
                    the practice of the <lb/> law. To this he was decidedly averse. His resolution
                    was <lb/> fixed, and the law was abandoned. Neither argument not <lb/>
                    persuasion could vanquish his resolution. This was not the <lb/> result of whim
                    or caprice. His passion for letters, the <reg orig="weak-|ness">weakness</reg>
                    <lb/> of his physical constitution, and his reluctance to <lb/> engage in the
                    noise and bustle of professional business, were <lb/> doubtless causes
                    abundantly adequate to the production of <lb/> this effect. The last of these
                    originated in that habit of <lb/> romantic and visionary speculation, in which
                    he so much <lb/> delighted to indulge, and of which he gave a striking <reg
                        orig="in-|stance">instance</reg>
                    <lb/> in the essays which he published, under the title of <lb/> the
                    "Rhapsodist."</p>
                <p>In reference to this event he says, himself,&mdash;"As for me, <lb/> I had long
                    ago discovered that nature had not qualified me <lb/> for an actor on this
                    stage. The nature of my education <lb/> only added to these disqualifications."
                    The disappointment <lb/> of his friends was great, indeed, at this abandonment
                    of the <lb/> only path to fame and fortune which seemed to be open to <lb/> him.
                    They reasoned, they remonstrated; but their labor <lb/> was vain. His reluctance
                    was invincible. Not even his own <lb/> sense of duty could overcome it. His
                    friends saw this, and <lb/> were silent. To one so strongly attached to his
                    family and <lb/> friends, of whom he was the pride and the boast, this trial
                    <lb/> must have been peculiarly severe. The effect was soon <lb/> perceived. His
                    spirits sunk almost to hopelessness, and his <lb/> health became visibly
                    impaired.</p>

                <p>The portion of his life, from the close of his legal studies <lb/> till the time
                    of his becoming professedly an author, in the <lb/> year 1798, comprises a
                    period of about six years. Of this <lb/> part of his history, the incidents are
                    few and may be briefly <lb/> told. His literary and scientific tastes were now
                    his only <lb/> resource, and they were indulged without restraint.</p>
                <p>To dissipate the gloom and dejection into which his mind <lb/> had sunk, he left
                    Philadelphia, and after traversing various <lb/> parts of the country, he
                    remained for a while in the city of <lb/> New York. There the joys and
                    consolations of friendship <lb/> awaited him, for his friend, Dr. Elihu H.
                    Smith, was a <reg orig="resi-|dent">resident</reg>
                    <lb/> of that city. By him Mr. Brown was received with all <lb/> the cordiality
                    which the most disinterested friendship could <lb/> inspire. Their intercourse
                    had commenced in Philadelphia, <lb/> while respectively engaged in professional
                    studies. This <lb/> visit was not only productive of pleasure, but of
                    friendship, <lb/> to Mr. B. Through the kindness of his beloved friend, <lb/>
                    Smith, the circle of his friends was considerably enlarged, <lb/> and hope was
                    revived in his breast. He left New York <lb/> gratified and strengthened.</p>
                <p>The impressions he received during this visit, induced a <lb/> speedy repetition
                    of it. The second was longer than the <lb/> first, and from this time the
                    greater part of the period before <lb/> mentioned, was spent by him in New York.
                    His situation <lb/> there was happily adapted to gratify his best feelings, and
                    <lb/> promote his favorite pursuits. Of his new friends and <reg
                        orig="asso-|ciates">associates</reg>, <lb/> many were distinguished, and all
                    respectable, for <lb/> literature or science. With most of these gentlemen he
                    <lb/> was on terms of the strictest intimacy and most liberal <reg
                        orig="inter-|course">intercourse</reg>. <lb/> Many of them were members of a
                    literary society, <lb/> about that time formed in New York, under the modest
                    title <lb/> of the "Friendly Club." Of this society Mr. B. became a <lb/>
                    <pb n="x" entity="eaf033v1_0027" pid="uva-lib:349057"/> member, and frequently
                    mentions, in his journal, the <reg orig="plea-|sure">pleasure</reg>
                    <lb/> and advantages he derived from it.</p>
                <p>By his friend Smith, he was introduced to the friendship <lb/> of Mr. Johnson and
                    Mr. Dunlap, the latter of whom has <lb/> since celebrated the talents and
                    virtues of his friend in an <lb/> extended biography. Between these gentlemen,
                    Dr. Smith <lb/> and himself, an intimacy of the most endearing and <reg
                        orig="confi-|dential">confidential</reg>
                    <lb/> nature subsisted for several years, and was <reg orig="termi-|nated"
                        >terminated</reg>
                    <lb/> only by death. He was an inmate in the family of <lb/> Mr. Dunlap during
                    the greater part of this time; but he <lb/> afterwards resided with his friends
                    Johnson and Smith. <lb/> Mr. Brown was of that temperament that required objects
                    <lb/> for the exercise of the domestic affections. Mere literary <lb/> or social
                    intercourse was not sufficient for him. In the <lb/> family establishments just
                    mentioned, he found ample <reg orig="exer-|cise">exercise</reg>
                    <lb/> for the sensibilities of his affectionate heart.</p>
                <p>Thus circumstanced, his intellectual powers were strongly <lb/> excited and his
                    moral propensities confirmed and <reg orig="strength-|ened">strengthened</reg>.
                    <lb/> That he made large additions to his knowledge may <lb/> fairly be inferred
                    from his known habits of labor and <reg orig="appli-|cation">application</reg>.
                    <lb/> His reading was various and extensive, but not <lb/> always profitable. He
                    had at this period of his life a strong <lb/> tendency to scepticism, which, in
                    his riper years, he rejected. <lb/> This was natural, and the explanation is
                    easy. <reg orig="Imperfec-|tion">Imperfection</reg>
                    <lb/> is written upon every thing human. It requires little <lb/> sagacity to
                    perceive defects in existing institutions, or to <lb/> suggest difficulties and
                    to frame objections to any system of <lb/> morals or religion. To a young,
                    acute, and original <reg orig="in-|quirer">inquirer</reg>
                    <lb/> these are soon apparent. To him, if zealous and <lb/> sincere in his
                    search after truth, nothing is more vehemently <lb/> desired than certainty. He
                    strains after perfection, and <lb/> finding the system which accident, design,
                    or necessity, first <lb/> presents to his examination, not to yield the
                    satisfaction he <lb/>
                    <pb n="xi" entity="eaf033v1_0028" pid="uva-lib:349058"/> seeks, he rejects it
                    for another. This is liable to objections <lb/> as well as the
                    former,&mdash;less potent, perhaps, but still <reg orig="objec-|tions"
                        >objections</reg>. <lb/> Another, and another succeeds; but doubts and <lb/>
                    difficulties are still unresolved, and the inquirer, wearied at <lb/> last with
                    the fruitless search, sinks into the indifference of <lb/> scepticism, from
                    which a more enlarged experience, and <lb/> deeper inquiries, alone can raise
                    him.</p>
                <p>During this period of his life, the moral and political worlds <lb/> were in a
                    state of the most violent excitation. The deep <lb/> foundations of society were
                    shaken. The spirit of fearless <lb/> inquiry was abroad upon the earth. Theories
                    the most <reg orig="ex-|travagant">extravagant</reg>
                    <lb/> were daily promulgated, and the madness of <reg orig="specu-|lation"
                        >speculation</reg>
                    <lb/> knew no bounds.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of these times of such fearful <reg orig="excite-|ment"
                        >excitement</reg>, <lb/> he commenced his career as an author, and his first
                    <lb/> publication was Alcuin, a Dialogue on the Rights of Women. <lb/> This was
                    written during the autumn and winter of the year <lb/> 1797. It is an eloquent
                    and ingenious speculation, of which, <lb/> though we may praise the elegance of
                    the language, the <lb/> originality of the style, and the subtlety of the
                    argument, <lb/> we cannot but condemn the unsoundness of the doctrine. <lb/>
                    Though published, it was scarcely known to the public, and <lb/> the author
                    consequently acquired from it neither reputation <lb/> nor profit.</p>
                <p>About the same period he wrote a small novel, in the form <lb/> of a series of
                    letters, which he never published, and which, <lb/> though not destitute of
                    merit, it would be unnecessary to <lb/> notice here, did not the composition of
                    it seem to have been <lb/> the circumstance which led to his subsequent efforts
                    in the <lb/> same walk. On this work he remarks in his journal,&mdash;"I <lb/>
                    commenced something in the form of a romance. I had at <lb/> first no definite
                    conceptions of my design. As my pen <reg orig="pro-|ceeded">proceeded</reg>
                    <lb/> forward, my invention was tasked, and the materials <lb/> that it afforded
                    were arranged and digested."&mdash;"Every new <lb/>
                    <pb n="xii" entity="eaf033v1_0029" pid="uva-lib:349059"/> attempt will be better
                    than the last, and, considered in the <lb/> light of a prelude or first link, it
                    may merit that praise to <lb/> which it may possess no claim, considered as a
                    last, best <lb/> creation."</p>
                <p>It was indeed a prelude to a series, which he now in rapid <lb/> succession
                    produced, of the most original, powerful, and <lb/> masterly, though faulty, and
                    in some respects, imperfect and <lb/> objectionable, works of fiction, of which
                    American literature <lb/> could then, or perhaps can now, boast; and which will
                        <reg orig="ad-|vantageously">advantageously</reg>
                    <lb/> sustain a comparison with European works of <lb/> the same species of
                    composition, in most of the qualities <lb/> essential to such productions.</p>
                <p>Mr. Brown wrote six works of this description, upon <lb/> which his fame has
                    hitherto chiefly rested,&mdash;Weiland, <reg orig="Or-|mond">Ormond</reg>, <lb/>
                    Arthur Mervyn, Edgar Huntly, Clara Howard, and <lb/> Jane Talbot. The first five
                    were published in the interval <lb/> that elapsed from the spring of 1798 till
                    the summer of <lb/> 1801, a period of little more than three years, and in which
                    <lb/> he completed his thirtieth year. The last was published <lb/> somewhat
                    later.</p>
                <p>Upon the character of these fictions, little more can be <lb/> said upon this
                    occasion. They have now in their favor the <lb/> voice of British criticism,
                    tardy as it has ever been to <reg orig="pro-|claim">proclaim</reg>
                    <lb/> the merits of American genius; and that excellence <lb/> must indeed be
                    positive on this side of the Atlantic, which <lb/> can win or extort applause
                    from the judges on the other. <lb/> They are indeed remarkable productions. Once
                    read, the <lb/> impression they make is never forgotten. They are <hi
                        rend="italic">original</hi>
                    <lb/> in every sense,&mdash;in the conception, the style, the execution; <lb/>
                    in the characters, sentiments, manners, incidents&mdash;altogether <lb/>
                    original. Full of energy and pathos, they abound with <reg orig="pas-|sages"
                        >passages</reg>
                    <lb/> of genuine eloquence and irresistible force. Few <lb/> works excite such
                    breathless anxiety and awful apprehension. <lb/> The tone of seriousness and
                    solemnity that pervades them, <lb/>

                        <fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">2*</fw>
                    </pb> repels the ordinary reader of novels. One fond of mere <lb/> love-tales
                    must not look into them for enjoyment. They are <lb/> calculated only for those
                    who indulge in the deep and <reg orig="pow-|erful">powerful</reg>
                    <lb/> emotions; for those who think and feel strongly; who <lb/> delight
                    patiently to trace every action to its appropriate <reg orig="mo-|tive"
                        >motive</reg>; <lb/> and to mark the ebbs and flows of passion, and follow
                    <lb/> them out to their farthest consequences. To such readers <lb/> they will
                    always be welcome, notwithstanding the admission, <lb/> that the characters and
                    incidents are too frequently in <reg orig="ex-|tremes">extremes</reg>, <lb/> and
                    lie barely within the range of probability. Few <lb/> writers of fictitious
                    narrative can be pronounced equal to <lb/> Mr. Brown, in the analysis of the
                    thoughts and emotions of <lb/> the soul; in exquisite skill in the arrangement
                    and <reg orig="develop-|ment">development</reg>
                    <lb/> of incidents; and in accuracy, extent, and variety of <lb/> knowledge.</p>
                <p>During this period, he not only wrote a variety of essays <lb/> and fugitive
                    pieces, in prose and verse, some of which were <lb/> published in the journals
                    of the day, but he at the same <lb/> time conducted, with great credit and
                    ability, a periodical <lb/> work in the city of New York, under the title of the
                    <lb/> "Monthly Magazine, and American Review." This work, <lb/> begun in April,
                    1799, and closed in the autumn of the year <lb/> 1800, was almost entirely the
                    production of his own pen, <lb/> though he received some valuable contributions
                    from his <lb/> literary and scientific friends, particularly in the critical
                    <lb/> department. It abounds with curious and learned essays, <lb/> ingenious
                    speculations, interesting tales, and valuable <reg orig="infor-|mation"
                        >information</reg>; <lb/> and affords some of the best specimens of liberal,
                    <lb/> candid, and manly criticism, that the American press has <lb/> hitherto
                    produced.</p>
                <p>In closing this short summary of his first literary labors, <lb/> it is but
                    justice to his memory to claim for him the honor <lb/> of having been among the
                    first, perhaps of having been the <lb/>
                    <pb n="xiv" entity="eaf033v1_0031" pid="uva-lib:349061"/> first, of those
                    American writers who set an example of <reg orig="lite-|rary">literary</reg>
                    <lb/> independence, by drawing upon their own resources; <lb/> thus stimulating
                    the national mind to exertion in the fields of <lb/> literature and science. He
                    was, it is believed, the first <lb/> native American author who devoted himself
                    to literary <reg orig="pur-|suits">pursuits</reg>
                    <lb/> as a regular occupation, and who depended upon them <lb/> for a permanent
                    support.</p>
                <p>Mr. Brown continued to reside in the city of New York <lb/> and its neighborhood,
                    from the spring of 1798 till the <lb/> autumn of the year 1800, at the
                    conclusion of which he <lb/> removed to his native city, Philadelphia.</p>
                <p>Riper years, and more extensive communion with his <lb/> fellow-men, during his
                    residence in New York, corrected <lb/> without weakening his moral enthusiasm
                    and romantic <reg orig="sen-|sibilities">sensibilities</reg>. <lb/> The
                    realities of experience were gradually and <lb/> imperceptibly substituted for
                    the visions of a glowing and <lb/> luxurious imagination, and his moral progress
                    was eminently <lb/> beneficial and salutary. Friendship in him was so powerful
                    <lb/> and elevated a sentiment, that not even the dangers of <reg
                        orig="pes-|tilence">pestilence</reg>
                    <lb/> could deter him from the performance of those duties <lb/> which it seemed
                    to him to prescribe.</p>
                <p>Though he made occasional excursions, in the warm <reg orig="sea-|sons"
                        >seasons</reg>, <lb/> sometimes for health, and sometimes for pleasure and
                    <lb/> relaxation, yet his favorite studies and pursuits were <reg
                        orig="zeal-|ously">zealously</reg>
                    <lb/> continued, and he added largely to the ample stock of <lb/> literature and
                    science which he had previously acquired. His <lb/> correspondence was
                    prosecuted with his wonted activity, and <lb/> his journals were, as usual,
                    detailed and copious. His pen, <lb/> indeed, was incessantly employed, and for
                    the three years <lb/> succeeding his return to his paternal abode, he not only
                    <lb/> wrote a variety of lighter essays, in prose and verse, but <lb/> planned
                    and made considerable collections for future works <lb/> of more durable utility
                    and elevated aim than any he had <lb/>
                    <pb n="xv" entity="eaf033v1_0032" pid="uva-lib:349062"/> yet produced, and from
                    which, when completed, he might <lb/> expect both profit and reputation.</p>
                <p>The year 1803 was an important era in his life, as from <lb/> this is to be dated
                    the commencement of his career as a <lb/> political writer, and we can only
                    regret that he did not write <lb/> more on subjects of such vast practical
                    importance, upon <lb/> which he has shown himself so admirably qualified to
                    write <lb/> well. Three of the speculations which he published at <reg
                        orig="dif-|ferent">different</reg>
                    <lb/> periods, upon political subjects, are especially worthy <lb/> of notice
                    and consideration, that on the Cession of Louisiana <lb/> to France, that on the
                    Treaty with England, rejected by Mr. <lb/> Jefferson, and that on Commercial
                    Restrictions.</p>
                <p>The candid and impartial reader will bestow upon these <lb/> productions no mean
                    praise. They are evidently the work of <lb/> a clear, sagacious, original and
                    comprehensive thinker, the <lb/> soundness and accuracy of whose views and
                    opinions are <lb/> strongly implied in the manliness, candor and perspicuity
                    <lb/> with which those of the adverse parties are stated and <reg
                        orig="ex-|amined">examined</reg>. <lb/> To the praise of variety and depth
                    of knowledge, <lb/> vigor of argument, and comprehensiveness of view, they are
                    <lb/> eminently entitled. They display a boldness and <reg orig="indepen-|dence"
                        >independence</reg>
                    <lb/> of thought, a freedom from prejudice and party bias, <lb/> and an
                    impartiality of decision, very unusual in writings of <lb/> this description
                    among us. The characteristic originality of <lb/> the author is seen in almost
                    every page. On subjects so <lb/> complicated and various as those discussed in
                    these <reg orig="produc-|tions">productions</reg>, <lb/> different opinions may
                    be entertained and different <lb/> conclusions drawn by men of the greatest
                    knowledge and <lb/> brightest intellect, without subjecting them to the
                    imputation <lb/> of ignorance or unfairness. Of the ability displayed in these
                    <lb/> essays, a careful perusal will afford decisive evidence. For <lb/> the
                    disinterestedness and purity of the author's motives, <lb/> those who knew him
                    best, can best answer; no American <lb/> could be actuated by a more noble and
                    elevated patriotism, <lb/>

                    clearly, and paint more vividly the <lb/> glorious destinies of his country.</p>
                <p>A second edition of the Cession of Louisiana, was called <lb/> for and speedily
                    issued in February, 1803. The public <reg orig="at-|tention">attention</reg>
                    <lb/> was ingeniously and forcibly directed to the <reg orig="impor-|tance"
                        >importance</reg>
                    <lb/> of the acquisition, and to the necessity that it should, <lb/> at all
                    hazards, be secured to these States. We may <reg orig="there-|fore"
                        >therefore</reg>
                    <lb/> justly claim for the author, the honor of having, in some <lb/> small
                    degree, contributed to the subsequent annexation of <lb/> that important and
                    extensive country, to the American <lb/> Union.</p>
                <p>There was nothing for which he had a deeper abhorrence <lb/> than for party
                    intemperance and strife. He freely and fairly <lb/> allowed to others the
                    freedom which he exercised himself, <lb/> and he could prove an adversary to be
                    in the wrong, without <lb/> the imputation of selfish or dishonorable motives.
                    He <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg>, <lb/> in his pamphlet on the British
                    Treaty of 1806, <reg orig="fear-|lessly">fearlessly</reg>
                    <lb/> but decorously declared his opinions of public men and <lb/> their
                    measures. He aimed sedulously and solely to establish <lb/> truth. If he failed,
                    his judgment, not his intentions, must <lb/> be called in question.</p>
                <p>He was decidedly opposed to embargoes and restrictions. <lb/> He therefore in his
                    pamphlet on Commercial Restrictions, <lb/> endeavored, and we think
                    successfully, to demonstrate their <lb/> injustice and inutility. The course
                    pursued since by some <lb/> of the principal maritime States of Europe, seems to
                        <reg orig="con-|firm">confirm</reg>
                    <lb/> the justness of his conclusions, and the enlightened <lb/> views of
                    political economy since prevalent, to lead to the same <lb/> result. A
                    considerable portion of his countrymen maintain <lb/> the same doctrines which
                    he so forcibly and ably supported, <lb/> and a still larger one, perhaps,
                    rejects them. Many may <lb/> deride the impartiality which weighed the merits of
                    France, <lb/> and England in the same scales. Some, surely will applaud <lb/>
                    it. Time will add to the number of the latter, and every <lb/>
                    <pb n="xvii" entity="eaf033v1_0034" pid="uva-lib:349064"/> American bosom must
                    swell with exultation at the grand <lb/> picture of "the progress to greatness,"
                    so eloquently sketched <lb/> by the author, as that which his country is
                    destined to <lb/> realize in no distant futurity.</p>
                <p>But political speculations did not detain him long. <reg orig="Litera-|ture"
                        >Literature</reg>
                    <lb/> had long been his passion, and was now to be his support. <lb/> He made an
                    advantageous engagement with an eminent <lb/> bookseller of Philadelphia, who
                    undertook the publication at <lb/> his own risk; and the first number of a new
                    periodical work <lb/> was issued on the first of October 1803, under the title
                    of <lb/> "The Literary Magazine and American Register." The <lb/> following
                    passage from the excellent address which <reg orig="accom-|panied"
                        >accompanied</reg>

                    his candor and his sensibility to fame:&mdash;</p>
                <p>"I am far, however, from wishing that my readers should <lb/> judge of my
                    exertions by my former ones. I have written <lb/> much, but take much blame to
                    myself for something, which I <lb/> have written, and take no praise for any
                    thing. I should enjoy <lb/> a larger share of my own respect at the present
                    moment, if <lb/> nothing had ever flowed from my pen the production of which
                    <lb/> could be traced to me. A variety of causes induce me to form <lb/> such a
                    wish, but I am principally influenced by the <reg orig="considera-|tion"
                        >consideration</reg>, <lb/> that time can scarcely fail of enlarging and
                    refining the <lb/> powers of a man, while the world is sure to judge of his <reg

                    <lb/> and principles at fifty, from what he has written at <lb/> fifteen." The
                    following illustrates an important change in <lb/> his opinions. "In an age like
                    this, when the foundations of <lb/> religion and morality have been so boldly
                    attacked, it seems <lb/> necessary, in announcing a work of this nature, to be

                    <lb/> explicit as to the path which the editor means to <lb/> pursue. He
                    therefore avows himself to be, without <reg orig="equivoca-|tion"
                        >equivocation</reg>
                    <lb/> or reserve, the ardent friend and the willing champion <lb/> of the
                    Christian Religion. Christian piety he reveres as the <lb/> highest excellence
                    of human beings, and the amplest reward <lb/>
                    <pb n="xviii" entity="eaf033v1_0035" pid="uva-lib:349065"/> he can seek for his
                    labor, is the consciousness of having, in <lb/> some degree, however
                    inconsiderable, contributed to <reg orig="recom-|mend">recommend</reg>
                    <lb/> the practice of religious duties."</p>
                <p>This work was continued with unremitting care and <reg orig="assi-|duity"
                        >assiduity</reg>
                    <lb/> for five years. And though his reputation for <reg orig="know-|ledge"
                        >knowledge</reg>
                    <lb/> and learning were extended by it, he could derive from <lb/> it little
                    fame as an author. It is larger and contains a <lb/> greater variety of
                    information, than the one which he had <lb/> previously conducted, and its
                    general characteristics are <reg orig="se-|riousness">seriousness</reg>
                    <lb/> and solidity. It has little gaiety, that essential <reg

                    <lb/> in a monthly publication designed for miscellaneous <lb/> reading. Of wit
                    and humor it cannot boast, for to neither <lb/> of these had the editor any
                    pretensions. There are so many <lb/> articles on subjects of science dispersed
                    through this work, <lb/> that it might with propriety be denominated a
                    scientific as <lb/> well as a literary journal. The editor, as in his formet
                    <lb/> enterprise, was compelled to draw copiously from his own <lb/> store, and
                    he not unfrequently wrote the whole of the <reg orig="origin-|al">original</reg>
                    <lb/> matter of a number, himself. When the variety of articles <lb/> embraced

                    the versatility of his powers, and <lb/> the abundance of his resources, who
                    could so readily and <lb/> promptly produce essays on topics so diversified.
                    This work <lb/> is an honorable evidence of the taste, knowledge, talents <lb/>
                    and attainments of its indefatigable editor.</p>
                <p>Single, enjoying the pleasures of friendship and social <reg orig="in-|tercourse"
                        >intercourse</reg>, <lb/> full of literary occupation, with brightening <reg

                    <lb/> and a rising reputation, honorably supported by the <lb/> labors of his
                    pen, and free from all cares but those incident <lb/> to the life of a literary
                    man, he seemed to have reached a <lb/> situation, in all respects gratifying and
                    satisfactory to the <lb/> votary of letters. He was not insensible to the
                    advantages <lb/> of this condition, and a year passed away in abundant <reg

                    <lb/> and eager anticipations of future felicity from that <lb/>

                    the close of this year, he was for the <lb/> first time to enter.</p>
                <p>In November, 1804, he was married to Miss Elizabeth <lb/> Linn, of New York. This
                    lady was the daughter of the <lb/> Rev. Dr. Linn, of that city, a clergyman of
                    the presbyterian <lb/> church, of great respectability and superior
                    eloquence.</p>
                <p>After his marriage he became a permanent resident in his <lb/> native city. Of
                    his domestic condition and prospects he <lb/> must be his own historian. He
                    says, in a letter to a friend, <lb/> &mdash;"As to myself, my friend, you judge
                    rightly when you <lb/> think me situated happily. My present way of life is in
                    every <lb/> respect to my mind. There is nothing to disturb my felicity <lb/>
                    but the sense of the uncertainty and instability that clings to <lb/> every
                    thing human."&mdash;"My business, if I may so call it, is <lb/> altogether
                    pleasurable; and such as it is, it occupies not one <lb/> fourth of my
                    time."&mdash;"I have nothing to wish but that my <lb/> present situation may
                    last."&mdash;This was written in 1805. In <lb/> the summer of the following year
                    he writes thus of his home <lb/> to another friend,&mdash;"You will find it the
                    abode of content, <lb/> and may enjoy the spectacle, not very common, of a happy
                    <lb/> family."</p>
                <p>Thus happily situated, notwithstanding the delicacy of his <lb/> health, his
                    literary labors were prosecuted with his <reg orig="accus-|tomed"
                        >accustomed</reg>
                    <lb/> zeal and perseverance; and in the year succeeding his <lb/> marriage, he
                    commemorated the virtues and abilities of his <lb/> departed friend, Dr. J. B.
                    Linn, the brother of his wife, in <lb/> one of the most elegant and interesting
                    biographical sketches, <lb/> with which we are acquainted. It is, indeed, in our
                        <reg orig="appre-|hension">apprehension</reg>, <lb/> a model of its kind.
                    The facts, though few, are <lb/> judiciously arranged, and the character is

                    <lb/> developed with singular correctness and felicity. His <lb/> taste and
                    skill in this department of composition, as well as <lb/> in others, were
                    frequently exercised in the columns of the <lb/>
                    <pb n="xx" entity="eaf033v1_0037" pid="uva-lib:349067"/> Port Folio, to which,
                    from its commencement, he was a large <lb/> contributor.</p>
                <p>Unwearied in his efforts to promote knowledge, he <reg orig="com-|menced"
                        >commenced</reg>
                    <lb/> in the year 1806, a new annual publication devoted <lb/> to history,
                    politics, and science, under the title of the "<reg orig="Ame-|rican"
                        >American</reg>
                    <lb/> Register." This work, the only one of the kind yet <lb/> attempted, we
                    believe, in this country, was successfully and <lb/> vigorously continued by him
                    until the close of the year 1809.</p>
                <p>When it is considered that the Magazine and Register <lb/> were both conducted by
                    him at the same time for a <reg orig="consider-|able">considerable</reg>
                    <lb/> period after the commencement of the latter, an opinion <lb/> favorable to
                    his zeal and application will readily be admitted. <lb/> But he deserves other
                    and higher praise.</p>
                <p>In the "American Register" the powers of this <reg orig="admira-|ble"

                        >manner</reg>. <lb/> This work exhibits him to his countrymen as an <reg

                    merely annals, <lb/> which impartial criticism will scarcely hesitate to call
                        <reg orig="histo-|ry">history</reg>; <lb/> we cannot but declare the
                    conviction, that his narrative <lb/> of European and American affairs from the
                    year 1806 to the <lb/> year 1809, is not surpassed, if equalled, by any
                    contemporary <lb/> sketch of the same period, that has hitherto been presented
                    <lb/> to the public. It proves the author to have possessed the <lb/> essential

                    employed. He had in this interval nearly <reg orig="com-|pleted">completed</reg>
                    <lb/> an extensive system of General Geography,<ref target="n2" n="2">*</ref>
                    <note id="n2" place="foot" n="2"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>This able

                            relating to the United States. It has never yet been published. A <reg

                            read the manuscript of the account of London, <lb/> contained in this
                            work, declared it to be, beyond comparison, the best <lb/> history of
                            that city which he had ever seen.</p></note> and <lb/> made considerable
                    progress in a work on Rome, during the <lb/> Age of the Antonines, similar to
                    Anacharsis' Travels in <lb/> Greece, when disease invaded his frame so seriously
                    that he <lb/> was compelled to desist from his labors, and go in search of <lb/>
                    that health, which it was now almost hopeless to find.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1809, he left home for this purpose, and <lb/> passed a short
                    time with some friends in New Jersey and <lb/> New York. He says, in a letter
                    written upon this occasion, <lb/> "When have I known that lightness and vivacity
                    of mind, <lb/> which the divine flow of health, even in calamity, produces <lb/>
                    in some men?"&mdash;"Never,&mdash;scarcely ever. Not longer than <lb/> half an
                    hour at a time, since I have called myself man." <lb/> It is hardly necessary to
                    say that he returned without benefit, <lb/> to the home he had left, with great
                    reluctance.</p>
                <p>He was naturally inclined to consumption, and his <reg orig="appli-|cation"
                        >application</reg>
                    <lb/> only confirmed the predisposition. His friends were <lb/> alarmed, and
                    urged the necessity of a sea voyage for the <reg orig="ben-|efit">benefit</reg>
                    <lb/> of his health; but home was too dear to him to be left <lb/> for so long a
                    time as this would require. The disease now <lb/>
                    <pb n="xxii" entity="eaf033v1_0039" pid="uva-lib:349069"/> began to assume a
                    more threatening aspect, and his friends <lb/> again became importunate for him
                    to try a voyage to Europe. <lb/> He at last consented; and the spring of 1810
                    was fixed <lb/> upon as the period of his departure for England.</p>
                <p>The disease however did not abate. On the 10th of <reg orig="No-|vember"
                        >November</reg>
                    <lb/> 1809, he was attacked with a violent pain in his <lb/> side, for which he
                    was bled. He was now confined to his <lb/> chamber, and his situation became
                    evidently more alarming. <lb/> Day after day passed away, but there was no
                    symptom of <lb/> amendment. The malady was making fearful progress, and <lb/>
                    the hearts of his friends sunk within them at the bare <reg orig="con-|ception"
                        >conception</reg>
                    <lb/> of the catastrophe that was rapidly approaching. <lb/> His sufferings were
                    acute and severe, but his patience and <lb/> fortitude were superior to
                    calamity. He was aware of his <lb/> danger from the beginning, and perfectly
                    conscious of the <lb/> fate that awaited him. In his long confinement he was
                    <lb/> scarcely ever free from pain; but the same gentleness and <lb/> simplicity
                    of manners, the same sweetness of conversation, <lb/> which distinguished him in
                    health, shone conspicuously in <lb/> sickness. He was the same gentle,
                    forbearing, humble <reg orig="be-|ing">being</reg>
                    <lb/> he had ever been.</p>
                <p>One who was bound to him by the strongest ties, and who <lb/> will ever revere
                    his memory, thus describes his deportment <lb/> at this trying season: "He
                    always felt for others more than <lb/> for himself, and the evidences of sorrow
                    in those around <lb/> him, which could not at all times be suppressed, appeared
                    to <lb/> affect him more than his own sufferings. Whenever he <lb/> spoke of the
                    probability of a fatal termination to his disease, <lb/> it was in an indirect
                    and covert manner, as, `you must do <lb/> so and so, when I am absent,'&mdash;or
                    `when I am asleep.' He <lb/> surrendered not up one faculty of his soul but with
                    his last <lb/> breath. He saw death in every step of his approach, and <lb/>
                    received him as a messenger that brought with him no terrors. <lb/>
                    <pb n="xxiii" entity="eaf033v1_0040" pid="uva-lib:349070"/> He frequently
                    expressed his resignation; but his resignation <lb/> was not produced by apathy
                    or pain, for while he bowed <lb/> with submission to the divine will, he felt,
                    with the keenest <lb/> sensibility, his separation from those who made this
                    world but <lb/> too dear to him. Towards the last, he spoke of death <reg
                        orig="with-|out">without</reg>
                    <lb/> disguise, and appeared to wish to prepare his friends for <lb/> the event
                    which he felt to be approaching. A few days <reg orig="pre-|vious"
                        >previous</reg>
                    <lb/> to his change, while sitting up in bed, he fixed his eyes <lb/> on the
                    sky, and desired not to be spoken to, until he should <lb/> first speak. In this
                    position and with a serene countenance, <lb/> he continued some minutes, and
                    then said to his wife, `when <lb/> I desired you not to speak to me, I had the
                    most <reg orig="transport-|ing">transporting</reg>
                    <lb/> and sublime feelings I ever experienced. I wanted to <lb/> enjoy them, and
                    to know how long they would last.' He <lb/> concluded with requesting her to
                    remember the <reg orig="circum-|stance">circumstance</reg>."</p>
                <p>His sufferings were protracted till February, 1810. On <lb/> the morning of the
                    19th of that month, his anxious family <lb/> saw with emotions not to be
                    expressed, that a fatal change <lb/> had taken place. He thought himself dying;
                    and at his <reg orig="re-|quest">request</reg>, <lb/> his family and friends
                    were assembled round his bed. <lb/> He addressed them successively with the
                    utmost tenderness <lb/> and affection. He lingered, however, for three days
                    longer, <lb/> conversing as usual with perfect composure and self-<reg
                        orig="posses-|sion">possession</reg>. <lb/> On the 22d, the final summons
                    came, and with clear <lb/> and unclouded faculties, he yielded up his soul to
                    Him who <lb/> gave it.</p>
                <p>Thus died, at the early age of thirty-nine, a martyr to <lb/> letters, <hi
                        rend="small-caps">Charles Brockden Brown,</hi> who to eminence in <lb/>
                    knowledge and strength of genius, added a moral purity <lb/> and elevation of
                    sentiment, above all praise; whose <reg orig="charac-|ter">character</reg>
                    <lb/> exhibited the rare union of intellectual superiority and <lb/> unfeigned
                    modesty; and whose whole life was radiant with <lb/>
                    <pb n="xxiv" entity="eaf033v1_0041" pid="uva-lib:349071"/> virtue and goodness.
                    He was one of the most disinterested <lb/> of men; and to the base and malignant
                    passions, he was an <lb/> utter stranger. Distinguished for genius himself, he
                    was the <lb/> enthusiastic admirer of it in others. He knew not how to <lb/>
                    envy. Intellectual exercise of every kind was perfectly <lb/> familiar to him,
                    and he could with equal ease, and without <lb/> premeditation, enter into solid
                    and elaborate argument, or <lb/> sport in all the luxuriance of fiction. Mild,
                    retiring, and <lb/> amiable, his manners had a simplicity and unobtrusiveness,
                    <lb/> and his conversation a sweetness, that cannot soon be <reg
                        orig="for-|gotten">forgotten</reg>
                    <lb/> by his friends. With great colloquial powers, and <lb/> inexhaustible
                    stores of knowledge, he would frequently <lb/> listen and modestly receive from
                    others what he was much <lb/> better qualified to give. No one enjoyed with a
                    keener <lb/> relish the delights of social intercourse; but it was in the <lb/>
                    converse of the domestic circle that his gratification was <lb/> complete. He
                    enjoyed the singular felicity of numbering <lb/> among his best friends, his
                    relations by marriage as well as <lb/> by birth, by whom his memory is cherished
                    with the <reg orig="warm-|est">warmest</reg>
                    <lb/> affection and reverence. The literature of America <lb/> owes him much,
                    and our countrymen will do justice to the <lb/> merits of one equally entitled
                    to the admiration of the mind, <lb/> and the homage of the heart.</p>

                    <lb/> of man. Whether this tale will be classed with the <lb/> ordinary or

                    whose usefulness secures to them <lb/> a lasting reputation, the reader must be
                    permitted to decide.</p>
                <p>The incidents related are extraordinary and rare. Some <lb/> of them, perhaps,

                    appearances are solved, but that the <reg orig="solu-|tion">solution</reg>
                    <lb/> will be found to correspond with the known principles <lb/> of human
                    nature. The power which the principal person is <lb/> said to possess can
                    scarcely be denied to be real. It must <lb/> be acknowledged to be extremely
                    rare; but no fact, equally <lb/> uncommon, is supported by the same strength of
                    historical <lb/> evidence.</p>

                <p>Some readers may think the conduct of the younger <reg orig="Wie-|land"
                        >Wieland</reg>
                    <lb/> impossible. In support of its possibility the writer must <lb/> appeal to
                    Physicians, and to men conversant with the latent <lb/> springs and occasional
                    perversions of the human mind. It <lb/> will not be objected that the instances
                    of similar delusion <lb/> are rare, because it is the business of moral painters
                    to <lb/> exhibit their subject in its most instructive and memorable <lb/>
                    forms. If history furnishes one parallel fact, it is a sufficient <lb/>
                    vindication of the writer; but most readers will probably <lb/> recollect an
                    authentic case, remarkably similar to that of <lb/> Wieland.</p>
                <p>It will be necessary to add, that this narrative is addressed, <lb/> in an

                    is to come I am <reg orig="per-|fectly">perfectly</reg>
                    <lb/> indifferent. With regard to myself, I have nothing <lb/> more to fear.
                    Fate has done its worst. Henceforth, I am <lb/> callous to misfortune.</p>
                <p>I address no supplication to the Deity. The power that <lb/> governs the course
                    of human affairs has chosen his path. <lb/> The decree that ascertained the
                    condition of my life, admits <lb/> of no recall. No doubt it squares with the
                    maxims of <reg orig="eter-|nal">eternal</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="6" entity="eaf033v1_0047" pid="uva-lib:349077"/> equity. That is neither
                    to be questioned nor denied by <lb/> me. It suffices that the past is exempt
                    from mutation. The <lb/> storm that tore up our happiness, and changed into <reg
                        orig="dreari-|ness">dreariness</reg>
                    <lb/> and desert the blooming scene of our existence, is lulled <lb/> into grim
                    repose; but not until the victim was transfixed <lb/> and mangled; till every
                    obstacle was dissipated by its rage; <lb/> till every remnant of good was
                    wrested from our grasp and <lb/> exterminated.</p>
                <p>How will your wonder, and that of your companions, be <lb/> excited by my story!
                    Every sentiment will yield to your <lb/> amazement. If my testimony were without
                    corroborations, <lb/> you would reject it as incredible. The experience of no
                    <lb/> human being can furnish a parallel; that I, beyond the rest <lb/> of
                    mankind, should be reserved for a destiny without <reg orig="alle-|viation"
                        >alleviation</reg>, <lb/> and without example! Listen to my narrative, and
                    <lb/> then say what it is that has made me deserve to be placed <lb/> on this
                    dreadful eminence, if, indeed, every faculty be not <lb/> suspended in wonder
                    that I am still alive, and am able to <lb/> relate it.</p>
                <p>My father's ancestry was noble on the paternal side; but <lb/> his mother was the
                    daughter of a merchant. My <reg orig="grand-|father">grandfather</reg>
                    <lb/> was a younger brother, and a native of Saxony. He <lb/> was placed, when
                    he had reached the suitable age, at a <lb/> German college. During the
                    vacations, he employed <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>
                    <lb/> in traversing the neighboring territory. On one <reg orig="occa-|sion"
                        >occasion</reg>
                    <lb/> it was his fortune to visit Hamburg. He formed an <lb/> acquaintance with
                    Leonard Weise, a merchant of that city, <lb/> and was a frequent guest at his
                    house. The merchant had <lb/> an only daughter, for whom his guest speedily
                    contracted <lb/> an affection; and, in spite of parental menaces and <reg
                        orig="prohibi-|tions">prohibitions</reg>, <lb/> he, in due season, became
                    her husband.</p>
                <p>By this act he mortally offended his relations. <reg orig="Thence-|forward"
                        >Thenceforward</reg>
                    <lb/> he was entirely disowned and rejected by them. <lb/> They refused to
                    contribute any thing to his support. All <lb/> intercourse ceased, and he
                    received from them merely that <lb/> treatment to which an absolute stranger, or
                    detested enemy, <lb/> would be entitled.</p>
                <p>He found an asylum in the house of his new father, whose <lb/> temper was kind,
                    and whose pride was flattered by this <reg orig="ali-|ance">aliance</reg>. <lb/>
                    The nobility of his birth was put in the balance <lb/>
                    <pb n="7" entity="eaf033v1_0048" pid="uva-lib:349078"/> against his poverty.
                    Weise conceived himself, on the whole, <lb/> to have acted with the highest
                    discretion, in thus disposing <lb/> of his child. My grandfather found it
                    incumbent on him <lb/> to search out some mode of independent subsistence. His
                    <lb/> youth had been eagerly devoted to literature and music. <lb/> These had
                    hitherto been cultivated merely as sources of <lb/> amusement. They were now
                    converted into the means of <lb/> gain. At this period there were few works of
                    taste in the <lb/> Saxon dialect. My ancestor may be considered as the <lb/>
                    founder of the German Theatre. The modern poet of the <lb/> same name is sprung
                    from the same family, and, perhaps, <lb/> surpasses but little, in the
                    fruitfulness of his invention, or the <lb/> soundness of his taste, the elder
                    Wieland. His life was <lb/> spent in the composition of sonatas and dramatic
                    pieces. <lb/> They were not unpopular, but merely afforded him a scanty <lb/>
                    subsistence. He died in the bloom of his life, and was <lb/> quickly followed to
                    the grave by his wife. Their only child <lb/> was taken under the protection of
                    the merchant. At an <lb/> early age he was apprenticed to a London trader, and
                        <reg orig="pass-|ed">passed</reg>
                    <lb/> seven years of mercantile servitude.</p>
                <p>My father was not fortunate in the character of him under <lb/> whose care he was
                    now placed. He was treated with rigor, <lb/> and full employment was provided
                    for every hour of his <lb/> time. His duties were laborious and mechanical. He
                    had <lb/> been educated with a view to this profession, and, therefore, <lb/>
                    was not tormented with unsatisfied desires. He did not <lb/> hold his present
                    occupations in abhorrence, because they <lb/> withheld him from paths more
                    flowery and more smooth, <lb/> but he found in unintermitted labor, and in the
                    sternness of <lb/> his master, sufficient occasions for discontent. No <reg
                        orig="oppor-|tunities">opportunities</reg>
                    <lb/> of recreation were allowed him. He spent all his time <lb/>
                    <unclear id="u21">ent</unclear> up in a gloomy apartment, or traversing narrow
                    and <lb/> crowded streets. His food was coarse, and his lodging <lb/>
                    humble.</p>
                <p>His heart gradually contracted a habit of morose and <lb/> gloomy reflection. He
                    could not accurately define what <lb/> was wanting to his happiness. He was not
                    tortured by <reg orig="com-|parisons">comparisons</reg>
                    <lb/> drawn between his own situation and that of others. <lb/> His state was
                    such as suited his age and his views as to <reg orig="for-|tune">fortune</reg>.
                    <lb/> He did not imagine himself treated with <reg orig="extraordi-|nary"
                        >extraordinary</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="8" entity="eaf033v1_0049" pid="uva-lib:349079"/> or unjustifiable rigor.
                    In this respect he supposed the <lb/> condition of others, bound like himself to
                    mercantile service, <lb/> to resemble his own; yet every engagement was irksome,
                    <lb/> and every hour tedious in its lapse.</p>
                <p>In this state of mind he chanced to light upon a book <lb/> written by one of the
                    teachers of the Albigenses, or French <lb/> protestants. He entertained no
                    relish for books, and was <lb/> wholly unconscious of any power they possessed
                    to delight <lb/> or instruct. This volume had lain for years in a corner of
                    <lb/> his garret, half buried in dust and rubbish. He had marked <lb/> it as it
                    lay; had thrown it, as his occasions required, from <lb/> one spot to another;
                    but had felt no inclination to examine <lb/> its contents, or even to inquire
                    what was the subject of which <lb/> it treated.</p>
                <p>One Sunday afternoon, being induced to retire for a few <lb/> minutes to his
                    garret, his eye was attracted by a page of this <lb/> book, which, by some
                    accident, had been opened and <lb/> placed full in his view. He was seated on
                    the edge of his <lb/> bed, and was employed in repairing a rent in some part of
                    <lb/> his clothes. His eyes were not confined to his work, but <lb/>
                    occasionally wandering, lighted at length upon the page. <lb/> The words "Seek
                    and ye shall find," were those that first <lb/> offered themselves to his
                    notice. His curiosity was roused <lb/> by these so far as to prompt him to
                    proceed. As soon as <lb/> he finished his work, he took up the book and turned
                    to <lb/> the first page. The further he read, the more inducement <lb/> he found
                    to continue, and he regretted the decline of the <lb/> light which obliged him
                    for the present to close it.</p>
                <p>The book contained an exposition of the doctrine of <lb/> the sect of Camissards,
                    and an historical account of its <lb/> origin. His mind was in a state
                    peculiarly fitted for the <lb/> reception of devotional sentiments. The craving
                    which <lb/> had haunted him was now supplied with an object. His <lb/> mind was
                    at no loss for a theme of meditation. Or <lb/> days of business, he rose at the
                    dawn, and retired to his <lb/> chamber not till late at night. He now supplied
                    himself <lb/> with candles, and employed his nocturnal and Sunday hours <lb/> in
                    studying this book. It, of course, abounded with <reg orig="allu-|sions"
                        >allusions</reg>
                    <lb/> to the Bible. All its conclusions were deduced from <lb/> the sacred text.
                    This was the fountain, beyond which it <lb/>
                    <pb n="9" entity="eaf033v1_0050" pid="uva-lib:349080">
                        <fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">4</fw>
                    </pb> was unnecessary to trace the stream of religious truth; but <lb/> it was
                    his duty to trace it thus far.</p>
                <p>A Bible was easily procured, and he ardently entered on <lb/> the study of it.
                    His understanding had received a <reg orig="particu-|lar">particular</reg>
                    <lb/> direction. All his reveries were fashioned in the same <lb/> mould. His
                    progress towards the formation of his creed <lb/> was rapid. Every fact and
                    sentiment in this book were <lb/> viewed through a medium which the writings of
                    the <reg orig="Ca-|missard">Camissard</reg>
                    <lb/> apostle had suggested. His constructions of the <lb/> text were hasty, and
                    formed on a narrow scale. Every <lb/> thing was viewed in a disconnected
                    position. One action <lb/> and one precept were not employed to illustrate and
                        <reg orig="re-|strict">restrict</reg>
                    <lb/> the meaning of another. Hence arose a thousand <lb/> scruples to which he
                    had hitherto been a stranger. He <lb/> was alternately agitated by fear and by
                    ecstacy. He <reg orig="ima-|gined">imagined</reg>
                    <lb/> himself beset by the snares of a spiritual foe, and <lb/> that his
                    security lay in ceaseless watchfulness and prayer.</p>
                <p>His morals, which had never been loose, were now <lb/> modelled by a stricter
                    standard. The empire of religious <lb/> duty extended itself to his looks,
                    gestures, and phrases. <lb/> All levities of speech, and negligences of
                    behavior, were <lb/> proscribed. His air was mournful and contemplative. He
                    <lb/> labored to keep alive a sentiment of fear, and a belief of the <lb/> awe
                    creating presence of the Deity. Ideas foreign to this <lb/> were sedulously
                    excluded. To suffer their intrusion was a <lb/> crime against the Divine
                    Majesty, inexpiable but by days <lb/> and weeks of the keenest agonies.</p>
                <p>No material variation had occurred in the lapse of two <lb/> years. Every day
                    confirmed him in his present modes of <lb/> thinking and acting. It was to be
                    expected that the tide of <lb/> his emotions would sometimes recede, that
                    intervals of <reg orig="des-|pondency">despondency</reg>
                    <lb/> and doubt would occur; but these gradually were <lb/> more rare, and of
                    shorter duration; and he, at last, arrived <lb/> at a state considerably uniform
                    in this respect.</p>
                <p>His apprenticeship was now almost expired. On his <reg orig="ar-|rival"
                        >arrival</reg>
                    <lb/> at age he became entitled, by the will of my <reg orig="grand-|father"
                        >grandfather</reg>, <lb/> to a small sum. This sum would hardly suffice to
                    <lb/> set him afloat as a trader in his present situation, and he <lb/> had
                    nothing to expect from the generosity of his master. <lb/> Residence in England
                    had, besides, become almost <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg>, <lb/>
                    <pb n="10" entity="eaf033v1_0051" pid="uva-lib:349081"/> on account of his
                    religious tenets. In addition <lb/> to these motives for seeking a new
                    habitation, there was <lb/> another of the most imperious and irresistible
                    necessity. <lb/> He had imbibed an opinion that it was his duty to <reg
                        orig="dissemi-|nate">disseminate</reg>
                    <lb/> the truths of the gospel among the unbelieving nations. <lb/> He was
                    terrified at first by the perils and hardships to which <lb/> the life of a
                    missionary is exposed. This cowardice made <lb/> him diligent in the invention
                    of objections and excuses; but <lb/> he found it impossible wholly to shake off
                    the belief that <lb/> such was the injunction of his duty. The belief, after
                    <lb/> every new conflict with his passions, acquired new strength; <lb/> and, at
                    length, he formed a resolution of complying with <lb/> what he deemed the will
                    of heaven.</p>
                <p>The North American Indians naturally presented <reg orig="them-|selves"
                        >themselves</reg>
                    <lb/> as the first objects for this species of benevolence. <lb/> As soon as his
                    servitude expired, he converted his little <lb/> fortune into money, and
                    embarked for Philadelphia. Here <lb/> his fears were revived, and a nearer
                    survey of savage <reg orig="man-|ners">manners</reg>
                    <lb/> once more shook his resolution. For a while he <reg orig="re-|linquished"
                        >relinquished</reg>
                    <lb/> his purpose, and purchasing a farm on <reg orig="Schuyl-|kill"
                        >Schuylkill</reg>, <lb/> within a few miles of the city, set himself down to
                    the <lb/> cultivation of it. The cheapness of land, and the service <lb/> of
                    African slaves, which were then in general use, gave <lb/> him, who was poor in
                    Europe, all the advantages of wealth. <lb/> He passed fourteen years in a
                    thrifty and laborious manner. <lb/> In this time new objects, new employments,
                    and new <reg orig="as-|sociates">associates</reg>
                    <lb/> appeared to have nearly obliterated the devout <reg orig="im-|pressions"
                        >impressions</reg>
                    <lb/> of his youth. He now became acquainted with a <lb/> woman of a meek and
                    quiet disposition, and of slender <reg orig="ac-|quirements">acquirements</reg>
                    <lb/> like himself. He proffered his hand and was <lb/> accepted.</p>
                <p>His previous industry had now enabled him to dispense <lb/> with personal labor,
                    and direct attention to his own <reg orig="con-|cerns">concerns</reg>. <lb/> He
                    enjoyed leisure, and was visited afresh by <reg orig="de-|votional"
                        >devotional</reg>
                    <lb/> contemplation. The reading of the scriptures, and <lb/> other religious
                    books, became once more his favorite <reg orig="em-|ployment">employment</reg>.
                    <lb/> His ancient belief relative to the conversion of <lb/> the savage tribes,
                    was revived with uncommon energy. To <lb/> the former obstacles were now added
                    the pleadings of <reg orig="pa-|rental">parental</reg>
                    <lb/> and conjugal love. The struggle was long and <reg orig="vehe-|ment"
                        >vehement</reg>; <lb/>
                    <pb n="11" entity="eaf033v1_0052" pid="uva-lib:349082"/> but his sense of duty
                    would not be stifled or <reg orig="en-|feebled">enfeebled</reg>, <lb/> and
                    finally triumphed over every impediment.</p>
                <p>His efforts were attended with no permanent success. <lb/> His exhortations had
                    sometimes a temporary power, but <lb/> more frequently were repelled with insult
                    and derision. In <lb/> pursuit of this object he encountered the most imminent
                    <lb/> perils, and underwent incredible fatigues, hunger, sickness, <lb/> and
                    solitude. The license of savage passion, and the <reg orig="ar-|tifices"
                        >artifices</reg>
                    <lb/> of his depraved countrymen, all opposed themselves <lb/> to his progress.
                    His courage did not forsake him till there <lb/> appeared no reasonable ground
                    to hope for success. He <lb/> desisted not till his heart was relieved from the
                    supposed <lb/> obligation to persevere. With a constitution somewhat <reg
                        orig="de-|cayed">decayed</reg>, <lb/> he at length returned to his family.
                    An interval of <lb/> tranquillity succeeded. He was frugal, regular, and strict
                    <lb/> in the performance of domestic duties. He allied himself <lb/> with no
                    sect, because he perfectly agreed with none. <reg orig="So-|cial">Social</reg>
                    <lb/> worship is that by which they are all distinguished; but <lb/> this
                    article found no place in his creed. He rigidly <reg orig="inter-|preted"
                        >interpreted</reg>
                    <lb/> that precept which enjoins us, when we worship, to <lb/> retire into
                    solitude, and shut out every species of society. <lb/> According to him devotion
                    was not only a silent office, but <lb/> must be performed alone. An hour at
                    noon, and an hour <lb/> at midnight were thus appropriated.</p>
                <p>At the distance of three hundred yards from his house, <lb/> on the top of a rock
                    whose sides were steep, rugged, and <lb/> encumbered with dwarf cedars and stony
                    asperities, he built, <lb/> what to a common eye would have seemed a summer
                    house. <lb/> The eastern verge of this precipice was sixty feet above <lb/> the
                    river which flowed at its foot. The view before it <lb/> consisted of a
                    transparent current, fluctuating and rippling <lb/> in a rocky channel, and
                    bounded by a rising scene of <reg orig="corn-|fields">cornfields</reg>
                    <lb/> and orchards. The edifice was slight and airy. It <lb/> was no more than a
                    circular area, twelve feet in diameter, <lb/> whose flooring was the rock,
                    cleared of moss and shrubs, <lb/> and exactly levelled, edged by twelve Tuscan
                    columns, <lb/> and covered by an undulating dome. My father furnished <lb/> the
                    dimensions, and outlines, but allowed the artist, whom <lb/> he employed, to
                    complete the structure on his own plan. <lb/> It was without seat, table, or
                    ornament of any kind.</p>
                <pb n="12" entity="eaf033v1_0053" pid="uva-lib:349083"/>
                <p>This was the temple of his Deity. Twice in twenty <lb/> four hours he repaired
                    hither, unaccompanied by any human <lb/> being. Nothing but physical inability
                    to move was allowed <lb/> to obstruct or postpone this visit. He did not exact
                    from <lb/> his family compliance with his example. Few men, equally <lb/>
                    sincere in their faith, were as sparing in their censures and <lb/>
                    restrictions, with respect to the conduct of others, as my <lb/> father. The
                    character of my mother was no less devout; <lb/> but her education had
                    habituated her to a different mode of <lb/> worship. The loneliness of their
                    dwelling prevented her <lb/> from joining any established congregation; but she
                    was <lb/> punctual in the offices of prayer, and in the performance of <lb/>
                    hymns to her Saviour, after the manner of the disciples of <lb/> Zinzendorf. My
                    father refused to interfere in her <reg orig="arrange-|ments"
                    >arrangements</reg>. <lb/> His own system was embraced not, accurately <lb/>
                    speaking, because it was the best, but because it had been <lb/> expressly
                    prescribed to him. Other modes, if practised <lb/> by other persons, might be
                    equally acceptable.</p>
                <p>His deportment to others was full of charity and <reg orig="mild-|ness"
                        >mildness</reg>. <lb/> A sadness perpetually overspread his features, but
                    <lb/> was unmingled with sternness or discontent. The tones of <lb/> his voice,
                    his gestures, his steps were all in tranquil uniform. <lb/> His conduct was
                    characterized by a certain forbearance and <lb/> humility, which secured the
                    esteem of those to whom his <lb/> tenets were most obnoxious. They might call
                    him a <reg orig="fan-|atic">fanatic</reg>
                    <lb/> and a dreamer, but they could not deny their <reg orig="venera-|tion"
                        >veneration</reg>
                    <lb/> to his invincible candor and invariable integrity. His <lb/> own belief of
                    rectitude was the foundation of his happiness. <lb/> This, however, was destined
                    to find an end.</p>
                <p>Suddenly the sadness that constantly attended him was <lb/> deepened. Sighs, and
                    even tears, sometimes escaped him. <lb/> To the expostulations of his wife he
                    seldom answered any <lb/> thing. When he designed to be communicative, he hinted
                    <lb/> that his peace of mind was flown, in consequence of <reg
                        orig="devi-|ation">deviation</reg>
                    <lb/> from his duty. A command had been laid upon him, <lb/> which he had
                    delayed to perform. He felt as if a certain <lb/> period of hesitation and
                    reluctance had been allowed him, <lb/> but that this period was passed. He was
                    no longer <reg orig="permit-|ted">permitted</reg>
                    <lb/> to obey. The duty assigned to him was transferred, in <lb/>

                    </pb> consequence of his disobedience, to another, and all that <lb/> remained
                    was to endure the penalty.</p>
                <p>He did not describe this penalty. It appeared to be <lb/> nothing more for some
                    time than a sense of wrong. This <lb/> was sufficiently acute, and was
                    aggravated by the belief that <lb/> his offence was incapable of expiation. No
                    one could <reg orig="con-|template">contemplate</reg>
                    <lb/> the agonies which he seemed to suffer without the <lb/> deepest

                    <lb/> appeared to add to it. At length he hinted to his wife, <lb/> that his end
                    was near. His imagination did not prefigure <lb/> the mode or the time of his
                    decease, but was fraught with <lb/> an incurable persuasion that his death was
                    at hand. He <lb/> was likewise haunted by the belief that the kind of death
                    <lb/> that awaited him was strange and terrible. His <reg orig="anticipa-|tions"
                        >anticipations</reg>
                    <lb/> were thus far vague and indefinite; but they sufficed <lb/> to poison
                    every moment of his being, and devote him to <lb/> ceaseless anguish.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Early</hi> in the morning of a sultry day in August he left
                    <lb/> Mettingen, to go to the city. He had seldom passed a day <lb/> from home
                    since his return from the shores of the Ohio. <lb/> Some urgent engagements at
                    this time existed, which would <lb/> not admit of further delay. He returned in
                    the evening, <lb/> but, appeared to be greatly oppressed with fatigue. His <lb/>
                    silence and dejection were likewise in a more than ordinary <lb/> degree
                    conspicuous. My mother's, brother, whose profession <lb/> was that of a surgeon,
                    chanced to spend this night at our <lb/> house. It was from him that I have
                    frequently received <lb/> an exact account of the mournful catastrophe that
                    followed.</p>
                <p>As the evening advanced my father's inquietudes <reg orig="increas-|ed"
                        >increased</reg>. <lb/> He sat with his family as usual, but took no part in
                    their <lb/> conversation. He appeared fully engrossed by his own <reg
                        orig="re-|flections">reflections</reg>. <lb/> Occasionally his countenance
                    exhibited tokens <lb/> of alarm; he gazed steadfastly and wildly at the ceiling;
                    and <lb/> the exertions of his companions were scarcely sufficient <lb/>
                    <pb n="14" entity="eaf033v1_0055" pid="uva-lib:349085"/> to interrupt his
                    reverie. On recovering from these fits, he <lb/> expressed no surprise; but
                    pressing his hand to his head, <lb/> complained, in a tremulous and terrified
                    tone, that his brain <lb/> was scorched to cinders. He would then betray marks
                    of <lb/> insupportable anxiety.</p>
                <p>My uncle perceived by his pulse, that he was indisposed, <lb/> but in no alarming
                    degree, and ascribed appearances chiefly <lb/> to the workings of his mind. He
                    exhorted him to <reg orig="recol-|lection">recollection</reg>
                    <lb/> and composure, but in vain. At the hour of repose <lb/> he readily retired
                    to his chamber. At the persuasion of <lb/> my mother he even undressed and went
                    to bed. Nothing <lb/> could abate his restlessness. He checked her tender <reg
                        orig="ex-|postulations">expostulations</reg>
                    <lb/> with some sternness. "Be silent," said he, <lb/> "for that which I feel
                    there is but one cure, and that will <lb/> shortly come. You can help me
                    nothing. Look to your <lb/> own condition, and pray to God to strengthen you
                    under the <lb/> calamities that await you." "What am I to fear?" she <lb/>
                    answered. "What terrible disaster is it that you think of?" <lb/>
                    "Peace&mdash;as yet I know it not myself, but come it will, and <lb/> shortly."
                    She repeated her inquiries and doubts; but he <lb/> suddenly put an end to the
                    discourse, by a stern command <lb/> to be silent.</p>
                <p>She had never before known him in this mood. Hitherto <lb/> all was benign in his
                    deportment. Her heart was pierced <lb/> with sorrow at the contemplation of this
                    change. She was <lb/> utterly unable to account for it, or to figure to herself
                    the <lb/> species of disaster that was menaced.</p>
                <p>Contrary to custom, the lamp, instead of being placed <lb/> on the hearth, was
                    left upon the table. Over it against the <lb/> wall there hung a small clock, so
                    contrived as to strike a <lb/> very hard stroke at the end of every sixth hour.
                    That <lb/> which was now approaching was the signal for retiring to <lb/> the
                    fane at which he addressed his devotions. Long habit <lb/> had occasioned him to
                    be always awake at this hour, and <lb/> the toll was instantly obeyed.</p>
                <p>Now frequent and anxious glances were cast at the clock. <lb/> Not a single
                    movement of the index appeared to escape his <lb/> notice. As the hour verged
                    towards twelve, his anxiety <lb/> visibly augmented. The trepidations of my
                    mother kept <lb/> pace with those of her husband; but she was intimidated <lb/>
                    <pb n="15" entity="eaf033v1_0056" pid="uva-lib:349086"/> into silence. All that
                    was left to her was to watch every <lb/> change of his features, and give vent
                    to her sympathy in <lb/> tears.</p>
                <p>At length the hour was spent, and the clock tolled. The <lb/> sound appeared to
                    communicate a shock to every part of <lb/> my father's frame. He rose
                    immediately, and threw over <lb/> himself a loose gown. Even this office was
                    performed with <lb/> difficulty, for his joints trembled, and his teeth
                    chattered <lb/> with dismay. At this hour his duty called him to the rock, <lb/>
                    and my mother naturally concluded that it was thither he <lb/> intended to
                    repair. Yet these incidents were so <reg orig="uncom-|mon">uncommon</reg>, <lb/>
                    as to fill her with astonishment and foreboding. She <lb/> saw him leave the
                    room, and heard his steps as they hastily <lb/> descended the stairs. She half
                    resolved to rise and pursue <lb/> him, but the wildness of the scheme quickly
                    suggested itself. <lb/> He was going to a place whither no power on earth could
                    <lb/> induce him to suffer an attendant.</p>
                <p>The window of her chamber looked towards the rock. <lb/> The atmosphere was clear
                    and calm, but the edifice could <lb/> not be discovered at that distance through
                    the dusk. My <lb/> mother's anxiety would not allow her to remain where she
                    <lb/> was. She rose, and seated herself at the window. She <lb/> strained her
                    sight to get a view of the dome, and of the <lb/> path that led to it. The first
                    painted itself with sufficient <lb/> distinctness on her fancy, but was
                    undistinguishable by the <lb/> eye from the rocky mass on which it was erected.
                    The <lb/> second could be imperfectly seen; but her husband had <lb/> already
                    passed, or had taken a different direction.</p>
                <p>What was it that she feared? Some disaster impended <lb/> over her husband or
                    herself. He had predicted evils, but <lb/> professed himself ignorant of what
                    nature they were. When <lb/> were they to come? Was this night, or this hour to
                    witness <lb/> the accomplishment? She was tortured with impatience, <lb/> and
                    uncertainty. All her fears were at present linked to <lb/> his person, and she
                    gazed at the clock, with nearly as much <lb/> eagerness as my father had done,
                    in expectation of the next <lb/> hour.</p>
                <p>An half hour passed away in this state of suspense. <lb/> Her eyes were fixed
                    upon the rock; suddenly it was <reg orig="illu-|minated">illuminated</reg>.
                    <lb/> A light proceeding from the edifice, made every <lb/>
                    <pb n="16" entity="eaf033v1_0057" pid="uva-lib:349087"/> part of the scene
                    visible. A gleam diffused itself over the <lb/> intermediate space, and
                    instantly a loud report, like the <reg orig="ex-|plosion">explosion</reg>
                    <lb/> of a mine, followed. She uttered an involuntary <lb/> shriek, but the new
                    sounds that greeted her ear, quickly <lb/> conquered her surprise. They were
                    piercing shrieks, and <lb/> uttered without intermission. The gleams which had
                        <reg orig="dif-|fused">diffused</reg>
                    <lb/> themselves far and wide, were in a moment withdrawn, <lb/> but the
                    interior of the edifice was filled with rays.</p>
                <p>The first suggestion was that a pistol was discharged, and <lb/> that the
                    structure was on fire. She did not allow herself <lb/> time to meditate a second
                    thought, but rushed into the entry <lb/> and knocked loudly at the door of her
                    brother's chamber. <lb/> My uncle had been previously roused by the noise, and
                        <reg orig="in-|stantly">instantly</reg>
                    <lb/> flew to the window. He also imagined what he saw <lb/> to be fire. The
                    loud and vehement shrieks which <reg orig="succeed-|ed">succeeded</reg>
                    <lb/> the first explosion, seemed to be an invocation of succor. <lb/> The
                    incident was inexplicable; but he could not fail to <reg orig="per-|ceive"
                        >perceive</reg>
                    <lb/> the propriety of hastening to the spot. He was <reg orig="un-|bolting"
                        >unbolting</reg>
                    <lb/> the door, when his sister's voice was heard on the <lb/> outside conjuring
                    him to come forth.</p>
                <p>He obeyed the summons with all the speed in his power. <lb/> He stopped not to
                    question her, but hurried down stairs and <lb/> across the meadow which lay
                    between the house and the <lb/> rock. The shrieks were no longer to be heard;
                    but a <lb/> blazing light was clearly discernible between the columns of <lb/>
                    the temple. Irregular steps, hewn in the stone, led him to <lb/> the summit. On
                    three sides, this edifice touched the very <lb/> verge of the cliff. On the
                    fourth side, which might be <reg orig="re-|garded">regarded</reg>
                    <lb/> as the front, there was an area of small extent, to <lb/> which the rude
                    staircase conducted you. My uncle <reg orig="speedi-|ly">speedily</reg>
                    <lb/> gained this spot. His strength was for a moment <reg orig="ex-|hausted"
                        >exhausted</reg>
                    <lb/> by his haste. He paused to rest himself. <reg orig="Mean-|while"
                        >Meanwhile</reg>
                    <lb/> he bent the most vigilant attention towards the object <lb/> before
                    him.</p>
                <p>Within the columns he beheld what he could no better <lb/> describe, than by
                    saying that it resembled a cloud <reg orig="impreg-|nated">impregnated</reg>
                    <lb/> with light. It had the brightness of flame, but was <lb/> without its
                    upward motion. It did not occupy the whole <lb/> area, and rose but a few feet
                    above the floor. No part of <lb/> the building was on fire. This appearance was
                    astonishing. <lb/>
                    <pb n="17" entity="eaf033v1_0058" pid="uva-lib:349088"/> He approached the
                    temple. As he went forward the light <lb/> retired, and, when he put his feet
                    within the apartment, <lb/> utterly vanished. The suddenness of this transition
                    increased <lb/> the darkness that succeeded in a tenfold degree. Fear and <lb/>
                    wonder rendered him powerless. An occurrence like this, <lb/> in a place
                    assigned to devotion, was adapted to intimidate <lb/> the stoutest heart.</p>
                <p>His wandering thoughts were recalled by the groans of <lb/> one near him. His
                    sight gradually recovered its power, <lb/> and he was able to discern my father
                    stretched on the <lb/> floor. At that moment my mother and servants arrived,
                    with <lb/> with a lanthorn, and enabled my uncle to examine more <lb/> closely
                    this scene. My father, when he left the house, <reg orig="be-|sides"
                        >besides</reg>
                    <lb/> a loose upper vest and slippers, wore a shirt and <lb/> drawers. Now he
                    was naked, his skin throughout the <lb/> greater part of his body was scorched
                    and bruised. His <lb/> right arm exhibited marks as of having been struck by
                    some <lb/> heavy body. His clothes had been removed, and it was <lb/> not
                    immediately perceived that they were reduced to ashes. <lb/> His slippers and
                    his hair were untouched.</p>
                <p>He was removed to his chamber, and the requisite <reg orig="atten-|tion"
                        >attention</reg>
                    <lb/> paid to his wounds, which gradually became more <lb/> painful. A
                    mortification speedily shewed itself in the arm, <lb/> which had been most hurt.
                    Soon after, the other wounded <lb/> parts exhibited the like appearance.</p>
                <p>Immediately subsequent to this disaster, my father <reg orig="seem-|ed"
                        >seemed</reg>
                    <lb/> nearly in a state of insensibility. He was passive under <lb/> every
                    operation. He scarcely opened his eyes, and was <lb/> with difficulty prevailed
                    upon to answer the questions that <lb/> were put to him. By his imperfect
                    account, it <reg orig="appear-|ed">appeared</reg>, <lb/> that while engaged in
                    silent orisons, with thoughts full of <lb/> confusion and anxiety, a faint gleam
                    suddenly shot athwart <lb/> the apartment. His fancy immediately pictured to
                    itself, a <lb/> person bearing a lamp. It seemed to come from behind. <lb/> He
                    was in the act of turning to examine the visitant, when <lb/> his right arm
                    received a blow from a heavy club. At the <lb/> same instant, a very bright
                    spark was seen to light upon his <lb/> clothes. In a moment, the whole was
                    reduced to ashes. <lb/> This was the sum of the information which he chose to
                    give. <lb/> There was somewhat in his manner that indicated an <reg
                        orig="imper-|fect">imperfect</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="18" entity="eaf033v1_0059" pid="uva-lib:349089"/> tale. My uncle was
                    inclined to believe that half the <lb/> truth had been suppressed.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the disease thus wonderfully generated, <reg orig="be-|trayed"
                        >betrayed</reg>
                    <lb/> more terrible symptoms. Fever and delirium <reg orig="ter-|minated"
                        >terminated</reg>
                    <lb/> in lethargic slumber, which, in the course of two <lb/> hours, gave place
                    to death. Yet not till insupportable <reg orig="exha-|lations">exhalations</reg>
                    <lb/> and crawling putrefaction had driven from his <reg orig="cham-|ber"
                        >chamber</reg>
                    <lb/> and the house every one whom their duty did not <reg orig="de-|tain"
                        >detain</reg>.</p>
                <p>Such was the end of my father. None surely was ever <lb/> more mysterious. When
                    we recollect his gloomy <reg orig="anticipa-|tions">anticipations</reg>
                    <lb/> and unconquerable anxiety; the security from human <lb/> malice which his
                    character, the place, and the condition of <lb/> the times, might be supposed to
                    confer; the purity and <lb/> cloudlessness of the atmosphere, which rendered it
                        <reg orig="impossi-|ble">impossible</reg>
                    <lb/> that lightning was the cause; what are the conclusions <lb/> that we must
                    form?</p>
                <p>The prelusive gleam, the blow upon his arm, the fatal <lb/> spark, the explosion
                    heard so far, the fiery cloud that <reg orig="envi-|roned">environed</reg>
                    <lb/> him, without detriment to the structure, though <lb/> composed of
                    combustible materials, the sudden vanishing of <lb/> this cloud at my uncle's
                    approach&mdash;what is the inference to <lb/> be drawn from these facts? Their
                    truth cannot be doubted. <lb/> My uncle's testimony is peculiarly worthy of
                    credit, because <lb/> no man's temper is more sceptical, and his belief is <reg
                        orig="unaltera-|bly">unalterably</reg>
                    <lb/> attached to natural causes.</p>
                <p>I was at this time a child of six years of age. The <reg orig="im-|pressions"
                        >impressions</reg>
                    <lb/> that were then made upon me, can never be <lb/> effaced. I was ill
                    qualified to judge respecting what was <lb/> then passing; but as I advanced in
                    age, and became more <lb/> fully acquainted with these facts, they oftener
                    became the <lb/> subject of my thoughts. Their resemblance to recent events
                    <lb/> revived them with new force in my memory, and made me <lb/> more anxious
                    to explain them. Was this the penalty of <lb/> disobedience? this the stroke of
                    a vindictive and invisible <lb/> hand? Is it a fresh proof that the Divine Ruler
                    interferes in <lb/> human affairs, meditates an end, selects, and commissions
                    <lb/> his agents, and enforces, by unequivocal sanctions, <reg
                        orig="submis-|sion">submission</reg>
                    <lb/> to his will? Or, was it merely the irregular expansion <lb/> of the fluid
                    that imparts warmth to our heart and our blood, <lb/>
                    <pb n="19" entity="eaf033v1_0060" pid="uva-lib:349090"/> caused by the fatigue

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> shock which this disastrous occurrence occasioned
                    <lb/> to my mother, was the foundation of a disease which carried <lb/> her, in
                    a few months, to the grave. My brother and myself <lb/> were children at this
                    time, and were now reduced to the <lb/> condition of orphans. The property which
                    our parents left <lb/> was by no means inconsiderable. It was entrusted to <reg
                        orig="faith-|ful">faithful</reg>
                    <lb/> hands, till we should arrive at a suitable age. <reg orig="Mean-|while"
                        >Meanwhile</reg>
                    <lb/> our education was assigned to a maiden aunt who <reg orig="re-|sided"
                        >resided</reg>
                    <lb/> in the city, and whose tenderness made us in a short <lb/> time cease to
                    regret that we had lost a mother.</p>
                <p>The years that succeeded were tranquil and happy. Our <lb/> lives were molested
                    by few of those cares that are incident <lb/> to childhood. By accident more
                    than design, the <reg orig="indul-|gence">indulgence</reg>
                    <lb/> and yielding temper of our aunt was mingled with <lb/> resolution and
                    steadfastness. She seldom deviated into either <lb/> extreme of rigor or lenity.
                    Our social pleasures were <reg orig="sub-|ject">subject</reg>
                    <lb/> to no unreasonable restraints. We were instructed <lb/> in most branches
                    of useful knowledge, and were saved <lb/> from the corruption and tyranny of
                    colleges and boarding <lb/> schools.</p>
                <p>Our companions were chiefly selected from the children <lb/> of our neighbors.
                    Between one of these and my brother, <lb/> there quickly grew the most
                    affectionate intimacy. Her <lb/> name was Catharine Pleyel. She was rich,
                    beautiful, and <lb/> contrived to blend the most bewitching softness with the
                    <lb/> most exuberant vivacity. The tie by which my brother <lb/> and she were
                    united, seemed to add force to the love which <lb/>
                    <pb n="20" entity="eaf033v1_0061" pid="uva-lib:349091"/> I bore her, and which
                    was amply returned. Between her <lb/> and myself there was every circumstance
                    tending to <reg orig="pro-|duce">produce</reg>
                    <lb/> and foster friendship. Our sex and age were the same. <lb/> We lived
                    within sight of each other's abode. Our tempers <lb/> were remarkably congenial,
                    and the superintendents of our <lb/> education not only prescribed to us the
                    same pursuits, but <lb/> allowed us to cultivate them together.</p>
                <p>Every day added strength to the triple bonds that united <lb/> us. We gradually
                    withdrew ourselves from the society of <lb/> others, and found every moment
                    irksome that was not <reg orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg>
                    <lb/> to each other. My brother's advance in age made <lb/> no change in our
                    situation. It was determined that his <reg orig="pro-|fession">profession</reg>
                    <lb/> should be agriculture. His fortune exempted him <lb/> from the necessity
                    of personal labor. The task to be <reg orig="per-|formed">performed</reg>
                    <lb/> by him was nothing more than superintendence. <lb/> The skill that was
                    demanded by this was merely theoretical, <lb/> and was furnished by casual
                    inspection, or by closet study. <lb/> The attention that was paid to this
                    subject did not seclude <lb/> him for any long time from us, on whom time had no
                    other <lb/> effect than to augment our impatience in the absence of <lb/> each
                    other and of him. Our tasks, our walks, our music, <lb/> were seldom performed
                    but in each other's company.</p>
                <p>It was easy to see that Catherine and my brother were <lb/> born for each other.
                    The passion which they mutually <reg orig="en-|tertained">entertained</reg>
                    <lb/> quickly broke those bounds which extreme youth <lb/> had set to it;
                    confessions were made or extorted, and their <lb/> union was postponed only till
                    my brother had passed his <lb/> minority. The previous lapse of two years was
                    constantly <lb/> and usefully employed.</p>
                <p>O my brother! But the task I have set myself let me <lb/> perform with
                    steadiness. The felicity of that period was <lb/> marred by no gloomy
                    anticipations. The future, like the <lb/> present, was serene. Time was supposed
                    to have only <lb/> new delights in store. I mean not to dwell on previous <reg
                        orig="in-|cidents">incidents</reg>
                    <lb/> longer than is necessary to illustrate or explain the <lb/> great events
                    that have since happened. The nuptial day <lb/> at length arrived. My brother
                    took possession of the house <lb/> in which he was born, and here the long
                    protracted <reg orig="mar-|riage">marriage</reg>
                    <lb/> was solemnized.</p>
                <p>My father's property was equally divided between us. A <lb/>

                    <lb/> of a mile from my brother's, was now occupied by me. <lb/> These domains
                    were called, from the name of the first <reg orig="pos-|sessor">possessor</reg>,
                    <lb/> Mettingen. I can scarcely account for my refusing <lb/> to take up my
                    abode with him, unless it were from a <reg orig="dis-|position"
                        >disposition</reg>
                    <lb/> to be an economist of pleasure. Self-denial, <reg orig="sea-|sonably"
                        >seasonably</reg>
                    <lb/> exercised, is one means of enhancing our <reg orig="gratifica-|tions"
                        >gratifications</reg>. <lb/> I was, besides, desirous of administering a
                    fund, and <lb/> regulating a household, of my own. The short distance <lb/>
                    allowed us to exchange visits as often as we pleased. The <lb/> walk from one
                    mansion to the other was no undelightful <lb/> prelude to our interviews. I was
                    sometimes their visitant, <lb/> and they, as frequently, were my guests.</p>
                <p>Our education had been modelled by no religious <reg orig="stand-|ard"
                        >standard</reg>. <lb/> We were left to the guidance of our own <reg
                        orig="understand-|ing">understanding</reg>, <lb/> and the casual impressions
                    which society might make <lb/> upon us. My friends' temper, as well as my own,
                        <reg orig="exempt-|ed">exempted</reg>
                    <lb/> us from much anxiety on this account. It must not be <lb/> supposed that
                    we were without religion, but with us it was <lb/> the product of lively
                    feelings, excited by reflection on our <lb/> own happiness, and by the grandeur
                    of external nature. <lb/> We sought not a basis for our faith, in the weighing
                    of <lb/> proofs, and the dissection of creeds. Our devotion was a <lb/> mixed
                    and casual sentiment, seldom verbally expressed, <lb/> or solicitously sought,
                    or carefully retained. In the midst of <lb/> present enjoyment, no thought was
                    bestowed on the future. <lb/> As a consolation in calamity religion is dear. But
                    calamity <lb/> was yet at a distance, and its only tendency was to heighten
                    <lb/> enjoyments which needed not this addition to satisfy every <lb/>
                    craving.</p>
                <p>My brother's situation was somewhat different. His <reg orig="de-|portment"
                        >deportment</reg>
                    <lb/> was grave, considerate, and thoughtful. I will not <lb/> say whether he
                    was indebted to sublimer views for this <reg orig="dis-|position"
                        >disposition</reg>. <lb/> Human life, in his opinion, was made up of <lb/>
                    changeable elements, and the principles of duty were not <lb/> easily unfolded.
                    The future, either as anterior, or <reg orig="subse-|quent">subsequent</reg>
                    <lb/> to death, was a scene that required some preparation <lb/> and provision
                    to be made for it. These positions we could <lb/> not deny, but what
                    distinguished him was a propensity to <lb/> ruminate on these truths. The images
                    that visited us were <lb/>
                    <pb n="22" entity="eaf033v1_0063" pid="uva-lib:349093"/> blithsome and gay, but
                    those with which he was most familiar <lb/> were of an opposite hue. They did
                    not generate affliction <lb/> and fear, but they diffused over his behavior a
                    certain air of <lb/> forethought and sobriety. The principal effect of this <reg
                        orig="tem-|per">temper</reg>
                    <lb/> was visible in his features and tones. These, in <reg orig="gene-|ral"
                        >general</reg>, <lb/> bespoke a sort of thrilling melancholy. I scarcely
                    ever <lb/> knew him to laugh. He never accompanied the lawless <lb/> mirth of
                    his companions with more than a smile, but his <lb/> conduct was the same as
                    ours.</p>
                <p>He partook of our occupations and amusements with a <lb/> zeal not less than
                    ours, but of a different kind. The <reg orig="diver-|sity">diversity</reg>
                    <lb/> in our temper was never the parent of discord, and was <lb/> scarcely a
                    topic of regret. The scene was variegated, but <lb/> not tarnished or disordered
                    by it. It hindered the element <lb/> in which we moved from stagnating. Some
                    agitation and <lb/> concussion is requisite to the due exercise of human <reg
                        orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg>. <lb/> In his studies, he pursued
                    an austerer and more <lb/> arduous path. He was much conversant with the history
                    <lb/> of religious opinions, and took pains to ascertain their <reg
                        orig="vali-|dity">validity</reg>. <lb/> He deemed it indispensable to
                    examine the ground <lb/> of his belief, to settle the relation between motives
                    and actions, <lb/> the criterion of merit, and the kinds and properties of <reg
                        orig="evi-|dence">evidence</reg>.</p>
                <p>There was an obvious resemblance between him and my <lb/> father, in their
                    conceptions of the importance of certain <lb/> topics, and in the light in which
                    the vicissitudes of human <lb/> life were accustomed to be viewed. Their
                    characters were <lb/> similar, but the mind of the son was enriched by science,
                    <lb/> and embellished with literature.</p>
                <p>The temple was no longer assigned to its ancient use. <lb/> From an Italian
                    adventurer, who erroneously imagined that <lb/> he could find employment for his
                    skill, and sale for his <reg orig="sculp-|tures">sculptures</reg>
                    <lb/> in America, my brother had purchased a bust of Cicero. <lb/> He professed
                    to have copied this piece from an antique dug <lb/> up with his own hands in the
                    environs of Modena. Of the <lb/> truth of his assertions we were not qualified
                    to judge; but <lb/> the marble was pure and polished, and we were contented
                    <lb/> to admire the performance, without waiting for the sanction <lb/> of
                    connoisseurs. We hired the same artist to hew a suitable <lb/> pedestal from a
                    neighboring quarry. This was placed in <lb/>
                    <pb n="23" entity="eaf033v1_0064" pid="uva-lib:349094"/> the temple, and the
                    bust rested upon it. Opposite to this <lb/> was a harpsichord, sheltered by a
                    temporary roof from the <lb/> weather. This was the place of resort in the
                    evenings of <lb/> summer. Here we sung, and talked, and read, and <reg
                        orig="occa-|sionally">occasionally</reg>
                    <lb/> banqueted. Every joyous and tender scene most <lb/> dear to my memory, is
                    connected with this edifice. Here <lb/> the performances of our musical and
                    poetical ancestors were <lb/> rehearsed. Here my brother's children received the
                        <reg orig="rudi-|ments">rudiments</reg>
                    <lb/> of their education; here a thousand conversations, <lb/> pregnant with
                    delight and improvement, took place; and here <lb/> the social affections were
                    accustomed to expand, and the <lb/> tear of delicious sympathy to be shed.</p>
                <p>My brother was an indefatigable student. The authors <lb/> whom he read were
                    numerous, but the chief object of his <lb/> veneration was Cicero. He was never
                    tired of conning and <lb/> rehearsing his productions. To understand them was
                    not <lb/> sufficient. He was anxious to discover the gestures and <lb/> cadences
                    with which they ought to be delivered. He was <lb/> very scrupulous in selecting
                    a true scheme of pronunciation <lb/> for the Latin tongue, and in adapting it to
                    the words of his <lb/> darling writer. His favorite occupation consisted in <reg
                        orig="em-|bellishing">embellishing</reg>
                    <lb/> his rhetoric with all the proprieties of gesticulation <lb/> and
                    utterance.</p>
                <p>Not contented with this, he was diligent in settling and <lb/> restoring the
                    purity of the text. For this end, he collected <lb/> all the editions and
                    commentaries that could be procured, <lb/> and employed months of severe study
                    in exploring and <lb/> comparing them. He never betrayed more satisfaction than
                    <lb/> when he made a discovery of this kind.</p>
                <p>It was not till the addition of Henry Pleyel, my friend's <lb/> only brother, to
                    our society, that his passion for Roman <lb/> eloquence was countenanced and
                    fostered by a sympathy of <lb/> tastes. This young man had been some years in
                    Europe. <lb/> We had separated at a very early age, and he was now <reg
                        orig="re-|turned">returned</reg>
                    <lb/> to spend the remainder of his days among us.</p>
                <p>Our circle was greatly enlivened by the accession of a <lb/> new member. His
                    conversation abounded with novelty. <lb/> His gaiety was almost boisterous, but
                    was capable of <reg orig="yield-|ing">yielding</reg>
                    <lb/> to a grave deportment, when the occasion required it. <lb/> His
                    discernment was acute, but he was prone to view every <lb/>
                    <pb n="24" entity="eaf033v1_0065" pid="uva-lib:349095"/> object merely as
                    supplying materials for mirth. His <reg orig="concep-|tions">conceptions</reg>
                    <lb/> were ardent but ludicrous, and his memory, aided, <lb/> as he honestly
                    acknowledged, by his invention, was an <reg orig="in-|exhaustible"
                        >inexhaustible</reg>
                    <lb/> fund of entertainment.</p>
                <p>His residence was at the same distance below the city <lb/> as ours was above,
                    but there seldom passed a day without <lb/> our being favored with a visit. My
                    brother and he were <lb/> endowed with the same attachment to the Latin writers;
                    <lb/> and Pleyel was not behind his friend in his knowledge of <lb/> the history
                    and metaphysics of religion. Their creeds, <lb/> however, were in many respects
                    opposite. Where one <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg>
                    <lb/> only confirmations of his faith, the other could find <lb/> nothing but
                    reasons for doubt. Moral necessity, and <reg orig="calvi-|nistic"
                        >calvinistic</reg>
                    <lb/> inspiration, were the props on which my brother <lb/> thought proper to
                    repose. Pleyel was the champion of <reg orig="in-|tellectual">intellectual</reg>
                    <lb/> liberty, and rejected all guidance but that of his <lb/> reason. Their
                    discussions were frequent, but, being <reg orig="ma-|naged">managed</reg>
                    <lb/> with candor as well as with skill, they were always <lb/> listened to by
                    us with avidity and benefit.</p>
                <p>Pleyel, like his new friends, was fond of music and <reg orig="poe-|try"
                        >poetry</reg>. <lb/> Henceforth our concerts consisted of two violins, a
                    <lb/> harpsichord, and three voices. We were frequently <reg orig="re-|minded"
                        >reminded</reg>
                    <lb/> how much happiness depends upon society. This <lb/> new friend, though,
                    before his arrival, we were sensible of <lb/> no vacuity, could not now be
                    spared. His departure would <lb/> occasion a void which nothing could fill, and
                    which would <lb/> produce insupportable regret. Even my brother, though <lb/>
                    his opinions were hourly assailed, and even the divinity of <lb/> Cicero
                    contested, was captivated with his friend, and laid <lb/> aside some part of his
                    ancient gravity at Pleyel's approach.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Six</hi> years of uninterrupted happiness had rolled away,
                    <lb/> since my brother's marriage. The sound of war had been <lb/> heard, but it
                    was at such a distance as to enhance our <reg orig="en-|joyment">enjoyment</reg>
                    <lb/> by affording objects of comparison. The Indians <lb/> were repulsed on the

                    </pb> on the other. Revolutions and battles, however calamitous <lb/> to those
                    who occupied the scene, contributed in some sort <lb/> to our happiness, by
                    agitating our minds with curiosity, and <lb/> furnishing causes of patriotic
                    exultation. Four children, <lb/> three of whom were of an age to compensate, by
                    their <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg>
                    <lb/> and mental progress, the cares of which they had <lb/> been, at a more
                    helpless age, the objects, exercised my <lb/> brother's tenderness. The fourth
                    was a charming babe that <lb/> promised to display the image of her mother, and
                    enjoyed <lb/> perfect health. To these were added a sweet girl fourteen <lb/>
                    years old, who was loved by all of us, with an affection <lb/> more than
                    parental.</p>
                <p>Her mother's story was a mournful one. She had come <lb/> hither from England
                    when this child was an infant, alone, <lb/> without friends, and without money.
                    She appeared to <lb/> have embarked in a hasty and clandestine manner. She <lb/>
                    passed three years of solitude and anguish under my aunt's <lb/> protection, and
                    died a martyr to wo; the source of which <lb/> she could, by no importunities,
                    be prevailed upon to unfold. <lb/> Her education and manners bespoke her to be
                    of no mean <lb/> birth. Her last moments were rendered serene, by the <lb/>
                    assurances she received from my aunt, that her daughter <lb/> should experience
                    the same protection that had been <reg orig="ex-|tended">extended</reg>
                    <lb/> to herself.</p>
                <p>On my brother's marriage, it was agreed that she should <lb/> make a part of his
                    family. I cannot do justice to the <lb/> attractions of this girl. Perhaps the
                    tenderness she excited <lb/> might partly originate in her personal resemblance
                    to her <lb/> mother, whose character and misfortunes were still fresh in <lb/>
                    our remembrance. She was habitually pensive, and this <lb/> circumstance tended
                    to remind the spectator of her <reg orig="friend-|less">friendless</reg>
                    <lb/> condition; and yet that epithet was surely misapplied <lb/> in this case.
                    This being was cherished by those with whom <lb/> she now resided, with
                    unspeakable fondness. Every <reg orig="ex-|ertion">exertion</reg>
                    <lb/> was made to enlarge and improve her mind. Her <lb/> safety was the object
                    of a solicitude that almost exceeded <lb/> the bounds of discretion. Our
                    affection indeed could scarcely <lb/> transcend her merits. She never met my
                    eye, or occurred <lb/> to my reflections, without exciting a kind of enthusiasm.
                    <lb/> Her softness, her intelligence, her equanimity, never shall I <lb/>
                    <pb n="26" entity="eaf033v1_0067" pid="uva-lib:349097"/> see surpassed. I have
                    often shed tears of pleasure at her <lb/> approach, and pressed her to my bosom
                    in an agony of <lb/> fondness.</p>
                <p>While every day was adding to the charms of her person, <lb/> and the stores of
                    her mind, there occurred an event which <lb/> threatened to deprive us of her.
                    An officer of some rank, <lb/> who had been disabled by a wound at Quebec, had
                    employed <lb/> himself, since the ratification of peace, in travelling through
                    <lb/> the colonies. He remained a considerable period at <reg
                        orig="Phila-|delphia">Philadelphia</reg>, <lb/> but was at last preparing
                    for his departure. No <lb/> one had been more frequently honored with his visits
                    than <lb/> Mrs. Baynton, a worthy lady with whom our family were <lb/> intimate.
                    He went to her house with a view to perform <lb/> a farewell visit, and was on
                    the point of taking his leave, <lb/> when I and my young friend entered the
                    apartment. It is <lb/> impossible to describe the emotions of the stranger, when
                    <lb/> he fixed his eyes upon my companion. He was motionless <lb/> with
                    surprise. He was unable to conceal his feelings, but <lb/> sat silently gazing
                    at the spectacle before him. At length <lb/> he turned to Mrs. Baynton, and more
                    by his looks and <lb/> gestures than by words, besought her for an explanation
                    of <lb/> the scene. He seized the hand of the girl, who, in her turn, <lb/> was
                    surprised by his behaviour, and drawing her forward, <lb/> said in a eager and
                    faltering tone, who is she? whence <lb/> does she come? what is her name?</p>
                <p>The answers that were given only increased the <reg orig="con-|fusion"
                        >confusion</reg>
                    <lb/> of his thoughts. He was successively told, that she <lb/> was the daughter
                    of one whose name was Louisa Conway, <lb/> who arrived among us at such a time,
                    who sedulously <reg orig="con-|cealed">concealed</reg>
                    <lb/> her parentage, and the motives of her flight, whose <lb/> incurable griefs
                    had finally destroyed her, and who had left <lb/> this child under the
                    protection of her friends. Having <lb/> heard the tale, he melted into tears,
                    eagerly clasped the <lb/> young lady in his arms, and called himself her father.
                    <lb/> When the tumults excited in his breast by this unlooked-for <lb/> meeting
                    were somewhat subsided, he gratified our curiosity <lb/> by relating the
                    following incidents.</p>
                <p>"Miss Conway was the only daughter of a banker in <lb/> London, who discharged
                    towards her every duty of an <lb/> affectionate father. He had chanced to fall
                    into her <lb/>
                    <pb n="27" entity="eaf033v1_0068" pid="uva-lib:349098"/> company, had been
                    subdued by her attractions, had <reg orig="tender-|ed">tendered</reg>
                    <lb/> her his hand, and been joyfully accepted both by parent <lb/> and child.
                    His wife had given him every proof of the <lb/> fondest attachment. Her father,
                    who possessed immense <lb/> wealth, treated him with distinguished respect,
                    liberally <reg orig="sup-|plied">supplied</reg>
                    <lb/> his wants, and had made one condition of his consent <lb/> to their union,
                    a resolution to take up their abode with <lb/> him.</p>
                <p>"They had passed three years of conjugal felicity, which <lb/> had been augmented
                    by the birth of this child; when his <lb/> professional duty called him into
                    Germany. It was not <lb/> without an arduous struggle, that she was persuaded to

                    <lb/> the design of accompanying him through all the <lb/> toils and perils of

                    They strove to alleviate, by frequent letters, the evils <lb/> of their lot.
                    Those of his wife, breathed nothing but <reg orig="anxie-|ty">anxiety</reg>
                    <lb/> for his safety, and impatience of his absence. At <lb/> length, a new
                    arrangement was made, and he was obliged <lb/> to repair from Westphalia to
                    Canada. One advantage <reg orig="attend-|ed">attended</reg>
                    <lb/> this change.&mdash;It afforded him an opportunity of meeting <lb/> his
                    family. His wife anticipated this interview, with no <lb/> less rapture than
                    himself. He hurried to London, and the <lb/> moment he alighted from the
                    stage-coach, ran with all speed <lb/> to Mr. Conway's house.</p>
                <p>"It was a house of mourning. His father was <reg orig="over-|whelmed"
                        >overwhelmed</reg>
                    <lb/> with grief, and incapable of answering his inquiries. <lb/> The servants,
                    sorrowful and mute, were equally refractory. <lb/> He explored the house, and
                    called on the names of his wife <lb/> and daughter, but his summons were
                    fruitless. At length, <lb/> this new disaster was explained. Two days before his
                        <reg orig="ar-|rival">arrival</reg>, <lb/> his wife's chamber was found
                    empty. No search, <lb/> however diligent and anxious, could trace her steps. No
                    <lb/> cause could be assigned for her disappearance. The <reg orig="mo-|ther"
                        >mother</reg>
                    <lb/> and child had fled away together.</p>
                <p>"New exertions were made, her chamber and cabinets <lb/> were ransacked, but no
                    vestige was found serving to inform <lb/> them as to the motives of her flight,
                    whether it had been <lb/> voluntary or otherwise, and in what corner of the
                    kingdom <lb/> or of the world she was concealed. Who shall describe <lb/> the
                    sorrow and amazement of the husband? His restlessness, <lb/>
                    <pb n="28" entity="eaf033v1_0069" pid="uva-lib:349099"/> his vicissitudes of
                    hope and fear, and his ultimate despair? <lb/> His duty called him to America.
                    He had been in this city, <lb/> and had frequently passed the door of the house
                    in which <lb/> his wife, at that moment, resided. Her father had not <reg
                        orig="re-|mitted">remitted</reg>
                    <lb/> his exertions to elucidate this painful mystery, but <lb/> they had
                    failed. This disappointment hastened his death; <lb/> in consequence of which,
                    Louisa's father became possessor <lb/> of his immense property."</p>
                <p>This tale was a copious theme of speculation. A <reg orig="thou-|sand"
                        >thousand</reg>
                    <lb/> questions were started and discussed in our domestic <lb/> circle,
                    respecting the motives that influenced Mrs. Stuart to <lb/> abandon her country.
                    It did not appear that her <reg orig="proceed-|ing">proceeding</reg>
                    <lb/> was involuntary. We recalled and reviewed every <reg orig="par-|ticular"
                        >particular</reg>
                    <lb/> that had fallen under our own observation. By none <lb/> of these were we
                    furnished with a clue. Her conduct, <lb/> after the most rigorous scrutiny,
                    still remained an <reg orig="impene-|trable">impenetrable</reg>
                    <lb/> secret. On a nearer view, Major Stuart proved <reg orig="him-|self"
                        >himself</reg>
                    <lb/> a man of most amiable character. His attachment to <lb/> Louisa appeared
                    hourly to increase. She was no stranger <lb/> to the sentiments suitable to her
                    new character. She could <lb/> not but readily embrace the scheme which was
                    proposed <lb/> to her, to return with her father to England. This scheme <lb/>
                    his regard for her induced him, however, to postpone. <lb/> Some time was
                    necessary to prepare her for so great a <lb/> change and enable her to think
                    without agony of her <reg orig="sepa-|ration">separation</reg>
                    <lb/> from us.</p>
                <p>I was not without hopes of prevailing on her father <reg orig="en-|tirely"
                        >entirely</reg>
                    <lb/> to relinquish this unwelcome design. Meanwhile, he <lb/> pursued his
                    travels through the southern colonies, and his <lb/> daughter continued with us.
                    Louisa and my brother <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg>
                    <lb/> received letters from him, which indicated a mind of <lb/> no common
                    order. They were filled with amusing details, <lb/> and profound reflections.
                    While here, he often partook of <lb/> our evening conversations at the temple;
                    and since his <reg orig="de-|parture">departure</reg>, <lb/> his correspondence
                    had frequently supplied us with <lb/> topics of discourse.</p>
                <p>One afternoon in May, the blandness of the air, and <lb/> brightness of the
                    verdure, induced us to assemble, earlier <lb/> than usual, in the temple. We
                    females were busy at the <lb/> needle, while my brother and Pleyel were bandying
                        <reg orig="quota-|tions">quotations</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="29" entity="eaf033v1_0070" pid="uva-lib:349100"/> and syllogisms. The
                    point discussed was the merit of <lb/> the oration for Cluentius, as
                    descriptive, first, of the genius <lb/> of the speaker; and, secondly, of the
                    manners of the times. <lb/> Pleyel labored to extenuate both these species of
                    merit, and <lb/> tasked his ingenuity, to shew that the orator had embraced
                    <lb/> a bad cause; or, at least, a doubtful one. He urged, that <lb/> to rely on
                    the exaggerations of an advocate, or to make the <lb/> picture of a single
                    family a model from which to sketch the <lb/> condition of a nation, was absurd.
                    The controversy was <lb/> suddenly diverted into a new channel, by a
                    misquotation. <lb/> Pleyel accused his companion of saying "<hi rend="italic"
                        >polliciatur,</hi>" when <lb/> he should have said "<hi rend="italic"
                        >polliceretur.</hi>" Nothing would decide <lb/> the contest, but an appeal
                    to the volume. My brother was <lb/> returning to the house for this purpose,
                    when a servant met <lb/> him with a letter from Major Stuart. He immediately
                        <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg>
                    <lb/> to read it in our company.</p>
                <p>Besides affectionate compliments to us, and paternal <reg orig="ben-|edictions"
                        >benedictions</reg>
                    <lb/> on Louisa, his letter contained a description of a <lb/> waterfall on the
                    Monongahela. A sudden gust of rain <reg orig="fall-|ing">falling</reg>, <lb/> we
                    were compelled to remove to the house. The <lb/> storm passed away, and a
                    radiant moon-light succeeded. <lb/> There was no motion to resume our seats in
                    the temple. <lb/> We therefore remained where we were, and engaged in <lb/>
                    sprightly conversation. The letter lately received naturally <lb/> suggested the
                    topic. A parallel was drawn between the <lb/> cataract there described, and one
                    which Pleyel had <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg>
                    <lb/> among the Alps of Glarus. In the state of the <reg orig="for-|mer"
                        >former</reg>, <lb/> some particular was mentioned, the truth of which <lb/>
                    was questionable. To settle the dispute which thence arose, <lb/> it was
                    proposed to have recourse to the letter. My brother <lb/> searched for it in his
                    pocket. It was no where to be found. <lb/> At length, he remembered to have left
                    it in the temple, and <lb/> he determined to go in search for it. His wife,
                    Pleyel, <lb/> Louisa, and myself, remained where we were.</p>
                <p>In a few minutes he returned. I was somewhat <reg orig="interest-|ed"
                        >interested</reg>
                    <lb/> in the dispute, and was therefore impatient for his return; <lb/> yet, as
                    I heard him ascending the stairs, I could not but <reg orig="re-|mark"
                        >remark</reg>, <lb/> that he had executed his intention with remarkable
                    <lb/> despatch. My eyes were fixed upon him on his entrance. <lb/> Methought he
                    brought with him looks considerably different <lb/>
                    <pb n="30" entity="eaf033v1_0071" pid="uva-lib:349101"/> from those with which
                    he departed. Wonder, and a slight <lb/> portion of anxiety were mingled in them.
                    His eyes seemed <lb/> to be in search of some object. They passed quickly from
                    <lb/> one person to another, till they rested on his wife. She <lb/> was seated
                    in a careless attitude on the sofa, in the same <lb/> spot as before. She had
                    the same muslin in her hand, by <lb/> which her attention was chiefly
                    engrossed.</p>
                <p>The moment he saw her, his perplexity visibly increased. <lb/> He quietly seated
                    himself, and fixing his eyes on the floor, <lb/> appeared to be absorbed in
                    meditation. These singularities <lb/> suspended the inquiry which I was
                    preparing to make <reg orig="re-|specting">respecting</reg>
                    <lb/> the letter. In a short time, the company <reg orig="relinquish-|ed"
                        >relinquished</reg>
                    <lb/> the subject which engaged them, and directed their <reg orig="at-|tention"
                        >attention</reg>
                    <lb/> to Wieland. They thought that he only waited for <lb/> a pause in the
                    discourse, to produce the letter. The pause <lb/> was uninterrupted by him. At
                    length Pleyel said, "Well, <lb/> I suppose you have found the letter."</p>
                <p>"No," said he without any abatement of his gravity, and <lb/> looking steadfastly
                    at his wife, "I did not mount the hill."&mdash; <lb/> "Why
                    not?"&mdash;"Catharine, have you not moved from that <lb/> spot since I left the
                    room?"&mdash;She was affected with the <lb/> solemnity of his manner, and laying
                    down her work, <reg orig="answer-|ed">answered</reg>
                    <lb/> in a tone of surprise, "No; Why do you ask that <reg
                        orig="ques-|tion?&quot;&mdash;His">question?"&mdash;His</reg>
                    <lb/> eyes were again fixed upon the floor, and he did <lb/> not immediately
                    answer. At length, he said, looking round <lb/> upon us, "Is it true that
                    Catharine did not follow me to the <lb/> hill? That she did not just now enter
                    the room?"&mdash;We <lb/> assured him, with one voice, that she had not been
                    absent <lb/> for a moment, and inquired into the motive of his <reg
                        orig="ques-|tions">questions</reg>.</p>
                <p>"Your assurances," said he, "are solemn and unanimous; <lb/> and yet I must deny
                    credit to your assertions, or disbelieve <lb/> the testimony of my senses, which
                    informed me, when I <lb/> was half way up the hill, that Catharine was at the
                    bottom."</p>
                <p>We were confounded at this declaration. Pleyel rallied <lb/> him with great
                    levity on his behavior. He listened to his <lb/> friend with calmness, but
                    without any relaxation of features.</p>
                <p>"One thing," said he, with emphasis, "is true; either I <lb/> heard my wife's
                    voice at the bottom of the hill, or I do not <lb/> hear your voice at
                    present."</p>
                <pb n="31" entity="eaf033v1_0072" pid="uva-lib:349102"/>
                <p>"Truly," returned Pleyel, "it is a sad dilemma to which <lb/> you have reduced
                    yourself. Certain it is, if our eyes can <lb/> give us certainty, that your wife
                    has been sitting in that spot <lb/> during every moment of your absence. You
                    have heard <lb/> her voice, you say, upon the hill. In general, her voice, <lb/>
                    like her temper, is all softness. To be heard across the <lb/> room, she is
                    obliged to exert herself. While you were <lb/> gone, if I mistake not, she did
                    not utter a word. Clara and <lb/> I had all the talk to ourselves. Still it may
                    be that she held <lb/> a whispering conference with you on the hill; but tell us
                    <lb/> the particulars."</p>
                <p>"The conference," said he, "was short; and far from <lb/> being carried on in a
                    whisper. You know with what <reg orig="inten-|tion">intention</reg>
                    <lb/> I left the house. Half way to the rock, the moon was <lb/> for a moment
                    hidden from us by a cloud. I never knew <lb/> the air to be more bland and more
                    calm. In this interval I <lb/> glanced at the temple, and thought I saw a
                    glimmering <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg>
                    <lb/> the columns. It was so faint, that it would not <reg orig="per-|haps"
                        >perhaps</reg>
                    <lb/> have been visible, if the moon had not been shrouded. <lb/> I looked
                    again, but saw nothing. I never visit this building <lb/> alone, or at night,
                    without being reminded of the fate of my <lb/> father. There was nothing
                    wonderful in this appearance; <lb/> yet it suggested something more than mere
                    solitude and <lb/> darkness in the same place would have done.</p>
                <p>"I kept on my way. The images that haunted me were <lb/> solemn; and I
                    entertained an imperfect curiosity, but no <lb/> fear, as to the nature of this
                    object. I had ascended the hill <lb/> little more than half way, when a voice
                    called me from <lb/> behind. The accents were clear, distinct, powerful, and
                    <lb/> were uttered, as I fully believed, by my wife. Her voice <lb/> is not
                    commonly so loud. She has seldom occasion to <reg orig="ex-|ert">exert</reg>
                    <lb/> it, but, nevertheless, I have sometimes heard her call <lb/> with force
                    and eagerness. If my ear was not deceived, it <lb/> was her voice which I
                    heard.</p>
                <p>"Stop, go no further. There is danger in your path." <lb/> The suddenness and
                    unexpectedness of this warning, the tone <lb/> of alarm with which it was given,
                    and, above all, the <reg orig="per-|suasion">persuasion</reg>
                    <lb/> that it was my wife who spoke, were enough to <reg orig="dis-|concert"
                        >disconcert</reg>
                    <lb/> and make me pause. I turned and listened to assure <lb/> myself that I was
                    not mistaken. The deepest silence <reg orig="suc-|ceeded">succeeded</reg>. <lb/>
                    <pb n="32" entity="eaf033v1_0073" pid="uva-lib:349103"/> At length, I spoke in
                    my turn. Who calls? Is it <lb/> you, Catharine? I stopped and presently received
                    an answer. <lb/> "Yes, it is I; go not up; return instantly; you are wanted
                    <lb/> at the house." Still the voice was Catharine's, and still it <lb/>
                    proceeded from the foot of the stairs.</p>
                <p>"What could I do? The warning was mysterious. To <lb/> be uttered by Catharine at
                    a place, and on an occasion like <lb/> this, enhanced the mystery. I could do
                    nothing but obey. <lb/> Accordingly, I trod back my steps, expecting that she
                    <lb/> waited for me at the bottom of the hill. When I reached <lb/> the bottom,
                    no one was visible. The moon-light was once <lb/> more universal and brilliant,
                    and yet, as far as I could see, <lb/> no human or moving figure was discernible.
                    If she had <lb/> returned to the house, she must have used wondrous <reg
                        orig="expe-|dition">expedition</reg>
                    <lb/> to have passed already beyond the reach of my eye. <lb/> I exerted my
                    voice, but in vain. To my repeated <reg orig="excla-|mations"
                    >exclamations</reg>, <lb/> no answer was returned.</p>
                <p>Ruminating on these incidents, I returned hither. There <lb/> was no room to
                    doubt that I had heard my wife's voice; <lb/> attending incidents were not
                    easily explained; but you now <lb/> assure me that nothing extraordinary has
                    happened to urge <lb/> my return, and that my wife has not moved from her
                    seat."</p>
                <p>Such was my brother's narrative. It was heard by us <lb/> with different
                    emotions. Pleyel did not scruple to regard <lb/> the whole as a deception of the
                    senses. Perhaps a voice <lb/> had been heard; but Wieland's imagination had
                    misled him <lb/> in supposing a resemblance to that of his wife, and giving
                    <lb/> such a signification to the sounds. According to his custom <lb/> he spoke
                    what he thought. Sometimes, he made it the <lb/> theme of grave discussion, but
                    more frequently treated it <lb/> with ridicule. He did not believe that sober
                    reasoning <lb/> would convince his friend, and gaiety, he thought, was <reg
                        orig="use-|ful">useful</reg>
                    <lb/> to take away the solemnities which, in a mind like <reg orig="Wie-|land's"
                        >Wieland's</reg>, <lb/> an accident of this kind was calculated to
                    produce.</p>
                <p>Pleyel proposed to go in search of the letter. He went <lb/> and speedily
                    returned, bearing it in his hand. He had found <lb/> it open on the pedestal;
                    and neither voice nor visage had <lb/> risen to impede his design.</p>
                <p>Catharine was endowed with an uncommon portion of <lb/> good sense; but her mind
                    was accessible, on this quarter, <lb/>
                    <pb n="33" entity="eaf033v1_0074" pid="uva-lib:349104">

                    </pb> to wonder and panic. That her voice should be thus <reg
                        orig="inex-|plicably">inexplicably</reg>
                    <lb/> and unwarrantably assumed, was a source of no <lb/> small disquietude. She
                    admitted the plausibility of the <reg orig="ar-|guments">arguments</reg>
                    <lb/> by which Pleyel endeavored to prove, that this <lb/> was no more than an
                    auricular deception; but this <reg orig="convic-|tion">conviction</reg>
                    <lb/> was sure to be shaken, when she turned her eyes upon <lb/> her husband,
                    and perceived that Pleyel's logic was far from <lb/> having produced the same
                    effect upon him.</p>
                <p>As to myself, my attention was engaged by this <reg orig="occur-|rence"
                        >occurrence</reg>. <lb/> I could not fail to perceive a shadowy resemblance
                    <lb/> between it and my father's death. On the latter event, I <lb/> had
                    frequently reflected; my reflections never conducted <lb/> me to certainty, but
                    the doubts that existed were not of a <lb/> tormenting kind. I could not deny
                    that the event was <reg orig="mi-|raculous">miraculous</reg>, <lb/> and yet I
                    was invincibly averse to that method of <lb/> solution. My wonder was excited by
                    the inscrutableness <lb/> of the cause, but my wonder was unmixed with sorrow or
                    <lb/> fear. It begat in me a thrilling, and not unpleasing <reg
                        orig="solem-|nity">solemnity</reg>. <lb/> Similar to these were the
                    sensations produced by the <lb/> recent adventure.</p>
                <p>But its effect upon my brother's imagination was of chief <lb/> moment. All that
                    was desirable was, that it should be <reg orig="re-|garded">regarded</reg>
                    <lb/> by him with indifference. The worst effect that <lb/> could flow, was not
                    indeed very formidable. Yet I could <lb/> not bear to think that his senses
                    should be the victims of <lb/> such delusion. It argued a diseased condition of
                    his frame, <lb/> which might show itself hereafter in more dangerous <reg
                        orig="symp-|toms">symptoms</reg>. <lb/> The will is the tool of the
                    understanding, which <lb/> must fashion its conclusions on the notices of sense.
                    If the <lb/> senses be depraved, it is impossible to calculate the evils <lb/>
                    that may flow from the consequent deductions of the <reg orig="un-|derstanding"
                        >understanding</reg>.</p>
                <p>I said, this man is of an ardent and melancholy <reg orig="charac-|ter"
                        >character</reg>. <lb/> Those ideas which, in others, are casual or obscure,
                    <lb/> which are entertained in moments of abstraction and <reg orig="soli-|tude"
                        >solitude</reg>, <lb/> and easily escape when the scene is changed, have
                    <lb/> obtained an immoveable hold upon his mind. The <reg orig="conclu-|sions"
                        >conclusions</reg>
                    <lb/> which long habit have rendered familiar, and, in some <lb/> sort, palpable
                    to his intellect, are drawn from the deepest <lb/> sources. All his actions and
                    practical sentiments are linked <lb/>
                    <pb n="34" entity="eaf033v1_0075" pid="uva-lib:349105"/> with long and abstruse
                    deductions from the system of divine <lb/> government and the laws of our
                    intellectual constitution. <lb/> He is, in some respects, an enthusiast, but is
                    fortified in his <lb/> belief by innumerable arguments and subtilties.</p>
                <p>His father's death was always regarded by him as flowing <lb/> from a direct and
                    supernatural decree. It visited his <reg orig="medi-|tations">meditations</reg>
                    <lb/> oftener than it did mine. The traces which it left <lb/> were more gloomy
                    and permanent. This new incident had <lb/> a visible effect in augmenting his
                    gravity. He was less <reg orig="dis-|posed">disposed</reg>
                    <lb/> than formerly to converse and reading. When we <lb/> sifted his thoughts,
                    they were generally found to have a <lb/> relation, more or less direct, with
                    this incident. It was <reg orig="dif-|ficult">difficult</reg>
                    <lb/> to ascertain the exact species of impression which it <lb/> made upon him.
                    He never introduced the subject into <lb/> conversation, and listened with a
                    silent and half-serious <lb/> smile to the satirical effusions of Pleyel.</p>
                <p>One evening we chanced to be alone together in the <lb/> temple. I seized that
                    opportunity of investigating the state <lb/> of his thoughts. After a pause,
                    which he seemed in no <lb/> wise inclined to interrupt, I spoke to
                    him&mdash;"How almost <lb/> palpable is this dark; yet a ray from above would
                    dispel <lb/> it." "Ay," said Wieland, with fervor, "not only the <reg
                        orig="phy-|sical">physical</reg>, <lb/> but moral night would be dispelled."
                    "But why," <lb/> said I, "must the Divine Will address its precepts to the <lb/>
                    eye?" He smiled significantly. "True," said he, "the <lb/> understanding has
                    other avenues." "You have never," <lb/> said I, approaching nearer to the
                    point&mdash;"you have never <lb/> told me in what way you considered the late
                    extraordinary <lb/> incident." "There is no determinate way in which the <lb/>
                    subject can be viewed. Here is an effect, but the cause is <lb/> utterly
                    inscrutable. To suppose a deception, will not do. <lb/> Such is possible, but
                    there are twenty other suppositions <lb/> more probable. They must all be set
                    aside before we <lb/> reach that point." "What are these twenty suppositions?"
                    <lb/> "It is needless to mention them. They are only less <reg
                        orig="im-|probable">improbable</reg>
                    <lb/> than Pleyel's. Time may convert one of them <lb/> into certainty. Till
                    then it is useless to expatiate on them."</p>

                <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Some</hi> time had elapsed when there happened another
                    <lb/> occurrence, still more remarkable. Pleyel, on his return <lb/> from
                    Europe, brought information of considerable <reg orig="impor-|tance"
                        >importance</reg>
                    <lb/> to my brother. My ancestors were noble Saxons, <lb/> and possessed large
                    domains in Lusatia. The Prussian <lb/> wars had destroyed those persons whose
                    right to these <reg orig="es-|tates">estates</reg>
                    <lb/> precluded my brother's. Pleyel had been exact in his <lb/> inquiries, and
                    had discovered that, by the law of <reg orig="male-|primogeniture"
                        >male-primogeniture</reg>, <lb/> my brother's claims were superior to those
                    <lb/> of any other person now living. Nothing was wanting but <lb/> his presence
                    in that country, and a legal application, to <lb/> establish this claim.</p>
                <p>Pleyel strenuously recommended this measure. The <lb/> advantages he thought
                    attending it were numerous, and it <lb/> would argue the utmost folly to neglect
                    them. Contrary to <lb/> his expectation, he found my brother averse to the
                    scheme. <lb/> Slight efforts, he at first thought, would subdue his <reg
                        orig="reluc-|tance">reluctance</reg>; <lb/> but he found this aversion by no
                    means slight. The <lb/> interest that he took in the happiness of his friend and
                    his <lb/> sister, and his own partiality to the Saxon soil, from which <lb/> he
                    had likewise sprung, and where he had spent several <lb/> years of his youth,
                    made him redouble his exertions to win <lb/> Wieland's consent. For this end he
                    employed every <reg orig="argu-|ment">argument</reg>
                    <lb/> that his invention could suggest. He painted, in <lb/> attractive colors,
                    the state of manners and government in <lb/> that country, the security of civil
                    rights, and the freedom of <lb/> religious sentiments. He dwelt on the
                    privileges of wealth <lb/> and rank, and drew from the servile condition of one
                    class, <lb/> an argument in favor of his scheme, since the revenue and <lb/>
                    power annexed to a German principality afford so large <lb/> a field for
                    benevolence. The evil flowing from this power, <lb/> in malignant hands, was
                    proportioned to the good that would <lb/> arise from the virtuous use of it.
                    Hence, Wieland, in <reg orig="for-|bearing">forbearing</reg>
                    <lb/> to claim his own, withheld all the positive felicity <lb/> that would
                    accrue to his vassals from his success, and <reg orig="haz-|arded"
                        >hazarded</reg>
                    <lb/> all the misery that would redound from a less <reg orig="enlight-|ened"
                        >enlightened</reg>
                    <lb/> proprietor.</p>
                <pb n="36" entity="eaf033v1_0077" pid="uva-lib:349107"/>
                <p>It was easy for my brother to repel these arguments, and <lb/> to shew that no
                    spot on the globe enjoyed equal security and <lb/> liberty to that which he at
                    present inhabited. That if the <lb/> Saxons had nothing to fear from
                    misgovernment, the <reg orig="exter-|nal">external</reg>
                    <lb/> causes of havoc and alarm were numerous and <reg orig="mani-|fest"
                        >manifest</reg>. <lb/> The recent devastations committed by the Prussians
                    <lb/> furnished a specimen of these. The horrors of war would <lb/> always
                    impend over them, till Germany were seized and <lb/> divided by Austrian and
                    Prussian tyrants; an event which <lb/> he strongly suspected was at no great
                    distance. But setting <lb/> these considerations aside, was it laudable to grasp
                    at wealth <lb/> and power even when they were within our reach? Were <lb/> not
                    these the two great sources of depravity? What security <lb/> had he, that in
                    this change of place and condition, he should <lb/> not degenerate into a tyrant
                    and voluptuary? Power and <lb/> riches were chiefly to be dreaded on account of
                    their <reg orig="ten-|dency">tendency</reg>
                    <lb/> to deprave the possessor. He held them in <reg orig="abhor-|rence"
                        >abhorrence</reg>, <lb/> not only as instruments of misery to others, but to
                    <lb/> him on whom they were conferred. Besides, riches were <lb/> comparative,
                    and was he not rich already? He lived at <lb/> present in the bosom of security
                    and luxury. All the <reg orig="instru-|ments">instruments</reg>
                    <lb/> of pleasure, on which his reason or imagination set any <lb/> value, were
                    within his reach. But these he must forego, <lb/> for the sake of advantages
                    which, whatever were their value, <lb/> were as yet uncertain. In pursuit of an
                    imaginary addition <lb/> to his wealth, he must reduce himself to poverty, he
                    must <lb/> exchange present certainties for what was distant and <reg
                        orig="con-|tingent">contingent</reg>; <lb/> for who knows not that the law
                    is a system of <reg orig="ex-|pense">expense</reg>, <lb/> delay and uncertainty?
                    If he should embrace this <lb/> scheme, it would lay him under the necessity of
                    making a <lb/> voyage to Europe, and remaining for a certain period, <reg
                        orig="sepa-|rate">separate</reg>
                    <lb/> from his family. He must undergo the perils and <reg orig="dis-|comforts"
                        >discomforts</reg>
                    <lb/> of the ocean; he must divest himself of all domestic <lb/> pleasures; he
                    must deprive his wife of her companion, and <lb/> his children of a father and
                    instructer, and all for what? For <lb/> the ambiguous advantages which overgrown
                    wealth and <lb/> flagitious tyranny have to bestow? For a precarious <reg
                        orig="posses-|sion">possession</reg>
                    <lb/> in a land of turbulence and war? Advantages, which <lb/> will not
                    certainly be gained, and of which the acquisition, <lb/> if it were sure, is
                    necessarily distant.</p>

                <p>Pleyel was enamoured of his scheme on account of its <lb/> intrinsic benefits,
                    but, likewise, for other reasons. His abode <lb/> at Leipsig made that country
                    appear to him like home. He <lb/> was connected with this place by many social
                    ties. While <lb/> there he had not escaped the amorous contagion. But the <lb/>
                    lady, though her heart was impressed in his favor, was <reg orig="com-|pelled"
                        >compelled</reg>
                    <lb/> to bestow her hand upon another. Death had <reg orig="re-|moved"
                        >removed</reg>
                    <lb/> this impediment, and he was now invited by the lady <lb/> herself to
                    return. This he was of course determined to do, <lb/> but was anxious to obtain
                    the company of Wieland; he <lb/> could not bear to think of an eternal
                    separation from his <lb/> present associates. Their interest, he thought, would
                    be <lb/> no less promoted by the change than his own. Hence he <lb/> was
                    importunate and indefatigable in his arguments and <lb/> solicitations.</p>
                <p>He knew that he could not hope for mine or his sister's <lb/> ready concurrence
                    in this scheme. Should the subject be <lb/> mentioned to us, we should league
                    our efforts against him, <lb/> and strengthen that reluctance in Wieland which
                    already <lb/> was sufficiently difficult to conquer. He, therefore, <reg
                        orig="anxious-|ly">anxiously</reg>
                    <lb/> concealed from us his purpose. If Wieland were <reg orig="pre-|viously"
                        >previously</reg>
                    <lb/> enlisted in his cause, he would find it a less difficult <lb/> task to
                    overcome our aversion. My brother was silent on <lb/> this subject, because he
                    believed himself in no danger of <lb/> changing his opinion, and he was willing
                    to save us from any <lb/> uneasiness. The mere mention of such a scheme, and the
                    <lb/> possibility of his embracing it, he knew, would considerably <lb/> impair
                    our tranquillity.</p>
                <p>One day, about three weeks subsequent to the <reg orig="mysteri-|ous"
                        >mysterious</reg>
                    <lb/> call, it was agreed that the family should be my guests. <lb/> Seldom had
                    a day been passed by us, of more serene <reg orig="en-|joyment">enjoyment</reg>.
                    <lb/> Pleyel had promised us his company, but we <lb/> did not see him till the
                    sun had nearly declined. He <lb/> brought with him a countenance that betokened
                        <reg orig="disappoint-|ment">disappointment</reg>
                    <lb/> and vexation. He did not wait for our inquiries, but <lb/> immediately
                    explained the cause. Two days before a packet <lb/> had arrived from Hamburgh,
                    by which he had flattered <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>
                    <lb/> with the expectation of receiving letters, but no letters <lb/> had
                    arrived. I never saw him so much subdued by an <reg orig="un-|toward"
                        >untoward</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="38" entity="eaf033v1_0079" pid="uva-lib:349109"/> event. His thoughts
                    were employed in accounting <lb/> for the silence of his friends. He was seized
                    with the <reg orig="tor-|ments">torments</reg>
                    <lb/> of jealousy, and suspected nothing less than the <reg orig="infi-|delity"
                        >infidelity</reg>
                    <lb/> of her to whom he had devoted his heart. The <lb/> silence must have been
                    concerted. Her sickness, or <reg orig="ab-|sence">absence</reg>, <lb/> or death,
                    would have increased the certainty of some <lb/> one's having written. No
                    supposition could be formed but <lb/> that his mistress had grown indifferent,
                    or that she had <reg orig="trans-|ferred">transferred</reg>
                    <lb/> her affections to another. The miscarriage of a letter <lb/> was hardly
                    within the reach of possibility. From Leipsig <lb/> to Hamburgh, and from
                    Hamburgh hither, the conveyance <lb/> was exposed to no hazard.</p>
                <p>He had been so long detained in America chiefly in <reg orig="con-|sequence"
                        >consequence</reg>
                    <lb/> of Wieland's aversion to the scheme which he <lb/> proposed. He now became
                    more impatient than ever to <lb/> return to Europe. When he reflected that, by
                    his delays, <lb/> he had probably forfeited the affections of his mistress, his
                    <lb/> sensations amounted to agony. It only remained, by his <lb/> speedy
                    departure, to repair, if possible, or prevent so <reg orig="intole-|rable"
                        >intolerable</reg>
                    <lb/> an evil. Already he had half resolved to embark in <lb/> this very ship,
                    which he was informed, would set out in a <lb/> few weeks on her return.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile he determined to make a new attempt to <lb/> shake the resolution of
                    Wieland. The evening was <reg orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg>
                    <lb/> advanced when he invited the latter to walk abroad <lb/> with him. The
                    invitation was accepted, and they left <reg orig="Catha-|rine">Catharine</reg>,
                    <lb/> Louisa, and me, to amuse ourselves by the best means <lb/> in our power.
                    During this walk, Pleyel renewed the <reg orig="sub-|ject">subject</reg>
                    <lb/> that was nearest his heart. He re-urged all his former <lb/> arguments,
                    and placed them in more forcible lights.</p>
                <p>They promised to return shortly; but hour after hour <lb/> passed, and they made
                    not their appearance. Engaged in <lb/> sprightly conversation, it was not till
                    the clock struck twelve <lb/> that we were reminded of the lapse of time. The
                    absence <lb/> of our friends excited some uneasy apprehensions. We <lb/> were
                    expressing our fears, and comparing our conjectures <lb/> as to what might be
                    the cause, when they entered together. <lb/> There were indications in their
                    countenances that struck me <lb/> mute. These were unnoticed by Catharine, who
                    was eager <lb/> to express her surprise and curiosity at the length of their <lb/>
                    <pb n="39" entity="eaf033v1_0080" pid="uva-lib:349110"/> walk. As they listened
                    to her, I remarked that their <reg orig="sur-|prise">surprise</reg>
                    <lb/> was not less than ours. They gazed in silence on <lb/> each other, and on
                    her. I watched their looks, but could <lb/> not understand the emotions that
                    were written in them.</p>
                <p>These appearances diverted Catharine's inquiries into a <lb/> new channel. What
                    did they mean, she asked, by their <lb/> silence, and by their thus gazing
                    wildly at each other, and <lb/> at her? Pleyel profited by this hint, and
                    assuming an air <lb/> of indifference, framed some trifling excuse, at the same
                    <lb/> time darting significant glances at Wieland, as if to caution <lb/> him
                    against disclosing the truth. My brother said nothing, <lb/> but delivered
                    himself up to meditation. I likewise was <lb/> silent, but burned with
                    impatience to fathom this mystery. <lb/> Presently my brother and his wife, and
                    Louisa, returned <lb/> home. Pleyel proposed, of his own accord, to be my <lb/>
                    guest for the night. This circumstance, in addition to those <lb/> which
                    preceded, gave new edge to my wonder.</p>
                <p>As soon as we were left alone, Pleyel's countenance <reg orig="as-|sumed"
                        >assumed</reg>
                    <lb/> an air of seriousness, and even consternation, which <lb/> I had never
                    before heheld in him. The steps with which <lb/> he measured the floor betokened
                    the trouble of his thoughts. <lb/> My inquiries were suspended by the hope that
                    he would <lb/> give me the information that I wanted without the <reg
                        orig="importu-|nity">importunity</reg>
                    <lb/> of questions. I waited some time, but the confusion <lb/> of his thoughts
                    appeared in no degree to abate. At length <lb/> I mentioned the apprehensions
                    which their unusual absence <lb/> had occasioned, and which were increased by
                    their <reg orig="beha-|viour">behaviour</reg>
                    <lb/> since their return, and solicited an explanation. He <lb/> stopped when I
                    began to speak, and looked steadfastly at <lb/> me. When I had done, he said to
                    me, in a tone which <lb/> faltered through the vehemence of his emotions, "How
                    <lb/> were you employed during our absence?" "In turning <lb/> over the Della
                    Crusca dictionary, and talking on different <lb/> subjects; but just before your
                    entrance, we were <reg orig="torment-|ing">tormenting</reg>
                    <lb/> ourselves with omens and prognostics relative to your <lb/> absence."
                    "Catharine was with you the whole time?" <lb/> "Yes," "But are you sure?" "Most
                    sure. She was not <lb/> absent a moment." He stood, for a time, as if to assure
                    <lb/> himself of my sincerity. Then, clenching his hands, and <lb/> wildly
                    lifting them above his head, "Lo," cried he, "I <lb/>
                    <pb n="40" entity="eaf033v1_0081" pid="uva-lib:349111"/> have news to tell you.
                    The Baroness de Stolberg is <lb/> dead?"</p>
                <p>This was her whom he loved. I was not surprised at <lb/> the agitation which he
                    betrayed. "But how was the <reg orig="infor-|mation">information</reg>
                    <lb/> procured? How was the truth of this news <reg orig="con-|nected"
                        >connected</reg>
                    <lb/> with the circumstance of Catharine's remaining in <lb/> our company?" He
                    was for some time inattentive to my <lb/> questions. When he spoke, it seemed
                    merely a <reg orig="continua-|tion">continuation</reg>
                    <lb/> of the reverie into which he had been plunged.</p>
                <p>"And yet it might be a mere deception. But could <lb/> both of us in that case
                    have been deceived? A rare and <lb/> prodigious coincidence! Barely not
                    impossible. And yet, <lb/> if the accent be oracular&mdash;Theresa is dead. No,
                    no," <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg>
                    <lb/> he, covering his face with his hands, and in a tone <lb/> half broken into
                    sobs, "I cannot believe it. She has not <reg orig="writ-|ten">written</reg>,
                    <lb/> but if she were dead, the faithful Bertrand would <lb/> have given me the
                    earliest information. And yet if he <lb/> knew his master, he must have easily
                    guessed at the effect <lb/> of such tidings. In pity to me he was silent."</p>
                <p>"Clara, forgive me; to you, this behaviour is mysterious. <lb/> I will explain as
                    well as I am able. But say not a word to <lb/> Catharine. Her strength of mind
                    is inferior to your's. <lb/> She will, besides, have more reason to be startled.
                    She is <lb/> Wieland's angel.</p>
                <p>Pleyel proceeded to inform me, for the first time, of the <lb/> scheme which he
                    had pressed, with so much earnestness, <lb/> on my brother. He enumerated the
                    objections which had <lb/> been made, and the industry with which he had
                    endeavored <lb/> to confute them. He mentioned the effect upon his <reg
                        orig="resolu-|tions">resolutions</reg>
                    <lb/> produced by the failure of a letter. "During our <lb/> late walk,"
                    continued he, "I introduced the subject that <lb/> was nearest my heart. I
                    re-urged all my former arguments, <lb/> and placed them in more forcible lights.
                    Wieland was still <lb/> refractory. He expatiated on the perils of wealth and
                    <lb/> power, on the sacredness of conjugal and parental duties, <lb/> and the
                    happiness of mediocrity.</p>
                <p>"No wonder that the time passed, unperceived, away. <lb/> Our whole souls were
                    engaged in this cause. Several <lb/> times we came to the foot of the rock; as
                    soon as we <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg>
                    <lb/> it, we changed our course, but never failed to <reg orig="ter-|minate"
                        >terminate</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="41" entity="eaf033v1_0082" pid="uva-lib:349112"/> our circuitous and
                    devious ramble at this spot. At <lb/> length your brother observed, `We seem to
                    be led hither <lb/> by a kind of fatality. Since we are so near, let us ascend
                    <lb/> and rest ourselves awhile. If you are not weary of this <lb/> argument we
                    will resume it there.'</p>
                <p>"I tacitly consented. We mounted the stairs, and <reg orig="draw-|ing"
                        >drawing</reg>
                    <lb/> the sofa in front of the river, we seated ourselves upon <lb/> it. I took
                    up the thread of our discourse where we had <lb/> dropped it. I ridiculed his
                    dread of the sea, and his <reg orig="at-|tachment">attachment</reg>
                    <lb/> to home. I kept on in this strain, so congenial <lb/> with my disposition,
                    for some time, uninterrupted by him. <lb/> At length, he said to me, `Suppose
                    now that I, whom <reg orig="ar-|gument">argument</reg>
                    <lb/> has not convinced, should yield to ridicule, and <lb/> should agree that
                    your scheme is eligible; what will you <lb/> have gained? Nothing. You have
                    other enemies besides <lb/> myself to encounter. When you have vanquished me,
                    <lb/> your toil has scarcely begun. There are my sister and <lb/> wife, with
                    whom it will remain for you to maintain the <reg orig="con-|test">contest</reg>.
                    <lb/> And trust me, they are adversaries whom all your <lb/> force and stratagem
                    will never subdue.' I insinuated that <lb/> they would model themselves by his
                    will; that Catharine <lb/> would think obedience her duty. He answered, with
                    some <lb/> quickness, `You mistake. Their concurrence is <reg
                        orig="indispen-|sable">indispensable</reg>. <lb/> It is not my custom to
                    exact sacrifices of this kind. <lb/> I live to be their protector and friend,
                    and not their tyrant <lb/> and foe. If my wife shall deem her happiness, and
                    that of <lb/> her children, most consulted by remaining where she is, <lb/> here
                    she shall remain.' `But,' said I, `when she knows <lb/> your pleasure, will she
                    not conform to it?' Before my <lb/> friend had time to answer this question, a
                    negative was <lb/> clearly and distinctly uttered from another quarter. It did
                    <lb/> not come from one side or the other, from before us or <reg
                        orig="be-|hind">behind</reg>. <lb/> Whence then did it come? By whose organs
                    was <lb/> it fashioned?</p>
                <p>"If any uncertainty had existed with regard to these <lb/> particulars, it would
                    have been removed by a deliberate <lb/> and equally distinct repetition of the
                    same monosyllable, <lb/> `No.' The voice was my sister's. It appeared to come
                    <lb/> from the roof. I started from my seat. Catharine, <reg orig="ex-|claimed"
                        >exclaimed</reg>
                    <lb/> I, where are you? No answer was returned. I <lb/>
                    <pb n="42" entity="eaf033v1_0083" pid="uva-lib:349113"/> searched the room, and
                    the area before it, but in vain. <lb/> Your brother was motionless in his seat.
                    I returned to him, <lb/> and placed myself again by his side. My astonishment
                    was <lb/> not less than his.</p>
                <p>" `Well,' said he at length, `What think you of this? <lb/> This is the self-same
                    voice which I formerly heard; you are <lb/> now convinced that my ears were well
                    informed.'</p>
                <p>" `Yes,' said I, `this, it is plain, is no fiction of the <lb/> fancy.' We again
                    sunk into mutual and thoughtful silence. <lb/> A recollection of the hour, and
                    of the length of our <reg orig="ab-|sence">absence</reg>, <lb/> made me at last
                    propose to return. We rose up <lb/> for this purpose. In doing this, my mind
                    reverted to the <lb/> contemplation of my own condition. `Yes,' said I aloud,
                    <lb/> but without particularly addressing myself to Wieland, `my <lb/>
                    resolution is taken. I cannot hope to prevail with my friends <lb/> to accompany
                    me. They may doze away their days on <lb/> the banks of Schuylkill, but as to
                    me, I go in the next <reg orig="ves-|sel">vessel</reg>; <lb/> I will fly to her
                    presence, and demand the reason of <lb/> this extraordinary silence.'</p>
                <p>"I had scarcely finished the sentence, when the same <lb/> mysterious voice
                    exclaimed, `You shall not go. The seal <lb/> of death is on her lips. Her
                    silence is the silence of the <lb/> tomb.' Think of the effects which accents
                    like these must <lb/> have had upon me. I shuddered as I listened. As soon <lb/>
                    as I recovered from my first amazement, `Who is it that <lb/> speaks?' said I,
                    `whence did you procure these dismal <lb/> tidings?' I did not wait long for an
                    answer. `From a <lb/> source that cannot fail. Be satisfied. She is dead.' You
                    <lb/> may justly be surprised, that, in the circumstances in which <lb/> I heard
                    the tidings, and notwithstanding the mystery which <lb/> environed him by whom
                    they were imparted, I could give <lb/> an undivided attention to the facts,
                    which were the subject <lb/> of our dialogue. I eagerly inquired, when and where
                    did <lb/> she die? What was the cause of her death? Was her <lb/> death
                    absolutely certain? An answer was returned only to <lb/> the last of these
                    questions. `Yes,' was pronounced by <lb/> the same voice; but it now sounded
                    from a greater distance, <lb/> and the deepest silence was all the return made
                    to my <reg orig="sub-|sequent">subsequent</reg>
                    <lb/> interrogatories.</p>
                <p>"It was my sister's voice; but it could not be uttered by <lb/>
                    <pb n="43" entity="eaf033v1_0084" pid="uva-lib:349114"/> her; and yet, if not by
                    her, by whom was it uttered? When <lb/> we returned hither, and discovered you
                    together, the doubt <lb/> that had previously existed was removed. It was <reg
                        orig="mani-|fest">manifest</reg>
                    <lb/> that the intimation came not from her. Yet if not from <lb/> her, from
                    whom could it come? Are the circumstances <lb/> attending the imparting of this
                    news proof that the tidings <lb/> are true? God forbid that they should be
                    true."</p>
                <p>Here Pleyel sunk into anxious silence, and gave me <reg orig="lei-|sure"
                        >leisure</reg>
                    <lb/> to ruminate on this inexplicable event. I am at a loss <lb/> to describe
                    the sensations that affected me. I am not <reg orig="fear-|ful">fearful</reg>
                    <lb/> of shadows. The tales of apparitions and enchantments <lb/> did not
                    possess that power over my belief which could even <lb/> render them
                    interesting. I saw nothing in them but ignorance <lb/> and folly, and was a
                    stranger even to that terror which is <lb/> pleasing. But this incident was
                    different from any that I <lb/> had ever before known. Here were proofs of a
                    sensible <lb/> and intelligent existence, which could not be denied. Here <lb/>
                    was information obtained and imparted by means <reg orig="unques-|tionably"
                        >unquestionably</reg>
                    <lb/> super-human.</p>
                <p>That there are conscious beings, besides ourselves, in <lb/> existence, whose
                    modes of activity and information <reg orig="sur-|pass">surpass</reg>
                    <lb/> our own, can scarcely be denied. Is there a glimpse <lb/> afforded us into
                    a world of these superior beings? My <lb/> heart was scarcely large enough to
                    give admittance to so <lb/> swelling a thought. An awe, the sweetest and most
                        <reg orig="so-|lemn">solemn</reg>
                    <lb/> that imagination can conceive, pervaded my whole <lb/> frame. It forsook
                    me not when I parted from Pleyel and <lb/> retired to my chamber. An impulse was
                    given to my <lb/> spirits utterly incompatible with sleep. I passed the night
                    <lb/> wakeful and full of meditation. I was impressed with the <lb/> belief of
                    mysterious, but not of malignant agency. <reg orig="Hither-|to">Hitherto</reg>
                    <lb/> nothing had occurred to persuade me that this airy <reg orig="minis-|ter"
                        >minister</reg>
                    <lb/> was busy to evil rather than to good purposes. On the <lb/> contrary, the
                    idea of superior virtue had always been <reg orig="as-|sociated"
                        >associated</reg>
                    <lb/> in my mind with that of superior power. The <lb/> warnings that had thus
                    been heard appeared to have been <lb/> prompted by beneficent intentions. My
                    brother had been <lb/> hindered by this voice from ascending the hill. He was
                    <lb/> told that danger lurked in his path, and his obedience to <lb/>
                    <pb n="44" entity="eaf033v1_0085" pid="uva-lib:349115"/> the intimation had
                    perhaps saved him from a destiny <reg orig="simi-|lar">similar</reg>
                    <lb/> to that of my father.</p>
                <p>Pleyel had been rescued from formenting uncertainty, <lb/> and from the hazards
                    and fatigues of a fruitless voyage, <lb/> by the same interposition. It had
                    assured him of the death <lb/> of his Theresa.</p>
                <p>This woman was then dead. A confirmation of the <lb/> tidings, if true, would
                    speedily arrive. Was this <reg orig="confirm-|ation">confirmation</reg>
                    <lb/> to be deprecated or desired? By her death, the tie <lb/> that attached him
                    to Europe, was taken way. <reg orig="Hencefor-|ward">Henceforward</reg>
                    <lb/> every motive would combine to retain him in his <lb/> native country, and
                    we were rescued from the deep regrets <lb/> that would accompany his hopeless
                    absence from us. <reg orig="Pro-|pitious">Propitious</reg>
                    <lb/> was the spirit that imparted these tidings. Propitious <lb/> he would
                    perhaps have been, if he had been instrumental <lb/> in producing, as well as in
                    communicating the tidings of her <lb/> death. Propitious to us, the friends of
                    Pleyel, to whom <lb/> has thereby been secured the enjoyment of his society;
                    <lb/> and not unpropitious to himself; for though this object of <lb/> his love
                    be snatched away, is there not another who is able <lb/> and willing to console
                    him for her loss?</p>
                <p>Twenty days after this, another vessel arrived from the <lb/> same port. In this
                    interval, Pleyel, for the most part, <lb/> estranged himself from his old
                    companions. He was <reg orig="be-|come">become</reg>
                    <lb/> the prey of a gloomy and unsociable grief. His <lb/> walks were limited to
                    the bank of the Delaware. This bank <lb/> is an artificial one. Reeds and the
                    river are on one side, <lb/> and a wartery marsh on the other, in that part
                    which <reg orig="bound-|ed">bounded</reg>
                    <lb/> his lands, and which extended from the mouth of <reg orig="Hol-|lander's"
                        >Hollander's</reg>
                    <lb/> creek to that of Schuylkill. No scene can be <lb/>
                    <unclear id="u22">imagined</unclear> less enticing to a lover of the pcituresque
                    than <lb/> this. The shore is deformed with mud, and encumbered <lb/> with a
                    forest of reeds. The fields, in most seasons, are <lb/> mire; but when they
                    afford a firm footing, the ditches by <lb/> which they are bounded and
                    intersected, are mantled with <lb/> stagnating green, and emit the most noxious
                    exhalations. <lb/> Health is no less a strange to those seats than pleasure.
                    <lb/> Spring and autumn are sure to be accompanied with agues <lb/> and bilious
                    remittents.</p>
                <p>The scenes which environed our dwellings at Mettingen <lb/>
                    <pb n="45" entity="eaf033v1_0086" pid="uva-lib:349116">

                    </pb> constituted the reverse of this. Schuylkill was here a pure <lb/> and
                    translucid current broken into wild and ceaseless music <lb/> by rocky points,
                    murmuring on a sandy margin, and <reg orig="reflect-|ing">reflecting</reg>
                    <lb/> on its surface, banks of all varieties of height and <reg orig="de-|grees"
                        >degrees</reg>
                    <lb/> of declivity. These banks were checkered by patches <lb/> of dark verdure
                    and shapeless masses of white marble, <lb/> and crowned by copses of cedar, or
                    by the regular <reg orig="mag-|nificence">magnificence</reg>
                    <lb/> of orchards, which, at this season, were in blossom, <lb/> and were
                    prodigal of odors. The ground which receded <lb/> from the river was scooped
                    into valleys and dales. Its <reg orig="beau-|ties">beauties</reg>
                    <lb/> were enhanced by the horticultural skill of my brother, <lb/> who bedecked
                    this exquisite assemblage of slopes and risings <lb/> with every species of
                    vegetable ornament, from the giant <lb/> arms of the oak to the clustering
                    tendrils of the <reg orig="honey-|suckle">honeysuckle</reg>.</p>
                <p>To screen him from the unwholesome airs of his own <lb/> residence, it had been
                    proposed to Pleyel to spend the <lb/> months of spring with us. He had
                    apparently acquiesced <lb/> in this proposal; but the late event induced him to
                    change <lb/> his purpose. He was only to be seen by visiting him in his <lb/>
                    retirements. His gaiety had flown, and every passion was <lb/> absorbed in
                    eagerness to procure tidings from Saxony. I <lb/> have mentioned the arrival of
                    another vessel from the Elbe. <lb/> He descried her early one morning as he was
                    passing <lb/> along the skirt of the river. She was easily recognised, <lb/>
                    being the ship in which he had performed his first voyage to <lb/> Germany. He
                    immediately went on board, but found no <lb/> letters directed to him. This
                    omission was, in some degree, <lb/> compensated by meeting with an old
                    acquaintance among <lb/> the passengers, who had till lately been a resident in
                    Leipsig. <lb/> This person put an end to all suspense respecting the fate of
                    <lb/> Theresa, by relating the particulars of her death and funeral.</p>
                <p>Thus was the truth of the former intimation attested. <lb/> No longer devoured by
                    suspense, the grief of Pleyel was <lb/> not long in yielding to the influence of
                    society. He gave <lb/> himself up once more to our company. His vivacity had
                    <lb/> indeed been damped; but even in this respect he was a <lb/> more
                    acceptable companion than formerly, since his <reg orig="serious-|ness"
                        >seriousness</reg>
                    <lb/> was neither incommunicative nor sullen.</p>
                <p>These incidents, for a time, occupied all our thoughts. <lb/>
                    <pb n="46" entity="eaf033v1_0087" pid="uva-lib:349117"/> In me they produced a
                    sentiment not unallied to pleasure, <lb/> and more speedily than in the case of
                    my friends were <reg orig="in-|termixed">intermixed</reg>
                    <lb/> with other topics. My brother was particularly <lb/> affected by them. It
                    was easy to perceive that most of his <lb/> meditations were tinctured from this
                    source. To this was <lb/> to be ascribed a design in which his pen was, at this
                    period <lb/> engaged, of collecting and investigating the facts which relate
                    <lb/> to that mysterious personage, the D&aelig;mon of Socrates.</p>
                <p>My brother's skill in Greek and Roman learning was <reg orig="ex-|ceeded"
                        >exceeded</reg>
                    <lb/> by that of few, and no doubt the world would have <lb/> accepted a
                    treatise upon this subject from his hand with <lb/> avidity; but alas! this and
                    every other scheme of felicity <lb/> and honor, were doomed to sudden blast and

                    <lb/> of the task which I have undertaken; but it would <lb/> be weakness to

                <p>I have taken a few turns in my chamber, and have <lb/> gathered strength enough

                    irresolution is momentary. I have not formed this design <lb/>

                <p>One sunny afternoon, I was standing in the door of my <lb/> house, when I marked
                    a person passing close to the edge of <lb/> the bank that was in front. His pace
                    was a careless and <lb/> lingering one, and had none of that gracefulness and
                    ease <lb/> which distinguish a person with certain advantages of <reg
                        orig="edu-|cation">education</reg>
                    <lb/> from a clown. His gait was rustic and awkward. <lb/> His form was ungainly
                    and disproportioned. Shoulders <lb/> broad and square, breast sunken, his head
                    drooping, his <lb/> body of uniform breadth, supported by long and lank legs,
                    <lb/> were the ingredients of his frame. His garb was not ill <lb/> adapted to
                    such a figure. A slouched hat, tarnished by the <lb/> weather, a coat of thick
                    grey cloth, cut and wrought, as it <lb/> seemed, by a country tailor, blue
                    worsted stockings, and <lb/> shoes fastened by thongs, and deeply discolored by
                    dust, <lb/> which brush had never disturbed, constituted his dress.</p>
                <p>There was nothing remarkable in these appearances; <lb/> they were frequently to
                    be met with on the road, and in <lb/> the harvest field. I cannot tell why I
                    gazed upon them, <lb/> on this occasion, with more than ordinary attention,
                    unless <lb/> it were that such figures were seldom seen by me, except <lb/> on
                    the road or field. This lawn was only traversed by men <lb/> whose views were
                    directed to the pleasures of the walk, or <lb/> the grandeur of the scenery.</p>
                <p>He passed slowly along, frequently pausing, as if to <reg orig="ex-|amine"
                        >examine</reg>
                    <lb/> the prospect more deliberately, but never turning his <lb/>
                    <pb n="48" entity="eaf033v1_0089" pid="uva-lib:349119"/> eye towards the house,
                    so as to allow me a view of his <lb/> countenance. Presently, he entered a copse
                    at a small <lb/> distance, and disappeared. My eye followed him while he <lb/>
                    remained in sight. If his image remained for any duration <lb/> in my fancy
                    after his departure, it was because no other <lb/> object occurred sufficient to
                    expel it.</p>
                <p>I continued in the same spot for half an hour, vaguely, <lb/> and by fits,
                    contemplating the image of this wanderer, and <lb/> drawing, from outward
                    appearances, those inferences, with <lb/> respect to the intellectual history of
                    this person, which <lb/> experience affords us. I reflected on the alliance
                    which <lb/> commonly subsists between ignorance and the practice of <lb/>
                    agriculture, and indulged myself in airy speculations as to <lb/> the influence
                    of progressive knowledge in dissolving this <reg orig="alli-|ance"
                        >alliance</reg>, <lb/> and embodying the dreams of the poets. I asked <lb/>
                    why the plough and the hoe might not become the trade of <lb/> every human
                    being, and how this trade might be made <reg orig="con-|ducive">conducive</reg>
                    <lb/> to, or, at least, consistent with the acquisition of <reg orig="wis-|dom"
                        >wisdom</reg>
                    <lb/> and eloquence.</p>
                <p>Weary with these reflections, I returned to the kitchen to <lb/> perform some
                    household office. I had usually but one <lb/> servant, and she was a girl about
                    my own age. I was busy <lb/> near the chimney, and she was employed near the
                    door of <lb/> the apartment, when some one knocked. The door was <lb/> opened by
                    her, and she was immediately addressed with <lb/> "Pry'thee, good girl, canst
                    thou supply a thirsty man with <lb/> a glass of buttermilk?" She answered that
                    there was none <lb/> in the house. "Aye, but there is some in the dairy yonder.
                    <lb/> Thou knowest as well as I, though Hermes never taught <lb/> thee, that
                    though every dairy be a house, every house is not <lb/> a dairy." To this
                    speech, though she understood only a <lb/> part of it, she replied by repeating
                    her assurances, that she <lb/> had none to give. "Well, then," rejoined the
                    stranger, "for <lb/> charity's sweet sake, hand me forth a cup of cold water."
                    <lb/> The girl said she would go to the spring and fetch it. <lb/> "Nay, give me
                    the cup, and suffer me to help myself. <lb/> Neither manacled nor lame, I should
                    merit burial in the maw <lb/> of carrion crows, if I laid this task upon thee.
                    She gave <lb/> him the cup, and he turned to go to the spring.</p>
                <p>I listened to this dialogue in silence. The words uttered <lb/>

                    </pb> by the person without, affected me as somewhat singular, <lb/> but what
                    chiefly rendered them remarkable, was the tone <lb/> that accompanied them. It
                    was wholly new. My brother's <lb/> voice and Pleyel's were musical and
                    energetic. I had <lb/> fondly imagined, that, in this respect, they were
                    surpassed <lb/> by none. Now my mistake was detected. I cannot <reg
                        orig="pre-|tend">pretend</reg>
                    <lb/> to communicate the impression that was made upon <lb/> me by these
                    accents, or to depict the degree in which force <lb/> and sweetness were blended
                    in them. They were <reg orig="articu-|lated">articulated</reg>
                    <lb/> with a distinctness that was unexampled in my <reg orig="expe-|rience"
                        >experience</reg>. <lb/> But this was not all. The voice was not only <lb/>
                    mellifluent and clear, but the emphasis was so just, and the <lb/> modulation so
                    impassioned, that it seemed as if a heart of <lb/> stone could not fail of being
                    moved by it. It imparted to <lb/> me an emotion altogether involuntary and
                    incontrolable. <lb/> When he uttered the words, "for charity's sweet sake," I
                    <lb/> dropped the cloth that I held in my hand, my heart <reg
                        orig="over-|flowed">overflowed</reg>
                    <lb/> with sympathy, and my eyes with unbidden tears.</p>
                <p>This description will appear to you triffing or incredible. <lb/> The importance
                    of these circumstances will be manifested <lb/> in the sequel. The manner in
                    which I was affected on this <lb/> occasion, was, to my own apprehension, a
                    subject of <reg orig="astonish-|ment">astonishment</reg>. <lb/> The tones were
                    indeed such as I never heard <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg>; <lb/> but that
                    they should, in an instant, as it were, dissolve <lb/> me in tears, will not
                    easily be believed by others, and can <lb/> scarcely be comprehended by
                    myself.</p>
                <p>It will be readily supposed that I was somewhat inquisitive <lb/> as to the
                    person and demeanor of our visitant. After a <lb/> moment's pause, I stepped to
                    the door and looked after him. <lb/> Judge my surprise, when I beheld the self
                    same figure that <lb/> had appeared a half hour before upon the bank. My <lb/>
                    fancy had conjured up a very different image. A form, <lb/> and attitude, and
                    garb, were instantly created worthy to <reg orig="ac-|company">accompany</reg>
                    <lb/> such elocution; but this person was, in all visible <lb/> respects, the
                    reverse of this phantom. Strange as it may <lb/> seem, I could not speedily
                    reconcile myself to this <reg orig="disappoint-|ment">disappointment</reg>.
                    <lb/> Instead of returning to my employment, I threw <lb/> myself in a chair
                    that was placed opposite the door, and <lb/> sunk into a fit of musing.</p>
                <p>My attention was, in a few minutes, recalled by the <lb/>
                    <pb n="50" entity="eaf033v1_0091" pid="uva-lib:349121"/> stranger, who returned
                    with the empty cup in his hand. I <lb/> had not thought of the circumstance, or
                    should certainly have <lb/> chosen a different seat. He no sooner shewed
                    himself, <lb/> than a confused sense of impropriety, added to the <reg
                        orig="sudden-|ness">suddenness</reg>
                    <lb/> of the interview, for which, not having foreseen it, I <lb/> had made no
                    preparation, threw me into a state of the most <lb/> painful embarrassment. He
                    brought with him a placid <lb/> brow; but no sooner had he cast his eyes upon me
                    than his <lb/> face was as glowingly suffused as my own. He placed <lb/> the cup
                    upon the bench, stammered out thanks, and <lb/> retired.</p>
                <p>It was some time before I could recover my wonted <lb/> composure. I had snatched
                    a view of the stranger's <reg orig="coun-|tenance">countenance</reg>. <lb/> The
                    impression that it made was vivid and <reg orig="indeli-|ble">indelible</reg>.
                    <lb/> His cheeks were pallid and lank, his eyes sunken, his <lb/> forehead
                    overshadowed by coarse straggling hairs, his teeth <lb/> large and irregular,
                    though sound and brilliantly white, and <lb/> his chin discolored by a tetter.
                    His skin was of coarse <lb/> grain, and sallow hue. Every feature was wide of
                    beauty, <lb/> and the outline of his face reminded you of an inverted <lb/>
                    cone.</p>
                <p>And yet his forehead, so far as shaggy locks would allow <lb/> it to be seen, his
                    eyes lustrously black, and possessing, in <lb/> the midst of haggardness, a
                    radiance inexpressibly serene <lb/> and potent, and something in the rest of his
                    features, which <lb/> it would be in vain to describe, but which served to
                    betoken <lb/> a mind of the highest order, were essential ingredients in <lb/>
                    the portrait. This, in the effects which immediately flowed <lb/> from it, I
                    count among the most extraordinary incidents of my <lb/> life. This face, seen
                    for a moment, continued for hours to <lb/> occupy my fancy, to the exclusion of
                    almost every other <lb/> image. I had purposed to spend the evening with my
                    <lb/> brother, but I could not resist the inclination of forming a <lb/> sketch
                    upon paper of this memorable visage. Whether my <lb/> hand was aided by any
                    peculiar inspiration, or I was <reg orig="de-|ceived">deceived</reg>
                    <lb/> by my own fond conceptions, this portrait, though <lb/> hastily executed,
                    appeared unexceptionable to my own <lb/> taste.</p>
                <p>I placed it at all distances, and in all lights; my eyes <lb/> were riveted upon
                    it. Half the night passed away in <reg orig="wake-|fulness">wakefulness</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="51" entity="eaf033v1_0092" pid="uva-lib:349122"/> and in contemplation of
                    this picture. So flexible, <lb/> and yet so stubborn, is the human mind. So
                    obedient to <reg orig="im-|pulses">impulses</reg>
                    <lb/> the most transient and brief, and yet so unalterably <lb/> observant of
                    the direction which is given to it! How little <lb/> did I then foresee the
                    termination of that chain, of which <lb/> this may be regarded as the first
                    link?</p>
                <p>Next day arose in darkness and storm. Torents of rain <lb/> fell during the whole
                    day, attended with incessant thunder, <lb/> which reverberated in stunning
                    echoes from the opposite <lb/> declivity. The inclemency of the air would not
                    allow me <lb/> to walk out. I had, indeed, no inclination to leave my <lb/>
                    apartment. I betook myself to the contemplation of this <lb/> portrait, whose
                    attractions time had rather enhanced than <lb/> diminished. I laid aside my
                    usual occupations, and seating <lb/> myself at a window, consumed the day in
                    alternately looking <lb/> out upon the storm, and gazing at the picture which
                    lay upon <lb/> a table before me. You will, perhaps, deem this conduct <lb/>
                    somewhat singular, and ascribe it to certain peculiarities of <lb/> temper. I am
                    not aware of any such peculiarities. I can <lb/> account for my devotion to this
                    image no otherwise, than by <lb/> supposing that its properties were rare and
                    prodigious. <reg orig="Per-|haps">Perhaps</reg>
                    <lb/> you will suspect that such were the first inroads of a <lb/> passion
                    incident to every female heart, and which frequently <lb/> gains a footing by
                    means even more slight, and more <reg orig="impro-|bable">improbable</reg>
                    <lb/> than these. I shall not controvert the reasonableness <lb/> of the
                    suspicion, but leave you at liberty to draw, from my <lb/> narrative, what
                    conclusions you please.</p>
                <p>Night at length returned, and the storm ceased. The air <lb/> was once more clear
                    and calm, and bore an affecting <reg orig="con-|trast">contrast</reg>
                    <lb/> to that uproar of the elements by which it had been <reg orig="pre-|ceded"
                        >preceded</reg>. <lb/> I spent the darksome hours, as I spent the day, <lb/>
                    contemplative and seated at the window. Why was my <lb/> mind absorbed in
                    thoughts ominous and dreary? Why did <lb/> my bosom heave with sighs, and my
                    eyes overflow with <lb/> tears? Was the tempest that had just past a signal of
                    the <lb/> ruin which impended over me? My soul fondly dwelt <lb/> upon the
                    images of my brother and his children, yet they <lb/> only increased the
                    mournfulness of my contemplations. <lb/> The smiles of the charming babes were
                    as bland as formerly. <lb/> The same dignity sat on the brow of their father,
                    and yet I <lb/>
                    <pb n="52" entity="eaf033v1_0093" pid="uva-lib:349123"/> thought of them with
                    anguish. Something whispered that <lb/> the happiness we at present enjoyed was
                    set on mutable <lb/> foundations. Death must happen to all. Whether our <lb/>
                    felicity was to be subverted by it tomorrow, or whether it <lb/> was ordained
                    that we should lay down our heads full of <lb/> years and of honor, was a
                    question that no human being <lb/> could solve. At other times, these ideas
                    seldom intruded. <lb/> I either forbore to reflect upon the destiny that is
                    reserved <lb/> for all men, or the reflection was mixed up with images that
                    <lb/> disrobed it of terror; but now the uncertainty of life <reg
                        orig="occur-|red">occurred</reg>
                    <lb/> to me without any of its usual and alleviating <reg
                        orig="accompani-|ments">accompaniments</reg>. <lb/> I said to myself, we
                    must die. Sooner or later, <lb/> we must disappear for ever from the face of the
                    earth. <lb/> Whatever be the links that hold us to life, they must be <lb/>
                    broken. This scene of existence is, in all its parts, <reg orig="calami-|tous"
                        >calamitous</reg>. <lb/> The greater number is oppressed with immediate
                    <lb/> evils, and those, the tide of whose fortunes is full, how small <lb/> is
                    their portion of enjoyment, since they know that it will <lb/> terminate.</p>
                <p>For some time I indulged myself, without reluctance, in <lb/> these gloomy
                    thoughts; but at length, the dejection which <lb/> they produced became
                    insupportably painful. I endeavored <lb/> to dissipate it with music. I had all
                    my grandfather's <reg orig="melo-|dy">melody</reg>
                    <lb/> as well as poetry by rote. I now lighted by chance on <lb/> a ballad,
                    which commemorated the fate of a German <reg orig="Cava-|lier">Cavalier</reg>,
                    <lb/> who fell at the siege of Nice under Godfrey of Bouillon. <lb/> My choice
                    was unfortunate, for the scenes of violence and <lb/> carnage which were here
                    wildly but forcibly portrayed, only <lb/> suggested to my thoughts a new topic
                    in the horrors of war.</p>
                <p>I sought refuge, but ineffectually, in sleep. My mind <lb/> was thronged by
                    vivid, but confused images, and no effort <lb/> that I made was sufficient to
                    drive them away. In this <reg orig="situ-|ation">situation</reg>
                    <lb/> I heard the clock, which hung in the room, give the <lb/> signal for
                    twelve. It was the same instrument which <reg orig="for-|merly">formerly</reg>
                    <lb/> hung in my father's chamber, and which, on account <lb/> of its being his
                    workmanship, was regarded, by every one of <lb/> our family, with veneration. It
                    had fallen to me, in the <reg orig="divi-|sion">division</reg>
                    <lb/> of his property, and was placed in this asylum. The <lb/> sound awakened a
                    series of reflections respecting his death. <lb/> I was not allowed to pursue
                    them; for scarcely had the <lb/>
                    <pb n="53" entity="eaf033v1_0094" pid="uva-lib:349124"/> vibrations ceased, when
                    my attention was attracted by a <reg orig="whis-|per">whisper</reg>, <lb/>
                    which, at first, appeared to proceed from lips that were <lb/> laid close to my
                    ear.</p>
                <p>No wonder that a circumstance like this startled me. In <lb/> the first impulse
                    of my terror, I uttered a slight scream, and <lb/> shrunk to the opposite side
                    of the bed. In a moment, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/> I recovered
                    from my trepidation. I was habitually <reg orig="in-|different"
                        >indifferent</reg>
                    <lb/> to all the causes of fear, by which the majority are <lb/> afflicted. I
                    entertained no apprehension of either ghosts or <lb/> robbers. Our security had
                    never been molested by either, <lb/> and I made use of no means to prevent or
                    counterwork <lb/> their machinatioms. My tranquillity, on this occasion, was
                    <lb/> quickly retrieved. The whisper evidently proceeded from <lb/> one who was
                    posted at my bedside. The first idea that <lb/> suggested itself was, that it
                    was uttered by the girl who lived <lb/> with me as a servant. Perhaps, somewhat
                    had alarmed <lb/> her, or she was sick, and had come to request my assistance.
                    <lb/> By whispering in my ear, she intended to rouse without <lb/> alarming
                    me.</p>
                <p>Full of this persuasion, I called; "Judith," said I, "is it <lb/> you? What do
                    you want? Is there any thing the matter <lb/> with you?" No answer was returned.
                    I repeated my <reg orig="in-|quiry">inquiry</reg>, <lb/> but equally in vain.
                    Cloudy as was the atmosphere, <lb/> and curtained as my bed was, nothing was
                    visible. I <reg orig="with-|drew">withdrew</reg>
                    <lb/> the curtain, and leaning my head on my elbow, I <reg orig="listen-|ed"
                        >listened</reg>
                    <lb/> with the deepest attention to catch some new sound. <lb/> Meanwhile, I ran
                    over in my thoughts, every circumstance <lb/> that could assist my
                    conjectures.</p>
                <p>My habitation was a wooden edifice, consisting of two <lb/> stories. In each
                    story were two rooms, separated by an <lb/> entry, or middle passage, with which
                    they communicated by <lb/> opposite doors. The passage, on the lower story, had
                    doors <lb/> at the two ends, and a staircase. Windows answered to the <lb/>
                    doors on the upper story. Annexed to this, on the eastern <lb/> side, were
                    wings, divided, in like manner, into an upper and <lb/> lower room; one of them
                    comprised a kitchen, and chamber <lb/> above it for the servant, and
                    communicated, on both stories, <lb/> with the parlor adjoining it below, and the
                    chamber <reg orig="adjoin-|ing">adjoining</reg>
                    <lb/> it above. The opposite wing is of smaller dimensions, <lb/> the rooms not
                    being above eight feet square. The lower of <lb/>
                    <pb n="54" entity="eaf033v1_0095" pid="uva-lib:349125"/> these was used as a
                    depository of household implements, the <lb/> upper was a closet in which I
                    deposited my books and <lb/> papers. They had but one inlet, which was from the
                    <lb/> room adjoining. There was no window in the lower one, <lb/> and in the
                    upper, a small aperture which communicated <lb/> light and air, but would
                    scarcely admit the body. The door <lb/> which led into this, was close to my
                    bed-head, and was <lb/> always locked, but when I myself was within. The avenues
                    <lb/> below were accustomed to be closed and bolted at nights.</p>
                <p>The maid was my only companion, and she could not <lb/> reach my chamber without
                    previously passing through the <lb/> opposite chamber, and the middle passage,
                    of which, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/> the doors were usually
                    unfastened. If she had <reg orig="oc-|casioned">occasioned</reg>
                    <lb/> this noise, she would have answered my repeated <lb/> calls. No other
                    conclusion, therefore, was left me, but <lb/> that I had mistaken the sounds,
                    and that my imagination <lb/> had transformed some casual noise into the voice
                    of a <reg orig="hu-|man">human</reg>
                    <lb/> creature. Satisfied with this solution, I was <reg orig="prepar-|ing"
                        >preparing</reg>
                    <lb/> to relinquish my listening attitude, when my ear was <lb/> again saluted
                    with a new and yet louder whispering. It <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg>,
                    <lb/> as before, to issue from lips that touched my <reg orig="pil-|low"
                        >pillow</reg>. <lb/> A second effort of attention, however, clearly shewed
                    <lb/> me, that the sounds issued from within the closet, the door <lb/> of which
                    was not more than eight inches from my pillow.</p>
                <p>This second interruption occasioned a shock less <reg orig="vehe-|ment"
                        >vehement</reg>
                    <lb/> than the former. I started, but gave no audible token <lb/> of alarm. I
                    was so much mistress of my feelings, as to <lb/> continue listening to what
                    should be said. The whisper <lb/> was distinct, hoarse, and uttered so as to
                    shew that the <lb/> speaker was desirous of being heard by some one near, <lb/>
                    but, at the same time, studious to avoid being overheard <lb/> by any other.</p>
                <p>"Stop, stop, I say; madman as you are! there are <reg orig="bet-|ter"
                        >better</reg>
                    <lb/> means than that. Curse upon your rashness! There <lb/> is no need to
                    shoot."</p>
                <p>Such were the words uttered in a tone of eagerness and <lb/> anger, within so
                    small a distance of my pillow. What <reg orig="con-|struction"
                        >construction</reg>
                    <lb/> could I put upon them? My heart began to <reg orig="pal-|pitate"
                        >palpitate</reg>
                    <lb/> with dread of some unknown danger. Presently, <lb/> another voice, but
                    equally near me, was heard whispering <lb/>
                    <pb n="55" entity="eaf033v1_0096" pid="uva-lib:349126"/> in answer. "Why not? I
                    will draw a trigger in this <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg>, <lb/> but
                    perdition be my lot if I do more." To this, the <lb/> first voice returned, in a
                    tone which rage had heightened in <lb/> a small degree above a whisper, "Coward!
                    stand aside, <lb/> and see me do it. I will grasp her throat; I will do her
                    <lb/> business in an instant; she shall not have time so much as <lb/> to
                    groan." What wonder that I was petrified by sounds <lb/> so dreadful! Murderers
                    lurked in my closet. They were <lb/> planning the means of my destruction. One
                    resolved to <lb/> shoot, and the other menaced suffocation. Their means <lb/>
                    being chosen, they would forthwith break the door. Flight <lb/> instantly
                    suggested itself as most eligible in circumstances <lb/> so perilous. I
                    deliberated not a moment; but, fear adding <lb/> wings to my speed, I leaped out
                    of bed, and scantily robed <lb/> as I was, rushed out of the chamber, down
                    stairs, and into <lb/> the open air. I can hardly recollect the process of
                    turning <lb/> keys, and withdrawing bolts. My terrors urged me <reg
                        orig="for-|ward">forward</reg>
                    <lb/> with almost a mechanical impulse. I stopped not <lb/> till I reached my
                    brother's door. I had not gained the <lb/> threshold, when, exhausted by the
                    violence of my <reg orig="emo-|tions">emotions</reg>, <lb/> and by my speed, I
                    sunk down in a fit.</p>
                <p>How long I remained in this situation I know not. When <lb/> I recovered, I found
                    myself stretched on a bed, surrounded <lb/> by my sister and her female
                    servants. I was astonished at <lb/> the scene before me, but gradually recovered
                    the <reg orig="recollec-|tion">recollection</reg>
                    <lb/> of what had happened. I answered their importunate <lb/> inquiries as well
                    as I was able. My brother and Pleyel, <lb/> whom the storm of the preceding day
                    chanced to detain <lb/> here, informing themselves of every particular,
                    proceeded <lb/> with lights and weapons to my deserted habitation. They <lb/>
                    entered my chamber and my closet, and found every thing in <lb/> its proper
                    place and customary order. The door of the closet <lb/> was locked, and appeared
                    not to have been opened in my <lb/> absence. They went to Judith's apartment.
                    They found <lb/> her asleep and in safety. Pleyel's caution induced him to <lb/>
                    forbear alarming the girl; and finding her wholly ignorant <lb/> of what had
                    passed, they directed her to return to her <lb/> chamber. They then fastened the
                    doors, and returned.</p>
                <p>My friends were disposed to regard this transaction as a <lb/> dream. That
                    persons should be actually immured in this <lb/>
                    <pb n="56" entity="eaf033v1_0097" pid="uva-lib:349127"/> closet, to which, in
                    the circumstances of the time, access <lb/> from without or within was
                    apparently impossible, they <lb/> could not seriously believe. That any human
                    beings had <lb/> intended murder, unless it were to cover a scheme of <reg
                        orig="pil-|lage">pillage</reg>, <lb/> was incredible; but that no such
                    design had been <lb/> formed, was evident from the security in which the <reg
                        orig="furni-|ture">furniture</reg>
                    <lb/> of the house and the closet remained.</p>
                <p>I revolved every incident and expression that had <reg orig="occur-|red"
                        >occurred</reg>. <lb/> My senses assured me of the truth of them, and yet
                    <lb/> their abruptness and improbability made me, in my turn, <lb/> somewhat
                    incredulous. The adventure had made a deep <lb/> impression on my fancy, and it
                    was not till after a week's <lb/> abode at my brother's, that I resolved to
                    resume the <reg orig="pos-|session">possession</reg>
                    <lb/> of my own dwelling.</p>
                <p>There was another circumstance that enhanced the <reg orig="mys-|teriousness"
                        >mysteriousness</reg>
                    <lb/> of this event. After my recovery it was obvious <lb/> to inquire by what
                    means the attention of the family had been <lb/> drawn to my situation. I had
                    fallen before I had reached <lb/> the threshold, or was able to give any signal.
                    My brother <lb/> related, that while this was transacting in my chamber, he
                    <lb/> himself was awake, in consequence of some slight <reg
                        orig="indisposi-|tion">indisposition</reg>, <lb/> and lay, according to his
                    custom, musing on some <lb/> favorite topic. Suddenly the silence, which was
                        <reg orig="remarka-|bly">remarkably</reg>
                    <lb/> profound, was broken by a voice of most piercing <lb/> shrillness, that
                    seemed to be uttered by one in the hall <reg orig="be-|low">below</reg>
                    <lb/> his chamber. "Awake! arise!" it exclaimed, "<reg orig="has-|ten"
                        >hasten</reg>
                    <lb/> to succor one that is dying at your door."</p>
                <p>This summons was effectual. There was no one in the <lb/> house who was not
                    roused by it. Pleyel was the first to <lb/> obey, and my brother overtook him
                    before he reached the <lb/> hall. What was the general astonishment when your
                    friend <lb/> was discovered stretched upon the grass before the door, <lb/>
                    pale, ghastly, and with every mark of death!</p>
                <p>This was the third instance of a voice, exerted for the <lb/> benefit of this
                    little community. The agent was no less <reg orig="in-|scrutable"
                        >inscrutable</reg>
                    <lb/> in this, than in the former case. When I <reg orig="rumi-|nated"
                        >ruminated</reg>
                    <lb/> upon these events, my soul was suspended in <reg orig="won-|der"
                        >wonder</reg>
                    <lb/> and awe. Was I really deceived in imagining that I <lb/> heard the closet
                    conversation? I was no longer at liberty <lb/> to question the reality of those
                    accents which had formerly <lb/>
                    <pb n="57" entity="eaf033v1_0098" pid="uva-lib:349128">
                        <fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">8</fw>
                    </pb> recalled my brother from the hill; which had imparted <lb/> tidings of the
                    death of the German lady to Pleyel; and <lb/> which had lately summoned them to
                    my assistance.</p>
                <p>But how was I to regard this midnight conversation? <lb/> Hoarse and manlike
                    voices conferring on the means of <lb/> death, so near my bed, and at such an
                    hour! How had <lb/> my ancient security vanished! That dwelling, which had <lb/>
                    hitherto been an inviolate asylum, was now beset with <reg orig="dan-|ger"
                        >danger</reg>
                    <lb/> to my life. That solitude, formerly so dear to me, <lb/> could no longer
                    be endured. Pleyel, who had consented <lb/> to reside with us during the months
                    of spring, lodged in the <lb/> vacant chamber, in order to quiet my alarms. He
                    treated <lb/> my fears with ridicule, and in a short time very slight traces
                    <lb/> of them remained; but as it was wholly indifferent to him <lb/> whether
                    his nights were passed at my house or at my <reg orig="bro-|ther's"
                        >brother's</reg>, <lb/> this arrangement gave general satisfaction.</p>

                    <lb/> which these incidents occasioned. After all our <reg orig="ef-|forts"

                <p>In the midst of thoughts, excited by these events, I was <lb/> not unmindful of
                    my interview with the stranger. I related <lb/> the particulars, and shewed the
                    portrait to my friends. <lb/> Pleyel recollected to have met with a figure
                    resembling my <lb/> description in the city; but neither his face or garb made
                    <lb/> the same impression upon him that it made upon me. It <lb/> was a hint to
                    rally me upon my prepossessions, and to amuse <lb/> us with a thousand ludicrous
                    anecdotes which he had <reg orig="col-|lected">collected</reg>
                    <lb/> in his travels. He made no scruple to charge me <lb/> with being in love;
                    and threatened to inform the swain, <lb/> when he met him, of his good
                    fortune.</p>
                <p>Pleyel's temper made him susceptible of no durable <reg orig="im-|pressions"
                        >impressions</reg>. <lb/> His conversation was occasionally visited by <lb/>
                    <pb n="58" entity="eaf033v1_0099" pid="uva-lib:349129"/> gleams of his ancient
                    vivacity; but, though his impetuosity <lb/> was sometimes inconvenient, there
                    was nothing to dread <lb/> from his malice. I had no fear that my character or
                        <reg orig="dig-|nity">dignity</reg>
                    <lb/> would suffer in his hands, and was not heartily <reg orig="dis-|pleased"
                        >displeased</reg>
                    <lb/> when he declared his intention of profiting by his <lb/> first meeting
                    with the stranger, to introduce him to our <reg orig="ac-|quaintance"
                        >acquaintance</reg>.</p>
                <p>Some weeks after this I had spent a toilsome day, and as <lb/> the sun declined,
                    found myself disposed to seek relief in a <lb/> walk. The river bank is, at this
                    part of it, and for some <lb/> considerable space upward, so rugged and steep as
                    not to <lb/> be easily descended. In a recess of this declivity, near the <lb/>
                    southern verge of my little demesne, was placed a slight <lb/> building, with
                    seats and lattices. From a crevice of the <lb/> rock, to which this edifice was
                    attached, there burst forth <lb/> a stream of the purest water, which, leaping
                    from ledge to <lb/> ledge, for the space of sixty feet, produced a freshness in
                    <lb/> the air, and a murmur, the most delicious and soothing <lb/> imaginable.
                    These, added to the odors of the cedars <lb/> which embowered it, and of the
                    honey-suckle which <reg orig="clus-|tered">clustered</reg>
                    <lb/> among the lattices, rendered this my favorite retreat <lb/> in summer.</p>
                <p>On this occasion I repaired hither. My spirits drooped <lb/> through the fatigue
                    of long attention, and I threw myself upon <lb/> a bench, in a state, both
                    mentally and personally, of the <lb/> utmost supineness. The lulling sounds of
                    the waterfall, the <lb/> fragrance and the dusk combined to becalm my spirits,
                    and, <lb/> in a short time, to sink me into sleep. Either the <reg
                        orig="uneasi-|ness">uneasiness</reg>
                    <lb/> of my posture, or some slight indisposition molested my <lb/> repose with
                    dreams of no cheerful hue. After various <reg orig="inco-|herences"
                        >incoherences</reg>
                    <lb/> had taken their turn to occupy my fancy, I at <lb/> length imagined myself
                    walking, in the evening twilight, to <lb/> my brother's habitation. A pit,
                    methought, had been dug <lb/> in the path I had taken, of which I was not aware.
                    As I <lb/> carelessly pursued my walk, I thought I saw my brother, <lb/>
                    standing at some distance before me, beckoning and calling <lb/> me to make
                    haste. He stood on the opposite edge of the <lb/> gulf. I mended my pace, and
                    one step more would have <lb/> plunged me into this abyss, had not some one from
                    behind <lb/>
                    <pb n="59" entity="eaf033v1_0100" pid="uva-lib:349130"/> caught suddenly my arm,
                    and exclaimed, in a voice of <reg orig="ea-|gerness">eagerness</reg>
                    <lb/> and terror, "Hold! hold!"</p>
                <p>The sound broke my sleep, and I found myself, at the <lb/> next moment, standing
                    on my feet, and surrounded by the <lb/> deepest darkness. Images so terrific and
                    forcible disabled <lb/> me, for a time, from distinguishing between sleep and
                        <reg orig="wake-|fulness">wakefulness</reg>, <lb/> and withheld from me the
                    knowledge of my actual <lb/> condition. My first panic was succeeded by the <reg
                        orig="perturba-|tions">perturbations</reg>
                    <lb/> of surprise, to find myself alone in the open air, and <lb/> immersed in
                    so deep a gloom. I slowly recollected the <lb/> incidents of the afternoon, and
                    how I came hither. I could <lb/> not estimate the time, but saw the propriety of
                    returning <lb/> with speed to the house. My faculties were still too <reg
                        orig="con-|fused">confused</reg>, <lb/> and the darkness too intense, to
                    allow me <reg orig="immediate-|ly">immediately</reg>
                    <lb/> to find my way up the steep. I sat down, therefore, to <lb/> recover
                    myself, and to reflect upon my situation.</p>
                <p>This was no sooner done, than a low voice was heard <lb/> from behind the
                    lattice, on the side where I sat. Between <lb/> the rock and the lattice was a
                    chasm not wide enough to <lb/> admit a human body; yet in this chasm he that
                    spoke <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg>
                    <lb/> to be stationed. "Attend! attend! but be not <reg orig="ter-|rified"
                        >terrified</reg>."</p>
                <p>I started and exclaimed, "Good heavens! what is that? <lb/> Who are you?"</p>
                <p>"A friend; one come, not to injure, but to save you; <lb/> fear nothing."</p>
                <p>This voice was immediately recognised to be the same <lb/> with one of those
                    which I had heard in the closet; it was <lb/> the voice of him who had proposed
                    to shoot, rather than to <lb/> strangle, his victim. My terror made me, at once,
                    mute <lb/> and motionless. He continued, "I leagued to murder you. <lb/> I
                    repent. Mark my bidding, and be safe. Avoid this spot. <lb/> The snares of death
                    encompass it. Elsewhere danger will <lb/> be distant; but this spot, shun it as
                    you value your life. <lb/> Mark me further; profit by this warning, but divulge
                    it not. <lb/> If a syllable of what has passed escape you, your doom is <lb/>
                    sealed. Remember your father, and be faithful."</p>
                <p>Here the accents ceased, and left me overwhelmed with <lb/> dismay. I was fraught
                    with the persuasion, that during <lb/> every moment I remained here, my life was
                    endangered; <lb/>
                    <pb n="60" entity="eaf033v1_0101" pid="uva-lib:349131"/> but I could not take a
                    step without hazard of falling to the <lb/> bottom of the precipice. The path,
                    leading to the summit, <lb/> was short, but rugged and intricate. Even starlight
                    was <lb/> excluded by the umbrage, and not the faintest gleam was <lb/> afforded
                    to guide my steps. What should I do? To depart <lb/> or remain was equally and
                    eminently perilous.</p>
                <p>In this state of uncertainty, I perceived a ray flit across <lb/> the gloom and
                    disappear. Another succeeded, which was <lb/> stronger, and remained for a
                    passing moment. It glittered <lb/> on the shrubs that were scattered at the
                    entrance, and <lb/> gleam continued to succeed gleam for a few seconds, till
                    <lb/> they, finally, gave place to unintermitted darkness.</p>
                <p>The first visitings of this light called up a train of <reg orig="hor-|rors"
                        >horrors</reg>
                    <lb/> in my mind; destruction impended over this spot; the <lb/> voice which I
                    had lately heard had warned me to retire, <lb/> and had menaced me with the fate
                    of my father if I refused. <lb/> I was desirous, but unable to obey; these
                    gleams were such <lb/> as preluded the stroke by which he fell; the hour,
                    perhaps, <lb/> was the same&mdash;I shuddered as if I had beheld, suspended
                    <lb/> over me, the exterminating sword.</p>
                <p>Presently a new and stronger illumination burst through <lb/> the lattice on the
                    right hand, and a voice, from the edge of <lb/> the precipice above, called out
                    my name. It was Pleyel. <lb/> Joyfully did I recognise his accents; but such was
                    the <reg orig="tu-|mult">tumult</reg>
                    <lb/> of my thoughts that I had not power to answer him till <lb/> he had
                    frequently repeated his summons. I hurried, at <lb/> length, from the fatal
                    spot, and, directed by the lanthorn <lb/> which he bore, ascended the hill.</p>
                <p>Pale and breathless, it was with difficulty I could <reg orig="sup-|port"
                        >support</reg>
                    <lb/> myself. He anxiously inquired into the cause of my <lb/> affright, and the
                    motive of my unusual absence. He had <lb/> returned from my brother's at a late
                    hour, and was <reg orig="inform-|ed">informed</reg>
                    <lb/> by Judith, that I had walked out before sunset, and had <lb/> not yet
                    returned. This intelligence was somewhat <reg orig="alarm-|ing">alarming</reg>.
                    <lb/> He waited some time; but, my absence continuing, <lb/> he had set out in
                    search of me. He had explored the <lb/> neighborhood with the utmost care, but,
                    receiving no tidings <lb/> of me, he was preparing to acquaint my brother with
                    this <lb/> circumstance, when he recollected the summer-house on <lb/> the bank,
                    and conceived it possible that some accident had <lb/>
                    <pb n="61" entity="eaf033v1_0102" pid="uva-lib:349132">
                        <fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">8*</fw>
                    </pb> detained me there. He again inquired into the cause of <lb/> this
                    detention, and of that confusion and dismay which my <lb/> looks testified.</p>
                <p>I told him that I had strolled hither in the afternoon, that <lb/> sleep had
                    overtaken me as I sat, and that I had awakened a <lb/> few minutes before his
                    arrival. I could tell him no more. <lb/> In the present impetuosity of my
                    thoughts, I was almost <reg orig="dubi-|ous">dubious</reg>, <lb/> whether the
                    pit, into which my brother had endeavored <lb/> to entice me, and the voice that
                    talked through the lattice, <lb/> were not parts of the same dream. I
                    remembered, <reg orig="like-|wise">likewise</reg>, <lb/> the charge of secrecy,
                    and the penalty denounced, if <lb/> I should rashly divulge what I had heard.
                    For these <reg orig="rea-|sons">reasons</reg>, <lb/> I was silent on that
                    subject, and shutting myself in my <lb/> chamber, delivered myself up to
                    contemplation.</p>
                <p>What I have related will, no doubt, appear to you a fable. <lb/> You will believe
                    that calamity has subverted my reason, and <lb/> that I am amusing you with the
                    chimeras of my brain, <reg orig="in-|stead">instead</reg>
                    <lb/> of facts that have really happened. I shall not be <lb/> surprised or
                    offended, if these be your suspicions. I know <lb/> not, indeed, how you can
                    deny them admission. For, if to <lb/> me, the immediate witness, they were
                    fertile of perplexity <lb/> and doubt, how must they affect another to whom they
                    are <lb/> recommended only by my testimony? It was only by <reg
                        orig="subse-|quent">subsequent</reg>
                    <lb/> events, that I was fully and incontestibly assured of <lb/> the veracity
                    of my senses.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile what was I to think? I had been assured that <lb/> a design had been
                    formed against my life. The ruffians <lb/> had leagued to murder me. Whom had I
                    offended? Who <lb/> was there with whom I had ever maintained intercourse, <lb/>
                    who was capable of harboring such atrocious purposes?</p>
                <p>My temper was the reverse of cruel and imperious. My <lb/> heart was touched with
                    sympathy for the children of <reg orig="mis-|fortune">misfortune</reg>. <lb/>
                    But this sympathy was not a barren sentiment. <lb/> My purse, scanty as it was,
                    was ever open, and my hands <lb/> ever active, to relieve distress. Many were
                    the wretches <lb/> whom my personal exertions had extricated from want and <lb/>
                    disease, and who rewarded me with their gratitude. There <lb/> was no face which
                    lowered at my approach, and no lips <lb/> which uttered imprecations in my
                    hearing. On the <reg orig="contra-|ry">contrary</reg>, <lb/> there was none,
                    over whose fate I had exerted any <reg orig="in-|fluence">influence</reg>, <lb/>
                    <pb n="62" entity="eaf033v1_0103" pid="uva-lib:349133"/> or to whom I was known
                    by reputation, who did <lb/> not greet me with smiles, and dismiss me with
                    proofs of <lb/> veneration; yet did not my senses assure me that a plot was
                    <lb/> laid against my life?</p>
                <p>I am not destitute of courage. I have shewn myself <reg orig="de-|liberative"
                        >deliberative</reg>
                    <lb/> and calm in the midst of peril. I have hazarded <lb/> my own life, for the
                    preservation of another, but now was <lb/> I confused and panic struck. I have
                    not lived so as to fear <lb/> death, yet to perish by an unseen and secret
                    stroke, to be <lb/> mangled by the knife of an assassin, was a thought at which
                    <lb/> I shuddered; what had I done to deserve to be made the <lb/> victim of
                    malignant passions?</p>
                <p>But soft! was I not assured that my life was safe in all <lb/> places but one?
                    And why was the treason limited to take <lb/> effect in this spot? I was every
                    where equally defenceless. <lb/> My house and chamber were, at all times,
                    accessible. <lb/> Danger still impended over me; the bloody purpose was still
                    <lb/> entertained, but the hand that was to execute it, was <reg
                        orig="power-|less">powerless</reg>
                    <lb/> in all places but one!</p>
                <p>Here I had remained for the last four or five hours, <reg orig="with-|out"
                        >without</reg>
                    <lb/> the means of resistance or defence, yet I had not been <lb/> attacked. A
                    human being was at hand, who was conscious <lb/> of my presence, and warned me
                    hereafter to avoid this <reg orig="re-|treat">retreat</reg>. <lb/> His voice was
                    not absolutely new, but had I never <lb/> heard it but once before? But why did
                    he prohibit me from <lb/> relating this incident to others, and what species of
                    death <lb/> will be awarded if I disobey?</p>
                <p>He talked of my father. He intimated, that disclosure <lb/> would pull upon my
                    head, the same destruction. Was then <lb/> the death of my father, portentous
                    and inexplicable as it <lb/> was, the consequence of human machinations? It
                    should <lb/> seem, that this being is apprized of the true nature of this <lb/>
                    event, and is conscious of the means that led to it. Whether <lb/> it shall
                    likewise fall upon me, depends upon the observance <lb/> of silence. Was it the
                    infraction of a similar command, <lb/> that brought so horrible a penalty upon
                    my father?</p>
                <p>Such were the reflections that haunted me during the <lb/> night, and which
                    effectually deprived me of sleep. Next <lb/> morning, at breakfast, Pleyel
                    related an event which my <lb/> disappearance had hindered him from mentioning
                    the night <lb/>
                    <pb n="63" entity="eaf033v1_0104" pid="uva-lib:349134"/> before. Early the
                    preceding morning, his occasions called <lb/> him to the city; he had stepped
                    into a coffee-house to <lb/> while away an hour; here he had met a person whose
                        <reg orig="ap-|pearance">appearance</reg>
                    <lb/> instantly bespoke him to be the same whose hasty <lb/> visit I have
                    mentioned, and whose extraordinary visage and <lb/> tones had so powerfully
                    affected me. On an attentive <reg orig="sur-|vey">survey</reg>, <lb/> however,
                    he proved, likewise, to be one with whom my <lb/> friend had had some
                    intercourse in Europe. This <reg orig="author-|ized">authorized</reg>
                    <lb/> the liberty of accosting him, and after some <reg orig="conversa-|tion"
                        >conversation</reg>, <lb/> mindful, as Pleyel said, of the footing which
                    this <lb/> stranger had gained in my heart, he had ventured to invite <lb/> him
                    to Mettingen. The invitation had been cheerfully <reg orig="ac-|cepted"
                        >accepted</reg>, <lb/> and a visit promised on the afternoon of the next
                    <lb/> day.</p>
                <p>This information excited no sober emotions in my breast. <lb/> I was, of course,
                    eager to be informed as to the circumstances <lb/> of their ancient intercourse.
                    When, and where had they <lb/> met? What knew he of the life and character of
                    this <lb/> man?</p>
                <p>In answer to my inquiries, he informed me that, three <lb/> years before, he was
                    a traveller in Spain. He had made <lb/> an excursion from Valencia to Murviedro,
                    with a view to <lb/> inspect the remains of Roman magnificence, scattered in
                    <lb/> the environs of that town. While traversing the scite of the <lb/> theatre
                    of old Saguntum, he alighted upon this man, seated <lb/> on a stone, and deeply
                    engaged in perusing the work of the <lb/> deacon Marti. A short conversation
                    ensued, which proved <lb/> the stranger to be English. They returned to Valencia
                        <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg>.</p>
                <p>His garb, aspect, and deportment, were wholly Spanish. <lb/> A residence of three
                    years in the country, indefatigable <reg orig="at-|tention">attention</reg>
                    <lb/> to the language, and a studious conformity with the <lb/> customs of the
                    people, had made him indistinguishable from <lb/> a native, when he chose to
                    assume that character. Pleyel <lb/> found him to be connected, on the footing of
                    friendship and <lb/> respect, with many eminent merchants in that city. He <lb/>
                    had embraced the catholic religion, and adopted a Spanish <lb/> name instead of
                    his own, which was <hi rend="small-caps">Carwin,</hi> and devoted <lb/> himself
                    to the literature and religion of his new country. <lb/>
                    <pb n="64" entity="eaf033v1_0105" pid="uva-lib:349135"/> He pursued no
                    profession, but subsisted on remittances from <lb/> England.</p>
                <p>While Pleyel remained in Valencia, Carwin betrayed no <lb/> aversion to
                    intercourse, and the former found no small <reg orig="at-|tractions"
                        >attractions</reg>
                    <lb/> in the society of this new acquaintance. On <reg orig="gene-|ral"
                        >general</reg>
                    <lb/> topics he was highly intelligent and communicative. He <lb/> had visited
                    every corner of Spain, and could furnish the <lb/> most accurate details
                    respecting its ancient and present <lb/> state. On topics of religion and of his
                    own history, previous <lb/> to his <hi rend="italic">transformation</hi> into a
                    Spaniard, he was invariably <lb/> silent. You could merely gather from his
                    discourse that he <lb/> was English, and that he was well acquainted with the

                <p>His character excited considerable curiosity in the <reg orig="ob-|server"
                        >observer</reg>. <lb/> It was not easy to reconcile his conversion to the
                    <lb/> Romish faith, with those proofs of knowledge and capacity <lb/> that were
                    exhibited by him on different occasions. A <reg orig="sus-|picion"
                        >suspicion</reg>
                    <lb/> was, sometimes, admitted, that his belief was <reg orig="coun-|terfeited"
                        >counterfeited</reg>
                    <lb/> for some political purpose. The most careful <reg orig="ob-|servation"
                        >observation</reg>, <lb/> however, produced no discovery. His manners <lb/>
                    were, at all times, harmless and inartificial, and his habits <lb/> those of a
                    lover of contemplation and seclusion. He <reg orig="appear-|ed">appeared</reg>
                    <lb/> to have contracted an affection for Pleyel, who was not <lb/> slow to
                    return it.</p>
                <p>My friend, after a month's residence in this city, <reg orig="return-|ed"
                        >returned</reg>
                    <lb/> into France, and, since that period, had heard nothing <lb/> concerning
                    Carwin, till his appearance at Mettingen.</p>
                <p>On this occasion Carwin had received Pleyel's greeting <lb/> with a certain
                    distance and solemnity to which the latter <lb/> had not been accustomed. He had
                    waved noticing the <reg orig="in-|quiries">inquiries</reg>
                    <lb/> of Pleyel respecting his desertion of Spain, in which <lb/> he had
                    formerly declared that it was his purpose to spend his <lb/> life. He had
                    assiduously diverted the attention of the latter to <lb/> indifferent topics,
                    but was still, on every theme, as eloquent <lb/> and judicious as formerly. Why
                    he had assumed the garb <lb/> of a rustic, Pleyel was unable to conjecture.
                    Perhaps it <lb/> might be poverty, perhaps he was swayed by motives which <lb/>
                    it was his interest to conceal, but which were connected <lb/> with consequences
                    of the utmost moment.</p>
                <pb n="65" entity="eaf033v1_0106" pid="uva-lib:349136"/>
                <p>Such was the sum of my friend's information. I was not <lb/> sorry to be left
                    alone during the greater part of this day. <lb/> Every employment was irksome
                    which did not leave me at <lb/> liberty to meditate. I had now a new subject on
                    which to <lb/> exercise my thoughts. Before evening I should be <reg
                        orig="usher-|ed">ushered</reg>
                    <lb/> into his presence, and listen to those tones whose <reg orig="magi-|cal"
                        >magical</reg>
                    <lb/> and thrilling power I had already experienced. But <lb/> with what new
                    images would he then be accompanied?</p>
                <p>Carwin was an adherent to the Romish faith, yet was an <lb/> Englishman by birth,
                    and, perhaps, a protestant by education. <lb/> He had adopted Spain for his
                    country, and had intimated <lb/> a design to spend his days there, yet now was
                    an inhabitant <lb/> of this district, and disguised by the habiliments of a
                    clown! <lb/> What could have obliterated the impressions of his youth, <lb/> and
                    made him abjure his religion and his country? What <lb/> subsequent events had
                    introduced so total a change in his <lb/> plans? In withdrawing from Spain, had
                    he reverted to the <lb/> religion of his ancestors; or was it true, that his
                    former <lb/> conversion was deceitful, and that his conduct had been <lb/>
                    swayed by motives which it was prudent to conceal?</p>
                <p>Hours were consumed in revolving these ideas. My <lb/> meditations were intense;
                    and, when the series was broken, <lb/> I began to reflect with astonishment on
                    my situation. From <lb/> the death of my parents, till the commencement of this
                    <lb/> year, my life had been serene and blissful, beyond the <reg
                        orig="or-|dinary">ordinary</reg>
                    <lb/> portion of humanity; but, now, my bosom was <reg orig="cor-|roded"
                        >corroded</reg>
                    <lb/> by anxiety. I was visited by dread of unknown <lb/> dangers, and the
                    future was a scene over which clouds <lb/> rolled, and thunders muttered. I
                    compared the cause with <lb/> the effect, and they seemed disproportioned to
                    each other. <lb/> All unaware, and in a manner which I had no power to <lb/>
                    explain, I was pushed from my immoveable and lofty station, <lb/> and cast upon
                    a sea of troubles.</p>
                <p>I determined to be my brother's visitant on this evening, <lb/> yet my resolves
                    were not unattended with wavering and <lb/> reluctance. Pleyel's insinuations
                    that I was in love, affected <lb/> in no degree my belief, yet the consciousness
                    that this was <lb/> the opinion of one, who would, probably, be present at our
                    <lb/> introduction to each other, would excite all that confusion <lb/> which
                    the passion itself is apt to produce. This would <lb/>
                    <pb n="66" entity="eaf033v1_0107" pid="uva-lib:349137"/> confirm him in his
                    error, and call forth new railleries. His <lb/> mirth, when exerted upon this
                    topic, was the source of the <lb/> bitterest vexation. Had he been aware of its
                    influence <lb/> upon my happiness, his temper would not have allowed him <lb/>
                    to persist; but this influence, it was my chief endeavor to <lb/> conceal. That
                    the belief of my having bestowed my heart <lb/> upon another, produced in my
                    friend none but ludicrous <lb/> sensations, was the true cause of my distress;
                    but if this <lb/> had been discovered by him, my distress would have been <lb/>
                    unspeakably aggravated.</p>

                        orig="Car-|win">Carwin</reg>
                    <lb/> made one of the company into which I was ushered. <lb/> Appearances were
                    the same as when I before beheld him. <lb/> His garb was equally negligent and
                    rustic. I gazed upon <lb/> his countenance with new curiosity. My situation was
                    such <lb/> as to enable me to bestow upon it a deliberate examination. <lb/>
                    Viewed at more leisure, it lost none of its wonderful <reg orig="proper-|ties"
                        >properties</reg>. <lb/> I could not deny my homage to the intelligence
                    <lb/> expressed in it, but was wholly uncertain, whether he were <lb/> an object
                    to be dreaded or adored, and whether his powers <lb/> had been exerted to evil
                    or to good.</p>
                <p>He was sparing in discourse; but whatever he said was <lb/> pregnant with
                    meaning, and uttered with rectitude of <reg orig="articu-|lation"
                        >articulation</reg>, <lb/> and force of emphasis, of which I had entertained
                    <lb/> no conception previously to my knowledge of him. <reg

                    <lb/> the uncouthness of his garb, his manners were <lb/> not unpolished. All
                    topics were handled by him with skill, <lb/> and without pedantry or
                    affectation. He uttered no <reg orig="senti-|ment">sentiment</reg>
                    <lb/> calculated to produce a disadvantageous impression; <lb/> on the contrary,
                    his observations denoted a mind alive to <lb/> every generous and heroic
                    feeling. They were introduced <lb/> without parade, and accompanied with that
                    degree of <reg orig="ear-|nestness">earnestness</reg>
                    <lb/> which indicates sincerity.</p>

                <p>He parted from us not till late, refusing an invitation to <lb/> spend the night
                    here, but readily consented to repeat his <lb/> visit. His visits were
                    frequently repeated. Each day <reg orig="in-|troduced">introduced</reg>
                    <lb/> us to a more intimate acquaintance with his <reg orig="senti-|ments"
                        >sentiments</reg>, <lb/> but left us wholly in the dark concerning that
                    about <lb/> which we were most inquisitive. He studiously avoided all <lb/>
                    mention of his past or present situation. Even the place <lb/> of his abode in
                    the city he concealed from us.</p>
                <p>Our sphere, in this respect, being somewhat limited, and <lb/> the intellectual
                    endowments of this man being indisputably <lb/> great, his deportment was more
                    diligently marked, and <lb/> copiously commented on by us, than you, perhaps,
                    will <lb/> think the circumstances warranted. Not a gesture, or <lb/> glance, or
                    accent, that was not, in our private assemblies, <lb/> discussed, and inferences
                    deduced from it. It may well <lb/> be thought that be modelled his behavior by
                    an uncommon <lb/> standard, when, with all our opportunities and accuracy of
                    <lb/> observation, we were able, for a long time, to gather no <reg
                        orig="sat-|isfactory">satisfactory</reg>
                    <lb/> information. He afforded us no ground on which <lb/> to build even a
                    plausible conjecture.</p>
                <p>There is a degree of familiarity which takes place <reg orig="be-|tween"
                        >between</reg>
                    <lb/> constant associates, that justifies the negligence of <lb/> many rules, of
                    which, in an earlier period of their <reg orig="inter-|course"
                    >intercourse</reg>, <lb/> politeness requires the exact observance. Inquiries
                    <lb/> into our condition are allowable when they are prompted by <lb/> a
                    disinterested concern for our welfare; and this solicitude <lb/> is not only
                    pardonable, but may justly be demanded from <lb/> those who choose us for their
                    companions. This state of <lb/> things was more slow to arrive at on this
                    occasion than on <lb/> most others, on account of the gravity and loftiness of
                    this <lb/> man's behavior.</p>
                <p>Pleyel, however, began at length to employ regular <lb/> means for this end. He
                    occasionally alluded to the <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg>
                    <lb/> in which they had formerly met, and remarked the <lb/> incongruousness
                    between the religion and habits of a <reg orig="Span-|iard">Spaniard</reg>,
                    <lb/> with those of a native of Britain. He expressed his <lb/> astonishment at
                    meeting our guest in this corner of the <lb/> globe, especially as, when they
                    parted in Spain, he was <lb/> taught to believe that Carwin should never leave
                    that <reg orig="coun-|try">country</reg>. <lb/>
                    <pb n="68" entity="eaf033v1_0109" pid="uva-lib:349139"/> He insinuated, that a
                    change so great must have been <lb/> prompted by motives of a singular and
                    momentous kind.</p>
                <p>No answer, or an answer wide of the purpose, was <reg orig="gene-|rally"
                        >generally</reg>
                    <lb/> made to these insinuations. Britons and Spaniards, he <lb/> said, are
                    votaries of the same Deity, and square their faith <lb/> by the same precepts;
                    their ideas are drawn from the same <lb/> fountains of literature, and they
                    speak dialects of the same <lb/> tongue; their government and laws have more
                    resemblances <lb/> than differences; they were formerly provinces of the same
                    <lb/> civil, and till lately, of the same religious empire.</p>
                <p>As to the motives which induce men to change the place <lb/> of their abode,
                    these must unavoidably be fleeting and <reg orig="muta-|ble">mutable</reg>.
                    <lb/> If not bound to one spot by conjugal or parental ties, <lb/> or by the
                    nature of that employment to which we are <reg orig="in-|debted">indebted</reg>
                    <lb/> for subsistence, the inducements to change are far <lb/> more numerous and
                    powerful, than opposite inducements.</p>
                <p>He spoke as if desirous of shewing that he was not <lb/> aware of the tendency of
                    Pleyel's remarks; yet, certain <lb/> tokens were apparent, that proved him by no
                    means <reg orig="want-|ing">wanting</reg>
                    <lb/> in penetration. These tokens were to be read in his <lb/> countenance, and
                    not in his words. When any thing was <lb/> said, indicating curiosity in us, the
                    gloom of his countenance <lb/> was deepened, his eyes sunk to the ground, and
                    his wonted <lb/> air was not resumed without visible struggle. Hence, it <lb/>
                    was obvious to infer, that some incidents of his life were <lb/> reflected on by
                    him with regret; and that, since these <reg orig="inci-|dents">incidents</reg>
                    <lb/> were carefully concealed, and even that regret which <lb/> flowed from
                    them laboriously stifled, they had not been <lb/> merely disastrous. The secrecy
                    that was observed appeared <lb/> not designed to provoke or baffle the
                    inquisitive, but was <lb/> prompted by the shame, or by the prudence of
                    guilt.</p>
                <p>These ideas, which were adopted by Pleyel and my <lb/> brother, as well as
                    myself, hindered us from employing <lb/> more direct means for accomplishing our
                    wishes. <reg orig="Ques-|tions">Questions</reg>
                    <lb/> might have been put in such terms, that no room <lb/> should be left for
                    the pretence of misapprehension, and if <lb/> modesty merely had been the
                    obstacle, such questions <lb/> would not have been wanting; but we considered,
                    that, if <lb/> the disclosure were productive of pain or disgrace, it was <lb/>
                    inhuman to extort it.</p>

                <p>Amidst the various topics that were discussed in his <reg orig="pre-|sence"
                        >presence</reg>, <lb/> allusions were, of course, made to the inexplicable
                    <lb/> events that had lately happened. At those times, the <lb/> words and looks
                    of this man were objects of my particular <lb/> attention. The subject was
                    extraordinary; and any one <lb/> whose experience or reflections could throw any
                    light upon <lb/> it, was entitled to my gratitude. As this man was <reg
                        orig="enlight-|ened">enlightened</reg>
                    <lb/> by reading and travel, I listened with eagerness to <lb/> the remarks
                    which he should make.</p>
                <p>At first, I entertained a kind of apprehension, that the <lb/> tale would be
                    heard by him with incredulity and secret <lb/> ridicule. I had formerly heard
                    stories that resembled this <lb/> in some of their mysterious circumstances, but
                    they were, <lb/> commonly, heard by me with contempt. I was doubtful, <lb/>
                    whether the same impression would not now be made on <lb/> the mind of our
                    guest; but I was mistaken in my fears.</p>
                <p>He heard them with seriousness, and without any marks <lb/> either of surprise or
                    incredulity. He pursued, with visible <lb/> pleasure, that kind of disquisition
                    which was naturally <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg>
                    <lb/> by them. His fancy was eminently vigorous and <lb/> prolific, and if he
                    did not persuade us, that human beings <lb/> are, sometimes, admitted to a
                    sensible intercourse with the <lb/> author of nature, he, at least, won over our
                    inclination to <lb/> the cause. He merely deduced, from his own reasonings,
                    <lb/> that such intercourse was probable; but confessed that, <lb/> though he
                    was acquainted with many instances somewhat <lb/> similar to those which had
                    been related by us, none of them <lb/> were perfectly exempted from the
                    suspicion of human <lb/> agency.</p>
                <p>On being requested to relate these instances, he amused <lb/> us with many
                    curious details. His narratives were <reg orig="con-|structed">constructed</reg>
                    <lb/> with so much skill, and rehearsed with so much <lb/> energy, that all the
                    effects of a dramatic exhibition were <lb/> frequently produced by them. Those
                    that were most <reg orig="co-|herent">coherent</reg>
                    <lb/> and most minute, and, of consequence, least entitled <lb/> to credit, were
                    yet rendered probable by the exquisite art <lb/> of this rhetorician. For every
                    difficulty that was suggested, <lb/> a ready and plausible solution was
                    furnished. Mysterious <lb/> voices had always a share in producing the
                    catastrophe, but <lb/> they were always to be explained on some known <reg
                        orig="princi-|ples">principles</reg>, <lb/>
                    <pb n="70" entity="eaf033v1_0111" pid="uva-lib:349141"/> either as reflected
                    into a focus, or communicated <lb/> through a tube. I could not but remark that
                    his narratives, <lb/> however complex or marvellous, contained no instance <reg
                        orig="suf-|ficiently">sufficiently</reg>
                    <lb/> parallel to those that had befallen ourselves, and <lb/> in which the
                    solution was applicable to our own case.</p>
                <p>My brother was a much more sanguine reasoner than our <lb/> guest. Even in some
                    of the facts which were related by <lb/> Carwin, he maintained the probability
                    of celestial <reg orig="interfe-|rence">interference</reg>, <lb/> when the
                    latter was disposed to deny it, and had <lb/> found, as he imagined, footsteps
                    of a human agent. <lb/> Pleyel was by no means equally credulous. He scrupled
                    <lb/> not to deny faith to any testimony but that of his senses, <lb/> and
                    allowed the facts which had lately been supported by <lb/> this testimony, not
                    to mould his belief, but merely to give <lb/> birth to doubts.</p>
                <p>It was soon observed that Carwin adopted, in some <reg orig="de-|gree"
                        >degree</reg>, <lb/> a similar distinction. A tale of this kind, related by
                    <lb/> others, he would believe, provided it was explicable upon <lb/> known
                    principles; but that such notices were actually <reg orig="com-|municated"
                        >communicated</reg>
                    <lb/> by beings of a higher order, he would believe <lb/> only when his own ears
                    were assailed in a manner which <lb/> could not be otherwise accounted for.
                    Civility forbade him <lb/> to contradict my brother or myself, but his
                    understanding <lb/> refused to acquiesce in our testimony. Besides, he was <lb/>
                    disposed to question whether the voices heard in the <reg orig="tem-|ple"
                        >temple</reg>, <lb/> at the foot of the hill, and in my closet, were not
                    <lb/> really uttered by human organs. On this supposition he <lb/> was desired
                    to explain how the effect was produced.</p>
                <p>He answered that the power of mimickry was very <reg orig="com-|mon"
                    >common</reg>. <lb/> Catharine's voice might easily be imitated by one at <lb/>
                    the foot of the hill, who would find no difficulty in eluding, <lb/> by flight,
                    the search of Wieland. The tidings of the death <lb/> of the Saxon lady were
                    uttered by one near at hand, who <lb/> overheard the conversation, who
                    conjectured her death, <lb/> and whose conjecture happened to accord with the
                    truth. <lb/> That the voice appeared to come from the ceiling was to be <lb/>
                    considered as an illusion of the fancy. The cry for help, <lb/> heard in the
                    hall on the night of my adventure, was to be <lb/> ascribed to a human creature,
                    who actually stood in the <lb/> hall when he uttered it. It was of no moment, he
                    said, <lb/>
                    <pb n="71" entity="eaf033v1_0112" pid="uva-lib:349142"/> that we could not
                    explain by what motives he that made the <lb/> signal was led hither. How
                    imperfectly acquainted were <lb/> we with the condition and designs of the
                    beings that <reg orig="sur-|rounded">surrounded</reg>
                    <lb/> us? The city was near at hand, and thousands <lb/> might there exist whose
                    powers and purposes might easily <lb/> explain whatever was mysterious in this
                    transaction. As <lb/> to the closet dialogue, he was obliged to adopt one of two
                    <lb/> suppositions, and affirm either that it was fashioned in my <lb/> own
                    fancy, or that it actually took place between two <reg orig="per-|sons"
                        >persons</reg>
                    <lb/> in the closet.</p>
                <p>Such was Carwin's mode of explaining these <reg orig="appear-|ances"
                        >appearances</reg>. <lb/> It is such, perhaps, as would commend itself as
                    <lb/> most plausible to the most sagacious minds, but it was <reg
                        orig="in-|sufficient">insufficient</reg>
                    <lb/> to impart conviction to us. As to the treason that <lb/> was meditated
                    against me, it was doubtless just to conclude <lb/> that it was either real or
                    imaginary; but that it was real was <lb/> attested by the mysterious warning in
                    the summer house, <lb/> the secret of which I had hitherto locked up in my own
                    <lb/> breast.</p>
                <p>A month passed away in this kind of intercourse. As <lb/> to Carwin, our
                    ignorance was in no degree enlightened <reg orig="re-|specting">respecting</reg>
                    <lb/> his genuine character and views. Appearances <lb/> were uniform. No man
                    possessed a larger store of <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>, <lb/> or a
                    greater degree of skill in the communication of <lb/> it to others; hence he was
                    regarded as an inestimable <reg orig="ad-|dition">addition</reg>
                    <lb/> to our society. Considering the distance of my <reg orig="bro-|ther's"
                        >brother's</reg>
                    <lb/> house from the city, he was frequently prevailed upon <lb/> to pass the
                    night where he spent the evening. Two days <lb/> seldom elapsed without a visit
                    from him; hence he was <reg orig="re-|garged">regarged</reg>
                    <lb/> as a kind of inmate of the house. He entered and <lb/> departed without
                    ceremony. When he arrived he received <lb/> an unaffected welcome, and when he
                    choose to retire, no <lb/> importunities were used to induce him to remain.</p>
                <p>The temple was the principal scene of our social <reg orig="enjoy-|ments"
                        >enjoyments</reg>; <lb/> yet the felicity that we tasted when assembled in
                    <lb/> this asylum, was but the gleam of a former sunshine. <reg orig="Car-|win"
                        >Carwin</reg>
                    <lb/> never parted with his gravity. The inscrutableness of <lb/> his character,
                    and the uncertainty whether his fellowship <lb/> tended to good or to evil, were
                    seldom absent from our <lb/>
                    <pb n="72" entity="eaf033v1_0113" pid="uva-lib:349143"/> minds. This
                    circumstance powerfully contributed to <reg orig="sad-|den">sadden</reg>
                    <lb/> us.</p>
                <p>My heart was the seat of growing disquietudes. This <lb/> change in one who had
                    formerly been characterized by all <lb/> the exuberances of soul, could not fail
                    to be remarked by <lb/> my friends. My brother was always a pattern of
                    solemnity. <lb/> My sister was clay, moulded by the circumstances in which <lb/>
                    she happened to be placed. There was but one whose <reg orig="de-|portment"
                        >deportment</reg>
                    <lb/> remains to be described as being of importance <lb/> to our happiness. Had
                    Pleyel likewise dismissed his <reg orig="viva-|city">vivacity</reg>?</p>
                <p>He was as whimsical and jestful as ever, but he was not <lb/> happy. The truth,
                    in this respect, was of too much <reg orig="im-|portance">importance</reg>
                    <lb/> to me not to make me a vigilant observer. His <lb/> mirth was easily
                    perceived to be the fruit of exertion. <lb/> When his thoughts wandered from the
                    company, an air of <lb/> dissatisfaction and impatience stole across his
                    features. <lb/> Even the punctuality and frequency of his visits were <reg
                        orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg>
                    <lb/> lessened. It may be supposed that my own <reg orig="uneasi-|ness"
                        >uneasiness</reg>
                    <lb/> was heightened by these tokens; but, strange as it may <lb/> seem, I
                    found, in the present state of my mind, no relief <lb/> but in the persuasion
                    that Pleyel was unhappy.</p>
                <p>That unhappiness, indeed, depended, for its value in my <lb/> eyes, on the cause
                    that produced it. It did not arise from <lb/> the death of the Saxon lady; it
                    was not a contagious <reg orig="ema-|nation">emanation</reg>
                    <lb/> from the countenances of Wieland or Carwin. There <lb/> was but one other
                    source whence it could flow. A <reg orig="name-|less">nameless</reg>
                    <lb/> ecstacy thrilled through my frame when any new proof <lb/> occurred that
                    the ambiguousness of my behavior was the <lb/> cause.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">My</hi> brother had received a new book from Germany. <lb/>
                    It was a tragedy, and the first attempt of a Saxon poet, <lb/> of whom my
                    brother had been taught to entertain the <reg orig="high-|est">highest</reg>
                    <lb/> expectations. The exploits of Zisca, the Bohemian <lb/> hero, were woven
                    into a dramatic series and connexion. <lb/>
                    <pb n="73" entity="eaf033v1_0114" pid="uva-lib:349144">
                        <fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">9*</fw>
                    </pb> According to German custom, it was minute and diffuse, <lb/> and dictated
                    by an adventurous and lawless fancy. It was <lb/> a chain of audacious acts, and
                    unheard of disasters. The <lb/> moated fortress, and the thicket; the ambush and
                    the battle; <lb/> and the conflict of headlong passions, were portrayed in <lb/>
                    wild numbers, and with terrific energy. An afternoon was <lb/> set apart to
                    rehearse this peformance. The language was <lb/> familiar to all of us but
                    Carwin, whose company, therefore, <lb/> was tacitly dispensed with.</p>
                <p>The morning previous to this intended rehearsal, I spent <lb/> at home. My mind
                    was occupied with reflections relative <lb/> to my own situation. The sentiment
                    which lived with chief <lb/> energy in my heart, was connected with the image of
                    <lb/> Pleyel. In the midst of my auguish, I had not been <reg orig="desti-|tute"
                        >destitute</reg>
                    <lb/> of consolation. His late deportment had given spring <lb/> to my hopes.
                    Was not the hour at hand, which should <lb/> render me the happiest of human
                    creatures? He suspected <lb/> that I looked with favorable eyes upon Carwin.
                    Hence <lb/> arose disquietudes, which he struggled in vain to conceal. <lb/> He
                    loved me, but was hopeless that his love would be <reg orig="com-|pensated"
                        >compensated</reg>. <lb/> Is it not time, said I, to rectify this error? But
                    <lb/> by what means is this to be effected? It can only he done <lb/> by a
                    change of deportment in me; but how must I demean <lb/> myself for this
                    purpose?</p>
                <p>I must not speak. Neither eyes, nor lips, must impart <lb/> the information. He
                    must not be assured that my heart is <lb/> his, previous to the tender of his
                    own; but he must be <reg orig="con-|vinced">convinced</reg>
                    <lb/> that it has not been given to another; he must be <lb/> supplied with
                    space whereon to build a doubt as to the true <lb/> state of my affections; he
                    must be prompted to avow <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>. <lb/> The line of
                    delicate propriety; how hard it is, not to <lb/> fall short, and not to overleap
                    it!</p>
                <p>This afternoon we shall meet at the temple. We shall <lb/> not separate till
                    late. It will be his province to accompany <lb/> me home. The airy expanse is
                    without a speck. This <lb/> breeze is usually steadfast, and its promise of a
                    bland and <lb/> cloudless evening, may be trusted. The moon will rise at <lb/>
                    eleven, and at that hour, we shall wind along this bank. <reg orig="Pos-|sibly"
                        >Possibly</reg>
                    <lb/> that hour may decide my fate. If suitable <reg orig="encourage-|ment"
                        >encouragement</reg>
                    <lb/> be given, Pleyel will reveal his soul to me; and I, <lb/>
                    <pb n="74" entity="eaf033v1_0115" pid="uva-lib:349145"/> ere I reach this
                    threshold, will be made the happiest of <lb/> beings.</p>
                <p>And is this good to be mine? Add wings to thy speed, <lb/> sweet evening; and
                    thou, moon, I charge thee, shroud thy <lb/> beams at the moment when my Pleyel
                    whispers love. I <lb/> would not for the world, that the burning blushes, and
                    the <lb/> mounting raptures of that moment, should be visible.</p>
                <p>But what encouragement is wanting? I must be <reg orig="regard-|ful"
                        >regardful</reg>
                    <lb/> of insurmountable limits. Yet when minds are imbued <lb/> with a genuine
                    sympathy, are not words and looks <reg orig="super-|fluous">superfluous</reg>?
                    <lb/> Are not motion and touch sufficient to impart <lb/> feelings such as mine?
                    Has he not eyed me at moments, <lb/> when the pressure of his hand has thrown me
                    into tumults, <lb/> and was it possible that he mistook the impetuosities of
                    love, <lb/> for the eloquence of indignation?</p>
                <p>But the hastening evening will decide. Would it were <lb/> come! And yet I
                    shudder at its near approach. An <reg orig="inter-|view">interview</reg>
                    <lb/> that must thus terminate, is surely to be wished for by <lb/> me; and yet
                    it is not without its terrors. Would to heaven <lb/> it were come and gone!</p>
                <p>I feel no reluctance, my friends, to be thus explicit. <lb/> Time was, when these
                    emotions would be hidden with <reg orig="im-|measurable">immeasurable</reg>
                    <lb/> solicitude from every human eye. Alas! these <lb/> airy and fleeting
                    impulses of shame are gone. My scruples <lb/> were preposterous and criminal.
                    They are bred in all <lb/> hearts, by a perverse and vicious education, and they
                    would <lb/> still have maintained their place in my heart, had not my <lb/>
                    portion been set in misery. My errors have taught me <lb/> thus much wisdom;
                    that those sentiments which we ought <lb/> not to disclose, it is criminal to
                    harbor.</p>
                <p>It was proposed to begin the rehearsal at four o'clock; I <lb/> counted the
                    minutes as they passed; their flight was at <lb/> once too rapid and too slow;
                    my sensations were of an <reg orig="ex-|cruciating">excruciating</reg>
                    <lb/> kind; I could taste no food, nor apply to any <lb/> task, nor enjoy a
                    moment's repose; when the hour arrived, <lb/> I hastened to my brother's.</p>
                <p>Pleyel was not there. He had not yet come. On <reg orig="ordi-|nary"
                        >ordinary</reg>
                    <lb/> occasions, he was eminent for punctuality. He had <lb/> testified great
                    eagerness to share in the pleasures of this <lb/> rehearsal. He was to divide
                    the task with my brother, and, <lb/> in tasks like these, he always engaged with
                    peculiar zeal. <lb/>
                    <pb n="75" entity="eaf033v1_0116" pid="uva-lib:349146"/> His elocution was less
                    sweet than sonorous; and, therefore, <lb/> better adapted than the mellifluences
                    of his friend, to the <lb/> outrageous vehemence of this drama.</p>
                <p>What could detain him? Perhaps he lingered through <lb/> forgetfulness. Yet this
                    was incredible. Never had his <lb/> memory been known to fail upon even more
                    trivial occasions. <lb/> Not less impossible was it, that the scheme had lost
                    its <lb/> attractions, and that he stayed, because his coming would <lb/> afford
                    him no gratification. But why should we expect him <lb/> to adhere to the
                    minute?</p>
                <p>An half hour elasped, but Pleyel was still at a distance. <lb/> Perhaps he had
                    misunderstood the hour which had been <reg orig="pro-|posed">proposed</reg>.
                    <lb/> Perhaps he had conceived that tomorrow, and not to <lb/> day, had been
                    selected for this purpose; but no. A review <lb/> of preceding circumstances
                    demonstrated that such <reg orig="misap-|prehension">misapprehension</reg>
                    <lb/> was impossible; for he had himself proposed <lb/> this day, and this hour.
                    This day, his attention would not <lb/> otherwise be occupied; but tomorrow, an
                    indispensable <lb/> engagement was foreseen, by which all his time would be
                    <lb/> engrossed; his detention, therefore, must be owing to some <lb/>
                    unforeseen and extraordinary event. Our conjectures were <lb/> vague,
                    tumultuous, and sometimes fearful. His sickness <lb/> and his death might
                    possibly have detained him.</p>
                <p>Tortured with suspense, we sat gazing at each other, and <lb/> at the path which
                    led from the road. Every horseman that <lb/> passed was, for a moment, imagined
                    to be him. Hour <lb/> succeeded hour, and the sun, gradually declining, at
                    length, <lb/> disappeared. Every signal of his coming proved fallacious, <lb/>
                    and our hopes were at length dismissed. His absence <lb/> affected my friends in
                    no insupportable degree. They <lb/> should be obliged, they said, to defer this
                    undertaking till <lb/> the morrow; and, perhaps, their impatient curiosity would
                    <lb/> compel them to dispense entirely with his presence. No <lb/> doubt, some
                    harmless occurrence had diverted him from his <lb/> purpose; and they trusted
                    that they should receive a <reg orig="satis-|factory">satisfactory</reg>
                    <lb/> account of him in the morning.</p>
                <p>It may be supposed that this disappointment affected me <lb/> in a very different
                    manner. I turned aside my head to <reg orig="con-|ceal">conceal</reg>
                    <lb/> my tears. I fled into solitude, to give vent to my <reg
                        orig="re-|proaches">reproaches</reg>, <lb/> without interruption or
                    restraint. My heart was <lb/> ready to burst with indignation and grief. Pleyel
                    was not <lb/>
                    <pb n="76" entity="eaf033v1_0117" pid="uva-lib:349147"/> the only object of my
                    keen but unjust upbraiding. Deeply <lb/> did I execrate my own folly. Thus
                    fallen into ruins was <lb/> the gay fabric which I had reared! Thus had my
                    golden <lb/> vision melted into air!</p>
                <p>How fondly did I dream that Pleyel was a lover! If he <lb/> were, would he have
                    suffered any obstacle to hinder his <lb/> coming? Blind and infatuated man! I
                    exclaimed. Thou <lb/> sportest with happiness. The good that is offered thee,
                    <lb/> thou hast the insolence and folly to refuse. Well, I will <lb/> henceforth
                    entrust my felicity to no one's keeping but my <lb/> own.</p>
                <p>The first agonies of this disappointment would not allow <lb/> me to be
                    reasonable or just. Every ground on which I had <lb/> built the persuasion that
                    Pleyel was not unimpressed in my <lb/> favor, appeared to vanish. It seemed as
                    if I had been <reg orig="mis-|led">misled</reg>
                    <lb/> into this opinion, by the most palpable illusions.</p>
                <p>I made some trifling excuse, and returned, much earlier <lb/> than I expected, to
                    my own house. I retired early to my <lb/> chamber, without designing to sleep. I
                    placed myself at a <lb/> window, and gave the reins to reflection.</p>
                <p>The hateful and degrading impulses which had lately <reg orig="con-|troled"
                        >controled</reg>
                    <lb/> me were, in some degree, removed. New dejection <lb/> succeeded, but was
                    now produced by contemplating my late <lb/> behavior. Surely that passion is
                    worthy to be abhorred <lb/> which obscures our understanding, and urges us to
                    the <reg orig="com-|mission">commission</reg>
                    <lb/> of injustice. What right had I to expect his <reg orig="atten-|dance"
                        >attendance</reg>? <lb/> Had I not demeaned myself like one indifferent
                    <lb/> to his happiness, and as having bestowed my regards upon <lb/> another?
                    His absence might be prompted by the love which <lb/> I considered his absence
                    as a proof that he wanted. He <lb/> came not because the sight of me, the
                    spectacle of my <reg orig="cold-|ness">coldness</reg>
                    <lb/> or aversion, contributed to his despair. Why should I <lb/> prolong, by
                    hypocrisy or silence, his misery as well as my <lb/> own? Why not deal with him
                    explicitly, and assure him of <lb/> the truth?</p>
                <p>You will hardly believe that, in obedience to this <reg orig="sugges-|tion"
                        >suggestion</reg>, <lb/> I rose for the purpose of ordering a light, that I
                    might <lb/> instantly make this confession in a letter. A second thought <lb/>
                    shewed me the rashness of this scheme, and I wondered by <lb/> what infirmity of
                    mind I could be betrayed into a <reg orig="momen-|tary">momentary</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="77" entity="eaf033v1_0118" pid="uva-lib:349148"/> approbation of it. I
                    saw with the utmost clearness <lb/> that a confession like that would be the
                    most remediless and <lb/> unpardonable outrage upon the dignity of my sex, and
                        <reg orig="utter-|ly">utterly</reg>
                    <lb/> unworthy of that passion which controled me.</p>
                <p>I resumed my seat and my musing. To account for the <lb/> absence of Pleyel
                    became once more the scope of my <reg orig="con-|jectures">conjectures</reg>.
                    <lb/> How many incidents might occur to raise an <reg orig="in-|superable"
                        >insuperable</reg>
                    <lb/> impediment in his way? When I was a child, a <lb/> scheme of pleasure, in
                    which he and his sister were parties, <lb/> had been, in like manner, frustrated
                    by his absence; but his <lb/> absence, in that instance, had been occasioned by
                    his falling <lb/> from a boat into the river, in consequence of which he had
                    <lb/> run the most imminent hazard of being drowned. Here was <lb/> a second
                    disappointment endured by the same persons, and <lb/> produced by his failure.
                    Might it not originate in the same <lb/> cause? Had he not designed to cross the
                    river that <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>
                    <lb/> to make some necessary purchases in Jersey? He had <lb/> preconcerted to
                    return to his own house to dinner; but, <lb/> perhaps, some disaster had
                    befallen him. Experience had <lb/> taught me the insecurity of a canoe, and that
                    was the only <lb/> kind of boat which Pleyel used; I was, likewise, actuated
                    <lb/> by an hereditary dread of water. These circumstances <lb/> combined to
                    bestow considerable plausibility on this <reg orig="conjec-|ture"
                        >conjecture</reg>; <lb/> but the consternation with which I began to be
                    seized <lb/> was allayed by reflecting, that if this disaster had happened, my
                    <lb/> brother would have received the speediest information of it. <lb/> The
                    consolation which this idea imparted was ravished from <lb/> me by a new
                    thought. This disaster might have happened, <lb/> and his family not be apprized
                    of it. The first intelligence <lb/> of his fate may be communicated by the livid
                    corpse which <lb/> the tide may cast, many days hence, upon the shore.</p>
                <p>Thus was I distressed by opposite conjectures; thus was <lb/> I tormented by
                    phantoms of my own creation. It was not <lb/> always thus. I can ascertain the
                    date when my mind <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg>
                    <lb/> the victim of this imbecility; perhaps it was coeval <lb/> with the inroad
                    of a fatal passion; a passion that will never <lb/> rank me in the number of its
                    eulogists; it was alone sufficient <lb/> to the extermination of my peace; it
                    was itself a plenteous <lb/> source of calamity, and needed not the concurrence
                    of other <lb/>
                    <pb n="78" entity="eaf033v1_0119" pid="uva-lib:349149"/> evils to take away the
                    attractions of existence, and dig for <lb/> me an untimely grave.</p>
                <p>The state of my mind naturally introduced a train of <lb/> reflections upon the
                    dangers and cares which inevitably beset <lb/> a human being. By no violent
                    transition was I led to <reg orig="pon-|der">ponder</reg>
                    <lb/> on the turbulent life and mysterious end of my father. <lb/> I cherished,
                    with the utmost veneration, the memory of this <lb/> man, and every relic
                    connected with his fate was preserved <lb/> with the most scrupulous care. Among
                    these was to be <lb/> numbered a manuscript, containing memoirs of his own life.
                    <lb/> The narrative was by no means recommended by its <reg orig="elo-|quence"
                        >eloquence</reg>; <lb/> but neither did all its value flow from my <reg
                        orig="relation-|ship">relationship</reg>
                    <lb/> to the author. Its style had an unaffected and picturesque <lb/>
                    simplicity. The great variety and circumstantial display <lb/> of the incidents,
                    together with their intriusic importance, as <lb/> descriptive of human manners
                    and passions, made it the <lb/> most useful book in my collection. It was late;
                    but being <lb/> sensible of no inclination to sleep, I resolved to betake <reg
                        orig="my-|self">myself</reg>
                    <lb/> to the perusal of it.</p>
                <p>To do this it was requisite to procure a light. The girl <lb/> had long since
                    retired to her chamber; it was therefore <lb/> proper to wait upon myself. A
                    lamp, and the means of <lb/> lighting it, were only to be found in the kitchen.
                    Thither I <lb/> resolved forthwith to repair; but the light was of use merely
                    <lb/> to enable me to read the book. I knew the shelf and the <lb/> spot where
                    it stood. Whether I took down the book, or <lb/> prepared the lamp in the first
                    place, appeared to be a matter <lb/> of no moment. The latter was perferred,
                    and, leaving my <lb/> seat, I approached the closet in which, as I mentioned
                        <reg orig="for-|merly">formerly</reg>, <lb/> my books and papers were
                    deposited.</p>
                <p>Suddenly the remembrance of what had lately passed in <lb/> this closet occurred.
                    Whether midnight was approaching, <lb/> or had passed, I knew not. I was, as
                    then, alone, and <reg orig="de-|fenceless">defenceless</reg>. <lb/> The wind was
                    in that direction, in which, aided by <lb/> the deathlike repose of nature, it
                    brought to me the murmur <lb/> of the water-fall. This was mingled with that
                    solemn and <lb/> enchanting sound, which a breeze produces among the leaves
                    <lb/> of pines. The words of that mysterious dialogue, their <reg
                        orig="fear-|ful">fearful</reg>
                    <lb/> import, and the wild excess to which I was transported <lb/>
                    <pb n="79" entity="eaf033v1_0120" pid="uva-lib:349150"/> by my terrors, filled
                    my imagination anew. My steps <reg orig="fal-|tered">faltered</reg>, <lb/> and I
                    stood a moment to recover myself.</p>
                <p>I prevailed on myself at length to move towards the <lb/> closet. I touched the
                    lock, but my fingers were powerless; <lb/> I was visited afresh by unconquerable
                    apprehensions. A <lb/> sort of belief darted into my mind, that some being was
                    <lb/> concealed within, whose purposes were evil. I began to <lb/> contend with
                    those fears, when it occurred to me that I <lb/> might, without impropriety, go
                    for a lamp, previously to <lb/> opening the closet. I receded a few steps; but
                    before I <lb/> reached the chamber door my thoughts took a new <reg
                        orig="direc-|tion">direction</reg>. <lb/> Motion seemed to produce a
                    mechanical influence <lb/> upon me. I was ashamed of my weakness. Besides, <lb/>
                    what aid could be afforded me by a lamp.</p>
                <p>My fears had pictured to themselves no precise object. <lb/> It would be
                    difficult to depict, in words, the ingredients and <lb/> hues of that phantom
                    which haunted me. A hand invisible <lb/> and of preternatural strength, lifted
                    by human passions, and <lb/> selecting my life for its aim, were parts of this
                    terrific image. <lb/> All places were alike accessible to this foe, or if his
                    empire <lb/> were restricted by local bounds, those bounds were utterly <lb/>
                    inscrutable by me. But had I not been told by some one <lb/> in league with this
                    enemy, that every place but the recess <lb/> in the bank was exempt from
                    danger?</p>
                <p>I returned to the closet, and once more put my hand <lb/> upon the lock. O! may
                    my ears lose their sensibility, ere <lb/> they be again assailed by a shriek so
                    terrible! Not merely <lb/> my understanding was subdued by the sound; it acted
                    on <lb/> my nerves like an edge of steel. It appeared to cut <reg
                        orig="asun-|der">asunder</reg>
                    <lb/> the fibres of my brain, and rack every joint with <lb/> agony.</p>
                <p>The cry, loud and piercing as it was, was nevertheless <lb/> human. No
                    articulation was ever more distinct. The <lb/> breath which accompanied it did
                    not fan my hair, yet did <lb/> every circumstance combine to persuade me that
                    the lips <lb/> which uttered it touched my very shoulder.</p>
                <p>"Hold! Hold!" were the words of this tremendous <lb/> prohibition, in whose tone
                    the whole soul seemed to be <lb/> wrapped up, and every energy converted into
                    eagerness <lb/> and terror.</p>
                <pb n="80" entity="eaf033v1_0121" pid="uva-lib:349151"/>
                <p>Shuddering, I dashed myself against the wall, and by the <lb/> same involuntary
                    impulse, turned my face backward to <reg orig="ex-|amine">examine</reg>
                    <lb/> the mysterious monitor. The moon-light streamed <lb/> into each window,
                    and every corner of the room was <lb/> conspicuous, and yet I beheld
                    nothing!</p>
                <p>The interval was too brief to be artificially measured, <lb/> between the
                    utterance of these words, and my scrutiny <reg orig="di-|rected">directed</reg>
                    <lb/> to the quarter whence they came. Yet if a human <lb/> being had been
                    there, could he fail to have been visible? <lb/> Which of my senses was the prey
                    of a fatal illusion? The <lb/> shock which the sound produced was still felt in
                    every part <lb/> of my frame. The sound, therefore, could not but be a <lb/>
                    genuine commotion. But that I had heard it, was not more <lb/> true, than that
                    the being who uttered it was stationed at my <lb/> right ear; yet my attendant
                    was invisible.</p>
                <p>I cannot describe the state of my thoughts at that <reg orig="mo-|ment"
                        >moment</reg>. <lb/> Surprise had mastered my faculties. My frame <lb/>
                    shook, and the vital current was congealed. I was conscious <lb/> only to the
                    vehemence of my sensations. This condition <lb/> could not be lasting. Like a
                    tide, which suddenly mounts <lb/> to an overwhelming height, and then gradually
                    subsides, my <lb/> confusion slowly gave place to order, and my tumults to a
                    <lb/> calm. I was able to deliberate and move. I resumed my <lb/> feet, and
                    advanced into the midst of the room. Upward, <lb/> and behind, and on each side,
                    I threw penetrating glances. <lb/> I was not satisfied with one examination. He
                    that hitherto <lb/> refused to be seen, might change his purpose, and on the
                    <lb/> next survey be clearly distinguishable.</p>
                <p>Solitude imposes least restraint upon the fancy. Dark is <lb/> less fertile of
                    images than the feeble lustre of the moon. I <lb/> was alone, and the walls were
                    checkered by shadowy <lb/> forms. As the moon passed behind a cloud and emerged,
                    <lb/> these shadows seemed to be endowed with life, and to move. <lb/> The
                    apartment was open to the breeze, and the curtain was <lb/> occasionally blown
                    from its ordinary position. This motion <lb/> was not unaccompanied with sound.
                    I failed not to snatch a <lb/> look, and to listen when this motion and this
                    sound occurred. <lb/> My belief that my monitor was posted near, was strong,
                    <lb/> and instantly converted these appearances to tokens of his <lb/> presence,
                    and yet I could discern nothing.</p>

                <p>When my thoughts were at length permitted to revert to <lb/> the past, the first
                    idea that occurred was the resemblance <lb/> between the words of the voice
                    which I had just heard, and <lb/> those which had terminated my dream in the
                    summer house. <lb/> There are means by which we are able to distinguish a <reg
                        orig="sub-|stance">substance</reg>
                    <lb/> from a shadow, a reality from the phantom of a <lb/> dream. The pit, my
                    brother beckoning me forward, the <lb/> seizure of my arm, and the voice behind,
                    were surely <reg orig="ima-|ginary">imaginary</reg>. <lb/> That these incidents
                    were fashioned in my sleep, <lb/> is supported by the same indubitable evidence
                    that compels <lb/> me to believe myself awake at present; yet the words and
                    <lb/> the voice were the same. Then, by some inexplicable <reg
                        orig="con-|trivance">contrivance</reg>, <lb/> I was aware of the danger,
                    while my actions and <lb/> sensations were those of one wholly unacquainted with
                    it. <lb/> Now, was it not equally true that my actions and <reg
                        orig="persua-|sions">persuasions</reg>
                    <lb/> were at war? Had not the belief, that evil lurked in <lb/> the closet,
                    gained admittance, and had not my actions <reg orig="be-|tokened"
                        >betokened</reg>
                    <lb/> an unwarrantable security? To obviate the effects <lb/> of my infatuation,
                    the same means had been used.</p>
                <p>In my dream, he that tempted me to my destruction was <lb/> my brother. Death was
                    ambushed in my path. From <lb/> what evil was I now rescued? What minister or
                    implement <lb/> of ill was shut up in this recess? Who was it whose <reg
                        orig="suf-|focating">suffocating</reg>
                    <lb/> grasp I was to feel, should I dare to enter it? What <lb/> monstrous
                    conception is this? my brother!</p>
                <p>No; protection, and not injury is his province. Strange <lb/> and terrible
                    chimera! Yet it would not be suddenly <reg orig="dis-|missed">dismissed</reg>.
                    <lb/> It was surely no vulgar agency that gave this form <lb/> to my fears. He
                    to whom all parts of time are equally <lb/> present, whom no contingency
                    approaches, was the author <lb/> of that spell which now seized upon me. Life
                    was dear <lb/> to me. No consideration was present that enjoined me to <lb/>
                    relinquish it. Sacred duty combined with every <reg orig="spontane-|ous"
                        >spontaneous</reg>
                    <lb/> sentiment to endear to me my being. Should I not <lb/> shudder when my
                    being was endangered? But what <reg orig="emo-|tion">emotion</reg>
                    <lb/> should possess me when the arm lifted against me was <lb/> Wieland's?</p>
                <p>Ideas exist in our minds that can be accounted for by no <lb/> established laws.
                    Why did I dream that my brother was my <lb/>
                    <pb n="82" entity="eaf033v1_0123" pid="uva-lib:349153"/> foe? Why but because an
                    omen of my fate was ordained <lb/> to be communicated? Yet what salutary end did
                    it serve? <lb/> Did it arm me with caution to elude, or fortitude to bear the
                    <lb/> evils to which I was reserved? My present thoughts were, <lb/> no doubt,
                    indebted for their hue, to the similitude existing <lb/> between these incidents
                    and those of my dream. Surely it <lb/> was phrenzy that dictated my deed. That a
                    ruffian was <lb/> hidden in the closet, was an idea, the genuine tendency of
                    <lb/> which was to urge me to flight. Such had been the effect <lb/> formerly
                    produced. Had my mind been simply occupied <lb/> with this thought at present,
                    no doubt, the same impulse <lb/> would have been experienced; but now it was my
                    brother <lb/> whom I was irresistibly persuaded to regard as the contriver <lb/>
                    of that ill of which I had been forewarned. This <reg orig="persua-|sion"
                        >persuasion</reg>
                    <lb/> did not extenuate my fears or my danger. Why then <lb/> did I again
                    approach the closet and withdraw the bolt? My <lb/> resolution was instantly
                    conceived, and executed without <lb/> faltering.</p>
                <p>The door was formed of light materials. The lock, of <lb/> simple structure,
                    easily forewent its hold. It opened into <lb/> the room, and commonly moved upon
                    its hinges, after being <lb/> unfastened, without any effort of mine. This
                    effort, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/> was bestowed upon the present
                    occasion. It was my <lb/> purpose to open it with quickness, but the exertion
                    which I <lb/> made was ineffectual. It refused to open.</p>
                <p>At another time, this circumstance would not have looked <lb/> with a face of
                    mystery. I should have supposed some <lb/> casual obstruction, and repeated my
                    efforts to surmount it. <lb/> But now my mind was accessible to no conjecture
                    but one. <lb/> The door was hindered from opening by human force. <lb/> Surely,
                    here was new cause for affright. This was <reg orig="confir-|mation"
                        >confirmation</reg>
                    <lb/> proper to decide my conduct. Now was all ground <lb/> of hesitation taken
                    away. What could be supposed, but <lb/> that I deserted the chamber and the
                    house? that I at least <lb/> endeavored no longer to withdraw the door?</p>
                <p>Have I not said that my actions were dictated by <reg orig="fren-|zy"
                        >frenzy</reg>? <lb/> My reason had forborne, for a time, to suggest, or to
                    <lb/> sway my resolves. I reiterated my endeavors. I exerted <lb/> all my force
                    to overcome the obstacle, but in vain. The <lb/>
                    <pb n="83" entity="eaf033v1_0124" pid="uva-lib:349154"/> strength that was
                    exerted to keep it shut, was superior to <lb/> mine.</p>
                <p>A casual observer might, perhaps, applaud the <reg orig="audacious-|ness"
                        >audaciousness</reg>
                    <lb/> of this conduct. Whence, but from a habitual defiance <lb/> of danger,
                    could my perseverance arise? I have already <lb/> assigned, as distinctly as I
                    am able, the cause of it. The <lb/> frantic conception that my brother was
                    within, that the <reg orig="re-|sistance">resistance</reg>
                    <lb/> made to my design was exerted by him, had rooted <lb/> itself in my mind.
                    You will comprehend the height of this <lb/> infatuation, when I tell you, that,
                    finding all my exertions <lb/> vain, I betook myself to exclamations. Surely I
                    was <reg orig="ut-|terly">utterly</reg>
                    <lb/> bereft of understanding.</p>
                <p>Now had I arrived at the crisis of my fate. "O! hinder <lb/> not the door to
                    open," I exclaimed, in a tone that had less <lb/> of fear than of grief in it.
                    "I know you well. Come <lb/> forth, but harm me not. I beseech you come
                    forth."</p>
                <p>I had taken my hand from the lock, and removed to a <lb/> small distance from the
                    door. I had scarcely uttered these <lb/> words, when the door swung upon its
                    hinges, and displayed <lb/> to my view the interior of the closet. Whoever was
                    within, <lb/> was shrouded in darkness. A few seconds passed without <lb/>
                    interruption of the silence. I knew not what to expect or <lb/> to fear. My eyes
                    would not stray from the recess. <reg orig="Pre-|sently">Presently</reg>, <lb/>
                    a deep sigh was heard. The quarter from which it <lb/> came heightened the
                    eagerness of my gaze. Some one <lb/> approached from the farther end. I quickly
                    perceived the <lb/> outlines of a human figure. Its steps were irresolute and
                    <lb/> slow. I recoiled as it advanced.</p>
                <p>By coming at length within the verge of the room, his <lb/> form was clearly
                    distinguishable. I had prefigured to <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg>
                    <lb/> a very different personage. The face that presented <lb/> itself was the
                    last that I should desire to meet at an hour, <lb/> and in a place like this. My
                    wonder was stifled by my <lb/> fears. Assassins had lurked in this recess. Some
                    divine <lb/> voice warned me of danger, that at this moment <reg
                        orig="await-|ed">awaited</reg>
                    <lb/> me. I had spurned the intimation, and challenged my <lb/> adversary.</p>
                <p>I recalled the mysterious countenance and dubious <reg orig="char-|acter"
                        >character</reg>
                    <lb/> of Carwin. What motive but atrocious ones could <lb/> guide his steps
                    hither? I was alone. My habit suited the <lb/>
                    <pb n="84" entity="eaf033v1_0125" pid="uva-lib:349155"/> hour, and the place,
                    and the warmth of the season. All <lb/> succor was remote. He had placed himself
                    between me <lb/> and the door. My frame shook with the vehemence of my <lb/>
                    apprehensions.</p>
                <p>Yet I was not wholly lost to myself; I vigilantly marked <lb/> his demeanor. His
                    looks were grave, but not without <reg orig="per-|turbation">perturbation</reg>.
                    <lb/> What species of inquietude it betrayed, the <lb/> light was not strong
                    enough to enable me to discover. He <lb/> stood still; but his eyes wandered
                    from one object to <reg orig="ano-|ther">another</reg>. <lb/> When these
                    powerful organs were fixed upon me, I <lb/> shrunk into myself. At length he
                    broke silence. <reg orig="Earnest-|ness">Earnestness</reg>, <lb/> and not
                    embarrassment was in his tone. He advanced <lb/> close to me while he spoke.</p>
                <p>"What voice was that which lately addressed you?"</p>
                <p>He paused for an answer; but observing my trepidation, <lb/> he resumed, with
                    undiminished solemnity; "Be not <reg orig="terri-|fied">terrified</reg>. <lb/>
                    Whoever he was, he has done you an important <reg orig="ser-|vice"
                    >service</reg>. <lb/> I need not ask you if it were the voice of a <reg
                        orig="compan-|ion">companion</reg>. <lb/> That sound was beyond the compass
                    of human <reg orig="or-|gans">organs</reg>. <lb/> The knowledge that enabled him
                    to tell you who <lb/> was in the closet, was obtained by incomprehensible
                    means.</p>
                <p>"You knew that Carwin was there. Were you not <reg orig="ap-|prized"
                        >apprized</reg>
                    <lb/> of his intents? The same power could impart the one <lb/> as well as the
                    other. Yet, knowing these, you persisted. <lb/> Audacious girl! but, perhaps,
                    you confided in his <reg orig="guardian-|ship">guardianship</reg>. <lb/> Your
                    confidence was just. With succor like this at <lb/> hand you may safely defy
                    me.</p>
                <p>"He is my eternal foe; the baffler of my best concerted <lb/> schemes. Twice have
                    you been saved by his accursed <reg orig="in-|terposition">interposition</reg>.
                    <lb/> But for him I should long ere now have borne <lb/> away the spoils of your
                    honor."</p>
                <p>He looked at me with greater steadfastness than before. <lb/> I became every
                    moment more anxious for my safety. It <lb/> was with difficulty I stammered out
                    an entreaty that he <lb/> would instantly depart, or suffer me to do so. He paid
                    no <lb/> regard to my request, but proceeded in a more impassioned <lb/>
                    manner.</p>
                <p>"What is it you fear? Have I not told you, you are safe? <lb/> Has not one in
                    whom you more reasonably place trust <lb/> assured you of it? Even if I execute
                    my purpose, what <reg orig="in-|jury">injury</reg>

                    not.</p>
                <p>"I was impelled by a sentiment that does you honor; a <lb/> sentiment, that would
                    sanctify my deed; but, whatever it <lb/> be, you are safe. Be this chimera still
                    worshipped; I will <lb/> do nothing to pollute it." There he stopped.</p>
                <p>The accents and gestures of this man left me drained of <lb/> all courage.
                    Surely, on no other occasion should I have <lb/> been thus pusillanimous. My
                    state I regarded as a <reg orig="hope-|less">hopeless</reg>
                    <lb/> one. I was wholly at the mercy of this being. <reg orig="Which-|ever"
                        >Whichever</reg>
                    <lb/> way I turned my eyes, I saw no avenue by which I <lb/> might escape. The
                    resources of my personal strength, my <lb/> ingenuity, and my eloquence, I
                    estimated at nothing. The <lb/> dignity of virtue, and the force of truth, I had
                    been <reg orig="accus-|tomed">accustomed</reg>
                    <lb/> to celebrate; and had frequently vaunted of the <reg orig="con-|quests"
                        >conquests</reg>
                    <lb/> which I should make with their assistance.</p>
                <p>I used to suppose that certain evils could never befall a <lb/> being in
                    possession of a sound mind; that true virtue <reg orig="sup-|plies"
                        >supplies</reg>
                    <lb/> us with energy which vice can never resist; that it was <lb/> always in
                    our power to obstruct, by his own death, the designs <lb/> of an enemy who aimed
                    at less than our life. How was it <lb/> that a sentiment like despair had now
                    invaded me, and that I <lb/> trusted to the protection of chance, or to the pity
                    of my <lb/> persecutor?</p>
                <p>His words imparted some notion of the injury which he <lb/> had meditated. He
                    talked of obstacles that had risen in his <lb/> way. He had relinquished his
                    design. These sources <lb/> supplied me with slender consolation. There was no
                        <reg orig="secu-|rity">security</reg>
                    <lb/> but in his absence. When I looked at myself, when I <lb/> reflected on the
                    hour and the place, I was overpowered by <lb/> horror and dejection.</p>
                <p>He was silent, museful, and inattentive to my situation, <lb/> yet made no motion
                    to depart. I was silent in my turn. <lb/> What could I say? I was confident that
                    reason in this <reg orig="con-|test">contest</reg>
                    <lb/> would be impotent. I must owe my safety to his own <lb/> suggestions.
                    Whatever purpose brought him hither, he had <lb/> changed it. Why then did he
                    remain? His resolutions <lb/> might fluctuate, and the pause of a few minutes
                    restore to <lb/> him his first resolutions.</p>
                <p>Yet was not this the man whom we had treated with <reg orig="un-|wearied"
                        >unwearied</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="86" entity="eaf033v1_0127" pid="uva-lib:349157"/> kindness? Whose society
                    was endeared to us by <lb/> his intellectual elevation and accomplishments? Who
                    had a <lb/> thousand times expatiated on the usefulness and beauty of <lb/>
                    virtue? Why should such a one be dreaded? If I could <lb/> have forgotten the
                    circumstances in which our interview had <lb/> taken place, I might have treated
                    his words as jests. <reg orig="Pre-|sently">Presently</reg>, <lb/> he
                    resumed;</p>
                <p>"Fear me not; the space that severs us is small, and all <lb/> visible succor is
                    distant. You believe yourself completely <lb/> in my power; that you stand upon
                    the brink of ruin. Such <lb/> are your groundless fears. I cannot lift a finger
                    to hurt <lb/> you. Easier it would be to stop the moon in her course <lb/> than
                    to injure you. The power that protects you would <lb/> crumble my sinews, and
                    reduce me to a heap of ashes in a <lb/> moment, if I were to harbor a thought
                    hostile to your <lb/> safety.</p>
                <p>"Thus are appearances at length solved. Little did I <lb/> expect that they
                    originated hence. What a portion is <reg orig="as-|signed">assigned</reg>
                    <lb/> to you? Scanned by the eyes of this intelligence, <lb/> your path will be
                    without pits to swallow, or snares to <reg orig="entan-|gle">entangle</reg>
                    <lb/> you. Environed by the arms of this protection, all <reg orig="arti-|fices"
                        >artifices</reg>
                    <lb/> will be frustrated, and all malice repelled."</p>
                <p>Here succeeded a new pause. I was still observant of <lb/> every gesture and
                    look. The tranquil solemnity that had <lb/> lately possessed his countenance
                    gave way to a new <reg orig="expres-|sion">expression</reg>. <lb/> All now was
                    trepidation and anxiety.</p>
                <p>"I must be gone," said he in a faltering accent. "Why <lb/> do I linger here? I
                    will not ask your forgiveness. I see <lb/> that your terrors are invincible.
                    Your pardon will be <reg orig="ex-|torted">extorted</reg>
                    <lb/> by fear, and not dictated by compassion. I must fly <lb/> from you
                    forever. He that could plot against your honor, <lb/> must expect from you and
                    your friends persecution and <lb/> death. I must doom myself to endless
                    exile."</p>
                <p>Saying this, he hastily left the room. I listened while he <lb/> descended the
                    stairs, and, unbolting the outer door, <unclear id="u23">wet</unclear>
                    <lb/> forth. I did not follow him with my eyes, as the <reg orig="moon-|light"
                        >moonlight</reg>
                    <lb/> would have enabled me to do. Relieved by his <reg orig="ab-|sence"
                        >absence</reg>, <lb/> and exhausted by the conflict of my fears, I threw
                    <lb/> myself on a chair, and resigned myself to those bewildering <lb/> ideas
                    which incidents like these could not fail to produce.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Order</hi> could not readily be introduced into my
                    thoughts. <lb/> The voice still rung in my ears. Every accent that was <lb/>
                    uttered by Carwin was fresh in my remembrance. His <reg orig="un-|welcome"
                        >unwelcome</reg>
                    <lb/> approach, the recognition of his person, his hasty <lb/> departure,
                    produced a complex impression on my mind <lb/> which no words can delineate. I
                    strove to give a slower <lb/> motion to my thoughts, and to regulate a confusion
                    which <lb/> became painful; but my efforts were nugatory. I covered <lb/> my
                    eyes with my hand, and sat, I know not how long, <reg orig="with-|out"
                        >without</reg>
                    <lb/> power to arrange or utter my conceptions.</p>
                <p>I had remained for hours, as I believed, in absolute <reg orig="soli-|tude"
                        >solitude</reg>. <lb/> No thought of personal danger had molested my <lb/>
                    tranquillity. I had made no preparation for defence. What <lb/> was it that
                    suggested the design of perusing my father's <lb/> manuscript? If, instead of
                    this, I had retired to bed, and to <lb/> sleep, to what fate might I not have
                    been reserved? The <lb/> ruffian, who must almost have suppressed his breathings
                    to <lb/> screen himself from discovery, would have noticed this <reg
                        orig="sig-|nal">signal</reg>, <lb/> and I should have awakened only to
                    perish with affright, <lb/> and to abhor myself. Could I have remained
                    unconscious <lb/> of my danger? Could I have tranquilly slept in the midst <lb/>
                    of so deadly a snare?</p>
                <p>And who was he that threatened to destroy me? By <lb/> what means could he hide
                    himself in this closet? Surely he <lb/> is gifted with supernatural power. Such
                    is the enemy of <lb/> whose attempts I was forewarned. Daily I had seen him
                    <lb/> and conversed with him. Nothing could be discerned <lb/> through the
                    impenetrable veil of his duplicity. When busied <lb/> in conjectures, as to the
                    author of the evil that was <reg orig="threaten-|ed">threatened</reg>, <lb/> my
                    mind did not light, for a moment, upon his image. <lb/> Yet has he not avowed
                    himself my enemy? Why should he <lb/> be here if he had not meditated evil?</p>
                <p>He confesses that this has been his second attempt. What <lb/> was the scene of
                    his former conspiracy? Was it not he <lb/> whose whispers betrayed him? Am I
                    deceived; or was <lb/> there not a faint resemblance between the voice of this
                    man <lb/> and that which talked of grasping my throat, and <reg
                        orig="extin-|guishing">extinguishing</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="88" entity="eaf033v1_0129" pid="uva-lib:349159"/> my life in a moment?
                    Then he had a colleague <lb/> in his crime; now he is alone. Then death was the
                    scope <lb/> of his thoughts; now an injury unspeakably more dreadful. <lb/> How
                    thankful should I be to the power that has interposed <lb/> to save me!</p>
                <p>That power is invisible. It is subject to the cognizance <lb/> of one of my
                    senses. What are the means that will inform <lb/> me of what nature it is? He
                    has set himself to counterwork <lb/> the machinations of this man, who had
                    menaced destruction <lb/> to all that is dear to me, and whose cunning had
                    surmounted <lb/> every human impediment. There was none to rescue me <lb/> from
                    his grasp. My rashness even hastened the completion <lb/> of his scheme, and
                    precluded him from the benefits of <reg orig="de-|liberation"
                    >deliberation</reg>. <lb/> I had robbed him of the power to repent and <lb/>
                    forbear. Had I been apprized of the danger, I should have <lb/> regarded my
                    conduct as the means of rendering my escape <lb/> from it impossible. Such,
                    likewise, seem to have been the <lb/> fears of my invisible protector. Else why
                    that startling <lb/> entreaty to refrain from opening the closet? By what <reg
                        orig="inex-|plicable">inexplicable</reg>
                    <lb/> infatuation was I compelled to proceed?</p>
                <p>Yet my conduct was wise. Carwin, unable to <reg orig="compre-|hend"
                        >comprehend</reg>
                    <lb/> my folly, ascribed my behavior to my knowledge. <lb/> He conceived himself
                    previously detected, and such <reg orig="detec-|tion">detection</reg>
                    <lb/> being possible to flow only from <hi rend="italic">my</hi> heavenly
                    friend, and <lb/>
                    <hi rend="italic">his</hi> enemy, his fears acquired additional strength.</p>
                <p>He is apprized of the nature and intentions of this being. <lb/> Perhaps he is a
                    human agent. Yet, on that supposition his <lb/> achievements are incredible. Why
                    should I be selected as <lb/> the object of his care; or, if a mere mortal,
                    should I not <lb/> recognise some one, whom, benefits imparted and received
                    <lb/> had prompted to love me? What were the limits and <reg orig="dura-|tion"
                        >duration</reg>
                    <lb/> of his guardianship? Was the genius of my birth <reg orig="en-|trusted"
                        >entrusted</reg>
                    <lb/> by divine benignity with this province? Are human <lb/> faculties adequate
                    to receive stronger proofs of the existence <lb/> of unfettered and beneficent
                    intelligences than I have <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg>?</p>
                <p>But who was this man's coadjutor? The voice that <reg orig="ac-|knowledged"
                        >acknowledged</reg>
                    <lb/> an alliance in treachery with Carwin warned <lb/> me to avoid the
                    summerhouse. He assured me that there <lb/> only my safety was endangered. His
                    assurance, as it now <lb/>
                    <pb n="89" entity="eaf033v1_0130" pid="uva-lib:349160"/> appears, was
                    fallacious. Was there not deceit in his <reg orig="admo-|nition"
                        >admonition</reg>? <lb/> Was his compact really annulled? Some purpose <lb/>
                    was, perhaps, to be accomplished by preventing my future <lb/> visits to that
                    spot. Why was I enjoined silence to others, <lb/> on the subject of this
                    admonition, unless it were for some <lb/> unauthorized and guilty purpose?</p>
                <p>No one but myself was accustomed to visit it. Backward, <lb/> it was hidden from
                    distant view by the rock, and in front, it <lb/> was screened from all
                    examination, by creeping plants, and <lb/> the branches of cedars. What recess
                    could be more <reg orig="pro-|pitious">propitious</reg>
                    <lb/> to secrecy? The spirit which haunted it formerly was <lb/> pure and
                    rapturous. It was a fane sacred to the memory <lb/> of infantile days, and to
                    blissful imaginations of the future! <lb/> What a gloomy reverse had succeeded
                    since the ominous <lb/> arrival of this stranger! Now, perhaps, it is the scene
                    of <lb/> his meditations. Purposes fraught with horror, that shun the <lb/>
                    light, and contemplate the pullution of innocence, are here <lb/> engendered,
                    and fostered, and reared to maturity.</p>
                <p>Such were the ideas that, during the night, were <reg orig="tumul-|tuously"
                        >tumultuously</reg>
                    <lb/> revolved by me. I reviewed every conversation in <lb/> which Carwin had
                    borne a part. I studied to discover the <lb/> true inferences deducible from his
                    deportment and words <lb/> with regard to his former adventures and actual
                    views. I <lb/> pondered on the comments which he made on the relation <lb/>
                    which I had given of the closet dialogue. No new ideas <lb/> suggested
                    themselves in the course of this review. My <reg orig="ex-|pectation"
                        >expectation</reg>
                    <lb/> had, from the first, been disappointed on the small <lb/> degree of
                    surprise which this narrative excited in him. He <lb/> never explicitly declared
                    his opinion as to the nature of those <lb/> voices, or decided whether they were
                    real or visionary. <lb/> He recommended no measures of caution or
                    prevention.</p>
                <p>But what measures were now to be taken? Was the <lb/> danger which threatened me
                    at an end? Had I nothing <lb/> more to fear? I was lonely, and without means of
                        <reg orig="de-|fence">defence</reg>. <lb/> I could not calculate the motives
                    and regulate the <lb/> footsteps of this person. What certainty was there, that
                    he <lb/> would not re-assume his purposes, and swiftly return to the <lb/>
                    execution of them?</p>
                <p>This idea covered me once more with dismay. How <lb/> deeply did I regret the
                    solitude in which I was placed, and <lb/>
                    <pb n="90" entity="eaf033v1_0131" pid="uva-lib:349161"/> how ardently did I
                    desire the return of day! But neither of <lb/> these inconveniencies were
                    susceptible of remedy. At first, it <lb/> occurred to me to summon my servant,
                    and make her spend <lb/> the night in my chamber; but the inefficacy of this
                        <reg orig="expedi-|ent">expedient</reg>
                    <lb/> to enhance my safety was easily seen. Once I resolved <lb/> to leave the
                    house, and retire to my brother's, but was <reg orig="de-|terred">deterred</reg>
                    <lb/> by reflecting on the unseasonableness of the hour, on <lb/> the alarm
                    which my arrival, and the account which I should <lb/> be obliged to give, might
                    occasion, and on the danger to <lb/> which I might expose myself in the way
                    thither. I began, <lb/> likewise, to consider Carwin's return to molest me as
                        <reg orig="ex-|ceedingly">exceedingly</reg>
                    <lb/> improbable. He had relinquished, of his own <lb/> accord, his design, and
                    departed without compulsion.</p>
                <p>"Surely," said I, "there is omnipotence in the cause <lb/> that changed the views
                    of a man like Carwin. The divinity <lb/> that shielded me from his attempts will
                    take suitable care of <lb/> my future safety. Thus to yield to my fears is to
                    deserve <lb/> that they should be real."</p>
                <p>Scarcely had I uttered these words, when my attention <lb/> was startled by the
                    sound of footsteps. They denoted some <lb/> one stepping into the piazza in
                    front of my house. My <reg orig="new-|born">newborn</reg>
                    <lb/> confidence was extinguished in a moment. Carwin, I <lb/> thought, had
                    repented his departure, and was hastily <reg orig="return-|ing">returning</reg>.
                    <lb/> The possibility that his return was prompted by <reg orig="inten-|tions"
                        >intentions</reg>
                    <lb/> consistent with my safety, found no place in my mind. <lb/> Images of
                    violation and murder assailed me anew, and the <lb/> terrors which succeeded
                    almost incapaciated me from taking <lb/> any measures for my defence. It was an
                    impulse of which <lb/> I was scarcely conscious, that made me fasten the lock
                    and <lb/> draw the bolts of my chamber door. Having done this, I <lb/> threw
                    myself on a seat; for I trembled to a degree which <lb/> disabled me from
                    standing, and my soul was so perfectly <lb/> absorbed in the act of listening,
                    that almost the vital motions <lb/> were stopped.</p>
                <p>The door below creaked on its hinges. It was not again <lb/> thrust to, but
                    appeared to remain open. Footsteps entered, <lb/> traversed the entry, and began
                    to mount the stairs. How I <lb/> detested the folly of not pursuing the man when
                    he <reg orig="with-|drew">withdrew</reg>, <lb/> and bolting after him the outer
                    door! Might he not <lb/>
                    <pb n="91" entity="eaf033v1_0132" pid="uva-lib:349162"/> conceive this omission
                    to be a proof that my angel bad <reg orig="de-|serted">deserted</reg>
                    <lb/> me, and be thereby fortified in guilt?</p>
                <p>Every step on the stairs, which brought him nearer to my <lb/> chamber, added
                    vigor to my desperation. The evil with <lb/> which I was menaced was to be at
                    any rate eluded. How <lb/> little did I preconceive the conduct which, in an
                    exigence <lb/> like this, I should be prone to adopt. You will suppose <lb/>
                    that deliberation and despair would have suggested the same <lb/> course of
                    action, and that I should have, unhesitatingly, <reg orig="re-|sorted"
                        >resorted</reg>
                    <lb/> to the best means of personal defence within my <lb/> power. A penknife
                    lay open upon my table. I <reg orig="remem-|bered">remembered</reg>
                    <lb/> that it was there, and seized it. For what purpose <lb/> you will scarcely
                    inquire. It will be immediately supposed <lb/> that I meant it for my last
                    refuge, and that if all other means <lb/> should fail, I should plunge it into
                    the heart of my ravisher.</p>
                <p>I have lost all faith in the steadfastness of human resolves. <lb/> It was thus
                    that in periods of calm I had determined to act. <lb/> No cowardice had been
                    held by me in greater abhorrence <lb/> than that which prompted an injured
                    female to destroy, not <lb/> her injurer ere the injury was perpetrated, but
                    herself when <lb/> it was without remedy. Yet now this penknife appeared to
                    <lb/> me of no other use than to baffle my assailant, and prevent <lb/> the
                    crime by destroying myself. To deliberate at such a time <lb/> was impossible;
                    but among the tumultuous suggestions of the <lb/> moment, I do not recollect
                    that it once occurred to me to <lb/> use it as an instrument of direct
                    defence.</p>
                <p>The steps had now reached the second floor. Every <lb/> footfall accelerated the
                    completion, without augmenting, the <lb/> certainty of evil. The consciousness
                    that the door was fast, <lb/> now that nothing but that was interposed between
                    me and <lb/> danger, was a source of some consolation. I cast my eye <lb/>
                    towards the window. This, likewise, was a new suggestion. <lb/> If the door
                    should give way, it was my sudden resolution to <lb/> throw myself from the
                    window. Its height from the ground, <lb/> which was covered beneath by a brick
                    pavement, would <lb/> ensure my destruction; but I thought not of that.</p>
                <p>When opposite to my door the footsteps ceased. Was he <lb/> listening whether my
                    fears were allayed, and my caution <lb/> were asleep? Did he hope to take me by
                    surprise? Yet, <lb/> if so, why did he allow so many noisy signals to betray his <lb/>
                    <pb n="92" entity="eaf033v1_0133" pid="uva-lib:349163"/> approach? Presently the
                    steps were again heard to approach <lb/> the door. A hand was laid upon the
                    lock, and the latch <lb/> pulled back. Did he imagine it possible that I should
                    fail <lb/> to secure the door? A slight effort was made to push it <lb/> open,
                    as if all bolts being withdrawn, a slight effort only was <lb/> required.</p>
                <p>I no sooner perceived this, than I moved swiftly towards <lb/> the window.
                    Carwin's frame might be said to be all muscle. <lb/> His strength and activity
                    had appeared, in various instances, <lb/> to be prodigious. A slight exertion of
                    his force would <reg orig="de-|molish">demolish</reg>
                    <lb/> the door. Would not that exertion be made? Too <lb/> surely it would; but,
                    at the same moment that this obstacle <lb/> should yield, and he should enter
                    the apartment, my <reg orig="deter-|mination">determination</reg>
                    <lb/> was formed to leap from the window. My senses <lb/> were still bound to
                    this object. I gazed at the door in <reg orig="mo-|mentary">momentary</reg>
                    <lb/> expectation that the assault would be made. The <lb/> pause continued. The
                    person without was irresolute and <lb/> motionless.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, it occurred to me that Carwin might conceive <lb/> me to have fled.
                    That I had not betaken myself to flight <lb/> was, indeed, the least probable of
                    all conclusions. In this <lb/> persuasion he must have been confirmed on finding
                    the <lb/> lower door unfastened, and the chamber door locked. Was <lb/> it not
                    wise to foster this persuasion? Should I maintain <lb/> deep silence, this, in
                    addition to other circumstances, might <lb/> encourage the belief, and he would
                    once more depart. Every <lb/> new reflection added plausibility to this
                    reasoning. It was <lb/> presently more strongly enforced, when I noticed
                    footsteps <lb/> withdrawing from the door. The blood once more flowed <lb/> back
                    to my heart, and a dawn of exultation began to rise; <lb/> but my joy was short
                    lived. Instead of descending the <lb/> stairs, he passed to the door of the
                    opposite chamber, <lb/> opened it, and having entered, shut it after him with a
                    <lb/> violence that shook the house.</p>
                <p>How was I to interpret this circumstance? For what <lb/> end could he have
                    entered this chamber? Did the <reg orig="vio-|lence">violence</reg>
                    <lb/> with which he closed the door testify the depth of his <lb/> vexation?
                    This room was usually occupied by Pleyel. <lb/> Was Carwin aware of his absence
                    on this night? Could <lb/> he be suspected of a design so sordid as pillage? If
                    this <lb/>
                    <pb n="93" entity="eaf033v1_0134" pid="uva-lib:349164">

                    </pb> were his view there were no means in my power to frustrate <lb/> it. It
                    behoved me to seize the first opportunity to escape; <lb/> but if my escape were
                    supposed by my enemy to have <lb/> been already effected, no asylum was more
                    secure than the <lb/> present. How could my passage from the house be <reg
                        orig="ac-|complished">accomplished</reg>
                    <lb/> without noises that might incite him to pursue <lb/> me?</p>
                <p>Utterly at a loss to account for his going into Pleyel's <lb/> chamber, I waited
                    in instant expectation of hearing him <lb/> come forth. All, however, was
                    profoundly still. I listened <lb/> in vain for a considerable period to catch
                    the sound of the <lb/> door when it should again be opened. There was no other
                    <lb/> avenue by which he could escape, but a door which led into <lb/> the
                    girl's chamber. Would any evil from this quarter befall <lb/> the girl?</p>
                <p>Hence arose a new train of apprehensions. They <lb/> merely added to the
                    turbulence and agony of my <reg orig="reflec-|tions">reflections</reg>. <lb/>
                    Whatever evil impended over her, I had no power <lb/> to avert it. Seclusion and
                    silence were the only means of <lb/> saving myself from the perils of this fatal
                    night. What <reg orig="so-|lemn">solemn</reg>
                    <lb/> vows did I put up, that if I should once more behold <lb/> the light of
                    day, I would never trust myself again within the <lb/> threshold of this
                    dwelling!</p>
                <p>Minute lingered after minute, but no token was given that <lb/> Carwin had
                    returned to the passage. What, I again asked, <lb/> could detain him in this
                    room? Was it possible that he had <lb/> returned, and glided, unperceived, away?
                    I was speedily <lb/> aware of the difficulty that attended an enterprise like
                    this; <lb/> and yet, as if by that means I were capable of gaining any <lb/>
                    information on that head, I cast anxious looks from the <lb/> window.</p>
                <p>The object that first attracted my attention was a human <lb/> figure standing on
                    the edge of the bank. Perhaps my <reg orig="pene-|tration">penetration</reg>
                    <lb/> was assisted by my hopes. Be that as it will, the <lb/> figure of Carwin
                    was clearly distinguishable. From the <lb/> obscurity of my station, it was
                    impossible that I should be <lb/> discerned by him, and yet he scarcely suffered
                    me to catch <lb/> a glimpse of him. He turned and went down the steep, <lb/>
                    which, in this part, was not difficult to be scaled.</p>
                <p>My conjecture then had been right. Carwin has softly <lb/>
                    <pb n="94" entity="eaf033v1_0135" pid="uva-lib:349165"/> opened the door,
                    descended the stairs, and issued forth. <lb/> That I should not have overheard
                    his steps, was only less <lb/> incredible than that my eyes had deceived me. But
                    what <lb/> was now to be done? The house was at length delivered <lb/> from this
                    detested inmate. By one avenue might he again <lb/> re-enter. Was it not wise to
                    bar the lower door? Perhaps <lb/> he had gone out by the kitchen door. For this
                    end, he <lb/> must have passed through Judith's chamber. These <reg
                        orig="en-|trances">entrances</reg>
                    <lb/> being closed and bolted, as great security was <lb/> gained as was
                    compatible with my lonely condition.</p>
                <p>The propriety of these measures was too manifest not to <lb/> make me struggle
                    successfully with my fears. Yet I <lb/> opened my own door with the utmost
                    caution, and <reg orig="de-|scended">descended</reg>
                    <lb/> as if I were afraid that Carwin had been still <reg orig="im-|mured"
                        >immured</reg>
                    <lb/> in Pleyel's chamber. The outer door was a-jar. I <lb/> shut, with
                    trembling eagerness, and drew every bolt that <lb/> appended to it. I then
                    passed with light and less cautious <lb/> steps through the parlor, but was
                    surprised to discover that <lb/> the kitchen door was secure. I was compelled to
                    acquiesce <lb/> in the first conjecture that Carwin had escaped through the
                    <lb/> entry.</p>
                <p>My heart was now somewhat eased of the load of <reg orig="appre-|hension"
                        >apprehension</reg>. <lb/> I returned once more to my chamber, the door
                    <lb/> of which I was careful to lock. It was no time to think of <lb/> repose.
                    The moonlight began already to fade before the <lb/> light of the day. The
                    approach of morning was betokened <lb/> by the usual signals. I mused upon the
                    events of this night, <lb/> and determined to take up my abode henceforth at my
                    <lb/> brother's. Whether I should inform him of what had <reg orig="hap-|pened"
                        >happened</reg>
                    <lb/> was a question which seemed to demand some <reg orig="con-|sideration"
                        >consideration</reg>. <lb/> My safety unquestionably required that I should
                    <lb/> abandon my present habitation.</p>
                <p>As my thoughts began to flow with fewer impediments, <lb/> the image of Pleyel,
                    and the dubiousness of his condition, <lb/> again recurred to me. I again ran
                    over the possible causes <lb/> of his absence on the preceding day. My mind was
                        <reg orig="at-|tuned">attuned</reg>
                    <lb/> to melancholy. I dwelt, with an obstinacy for which <lb/> I could not
                    account, on the idea of his death. I painted to <lb/> myself his struggles with
                    the billows, and his last <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg>. <lb/> I
                    imagined myself a midnight wanderer on the shore, <lb/>
                    <pb n="95" entity="eaf033v1_0136" pid="uva-lib:349166"/> and to have stumbled on
                    his corpse, which the tide had cast <lb/> up. These dreary images affected me
                    even to tears. I <lb/> endeavored not to restrain them. They imparted a relief
                    <lb/> which I had not anticipated. The more copiously they <lb/> flowed, the
                    more did my general sensations appear to <reg orig="sub-|side">subside</reg>
                    <lb/> into calm, and a certain restlessness give way to repose.</p>
                <p>Perhaps, relieved by this effusion, the slumber so much <lb/> wanted might have
                    stolen on my senses, had there been no <lb/> new cause of alarm.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">I was</hi> aroused from this stupor by sounds that
                    evidently <lb/> arose in the next chamber. Was it possible that I had <lb/> been
                    mistaken in the figure which I had seen on the bank? <lb/> or had Carwin, by
                    some inscrutable means, penetrated once <lb/> more into this chamber? The
                    opposite door opened; <reg orig="foot-|steps">footsteps</reg>
                    <lb/> came forth, and the person, advancing to mine, <lb/> knocked.</p>
                <p>So unexpected an incident robbed me of all presence of <lb/> mind, and starting
                    up, I involuntarily exclaimed, "Who is <lb/> there?" An answer was immediately
                    given. The voice, <lb/> to my inexpressible astonishment, was Pleyel's.</p>
                <p>"It is I. Have you risen? If you have not, make haste; <lb/> I want three minutes
                    conversation with you in the parlor&mdash;I <lb/> will wait for you there."
                    Saying this he retired from the <lb/> door.</p>
                <p>Should I confide in the testimony of my ears? If that were <lb/> true, it was
                    Pleyel that had been hitherto immured in the <lb/> opposite chamber; he whom my
                    rueful fancy had depicted <lb/> in so many ruinous and ghastly shapes; he whose
                    footsteps <lb/> had been listened to with such inquietude! What is man, <lb/>
                    that knowledge is so sparingly conferred upon him! that his <lb/> heart should
                    be wrung with distress, and his frame be <reg orig="ex-|animated"
                        >exanimated</reg>
                    <lb/> with fear, though his safety be encompassed with <lb/> impregnable walls!
                    What are the bounds of human <reg orig="imbe-|cility">imbecility</reg>! <lb/> He
                    that warned me of the presence of my foe <reg orig="re-|fused">refused</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="96" entity="eaf033v1_0137" pid="uva-lib:349167"/> the intimation by which
                    so many racking fears would <lb/> have been precluded.</p>
                <p>Yet who would have imagined the arrival of Pleyel at <lb/> such an hour? His tone
                    was desponding and anxious. <lb/> Why this unseasonable summons? and why this
                    hasty <reg orig="de-|parture">departure</reg>? <lb/> Some tidings he, perhaps,
                    bears of mysterious <lb/> and unwelcome import.</p>
                <p>My impatience would not allow me to consume much <lb/> time in deliberation; I
                    hastened down. Pleyel I found <lb/> standing at a window, with eyes cast down as
                    in meditation, <lb/> and arms folded on his breast. Every line in his <reg
                        orig="counte-|nance">countenance</reg>
                    <lb/> was pregnant with sorrow. To this was added a <reg orig="cer-|tain"
                        >certain</reg>
                    <lb/> wanness and air of fatigue. The last time I had seen <lb/> him appearances
                    had been the reverse of these. I was <lb/> startled at the change. The first
                    impulse was to question <lb/> him as to the cause. This impulse was supplanted
                    by some <lb/> degree of confusion, flowing from a consciousness that <lb/> love
                    had too large, and, as it might prove, a perceptible <lb/> share in creating
                    this impulse. I was silent.</p>
                <p>Presently he raised his eyes and fixed them upon me. I <lb/> read in them an
                    anguish altogether ineffable. Never had I <lb/> witnessed a like demeanor in
                    Pleyel. Never, indeed, had <lb/> I observed a human countenance in which grief
                    was more <lb/> legibly inscribed. He seemed struggling for utterance; but <lb/>
                    his struggles being fruitless, he shook his head and turned <lb/> away from
                    me.</p>
                <p>My impatience would not allow me to be longer silent; <lb/> "What," said I, "for
                    heaven's sake, my friend, what is the <lb/> matter?"</p>
                <p>He started at the sound of my voice. His looks, for a <lb/> moment, became
                    convulsed with an emotion very different <lb/> from grief. His accents were
                    broken with rage.</p>
                <p>"The matter&mdash;O wretch!&mdash;thus exquisitely fashioned&mdash; <lb/> on whom
                    nature seemed to have exhausted all her graces; <lb/> with charms so awful and
                    so pure! how art thou fallen! <lb/> From what height fallen! A ruin so
                    complete&mdash;so unheard <lb/> of!"</p>
                <p>His words were again choked by emotion. Grief and <lb/> pity were again mingled
                    in his features. He resumed, in a <lb/> tone half suffocated by sobs:</p>

                <p>"But why should I upbraid thee? Could I restore to thee <lb/> what thou hast
                    lost; efface this cursed stain; snatch thee <lb/> from the jaws of this fiend; I
                    would do it. Yet what will <lb/> avail my efforts? I have not arms with which to
                    contend with <lb/> so consummate, so frightful a depravity.</p>
                <p>"Evidence less than this would only have excited <reg orig="resent-|ment"
                        >resentment</reg>
                    <lb/> and scorn. The wretch who should have breathed a <lb/> suspicion injurious
                    to thy honor, would have been <reg orig="regard-|ed">regarded</reg>
                    <lb/> without anger; not hatred or envy could have prompted <lb/> him; it would
                    merely be an argument of madness. That <lb/> my eyes, that my ears, should bear
                    witness to thy fall! By <lb/> no other way could detestable conviction be
                    imparted.</p>
                <p>"Why do I summon thee to this conference? Why <reg orig="ex-|pose">expose</reg>
                    <lb/> myself to thy derision? Here admonition and entreaty <lb/> are vain. Thou
                    knowest him already, for a murderer and <lb/> thief. I had thought to have been
                    the first to disclose to thee <lb/> his infamy; to have warned thee of the pit
                    to which thou <lb/> art hastening; but thy eyes are open in vain. O foul and

                <p>"There is but one path. I know you will disappear <reg orig="to-|gether"

                        >instantly</reg>
                    <lb/> from this spot, if he desires to avoid the fate which <lb/> menaced him in

                <p>"And wilt thou not stay behind?&mdash;But shame upon my <lb/> weakness. I know
                    not what I would say. I have done <lb/> what I purposed. To stay longer, to

                    grovelling, <lb/> and atrocious character of the wretch to whom thou hast <lb/>

                    cankered? O most <lb/> specious, and most profligate of women!"</p>
                <p>Saying this, he rushed out of the house. I saw him in a <lb/>
                    <pb n="98" entity="eaf033v1_0139" pid="uva-lib:349169"/> few moments hurrying
                    along the path which led to my <reg orig="broth-|er's">brother's</reg>. <lb/> I
                    had no power to prevent his going, or to recall, or to <lb/> follow him. The
                    accents I had heard were calculated to <lb/> confound and bewilder. I looked
                    around me to assure <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg>
                    <lb/> that the scene was real. I moved that I might banish <lb/> the doubt that
                    I was awake. Such enormous imputations <lb/> from the mouth of Pleyel! To be
                    stigmatized with the <lb/> names of wanton and profligate! To be charged with
                    the <lb/> sacrifice of honor! with midnight meetings with a wretch <lb/> known
                    to be a murderer and thief! with an intention to fly <lb/> in his company!</p>
                <p>What I had heard was surely the dictate of frenzy, or <lb/> it was built upon
                    some fatal, some incomprehensible mistake. <lb/> After the horrors of the night;
                    after undergoing perils so <lb/> imminent from this man, to be summoned to an
                    interview <lb/> like this; to find Pleyel fraught with a belief that, instead of
                    <lb/> having chosen death as a refuge from the violence of this <lb/> man, I had
                    hugged his baseness to my heart, had sacrificed <lb/> for him my purity, my
                    spotless name, my friendships, and <lb/> my fortune! That even madness could
                    engender accusations <lb/> like these was not to be believed.</p>
                <p>What evidence could possibly suggest conceptions so wild? <lb/> After the
                    unlooked for interview with Carwin in my <reg orig="cham-|ber">chamber</reg>,
                    <lb/> he retired. Could Pleyel have observed his exit? It <lb/> was not long
                    after that Pleyel himself entered. Did he <lb/> build on this incident, his
                    odious conclusions? Could the <lb/> long series of my actions and sentiments
                    grant me no <reg orig="exemp-|tion">exemption</reg>
                    <lb/> from suspicions so foul? Was it not more rational to <reg orig="in-|fer"
                        >infer</reg>
                    <lb/> that Carwin's designs had been illicit; that my life had <lb/> been
                    endangered by the fury of one whom, by some means, <lb/> he had discovered to be
                    an assassin and robber; that my <lb/> honor had been assailed, not by
                    blandishments, but by <reg orig="vio-|lence">violence</reg>?</p>
                <p>He has judged me without hearing. He has drawn from <lb/> dubious appearances,
                    conclusions the most improbable and <lb/> unjust. He has loaded me with all
                    outrageous epithets. <lb/> He has ranked me with prostitutes and thieves. I
                    cannot <lb/> pardon thee, Pleyel, for this injustice. Thy understanding <lb/>
                    must be hurt. If it be not, if thy conduct was sober and <lb/>
                    <pb n="99" entity="eaf033v1_0140" pid="uva-lib:349170"/> deliberate, I can never
                    forgive an outrage so unmanly, and <lb/> so gross.</p>
                <p>These thoughts gradually gave place to others. Pleyel <lb/> was possessed by some
                    momentary frenzy; appearances <lb/> had led him into palpable errors. Whence
                    could his <reg orig="saga-|city">sagacity</reg>
                    <lb/> have contracted this blindness? Was it not love? <reg orig="Pre-|viously"
                        >Previously</reg>
                    <lb/> assured of my affection for Carwin, distracted with <lb/> grief and
                    jealousy, and impelled hither at that late hour by <lb/> some unknown
                    instigation, his imagination transformed <reg orig="sha-|dows">shadows</reg>
                    <lb/> into monsters, and plunged him into these deplorable <lb/> errors.</p>
                <p>This idea was not unattended with consolation. My soul <lb/> was divided between
                    indignation at his injustice, and delight <lb/> on account of the source from
                    which I conceived it to spring. <lb/> For a long time they would allow admission
                    to no other <lb/> thoughts. Surprise is an emotion that enfeebles, not <reg
                        orig="in-|vigorates">invigorates</reg>. <lb/> All my meditations were
                    accompanied with <reg orig="won-|der">wonder</reg>. <lb/> I rambled with
                    vagueness, or clung to one image with <lb/> an obstinacy which sufficiently
                    testified the maddening <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg>
                    <lb/> of late transactions.</p>
                <p>Gradually I proceeded to reflect upon the consequences <lb/> of Pleyel's mistake,
                    and on the measures I should take to <lb/> guard myself against future injury
                    from Carwin. Should I <lb/> suffer this mistake to be detected by time? When his
                        <reg orig="pas-|sion">passion</reg>
                    <lb/> should subside, would he not perceive the flagrancy of <lb/> his
                    injustice, and hasten to atone for it? Did it not become <lb/> my character to
                    testify resentment for language and <reg orig="treat-|ment">treatment</reg>
                    <lb/> so opprobrious? Wrapt up in the consciousness of <reg orig="in-|nocence"
                        >innocence</reg>, <lb/> and confiding in the influence of time and <reg
                        orig="reflec-|tion">reflection</reg>
                    <lb/> to confute so groundless a charge, it was my province to <lb/> be passive
                    and silent.</p>
                <p>As to the violences meditated by Carwin, and the means <lb/> of eluding them, the
                    path to be taken by me was obvious. I <lb/> resolved to tell the tale to my
                    brother, and regulate myself by <lb/> his advice. For this end, when the morning
                    was somewhat <lb/> advanced, I took the way to his house. My sister was <reg
                        orig="en-|gaged">engaged</reg>
                    <lb/> in her customary occupations. As soon as I <reg orig="appear-|ed"
                        >appeared</reg>, <lb/> she remarked a change in my looks. I was not willing
                    <lb/> to alarm her by the information which I had to communicate. <lb/> Her
                    health was in that condition which rendered a <reg orig="disas-|trous"
                        >disastrous</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="100" entity="eaf033v1_0141" pid="uva-lib:349171"/> tale particularly
                    unsuitable. I forebore a direct <reg orig="an-|swer">answer</reg>
                    <lb/> to her inquiries, and inquired, in my turn, for Wieland.</p>
                <p>"Why," said she, "I suspect something mysterious and <lb/> unpleasant has
                    happened this morning. Scarcely had we <lb/> risen when Pleyel dropped among us.
                    What could have <lb/> prompted him to make us so early and so unseasonable a
                    <lb/> visit I cannot tell. To judge from the disorder of his dress, <lb/> and
                    his countenance, something of an extraordinary nature <lb/> has occurred. He
                    permitted me merely to know that he <lb/> had slept none, nor even undressed,
                    during the past night. <lb/> He took your brother to walk with him. Some topic
                    must <lb/> have deeply engaged them, for Wieland did not return till <lb/> the
                    breakfast hour was passed, and returned alone. His <lb/> disturbance was
                    excessive; but he would not listen to my <lb/> importunities, or tell me what
                    had happened. I gathered <lb/> from hints which he let fall, that your situation
                    was, in some <lb/> way, the cause; yet he assured me that you were at your <lb/>
                    own house, alive, in good health, and in perfect safety. He <lb/> scarcely ate a
                    morsel, and immediately after breakfast went <lb/> out again. He would not
                    inform me whither he was going, <lb/> but mentioned that he probably might not
                    return before <lb/> night."</p>
                <p>I was equally astonished and alarmed by this information. <lb/> Pleyel had told
                    his tale to my brother, and had, by a <reg orig="plausi-|ble">plausible</reg>
                    <lb/> and exaggerated picture, instilled into him unfavorable <lb/> thoughts of
                    me. Yet would not the more correct judgment <lb/> of Wieland perceive and expose
                    the fallacy of his <reg orig="conclu-|sions">conclusions</reg>? <lb/> Perhaps
                    his uneasiness might arise from some insight <lb/> into the character of Carwin,
                    and from apprehensions for <lb/> my safety. The appearances by which Pleyel had
                    been <lb/> misled, might induce him likewise to believe that I <reg
                        orig="enter-|tained">entertained</reg>
                    <lb/> an indiscreet, though not dishonorable affection for <lb/> Carwin. Such
                    were the conjectures rapidly formed. I was <lb/> inexpressibly anxious to change
                    them into certainty. For <lb/> this end an interview with my brother was
                    desirable. He <lb/> was gone, no one knew whither, and was not expected <lb/>
                    speedily to return. I had no clue by which to trace his <lb/> footsteps.</p>
                <p>My anxieties could not be concealed from my sister. <lb/> They heightened her
                    solicitude to be acquainted with the <lb/>
                    <pb n="101" entity="eaf033v1_0142" pid="uva-lib:349172"/> cause. There were many
                    reasons persuading me to silence; <lb/> at least, till I had seen my brother, it
                    would be an act of <reg orig="in-|excusable">inexcusable</reg>
                    <lb/> temerity to unfold what had lately passed. No <lb/> other expedient for
                    eluding her importunities occurred to me, <lb/> but that of returning to my own
                    house. I recollected my <lb/> determination to become a tenant of this roof. I
                    mentioned <lb/> it to her. She joyfully acceded to this proposal, and <reg
                        orig="suffer-|ed">suffered</reg>
                    <lb/> me with less reluctance, to depart, when I told her that <lb/> it was with
                    a view to collect and send to my new dwelling <lb/> what articles would be
                    immediately useful to me.</p>
                <p>Once more I returned to the house which had been the <lb/> scene of so much
                    turbulence and danger. I was at no great <lb/> distance from it when I observed
                    my brother coming out. <lb/> On seeing me he stopped, and after ascertaining, as
                    it seemed, <lb/> which way I was going, he returned into the house before <lb/>
                    me. I sincerely rejoiced at this event, and I hastened to set <lb/> things, if
                    possible, on their right footing.</p>
                <p>His brow was by no means expressive of those vehement <lb/> emotions with which
                    Pleyel had been agitated. I drew a <lb/> favorable omen from this circumstance.
                    Without delay I <lb/> began the conversation.</p>
                <p>"I have been to look for you," said I, "but was told by <lb/> Catharine that
                    Pleyel had engaged you on some important <lb/> and disagreeable affair. Before
                    his interview with you he <lb/> spent a few minutes with me. These minutes he
                    employed <lb/> in upbraiding me for crimes and intentions with which I am <lb/>
                    by no means chargeable. I believe him to have taken up <lb/> his opinions on
                    very insufficient grounds. His behaviour <lb/> was in the highest degree
                    precipitate and unjust, and, until <lb/> I receive some atonement, I shall treat
                    him, in my turn, with <lb/> that contempt which he justly merits; meanwhile I am
                        <reg orig="fear-|ful">fearful</reg>
                    <lb/> that he has prejudiced my brother against me. That is <lb/> an evil which
                    I most anxiously deprecate, and which I shall <lb/> indeed exert myself to
                    remove. Has he made me the <reg orig="sub-|ject">subject</reg>
                    <lb/> of this morning's conversation?"</p>
                <p>My brother's countenance testified no surprise at my <reg orig="ad-|dress"
                        >address</reg>. <lb/> The benignity of his looks were no wise
                    diminished.</p>
                <p>"It is true," said he, "your conduct was the subject of <lb/> our discourse. I am
                    your friend, as well as your brother. <lb/> There is no human being whom I love
                    with more tenderness, <lb/>
                    <pb n="102" entity="eaf033v1_0143" pid="uva-lib:349173"/> and whose welfare is
                    nearer my heart. Judge then with <lb/> what emotions I listened to Pleyel's
                    story. I expect and <lb/> desire you to vindicate yourself from aspersions so
                    foul, if <lb/> vindication be possible."</p>
                <p>The tone with which he uttered the last words affected <lb/> me deeply. "If
                    vindication be possible!" repeated I. <lb/> "From what you know, do you deem a
                    formal vindication <lb/> necessary? Can you harbor for a moment the belief of my
                    <lb/> guilt?"</p>
                <p>He shook his head with an air of acute anguish. "I <lb/> have struggled," said
                    he, "to dismiss that belief. You <lb/> speak before a judge who will profit by
                    any pretence to <reg orig="ac-|quit">acquit</reg>
                    <lb/> you; who is ready to question his own senses when they <lb/> plead against
                    you."</p>
                <p>These words incited a new set of thoughts in my mind. <lb/> I began to suspect
                    that Pleyel had built his accusations on <lb/> some foundation unknown to me. "I
                    may be a stranger to <lb/> the grounds of your belief. Pleyel loaded me with
                        <reg orig="inde-|cent">indecent</reg>
                    <lb/> and virulent invectives, but he withheld from me the <lb/> facts that
                    generated his suspicions. Events took place last <lb/> night of which some of
                    the circumstances were of an <reg orig="am-|biguous">ambiguous</reg>
                    <lb/> nature. I conceived that these might possibly have <lb/> fallen under his
                    cognizance, and that, viewed through the <lb/> mists of prejudice and passion,
                    they supplied a pretence for <lb/> his conduct, but believed that your more
                    unbiassed <reg orig="judg-|ment">judgment</reg>
                    <lb/> would estimate them at their just value. Perhaps his <lb/> tale has been
                    different from what I suspect it to be. Listen <lb/> then to my narrative. If
                    there be any thing in his story <lb/> inconsistent with mine, his story is
                    false."</p>
                <p>I then proceeded to a circumstantial relation of the <reg orig="inci-|dents"
                        >incidents</reg>
                    <lb/> of the last night. Wieland listened with deep <reg orig="atten-|tion"
                        >attention</reg>. <lb/> Having finished, "This," continued I, "is the truth;
                    <lb/> you see in what circumstances an interview took place <reg
                        orig="be-|tween">between</reg>
                    <lb/> Carwin and me. He remained for hours in my <reg orig="clo-|set"
                        >closet</reg>, <lb/> and for some minutes in my chamber. He departed <lb/>
                    without haste or interruption. If Pleyel marked him as he <lb/> left the house,
                    and it is not impossible that he did, inferences <lb/> injurious to my character
                    might suggest themselves to <lb/> him. In admitting them, he gave proofs of less
                        <reg orig="discern-|ment">discernment</reg>
                    <lb/> and less candor than I once ascribed to him."</p>
                <pb n="103" entity="eaf033v1_0144" pid="uva-lib:349174"/>
                <p>"His proofs," said Wieland, after a considerable pause, <lb/> "are different.
                    That he should be deceived, is not <reg orig="possi-|ble">possible</reg>. <lb/>
                    That he himself is not the deceiver, could not be <reg orig="be-|lieved"
                        >believed</reg>, <lb/> if his testimony were not inconsistent with yours;
                    but <lb/> the doubts which I entertained are now removed. Your <lb/> tale, some
                    parts of it, is marvellous; the voice which <reg orig="ex-|claimed"
                        >exclaimed</reg>
                    <lb/> against your rashness in approaching the closet, <lb/> your persisting,
                    notwithstanding that prohibition, your belief <lb/> that I was the ruffian, and
                    your subsequent conduct, are <reg orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg>
                    <lb/> by me, because I have known you from childhood, <lb/> because a thousand
                    instances have attested your veracity, <lb/> and because nothing less than my
                    own hearing and vision <lb/> would convince me, in opposition to her own
                    assertions, that <lb/> my sister had fallen into wickedness like this."</p>
                <p>I threw my arms around him, and bathed his cheek with <lb/> my tears. "That,"
                    said I, "is spoken like my brother. <lb/> But what are the proofs?"</p>
                <p>He replied&mdash;"Pleyel informed me that, in going to your <lb/> house, his
                    attention was attracted by two voices. The <lb/> persons speaking sat beneath
                    the bank out of sight. These <lb/> persons, judging by their voices, were Carwin
                    and you. I <lb/> will not repeat the dialogue. If my sister was the female,
                    <lb/> Pleyel was justified in concluding you to be, indeed, one <lb/> of the
                    most profligate of women. Hence, his accusations <lb/> of you, and his efforts
                    to obtain my concurrence to a plan <lb/> by which an eternal separation should
                    be brought about <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg>
                    <lb/> my sister and this man."</p>
                <p>I made Wieland repeat this recital. Here, indeed, was <lb/> a tale to fill me
                    with terrible foreboding. I had vainly thought <lb/> that my safety could be
                    sufficiently secured by doors and <lb/> bars, but this is a foe from whose grasp
                    no power of divinity <lb/> can save me! His artifices will ever lay my fame and
                        <reg orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg>
                    <lb/> at his mercy. How shall I counterwork his plots, or <lb/> detect his
                    coadjutor? He has taught some vile and <reg orig="aban-|doned">abandoned</reg>
                    <lb/> female to mimic my voice. Pleyel's ears were the <lb/> witnesses of my
                    dishonor. This is the midnight assignation <lb/> to which he alluded. Thus is
                    the silence he maintained when <lb/> attempting to open the door of my chamber,
                    accounted for. <lb/> He supposed me absent, and meant, perhaps, had my <lb/>
                    <pb n="104" entity="eaf033v1_0145" pid="uva-lib:349175"/> apartment been
                    accessible, to leave in it some accusing <reg orig="me-|morial"
                    >memorial</reg>.</p>
                <p>Pleyel was no longer equally culpable. The sincerity of <lb/> his anguish, the
                    depth of his despair, I remembered with <lb/> some tendencies to gratitude. Yet
                    was he not precipitate? <lb/> Was the conjecture that my part was played by some
                    mimic <lb/> so utterly untenable? Instances of this faculty are common. <lb/>
                    The wickedness of Carwin must, in his opinion, have been <lb/> adequate to such
                    contrivances, and yet the supposition of <lb/> my guilt was adopted in
                    preference to that.</p>
                <p>But how was this error to be unveiled? What but my <lb/> own assertion had I to
                    throw in the balance against it? <lb/> Would this be permitted to outweigh the
                    testimony of his <lb/> senses? I had no witnesses to prove my existence in <reg
                        orig="ano-|ther">another</reg>
                    <lb/> place. The real events of that night are marvellous. <lb/> Few, to whom
                    they should be related, would scruple to <reg orig="dis-|credit">discredit</reg>
                    <lb/> them. Pleyel is sceptical in a transcendent degree. <lb/> I cannot summon
                    Carwin to my bar, and make him the <lb/> attester of my innocence, and the
                    accuser of himself.</p>
                <p>My brother saw and comprehended my distress. He <lb/> was unacquainted, however,
                    with the full extent of it. He <lb/> knew not by how many motives I was incited
                    to retrieve the <lb/> good opinion of Pleyel. He endeavored to console me. <lb/>
                    Some new event, he said, would occur to disentangle the <lb/> maze. He did not
                    question the influence of my eloquence, <lb/> if I thought proper to exert it.
                    Why not seek an interview <lb/> with Pleyel, and exact from him a minute
                    relation, in which <lb/> something may be met with serving to destroy the <reg
                        orig="proba-|bility">probability</reg>
                    <lb/> of the whole?</p>
                <p>I caught, with eagerness, at this hope; but my alacrity <lb/> was damped by new
                    reflections. Should I, perfect in this <lb/> respect, and unblemished as I was,
                    thrust myself, uncalled, <lb/> into his presence, and make my felicity depend
                    upon his <lb/> arbitrary verdict?</p>
                <p>"If you choose to seek an interview," continued Wieland, <lb/> "you must make
                    haste, for Pleyel informed me of his <lb/> intention to set out this evening or
                    tomorrow on a long <lb/> journey."</p>
                <p>No intelligence was less expected or less welcome than <lb/> this. I had thrown
                    myself in a window seat; but now, <lb/>
                    <pb n="105" entity="eaf033v1_0146" pid="uva-lib:349176">
                        <fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">12</fw>
                    </pb> starting on my feet, I exclaimed, "Good heavens! what is <lb/> it you say?
                    a journey? whither? when?"</p>
                <p>"I cannot say whither. It is a sudden resolution, I <reg orig="be-|lieve"
                        >believe</reg>. <lb/> I did not hear of it till this morning. He promises
                    <lb/> to write to me as soon as he is settled."</p>
                <p>I needed no further information as to the cause and issue <lb/> of this journey.
                    The scheme of happiness to which he had <lb/> devoted his thoughts, was blasted
                    by the discovery of last <lb/> night. My preference of another, and my
                    unworthiness to <lb/> be any longer the object of his adoration, were evinced by
                    <lb/> the same act, and in the same moment. The thought of <lb/> utter
                    desertion, a desertion originating in such a cause, was <lb/> the prelude to
                    distraction. That Pleyel should abandon me <lb/> forever, because I was blind to
                    his excellence, because I <lb/> coveted pollution, and wedded infamy, when, on
                    the <reg orig="contra-|ry">contrary</reg>, <lb/> my heart was the shrine of all
                    purity, and beat only for <lb/> his sake, was a destiny which, as long as my
                    life was in my <lb/> own hands, I would by no means consent to endure.</p>
                <p>I remembered that this evil was still preventable; that <lb/> this fatal journey
                    it was still in my power to procrastinate, <lb/> or, perhaps, to occasion it to
                    be laid aside. There were no <lb/> impediments to a visit; I only dreaded lest
                    the interview <lb/> should be too long delayed. My brother befriended my <reg
                        orig="im-|patience">impatience</reg>, <lb/> and readily consented to furnish
                    me with a chaise <lb/> and servant to attend me. My purpose was to go <reg
                        orig="immedi-|ately">immediately</reg>
                    <lb/> to Pleyel's farm, where his engagements usually <reg orig="de-|tained"
                        >detained</reg>
                    <lb/> him during the day.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">My</hi> way lay through the city. I had scarcely entered it
                    <lb/> when I was seized with a general sensation of sickness. <lb/> Every object
                    grew dim, and swam before my sight. It <lb/> was with difficulty I prevented
                    myself from sinking to the <lb/> bottom of the carriage. I ordered myself to be
                    carried to <lb/> Mrs. Baynton's, in hope that an interval of repose would <reg
                        orig="in-|vigorate">invigorate</reg>
                    <lb/> and refresh me. My distracted thoughts would <lb/>
                    <pb n="106" entity="eaf033v1_0147" pid="uva-lib:349177"/> allow me but little
                    rest. Growing somewhat better in the <lb/> afternoon, I resumed my journey.</p>
                <p>My contemplations were limited to a few objects. I <reg orig="re-|garded"
                        >regarded</reg>
                    <lb/> my success, in the purpose which I had in view, as <lb/> considerably
                    doubtful. I depended, in some degree, on the <lb/> suggestions of the moment,
                    and on the materials which <lb/> Pleyel himself should furnish me. When I
                    reflected on the <lb/> nature of the accusation, I burned with disdain. Would
                    <lb/> not truth, and the consciousness of innocence, render me <lb/> triumphant?
                    Should I not cast from me, with irresistible <lb/> force, such atrocious
                    imputations?</p>
                <p>What an entire and mournful change has been effected <lb/> in a few hours! The
                    gulf that separates man from insects <lb/> is not wider than that which severs
                    the polluted from the <lb/> chaste among women. Yesterday and to day I am the
                    same. <lb/> There is a degree of depravity to which it is impossible for <lb/>
                    me to sink; yet, in the apprehension of another, my ancient <lb/> and intimate
                    associate, the perpetual witness of my actions, <lb/> and partaker of my
                    thoughts, I had ceased to be the same. <lb/> My integrity was tarnished and
                    withered in his eyes. I <lb/> was the colleague of a murderer, and the paramour
                    of a <lb/> thief!</p>
                <p>His opinion was not destitute of evidence; yet what <lb/> proofs could reasonably
                    avail to establish an opinion like <lb/> this? If the sentiments corresponded
                    not with the voice that <lb/> was heard, the evidence was deficient; but this
                    want of <lb/> correspondence would have been supposed by me if I had <lb/> been
                    the auditor and Pleyel the criminal. But mimicry <lb/> might still more
                    plausibly have been employed to explain <lb/> the scene. Alas! it is the fate of
                    Clara Wieland to fall <lb/> into the hands of a precipitate and inexorable
                    judge.</p>
                <p>But what, O man of mischief! is the tendency of thy <lb/> thoughts? Frustrated in
                    thy first design, thou wilt not forego <lb/> the immolation of thy victim. To
                    exterminate my <reg orig="reputa-|tion">reputation</reg>
                    <lb/> was all that remained to thee, and this my guardian has <lb/> permitted.
                    To dispossess Pleyel of this prejudice may be <lb/> impossible; but if that be
                    effected, it cannot be supposed <lb/> that thy wiles are exhausted; thy cunning
                    will discover <reg orig="in-|numerable">innumerable</reg>
                    <lb/> avenues to the accomplishment of thy malignant <lb/> purpose.</p>
                <pb n="107" entity="eaf033v1_0148" pid="uva-lib:349178"/>
                <p>Why should I enter the lists against thee? Would to <lb/> heaven I could disarm
                    thy vengeance by my deprecations!</p>
                <p>When I think of all the resources with which nature and <lb/> education have
                    supplied thee; that thy form is a <reg orig="combina-|tion">combination</reg>
                    <lb/> of steely fibres and organs of exquisite ductility and <lb/> boundless
                    compass, actuated by an intelligence gifted with <lb/> infinite endowments, and
                    comprehending all knowledge, I <lb/> perceive that my doom is fixed. What
                    obstacle will be <lb/> able to divert thy zeal or repel thy efforts? That being
                    <lb/> who has hitherto protected me has borne testimony to the <lb/>
                    formidableness of thy attempts, since nothing less than <reg
                        orig="su-|pernatural">supernatural</reg>
                    <lb/> interference could check thy career.</p>
                <p>Musing on these thoughts, I arrived, towards the close of <lb/> the day, at
                    Pleyel's house. A month before, I had <reg orig="tra-|versed">traversed</reg>
                    <lb/> the same path; but how different were my sensations! <lb/> Now I was
                    seeking the presence of one who regarded me <lb/> as the most degenerate of
                    human kind. I was to plead the <lb/> cause of my innocence, against witnesses
                    the most explicit <lb/> and unerring, of those which support the fabric of human
                    <lb/> knowledge. The nearer I approached the crisis, the more <lb/> did my
                    confidence decay. When the chaise stopped at the <lb/> door, my strength refused
                    to support me, and I threw <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg>
                    <lb/> into the arms of an ancient female domestic. I had <lb/> not courage to
                    inquire whether her master was at home. I <lb/> was tormented with fears that
                    the projected journey was <reg orig="al-|ready">already</reg>
                    <lb/> undertaken. These fears were removed, by her <lb/> asking me whether she
                    should call her young master, who <lb/> had just gone into his own room. I was
                    somewhat revived <lb/> by this intelligence, and resolved immediately to seek
                    him <lb/> there.</p>
                <p>In my confusion of mind, I neglected to knock at the <lb/> door, but entered his
                    apartment without previous notice. <lb/> This abruptness was altogether
                    involuntary. Absorbed in <lb/> reflections of such unspeakable moment, I had no
                    leisure <lb/> to heed the niceties of punctilio. I discovered him <reg
                        orig="stand-|ing">standing</reg>
                    <lb/> with his back towards the entrance. A small trunk, with <lb/> its lid
                    raised, was before him, in which it seemed as if he <lb/> had been busy in
                    packing his clothes. The moment of my <lb/> entrance, he was employed in gazing
                    at something which <lb/> he held in his hand.</p>
                <pb n="108" entity="eaf033v1_0149" pid="uva-lib:349179"/>
                <p>I imagined that I fully comprehended this scene. The <lb/> image which he held
                    before him, and by which his <reg orig="at-|tention">attention</reg>
                    <lb/> was so deeply engaged, I doubted not to be my own. <lb/> These
                    preparations for his journey, the cause to which is <lb/> was to be imputed, the
                    hopelessness of success in the <reg orig="un-|dertaken">undertaken</reg>
                    <lb/> on which I had entered, rushed at once upon my <lb/> feelings, and
                    dissolved me into a flood of tears.</p>
                <p>Startled by this sound, he dropped the lid of the trunk <lb/> and turned. The
                    solemn sadness that previously overspread <lb/> his countenance, gave sudden way
                    to an attitude and look <lb/> of the most vehement astonishment. Perceiving me
                        <reg orig="una-|able">unaable</reg>
                    <lb/> to uphold myself, he stepped towards me without <lb/> speaking, and
                    supported me by his arm. The kindness of <lb/> this action called forth a new
                    effusion from my eyes. <lb/> Weeping was a solace to which, at that time, I had
                    not <lb/> grown familiar, and which, therefore, was peculiarly <reg
                        orig="de-|licious">delicious</reg>. <lb/> Indignation was no longer to be
                    read in the <reg orig="fea-|tures">features</reg>
                    <lb/> of my friend. They were pregnant with a mixture <lb/> of wonder and pity.
                    Their expression was easily <reg orig="inter-|preted">interpreted</reg>. <lb/>
                    This visit, and these tears, were tokens of my <lb/> penitence. The wretch whom
                    he had stigmatized as <reg orig="in-|curably">incurably</reg>
                    <lb/> and obdurately wicked, now shewed herself <reg orig="sus-|ceptible"
                        >susceptible</reg>
                    <lb/> of remorse, and had come to confess her guilt.</p>
                <p>This persuasion had no tendency to comfort me. It only <lb/> shewed me, with new
                    evidence, the difficulty of the task <lb/> which I had assigned myself. We were
                    mutually silent. I <lb/> had less power and less inclination than ever to speak.
                    I <lb/> extricated myself from his hold, and threw myself on a <lb/> sofa. He
                    placed himself by my side, and appeared to <lb/> wait with impatience and
                    anxiety for some beginning of the <lb/> conversation. What could I say? If my
                    mind had <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg>
                    <lb/> any thing suitable to the occasion, my utterance was <lb/> suffocated by
                    tears.</p>
                <p>Frequently he attempted to speak, but seemed deterred <lb/> by some degree of
                    uncertainty as to the true nature of the <lb/> scene. At length, in faltering
                    accents he spoke.</p>
                <p>"My friend! would to heaven I were still permitted to <lb/> call you by that
                    name. The image that I once adored <reg orig="ex-|isted">existed</reg>
                    <lb/> only in my fancy; but though I cannot hope to see it <lb/> realized, you
                    may not be totally insensible to the horrors of <lb/>

                    </pb> that gulf into which you are about to plunge. What heart <lb/> is forever
                    exempt from the goadings of compunction and <lb/> the influx of laudable
                    propensities?</p>
                <p>"I thought you accomplished and wise beyond the rest <lb/> of women. Not a
                    sentiment you uttered, not a look you <lb/> assumed, that were not, in my
                    apprehension, fraught with <lb/> the sublimities of rectitude and the
                    illuminations of genius. <lb/> Deceit has some bounds. Your education could not
                    be <lb/> without influence. A vigorous understanding cannot be <lb/> utterly
                    devoid of virtue; but you could not counterfeit the <lb/> powers of invention
                    and reasoning. I was rash in my <reg orig="in-|vectives">invectives</reg>. <lb/>
                    I will not, but with life, relinquish all hopes <lb/> of you. I will shut out
                    every proof that would tell me that <lb/> your heart is incurably diseased.</p>
                <p>"You come to restore me once more to happiness; to <lb/> convince me that you
                    have torn her mask from vice, and <lb/> feel nothing but abhorrence for the part
                    you have hitherto <lb/> acted."</p>
                <p>At these words my equanimity forsook me. For a <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg>
                    <lb/> I forgot the evidence from which Pleyel's opinions <lb/> were derived, the
                    benevolence of his remonstrances, and <lb/> the grief which his accents bespoke;
                    I was filled with <reg orig="in-|dignation">indignation</reg>
                    <lb/> and horror at charges so black; I shrunk back <lb/> and darted at him a
                    look of disdain and anger. My <reg orig="pas-|sion">passion</reg>
                    <lb/> supplied me with words.</p>
                <p>"What detestable infatuation was it that led me hither! <lb/> Why do I patiently
                    endure these horrible insults! My <reg orig="of-|fences">offences</reg>
                    <lb/> exist only in your own distempered imagination; <lb/> you are leagued with
                    the traitor who assailed my life; you <lb/> have vowed the destruction of my
                    peace and honor. I <reg orig="de-|serve">deserve</reg>
                    <lb/> infamy for listening to calumnies so base!"</p>
                <p>These words were heard by Pleyel without visible <reg orig="re-|sentment"
                        >resentment</reg>. <lb/> His countenance relapsed into its former gloom;
                    <lb/> but he did not even look at me. The ideas which had <lb/> given place to
                    my angry emotions returned, and once more <lb/> melted me into tears. "O!" I
                    exclaimed, in a voice <reg orig="bro-|ken">broken</reg>
                    <lb/> by sobs, "what a task is mine!" Compelled to <reg orig="heark-|en"
                        >hearken</reg>
                    <lb/> to charges which I feel to be false, but which I know <lb/> to be believed

                    <pb n="110" entity="eaf033v1_0151" pid="uva-lib:349181"/> without evidence,
                    which, though fallacious, is not <reg orig="unplau-|sible"
                    >unplausible</reg>.</p>
                <p>"I came hither not to confess, but to vindicate. I know <lb/> the source of your
                    opinions. Wieland has informed <lb/> me on what your suspicions are built. These
                    suspicions <lb/> are fostered by you as certainties; the tenor of my life, of
                    <lb/> all my conversations and letters, affords me no security; <lb/> every
                    sentiment that my tongue and my pen have uttered, <lb/> bear testimony to the
                    rectitude of my mind; but this <reg orig="testi-|mony">testimony</reg>
                    <lb/> is rejected. I am condemned as brutally profligate; <lb/> I am classed
                    with the stupidly and sordidly wicked.</p>
                <p>"And where are the proofs that must justify so foul and <lb/> so improbable an
                    accusation? You have overheard a <reg orig="mid-|night">midnight</reg>
                    <lb/> conference. Voices have saluted your ear, in which <lb/> you imagine
                    yourself to have recognised mine, and that of <lb/> a detected villain. The
                    sentiments expressed were not <reg orig="al-|lowed">allowed</reg>
                    <lb/> to outweigh the casual or concerted resemblance of <lb/> voice. Sentiments
                    the reverse of all those whose influence <lb/> my former life had attested,
                    denoting a mind polluted by <lb/> grovelling vices, and entering into compact
                    with that of a <lb/> thief and a murderer. The nature of these sentiments did
                    <lb/> not enable you to detect the cheat, did not suggest to you <lb/> the
                    possibility that my voice had been counterfeited by <lb/> another.</p>
                <p>"You were precipitate and prone to condemn. Instead <lb/> of rushing on the
                    impostors, and comparing the evidence of <lb/> sight with that of hearing, you
                    stood aloof, or you fled. <lb/> My innocence would not now have stood in need of
                        <reg orig="vindi-|cation">vindication</reg>, <lb/> if this conduct had been
                    pursued. That you did <lb/> not pursue it, your present thoughts incontestably
                    prove. <lb/> Yet this conduct might surely have been expected from <lb/> Pleyel.
                    That he would not hastily impute the blackest of <lb/> crimes, that he would not
                    couple my name with infamy, and <lb/> cover me with ruin for inadequate or
                    slight reasons, might <lb/> reasonably have been expected." The sobs which <reg
                        orig="con-|vulsed">convulsed</reg>
                    <lb/> my bosom, would not suffer me to proceed.</p>
                <p>Pleyel was for a moment affected. He looked at me <lb/> with some expression of
                    doubt; but this quickly gave place <lb/> to a mournful solemnity. He fixed his
                    eyes on the floor as <lb/> in reverie, and spoke;</p>
                <pb n="111" entity="eaf033v1_0152" pid="uva-lib:349182"/>
                <p>"Two hours hence I am gone. Shall I carry away with <lb/> me the sorrow that is
                    now my guest? or shall that sorrow <lb/> be accumulated tenfold? What is she
                    that is now before <lb/> me? Shall every hour supply me with new proofs of a
                    <lb/> wickedness beyond example? Already I deem her the <lb/> most abandoned and
                    detestable of human creatures. Her <lb/> coming and her tears imparted a gleam
                    of hope, but that <lb/> gleam has vanished."</p>
                <p>He now fixed his eyes upon me, and every muscle in his <lb/> face trembled. His
                    tone was hollow and terrible&mdash;"Thou <lb/> knowest that I was a witness of
                    your interview, yet thou <lb/> comest hither to upbraid me for injustice! Thou
                    canst look <lb/> me in the face and say that I am deceived!&mdash;An <reg

                    <lb/> Providence has fashioned thee for some end. Thou <lb/> wilt live, no
                    doubt, to fulfil the purposes of thy Maker, if <lb/> he repent not of his
                    workmanship, and send not his <reg orig="ven-|geance">vengeance</reg>
                    <lb/> to exterminate thee, ere the measure of thy days be <lb/> full. Surely
                    nothing in the shape of man can vie with <lb/> thee!</p>
                <p>"But I thought I had stifled this fury. I am not <reg orig="consti-|tuted"
                        >constituted</reg>
                    <lb/> thy judge. My office is to pity and amend, and not <lb/> to punish and
                    revile. I deemed myself exempt from all <lb/> tempestuous passions. I had almost
                    persuaded myself to <lb/> weep over thy fall; but I am frail as dust, and
                    mutable as <lb/> water; I am calm, I am compassionate only in thy absence. <lb/>
                    Make this house, this room, thy abode as long as thou wilt, <lb/> but forgive me
                    if I prefer solitude for the short time during <lb/> which I shall stay." Saying
                    this, he motioned as if to leave <lb/> the apartment.</p>
                <p>The stormy passions of this man affected me by <reg orig="sympa-|thy"
                        >sympathy</reg>. <lb/> I ceased to weep. I was motionless and speechless
                    <lb/> with agony. I sat with my hands clasped, mutely gazing <lb/> after him as
                    he withdrew. I desired to detain him, but was <lb/> unable to make any effort
                    for that purpose, till he had <lb/> passed out of the room. I then uttered an
                    involuntary and <lb/> piercing cry&mdash;"Pleyel! Art thou gone? Gone
                    forever?"</p>
                <p>At this summons he hastily returned. He beheld me <lb/> wild, pale, gasping for
                    breath, and my head already sinking <lb/> on my bosom. A painful dizziness
                    seized me, and I fainted <lb/> away.</p>
                <pb n="112" entity="eaf033v1_0153" pid="uva-lib:349183"/>
                <p>When I recovered, I found myself stretched on a bed in <lb/> the outerrr
                    apartment, and Pleyel, with two female servants <lb/> standing beside it. All
                    the fury and scorn, which the <reg orig="coun-|tenance">countenance</reg>
                    <lb/> of the former lately expressed, had now <reg orig="disappear-|ed"
                        >disappeared</reg>, <lb/> and was succeeeeded by the most tender anxiety. As
                    <lb/> soon as he peeerccceiiived that my senses were returned t to me, <lb/> he
                    clasped his hands, and exclaimed, "God be thanked! <lb/> you are once more
                    alive. I had almost despaired of your <lb/>
                    <lb/> recovery. I fear I havee and unjust. My <lb/> senses must have been the
                    victims of some inexplicable and <lb/> momentary frenzy. Forgive me, I beseech
                    you, forgive my <lb/> reproaches. I would purchase conviction of your purity,
                    <lb/> at the price of my existence here and hereafter."</p>
                <p>He once more, in a tone of the most fervent tenderness, <lb/> besought me to be
                    composed, and then left me to the care <lb/> of the women.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Here</hi> was wrought a surprising change in my friend.
                    <lb/> What was it that had shaken conviction so firm? Had any <lb/> thing
                    occurred during my fit, adequate to produce so total <lb/> an alteration? My
                    attendants informed me that he had not <lb/> left my apartment; that the unusual
                    duration of my fit, and <lb/> the failure, for a time, of all the means used for
                    my <reg orig="reco-|very">recovery</reg>, <lb/> had filled him with grief and
                    dismay. Did he regard <lb/> the effect which his reproaches had produced as a
                    proof of <lb/> my sincerity?</p>
                <p>In this state of mind, I little regarded my languors of <lb/> body. I rose and
                    requested an interview with him before <lb/> my departure, on which I was
                    resolved, notwithstanding his <lb/> earnest solicitation to spend the night at
                    his house. He <lb/> complied with my request. The tenderness which he had <lb/>
                    lately betrayed, had now disappeared, and he once more <lb/> relapsed into a
                    chilling solemnity.</p>
                <p>I told him that I was preparing to return to my brother's; <lb/> that I had come
                    hither to vindicate my innocence from the <lb/>
                    <pb n="113" entity="eaf033v1_0154" pid="uva-lib:349184"/> foul aspersions which
                    he had cast upon it. My pride had <lb/> not taken refuge in silence or distance.
                    I had not relied <lb/> upon time, or the suggestions of his cooler thoughts, to
                        <reg orig="con-|fute">confute</reg>
                    <lb/> his charges. Conscious as I was that I was perfectly <lb/> guiltless, and
                    entertaining some value for his good opinion, <lb/> I could not prevail upon
                    myself to believe that my efforts to <lb/> make my innocence manifest, would be
                    fruitless. Adverse <lb/> appearances might be numerous and specious, but they
                    were <lb/> unquestionably false. I was willing to believe him sincere, <lb/>
                    that he made no charges which he himself did not believe; <lb/> but these
                    charges were destitute of truth. The grounds of <lb/> his opinion were
                    fallacious; and I desired an opportunity of <lb/> detecting their fallacy. I
                    entreated him to be explicit, and <lb/> to give me a detail of what he had
                    heard, and what he had <lb/> seen.</p>
                <p>At these words, my companion's countenance grew <lb/> darker. He appeared to be
                    struggling with his rage. He <lb/> opened his lips to speak, but his accents
                    died away ere they <lb/> were formed. This conflict lasted for some minutes, but
                    <lb/> his fortitude was finally successful. He spoke as follows:</p>
                <p>"I would fain put an end to this hateful scene; what I <lb/> shall say, will be
                    breath idly and unprofitably consumed. <lb/> The clearest narrative will add
                    nothing to your present <lb/> knowledge. You are acquainted with the grounds of
                    my <lb/> opinion, and yet you avow yourself innocent; why then <lb/> should I
                    rehearse these grounds? You are apprized of the <lb/> character of Carwin; why
                    then should I enumerate the <lb/> discoveries which I have made respecting him?
                    Yet, since <lb/> it is your request; since, considering the limitedness of <lb/>
                    human faculties, some error may possibly lurk in those <reg orig="ap-|pearances"
                        >appearances</reg>
                    <lb/> which I have witnessed, I will briefly relate what <lb/> I know.</p>
                <p>"Need I dwell upon the impressions which your <reg orig="conver-|sation"
                        >conversation</reg>
                    <lb/> and deportment originally made upon me? We <lb/> parted in childhood; but
                    our intercourse, by letter, was <lb/> copious and uninterrupted. How fondly did
                    I anticipate a <lb/> meeting with one whom her letters had previously taught
                    <lb/> me to consider as the first of women, and how fully realized <lb/> were
                    the expectations that I had formed!</p>
                <p>"Here, said I, is a being, after whom sages may model <lb/>
                    <pb n="114" entity="eaf033v1_0155" pid="uva-lib:349185"/> their transcendent
                    intelligence, and painters their ideal <lb/> beauty. Here is exemplified that
                    union between intellect <lb/> and form, which has hitherto existed only in the
                        <reg orig="concep-|tions">conceptions</reg>
                    <lb/> of the poet. I have watched your eyes; my <reg orig="atten-|tion"
                        >attention</reg>
                    <lb/> has hung upon your lips. I have questioned whether <lb/> the enchantments
                    of your voice were more conspicuous in <lb/> the intricacies of melody, or the
                    emphasis of rhetoric. I <lb/> have marked the transitions of your discourse, the
                    felicities <lb/> of your expression, your refined argumentation, and <reg
                        orig="glow-|ing">glowing</reg>
                    <lb/> imagery; and been forced to acknowledge, that all <reg orig="de-|lights"
                        >delights</reg>
                    <lb/> were meagre and contemptible, compared with those <lb/> connected with the
                    audience and sight of you. I have <lb/> contemplated your principles, and been
                    astonished at the <lb/> solidity of their foundation, and the perfection of
                    their <reg orig="struc-|ture">structure</reg>. <lb/> I have traced you to your
                    home. I have viewed you <lb/> in relation to your servants, to your family, to
                    your <reg orig="neigh-|bors">neighbors</reg>, <lb/> and to the world. I have
                    seen by what skilful <reg orig="ar-|rangements">arrangements</reg>
                    <lb/> you facilitate the performance of the most <lb/> arduous and complicated
                    duties; what daily accessions of <lb/> strength your judicious discipline
                    bestowed upon your <reg orig="mem-|ory">memory</reg>; <lb/> what correctness and
                    abundance of knowledge was <lb/> daily experienced by your unwearied application
                    to books, <lb/> and to writing. If she that possesses so much in the bloom <lb/>
                    of youth, will go on accumulating her stores, what, said I, <lb/> is the picture
                    she will display at a mature age?</p>
                <p>"You know not the accuracy of my observation. I was <lb/> desirous that others
                    should profit by an example so rare. I <lb/> therefore noted down, in writing,
                    every particular of your <lb/> conduct. I was anxious to benefit by an
                    opportunity so <lb/> seldom afforded us. I labored not to omit the slightest
                    <lb/> shade, or the most petty line in your portrait. Here there <lb/> was no
                    other task incumbent on me but to copy; there was <lb/> no need to exaggerate or
                    overlook, in order to produce a <lb/> more unexceptionable pattern. Here was a
                    combination of <lb/> harmonies and graces, incapable of diminution or accession
                    <lb/> without injury to its completeness.</p>
                <p>"I found no end and no bounds to my task. No display <lb/> of a scene like this
                    could be chargeable with redundancy or <lb/> superfluity. Even the color of a
                    shoe, the knot of a <reg orig="rib-|bon">ribbon</reg>, <lb/> or your attitude in
                    plucking a rose, were of moment <lb/>
                    <pb n="115" entity="eaf033v1_0156" pid="uva-lib:349186"/> to be recorded. Even
                    the arrangements of your <reg orig="breakfast-|table">breakfast-table</reg>
                    <lb/> and your toilet have been amply displayed.</p>
                <p>"I know that mankind are more easily enticed to virtue <lb/> by example than by
                    precept. I know that the absoluteness <lb/> of a model, when supplied by
                    invention, diminishes its <reg orig="salu-|tary">salutary</reg>
                    <lb/> influence, since it is useless, we think, to strive after <lb/> that which
                    we know to be beyond our reach. But the <reg orig="pic-|ture">picture</reg>
                    <lb/> which I drew was not a phantom; as a model, it was <lb/> devoid of
                    imperfection; and to aspire to that height which <lb/> had been really attained,
                    was by no means unreasonable. I <lb/> had another and more interesting object in
                    view. One <reg orig="ex-|isted">existed</reg>
                    <lb/> who claimed all my tenderness. Here, in all its parts, <lb/> was a model
                    worthy of assiduous study, and indefatigable <lb/> imitation. I called upon her,
                    as she wished to secure and <lb/> enhance my esteem, to mould her thoughts, her
                    words, her <lb/> countenance, her actions, by this pattern.</p>
                <p>"The task was exuberant of pleasure, and I was deeply <lb/> engaged in it, when
                    an imp of mischief was let loose in the <lb/> form of Carwin. I admired his
                    powers and <reg orig="accomplish-|ments">accomplishments</reg>. <lb/> I did not
                    wonder that they were admired by you. <lb/> On the rectitude of your judgment,
                    however, I relied to <lb/> keep this admiration within discreet and scrupulous
                    bounds. <lb/> I assured myself, that the strangeness of his deportment, <lb/>
                    and the obscurity of his life, would teach you caution. Of <lb/> all errors, my
                    knowledge of your character informed me that <lb/> this was least likely to
                    befall you.</p>
                <p>"You were powerfully affected by his first appearance; <lb/> you were bewitched
                    by his countenance and his tones; <lb/> your description was ardent and
                    pathetic; I listened to you <lb/> with some emotions of surprise. The portrait
                    you drew in <lb/> his absence, and the intensity with which you mused upon <lb/>
                    it, were new and unexpected incidents. They bespoke a <lb/> sensibility somewhat
                    too vivid; but from which, while <reg orig="sub-|jected">subjected</reg>
                    <lb/> to the guidance of an understanding like yours, there <lb/> was nothing to
                    dread.</p>
                <p>"A more direct intercourse took place between you. I <lb/> need not apologize for
                    the solicitude which I entertained for <lb/> your safety. He that gifted me with
                    perception of <reg orig="excel-|lence">excellence</reg>, <lb/> compelled me to
                    love it. In the midst of danger and <lb/> pain, my contemplations have ever been
                    cheered by your <lb/>
                    <pb n="116" entity="eaf033v1_0157" pid="uva-lib:349187"/> image. Every object in
                    competition with you, was <reg orig="worth-|less">worthless</reg>
                    <lb/> and triyial. No price was too great by which your <lb/> safety could be
                    purchased. For that end, the sacrifice of <lb/> ease, of health, and even of
                    life, would cheerfully have been <lb/> made by me. What wonder then, that I
                    scrutinized the <lb/> sentiments and deportment of this man with ceaseless <reg
                        orig="vigi-|lance">vigilance</reg>; <lb/> that I watched your words and your
                    looks when he <lb/> was present; and that I extracted cause for the deepest <reg
                        orig="in-|quietude">inquietude</reg>, <lb/> from every token which you gave
                    of having put <lb/> your happiness into this man's keeping?</p>
                <p>"I was cautious in deciding. I recalled the various <reg orig="con-|versations"
                        >conversations</reg>
                    <lb/> in which the topics of love and marriage had been <lb/> discussed. As a
                    woman, young, beautiful, and independent, <lb/> it behoved you to have fortified
                    your mind with just <reg orig="princi-|ples">principles</reg>
                    <lb/> on this subject. Your principles were eminently just. <lb/> Had not their
                    rectitude and their firmness been attested by <lb/> your treatment of that
                    specious seducer Dashwood? These <lb/> principles, I was prone to believe,
                    exempted you from <reg orig="dan-|ger">danger</reg>
                    <lb/> in this new state of things. I was not the last to pay <lb/> my homage to
                    the unrivalled capacity, insinuation, and <reg orig="elo-|quence"
                        >eloquence</reg>
                    <lb/> of this man. I have disguised, but could never <lb/> stifle the
                    conviction, that his eyes and voice had a <reg orig="witch-|craft"
                        >witchcraft</reg>
                    <lb/> in them, which rendered him truly formidable; but I <lb/> reflected on the
                    ambiguous expression of his countenance <lb/> &mdash;an ambiguity which you were
                    the first to remark; on the <lb/> cloud which obscured his character; and on the
                    suspicious <lb/> nature of that concealment which he studied; and <reg
                        orig="conclud-|ed">concluded</reg>
                    <lb/> you to be safe. I denied the obvious construction to <lb/> appearances. I
                    referred your conduct to some principle <lb/> which had not been hitherto
                    disclosed, but which was <reg orig="recon-|cilable">reconcilable</reg>
                    <lb/> with those already known.</p>
                <p>"I was not suffered to remain long in this suspense. <lb/> One evening, you may
                    recollect, I came to your house, <lb/> where it was my purpose, as usual, to
                    lodge, somewhat <reg orig="ear-|lier">earlier</reg>
                    <lb/> than ordinary. I spied a light in your chamber as I <lb/> approached from
                    the outside, and on inquiring of Judith, <lb/> was informed that you were
                    writing. As your kinsman and <lb/> friend, and fellow-lodger, I thought I had a
                    right to be <reg orig="fami-|liar">familiar</reg>. <lb/> You were in your
                    chamber, but your employment and <lb/> the time were such as to make it no
                    infraction of decorum <lb/>
                    <pb n="117" entity="eaf033v1_0158" pid="uva-lib:349188">
                        <fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">13</fw>
                    </pb> to follow you thither. The spirit of mischievous gaiety <reg
                        orig="pos-|sessed">possessed</reg>
                    <lb/> me. I proceeded on tiptoe. You did not perceive my <lb/> entrance; and I
                    advanced softly till I was able to overlook <lb/> your shoulder.</p>
                <p>"I had gone thus far in error, and had no power to <reg orig="re-|cede"
                        >recede</reg>. <lb/> How cautiously should we guard against the first <lb/>
                    inroads of temptation! I knew that to pry into your papers <lb/> was criminal;
                    but I reflected that no sentiment of yours <lb/> was of a nature which made it
                    your interest to conceal it. <lb/> You wrote much more than you permitted your
                    friends to <lb/> peruse. My curiosity was strong, and I had only to throw <lb/>
                    a glance upon the paper, to secure its gratification. I should <lb/> never have
                    deliberately committed an act like this. The <lb/> slightest obstacle would have
                    repelled me; but my eye glanced <lb/> almost spontaneously upon the paper. I
                    caught only parts of <lb/> sentences; but my eyes comprehended more at a glance,
                    <lb/> because the characters were short-hand. I lighted on the <lb/> words <hi
                        rend="italic">summer house, midnight,</hi> and made out a passage <lb/>
                    which spoke of the propriety and of the effects to be <reg orig="ex-|pected"
                        >expected</reg>
                    <lb/> from <hi rend="italic">another</hi> interview. All this passed in less
                    than <lb/> a moment. I then checked myself, and made myself known <lb/> to you,
                    by a tap upon your shoulder.</p>
                <p>"I could pardon and account for some trifling alarm; but <lb/> your trepidation
                    and blushes were excessive. You hurried <lb/> the paper out of sight, and seemed
                    too anxious to discover <lb/> whether I knew the contents to allow yourself to
                    make any <lb/> inquiries. I wondered at these appearances of <reg
                        orig="consterna-|tion">consternation</reg>, <lb/> but did not reason on them
                    until I had retired. When <lb/> alone, these incidents suggested themselves to
                    my reflections <lb/> anew.</p>
                <p>"To what scene, or what interview, I asked, did you <lb/> allude? Your
                    disappearance on a former evening, my <lb/> tracing you to the recess in the
                    bank, your silence on my <lb/> first and second call, your vague answers and
                    invincible <lb/> embarrassment, when you, at length, ascended the hill, I <lb/>
                    recollected with new surprise. Could this be the summer <lb/> house alluded to?
                    A certain timidity and consciousness <lb/> had generally attended you, when this
                    incident and this <reg orig="re-|cess">recess</reg>
                    <lb/> had been the subjects of conversation. Nay, I <reg orig="imagin-|ed"
                        >imagined</reg>
                    <lb/> that the last time that adventure was mentioned, which <lb/>
                    <pb n="118" entity="eaf033v1_0159" pid="uva-lib:349189"/> happened in the
                    presence of Carwin, the countenance of <lb/> the latter betrayed some emotion.
                    Could the interview <lb/> have been with him?</p>
                <p>"This was an idea calculated to rouse every faculty <lb/> to contemplation. An
                    interview at that hour, in this <reg orig="dark-|some">darksome</reg>
                    <lb/> retreat, with a man of his mysterious but <reg orig="formi-|dable"
                        >formidable</reg>
                    <lb/> character; a clandestine interview, and one which <lb/> you afterwards
                    endeavored with so much solicitude to <reg orig="con-|ceal">conceal</reg>! <lb/>
                    It was a fearful and portentous occurrence. I could <lb/> not measure his power,
                    or fathom his designs. Had he <lb/> rifled from you the secret of your love, and
                    reconciled you <lb/> to concealment and nocturnal meetings? I scarcely ever
                    <lb/> spent a night of more inquietude.</p>
                <p>"I knew not how to act. The ascertainment of this <lb/> man's character and views
                    seemed to be, in the first place, <lb/> necessary. Had he openly preferred his
                    suit to you, we <lb/> should have been empowered to make direct inquiries; but
                    <lb/> since he had chosen this obscure path, it seemed <reg orig="reasona-|ble"
                        >reasonable</reg>
                    <lb/> to infer that his character was exceptionable. It, at <lb/> least,
                    subjected us to the necessity of resorting to other <lb/> means of information.
                    Yet the improbability that you <lb/> should commit a deed of such rashness, made
                    me reflect <lb/> anew upon the insufficiency of those grounds on which my <lb/>
                    suspicions had been built, and almost to condemn myself <lb/> for harboring
                    them.</p>
                <p>"Though it was mere conjecture that the interview <lb/> spoken of had taken place
                    with Carwin, yet two ideas <reg orig="occur-|red">occurred</reg>
                    <lb/> to involve me in the most painful doubts. This man's <lb/> reasonings
                    might be so specious, and his artifices so <reg orig="pro-|found"
                    >profound</reg>, <lb/> that, aided by the passion which you had conceived <lb/>
                    for him, he had finally succeeded; or his situation might <lb/> be such as to
                    justify the secrecy which you maintained. In <lb/> neither case did my wildest
                    reveries suggest to me, that <lb/> your honor had been forfeited.</p>
                <p>"I could not talk with you on this subject. If the <reg orig="imputa-|tion"
                        >imputation</reg>
                    <lb/> was false, its atrociousness would have justly drawn <lb/> upon me your
                    resentment, and I must have explained by <lb/> what facts it had been suggested.
                    If it were true, no <reg orig="bene-|fit">benefit</reg>
                    <lb/> would follow from the mention of it. You had chosen <lb/> to conceal it
                    for some reasons, and whether these reasons <lb/>
                    <pb n="119" entity="eaf033v1_0160" pid="uva-lib:349190"/> were true or false, it
                    was proper to discover and remove <lb/> them in the first place. Finally, I
                    acquiesced in the least <lb/> painful supposition, trammelled as it was with
                    perplexities, <lb/> that Carwin was upright, and that, if the reasons of your
                    <lb/> silence were known, they would be found to be just.</p>

                <p>"<hi rend="small-caps">Three</hi> days have elapsed since this occurrence. I
                    <lb/> have been haunted by perpetual inquietude. To bring <lb/> myself to regard
                    Carwin without terror, and to acquiesce in <lb/> the belief of your safety, was
                    impossible. Yet to put an <lb/> end to my doubts, seemed to be impracticable. If
                    some <lb/> light could be reflected on the actual situation of this man, <lb/> a
                    direct path would present itself. If he were, contrary to <lb/> the tenor of his
                    conversation, cunning and malignant, to <lb/> apprize you of this, would be to
                    place you in security. If he <lb/> were merely unfortunate and innocent, most
                    readily would <lb/> I espouse his cause; and if his intentions were upright with
                    <lb/> regard to you, most eagerly would I sanctify your choice <lb/> by my
                    approbation.</p>
                <p>"It would be vain to call upon Carwin for an avowal of <lb/> his deeds. It was
                    better to know nothing, than to be <reg orig="de-|ceived">deceived</reg>
                    <lb/> by an artful tale. What he was unwilling to <reg orig="com-|municate"
                        >communicate</reg>, <lb/> and this unwillingness had been repeatedly <reg

                    him. Importunity <lb/> might be appeased, or imposture effected by fallacious

                    the world he was unknown. <lb/> I had often made him the subject of discourse;
                    but a <lb/> glimpse of his figure in the street was the sum of their <lb/>
                    knowledge who knew most. None had ever seen him <reg orig="be-|fore"
                        >before</reg>, <lb/> and received as new, the information which my <reg

                    <lb/> with him in Valencia, and my present intercourse, <lb/> enabled me to

                <p>"Wieland was your brother. If he had really made you <lb/> the object of his
                    courtship, was not a brother authorized to <lb/> interfere and demand from him
                    the confession of his views? <lb/>
                    <pb n="120" entity="eaf033v1_0161" pid="uva-lib:349191"/> Yet what were the

                    <lb/> Would they justify a measure like this? Surely <lb/> not.</p>
                <p>"In the course of my restless meditations, it occurred to <lb/> me, at length,
                    that my duty required me to speak to you, <lb/> to confess the indecorum of
                    which I had been guilty, and <lb/> to state the reflections to which it had led
                    me. I was <lb/> prompted by no mean or selfish views. The heart within <lb/> my
                    breast was not more precious than your safety; most <lb/> cheerfully would I
                    have interposed my life between you and <lb/> danger. Would you cherish
                    resentment at my conduct? <lb/> When acquainted with the motive which produced
                    it, it <lb/> would not only exempt me from censure, but entitle me to <lb/>
                    gratitude.</p>
                <p>"Yesterday had been selected for the rehearsal of the <lb/> newly imported
                    tragedy. I promised to be present. The <lb/> state of my thoughts but little
                    qualified me for a performer <lb/> or auditor in such a scene; but I reflected
                    that, after it was <lb/> finished, I should return home with you, and should
                    <lb/> then enjoy an opportunity of discoursing with you fully on <lb/> this
                    topic. My resolution was not formed without a <reg orig="rem-|nant"
                        >remnant</reg>
                    <lb/> of doubt, as to its propriety. When I left this house <lb/> to perform the
                    visit I had promised, my mind was full of <lb/> apprehension and despondency.
                    The dubiousness of the <lb/> event of our conversation, fear that my
                    interference was <lb/> too late to secure your peace, and the uncertainty to
                    which <lb/> hope gave birth, whether I had not erred in believing you <lb/>
                    devoted to this man, or, at least, in imagining that he had <lb/> obtained your
                    consent to midnight conferences, distracted <lb/> me with contradictory
                    opinions, and repugnant emotions.</p>
                <p>"I can assign no reason for calling at Mrs. Baynton's. I <lb/> had seen her in
                    the morning, and knew her to be well. <lb/> The concerted hour had nearly
                    arrived, and yet I turned up <lb/> the street which leads to her house, and
                    dismounted at her <lb/> door. I entered the parlor and threw myself in a chair.
                    I <lb/> saw and inquired for no one. My whole frame was <reg
                        orig="over-|powered">overpowered</reg>
                    <lb/> by dreary and comfortless sensations. One idea <lb/> possessed me wholly;
                    the inexpressible importance of <reg orig="un-|veiling">unveiling</reg>
                    <lb/> the designs and character of Carwin, and the utter <lb/> improbability
                    that this ever would be effected. Some <reg orig="in-|stinct">instinct</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="121" entity="eaf033v1_0162" pid="uva-lib:349192">
                        <fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">13*</fw>
                    </pb> induced me to lay my hand upon a newspaper. I had <lb/> perused all the
                    general intelligence it contained in the <lb/> morning, and at the same spot.
                    The act was rather <reg orig="me-|chanical">mechanical</reg>
                    <lb/> than voluntary.</p>
                <p>"I threw a languid glance at the first column that <reg orig="pre-|sented"
                        >presented</reg>
                    <lb/> itself. The first words which I read, began with <lb/> the offer of a
                    reward of three hundred guineas for the <reg orig="ap-|prehension"
                        >apprehension</reg>
                    <lb/> of a convict under sentence of death, who had <lb/> escaped from Newgate
                    prison in Dublin. Good heaven! <lb/> how every fibre of my frame tingled when I
                    proceeded to <lb/> read that the name of the criminal was Francis Carwin!</p>
                <p>"The descriptions of his person and address were <reg orig="mi-|nute"
                        >minute</reg>. <lb/> His stature, hair, complexion, the extraordinary <reg
                        orig="posi-|tion">position</reg>
                    <lb/> and arrangement of his features, his awkward and <lb/> disproportionate
                    form, his gesture and gait, corresponded <lb/> perfectly with those of our
                    mysterious visitant. He had <lb/> been found guilty in two indictments. One for
                    the murder <lb/> of the Lady Jane Conway, and the other for a robbery <lb/>
                    committed on the person of the honorable Mr. Ludloe.</p>
                <p>"I repeatedly perused this passage. The ideas which <lb/> flowed in upon my mind,
                    affected me like an instant <reg orig="transi-|tion">transition</reg>
                    <lb/> from death to life. The purpose dearest to my heart <lb/> was thus
                    effected, at a time and by means the least of all <lb/> others within the scope
                    of my foresight. But what <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg>? <lb/> Carwin was
                    detected. Acts of the blackest and <lb/> most sordid guilt had been committed by
                    him. Here was <lb/> evidence which imparted to my understanding the most <reg
                        orig="lu-|minous">luminous</reg>
                    <lb/> certainty. The name, visage, and deportment, <lb/> were the same. Between
                    the time of his escape, and his <lb/> appearance among us, there was a
                    sufficient agreement. <lb/> Such was the man with whom I suspected you to
                    maintain <lb/> a clandestine correspondence. Should I not haste to snatch <lb/>
                    you from the talons of this vulture? Should I see you <lb/> rushing to the verge
                    of a dizzy precipice, and not stretch <lb/> forth a hand to pull you back? I had
                    no need to <reg orig="delibe-|rate">deliberate</reg>. <lb/> I thrust the paper
                    in my pocket, and resolved to <reg orig="ob-|tain">obtain</reg>
                    <lb/> an immediate conference with you. For a time, no <lb/> other image made
                    its way to my understanding. At length, <lb/> it occurred to me, that though the
                    information I possessed <lb/> was, in one sense, sufficient, yet if more could
                    be obtained, <lb/>
                    <pb n="122" entity="eaf033v1_0163" pid="uva-lib:349193"/> more was desirable.
                    This passage was copied from a <reg orig="Bri-|tish">British</reg>
                    <lb/> paper; part of it only, perhaps, was transcribed. The <lb/> printer was in
                    possession of the original.</p>
                <p>"Towards his house I immediately turned my horse's <lb/> head. He produced the
                    paper, but I found nothing more <lb/> than had already been seen. While busy in
                    perusing it, the <lb/> printer stood by my side. He noticed the object of which
                    <lb/> I was in search. "Aye," said he, "that is a strange affair. <lb/> I should
                    never have met with it had not Mr. Hallet sent <lb/> to me the paper, with a
                    particular request to republish that <lb/> advertisement."</p>
                <p>"Mr. Hallet! What reasons could he have for making <lb/> this request? Had the
                    paper sent to him been <reg orig="accompa-|nied">accompanied</reg>
                    <lb/> by any information respecting the convict? Had he <lb/> personal or
                    extraordinary reasons for desiring its <reg orig="republica-|tion"
                        >republication</reg>? <lb/> This was to be known only in one way. I speeded
                    <lb/> to his house. In answer to my interrogations, he told me <lb/> that Ludloe
                    had formerly been in America, and that during <lb/> his residence in this city,
                    considerable intercourse had taken <lb/> place between them. Hence a confidence
                    arose, which <lb/> has since been kept alive by occasional letters. He had <lb/>
                    lately received a letter from him, enclosing the newspaper <lb/> from which this
                    extract had been made. He put it into my <lb/> hands, and pointed out the
                    passages which related to <reg orig="Car-|win">Carwin</reg>.</p>
                <p>"Ludloe confirms the facts of his conviction and escape; <lb/> and adds, that he
                    had reason to believe him to have <reg orig="em-|barked">embarked</reg>
                    <lb/> for America. He describes him in general terms, <lb/> as the most
                    incomprehensible and formidable among men; <lb/> as engaged in schemes,
                    reasonably suspected to be, in the <lb/> highest degree, criminal, but such as
                    no human intelligence is <lb/> able to unravel; that his ends are pursued by
                    means which <lb/> leave it in doubt whether he be not in league with some <reg
                        orig="in-|fernal">infernal</reg>
                    <lb/> spirit; that his crimes have hitherto been perpetrated <lb/> with the aid
                    of some unknown but desperate accomplices; <lb/> that he wages a perpetual war
                    against the happiness of <reg orig="man-|kind">mankind</reg>, <lb/> and sets his
                    engines of destruction at work against <lb/> every object that presents
                    itself.</p>
                <p>"This is the substance of the letter. Hallet expressed <lb/> some surprise at the
                    curiosity which was manifested by me <lb/>
                    <pb n="123" entity="eaf033v1_0164" pid="uva-lib:349194"/> on this occasion. I
                    was too much absorbed by the ideas <lb/> suggested by this letter, to pay
                    attention to his remarks. I <lb/> shuddered with the apprehension of the evil to
                    which our <lb/> indiscreet familiarity with this man had probably exposed <lb/>
                    us. I burnt with impatience to see you, and to do what in <lb/> me lay to avert
                    the calumity which threatened us. It was <lb/> already five o'clock. Night was
                    hastening, and there was <lb/> no time to be lost. On leaving Mr. Hallet's
                    house, who <lb/> should meet me in the street, but Bertrand, the servant <lb/>
                    whom I left in Germany. His appearance and <reg orig="accoutre-|ments"
                        >accoutrements</reg>
                    <lb/> bespoke him to have just alighted from a toilsome and <lb/> long journey.
                    I was not wholly without expectation of <reg orig="see-|ing">seeing</reg>
                    <lb/> him about this time, but no one was then more distant <lb/> from my
                    thoughts. You know what reasons I have for <lb/> anxiety respecting scenes with
                    which this man was <reg orig="conver-|versant">converversant</reg>. <lb/> Carwin
                    was for a moment forgotten. In answer <lb/> to my vehement inquiries, Bertrand
                    produced a copious <lb/> packet. I shall not at present mention its contents,
                    nor the <lb/> measures which they obliged me to adopt. I bestowed a <lb/> brief
                    perusal on these papers, and having given some <reg orig="direc-|tions"
                        >directions</reg>
                    <lb/> to Bertrand, resumed my purpose with regard to you. <lb/> My horse I was
                    obliged to resign to my servant, he being <lb/> charged with a commission that
                    required speed. The clock <lb/> had struck ten, and Mettingen was five miles
                    distant. I <lb/> was to journey thither on foot. These circumstances only <lb/>
                    added to my expedition.</p>
                <p>"As I passed swiftly along, I reviewed all the incidents <lb/> accompanying the
                    appearance and deportment of that man <lb/> among us. Late events have been
                    inexplicable and <reg orig="myste-|rious">mysterious</reg>
                    <lb/> beyond any of which I have either read or heard. <lb/> These events were
                    coeval with Carwin's introduction. I <lb/> am unable to explain their origin and
                    mutual dependence; <lb/> but I do not, on that account, believe them to have a
                        <reg orig="super-|natural">supernatural</reg>
                    <lb/> original. Is not this man the agent? Some of them <lb/> seem to be
                    propitious; but what should I think of those <lb/> threats of assassination with
                    which you were lately alarmed? <lb/> Bloodshed is the trade, and horror is the
                    element of this <lb/> man. The process by which the sympathies of nature are
                    <lb/> extinguished in our hearts, by which evil is made our good, <lb/> and by
                    which we are made susceptible of no activity but in <lb/>
                    <pb n="124" entity="eaf033v1_0165" pid="uva-lib:349195"/> the infliction, and no
                    joy but in the spectacle of woes, is <lb/> an obvious process. As to alliance
                    with evil geniis, the <lb/> power and the malice of demons have been a thousand
                    times <lb/> exemplified in human beings. There are no devils but <lb/> those
                    which are begotten upon selfishness, and reared by <lb/> cunning.</p>
                <p>"Now, indeed, the scene was changed. It was not his <lb/> secret poniard that I
                    dreaded. It was only the success of <lb/> his efforts to make you a confederate
                    in your own <reg orig="destruc-|tion">destruction</reg>, <lb/> to make your will
                    the instrument by which he might <lb/> bereave you of liberty and honor.</p>
                <p>"I took, as usual, the path through your brother's ground. <lb/> I ranged with
                    celerity and silence along the bank. I <reg orig="ap-|proached">approached</reg>
                    <lb/> the fence, which divides Wieland's estate from <lb/> yours. The recess in
                    the bank being near this line, it <lb/> being necessary for me to pass near it,
                    my mind being <lb/> tainted with inveterate suspicions concerning you; <reg
                        orig="suspi-|cions">suspicions</reg>
                    <lb/> which were indebted for their strength to incidents <reg
                        orig="con-|nected">connected</reg>
                    <lb/> with this spot; what wonder that it seized upon my <lb/> thoughts!</p>
                <p>"I leaped on the fence; but before I descended on the <lb/> opposite side, I
                    paused to survey the scene. Leaves <reg orig="drop-|ping">dropping</reg>
                    <lb/> with dew, and glistening in the moon's rays, with no <lb/> moving object
                    to molest the deep repose, filled me with <reg orig="se-|curity">security</reg>
                    <lb/> and hope. I left the station at length, and tended <reg orig="for-|ward"
                        >forward</reg>. <lb/> You were probably at rest. How should I <reg
                        orig="com-|municate">communicate</reg>
                    <lb/> without alarming you, the intelligence of my <reg orig="arri-|val"
                        >arrival</reg>? <lb/> An immediate interview was to be procured. I could
                    <lb/> not bear to think that a minute should be lost by remissness <lb/> or
                    hesitation? Should I knock at the door? or should I stand <lb/> under your
                    chamber windows, which I perceived to be open, <lb/> and awaken you by my
                    calls?</p>
                <p>"These reflections employed me, as I passed opposite to <lb/> the summer house. I
                    had scarcely gone by, when my ear <lb/> caught a sound unusual at this time and
                    place. It was <reg orig="al-|most">almost</reg>
                    <lb/> too faint and too transient to allow me a distinct <reg
                        orig="per-|ception">perception</reg>
                    <lb/> of it. I stopped to listen; presently it was heard <lb/> again, and now it
                    was somewhat in a louder key. It was <lb/> laughter; and unquestionably produced
                    by a female voice. <lb/> That voice was familiar to my senses. It was yours.</p>
                <pb n="125" entity="eaf033v1_0166" pid="uva-lib:349196"/>
                <p>"Whence it came, I was at first at a loss to conjecture; <lb/> but this
                    uncertainty vanished when it was heard the third <lb/> time. I threw back my
                    eyes towards the recess. Every <lb/> other organ and limb was useless to me. I
                    did not reason <lb/> on the subject. I did not, in a direct manner, draw my
                    <lb/> conclusions from the hour, the place, the hilarity which this <lb/> sound
                    betokened, and the circumstance of having a <reg orig="com-|panion"
                        >companion</reg>, <lb/> which it no less incontestably proved. In an
                    instant, <lb/> as it were, my heart was invaded with cold, and the pulses <lb/>
                    of life at a stand.</p>
                <p>"Why should I go further? Why should I return? <lb/> Should I not hurry to a
                    distance from a sound, which, <lb/> though formerly so sweet and delectable, was
                    now more <lb/> hideous than the shrieks of owls?</p>
                <p>"I had no time to yield to this impulse. The thought of <lb/> approaching and
                    listening occurred to me. I had no doubt <lb/> of which I was conscious. Yet my
                    certainty was capable of <lb/> increase. I was likewise stimulated by a
                    sentiment that <reg orig="par-|took">partook</reg>
                    <lb/> of rage. I was governed by a half-formed and <reg orig="tem-|pestuous"
                        >tempestuous</reg>
                    <lb/> resolution to break in upon your interview, and <lb/> strike you dead with
                    my upbraiding.</p>
                <p>"I approached with the utmost caution. When I <reg orig="reach-|ed">reached</reg>
                    <lb/> the edge of the bank immediately above the summer <lb/> house, I thought I
                    heard voices from below, as busy in <reg orig="con-|versation"
                        >conversation</reg>. <lb/> The steps in the rock are clear of bushy <reg
                        orig="impe-|diments">impediments</reg>. <lb/> They allowed me to descend
                    into a cavity <reg orig="be-|side">beside</reg>
                    <lb/> the building without being detected. Thus to lie in <lb/> wait could only
                    be justified by the momentousness of the <lb/> occasion."</p>
                <p>Here Pleyel paused in his narrative, and fixed his eyes <lb/> upon me. Situated
                    as I was, my horror and astonishment <lb/> at this tale gave way to compassion
                    for the anguish which <lb/> the countenance of my friend betrayed. I reflected
                    on <lb/> his force of understanding. I reflected on the powers of <lb/> my
                    enemy. I could easily divine the substance of the <reg orig="con-|versation"
                        >conversation</reg>
                    <lb/> that was overheard. Carwin had constructed his <lb/> plot in a manner
                    suited to the characters of those whom he <lb/> had selected for his victims. I
                    saw that the convictions of <lb/> Pleyel were immutable. I forbore to struggle
                    against the <lb/> storm, because I saw that all struggles would be fruitless. I <lb/>
                    <pb n="126" entity="eaf033v1_0167" pid="uva-lib:349197"/> was calm; but my
                    calmness was the torpor of despair, and <lb/> not the tranquillity of fortitude.
                    It was calmness invincible <lb/> by any thing that his grief and his fury could
                    suggest to <lb/> Pleyel. He resumed&mdash;</p>
                <p>"Woman! wilt thou hear me further? Shall I go on to <lb/> repeat the
                    conversation? Is it shame that makes thee <reg orig="tongue-|tied"
                        >tongue-tied</reg>? <lb/> Shall I go on? or art thou satisfied with what has
                    been <lb/> already said?"</p>
                <p>I bowed my head. "Go on," said I. "I make not <lb/> this request in the hope of
                    undeceiving you. I shall no <lb/> longer contend with my own weakness. The storm
                    is let <lb/> loose, and I shall peaceably submit to be driven by its fury. <lb/>
                    But go on. This conference will end only with affording <lb/> me a clearer
                    foresight of my destiny; but that will be some <lb/> satisfaction, and I will
                    not part without it."</p>
                <p>Why, on hearing these words, did Pleyel hesitate? Did <lb/> some unlooked for
                    doubt insinuate itself into his mind? <lb/> Was his belief suddenly shaken by my
                    looks, or my words, <lb/> or by some newly recollected circumstance?
                    Whencesoever <lb/> it arose, it could not endure the test of deliberation. In a
                    <lb/> few minutes the flame of resentment was again lighted up in <lb/> his
                    bosom. He proceeded with his accustomed vehemence:</p>
                <p>"I hate myself for this folly. I can find no apology for <lb/> this tale. Yet I
                    am irresistibly impelled to relate it. She <lb/> that hears me is apprized of
                    every particular. I have only <lb/> to repeat to her her own words. She will
                    listen with a <lb/> tranquil air, and the spectacle of her obduracy will drive
                    me <lb/> to some desperate act. Why then should I persist! yet <lb/> persist I
                    must it."</p>
                <p>Again he paused. "No," said he, "it is impossible to <lb/> repeat your avowals of
                    love, your appeals to former <reg orig="confes-|sions">confessions</reg>
                    <lb/> of your tenderness, to former deeds of dishonor, to the <lb/>
                    circumstances of the first interview that took place between <lb/> you. It was
                    on that night when I traced you to this recess. <lb/> Thither had he enticed
                    you, and there had you ratified an <lb/> unhallowed compact by admitting
                    him&mdash;</p>
                <p>"Great God! Thou witnessedst the agonies that tore my <lb/> bosom at that moment!
                    Thou witnessedst my efforts to <reg orig="re-|pel">repel</reg>
                    <lb/> the testimony of my ears! It was in vain that you dwelt <lb/> upon the
                    confusion which my unlooked for summons <reg orig="excit-|ed">excited</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="127" entity="eaf033v1_0168" pid="uva-lib:349198"/> in you; the tardiness
                    with which a suitable excuse <reg orig="occur-|red">occurred</reg>
                    <lb/> to you; your resentment that my impertinent intrusion <lb/> had put an end
                    to that charming interview; a disappointment <lb/> for which you endeavored to
                    compensate yourself, by the <lb/> frequency and duration of subsequent
                    meetings.</p>
                <p>"In vain you dwelt upon incidents of which you only <lb/> could be conscious;
                    incidents that occurred on occasions on <lb/> which none besides your own family
                    were witnesses. In <lb/> vain was your discourse characterized by peculiarities
                        <reg orig="inimit-|able">inimitable</reg>
                    <lb/> of sentiment and language. My conviction was <reg orig="effect-|ed"
                        >effected</reg>
                    <lb/> only by an accumulation of the same tokens. I yielded <lb/> not but to
                    evidence which took away the power to withhold <lb/> my faith.</p>
                <p>"My sight was of no use to me. Beneath so thick an <lb/> umbrage, the darkness
                    was intense. Hearing was the only <lb/> avenue to information, which the
                    circumstances allowed to <lb/> be open. I was couched within three feet of you.
                    Why <lb/> should I approach nearer? I could not contend with your <lb/>
                    betrayer. What could be the purpose of a contest? You <lb/> stood in no need of
                    a protector. What could I do, but <reg orig="re-|tire">retire</reg>
                    <lb/> from the spot overwhelmed with confusion and dismay? <lb/> I sought my
                    chamber, and endeavored to regain my <reg orig="com-|posure">composure</reg>.
                    <lb/> The door of the house, which I found open, your <lb/> subsequent entrance,
                    closing, and fastening it, and going into <lb/> your chamber, which had been
                    thus long deserted, were <lb/> only confirmations of the truth.</p>
                <p>"Why should I paint the tempestuous fluctuation of my <lb/> thoughts between
                    grief and revenge, between rage and <reg orig="de-|spair">despair</reg>? <lb/>
                    Why should I repeat my vows of eternal <reg orig="implacabili-|ty"
                        >implacability</reg>
                    <lb/> and persecution, and the speedy recantation of these <lb/> vows?</p>
                <p>"I have said enough. You have dismissed me from a <lb/> place in your esteem.
                    What I think, and what I feel, is of <lb/> no importance in your eyes. May the
                    duty which I owe <lb/> myself enable me to forget your existence. In a few <lb/>
                    minutes I go hence. Be the maker of your fortune, and <lb/> may adversity
                    instruct you in that wisdom, which education <lb/> was unable to impart to
                    you."</p>
                <p>Those were the last words which Pleyel uttered. He <lb/> left the room, and my
                    new emotions enabled me to witness <lb/>
                    <pb n="128" entity="eaf033v1_0169" pid="uva-lib:349199"/> his departure without
                    any apparent loss of composure. As <lb/> I sat alone, I ruminated on these
                    incidents. Nothing was <lb/> more evident than that I had taken an eternal leave
                    of <reg orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg>. <lb/> Life was a worthless thing,
                    separate from that <lb/> good which had now been wrested from me; yet the <reg

                    <lb/> that now possessed me had no tendency to palsy my <lb/> exertions, and
                    overbear my strength. I noticed that the <lb/> light was declining, and
                    perceived the propriety of leaving <lb/> this house. I placed myself again in
                    the chaise, and <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg>
                    <lb/> slowly towards the city.</p>

                <p>What a letter was this! A man known to be an assassin <lb/> and robber; one
                    capable of plotting against my life and my <lb/> fame; detected lurking in my
                    chamber, and avowing <reg orig="de-|signs">designs</reg>
                    <lb/> the most flagitious and dreadful, now solicits me to <lb/> grant him a
                    midnight interview! To admit him alone into <lb/> my presence! Could he make
                    this request with the <reg orig="ex-|pectation">expectation</reg>
                    <lb/> of my compliance? What had he seen in me, <lb/> that could justify him in
                    admitting so wild a belief? Yet <lb/> this request is preferred with the utmost
                    gravity. It is not <lb/> accompanied by an appearance of uncommon earnestness.
                    <lb/> Had the misconduct to which he alludes been a slight <reg
                        orig="inci-|vility">incivility</reg>, <lb/> and the interview requested to
                    take place in the <lb/> midst of my friends, there would have been no
                    extravagance <lb/> in the tenor of this letter; but, as it was, the writer had
                    <lb/> surely been bereft of his reason.</p>
                <p>I perused this epistle frequently. The request it <reg orig="con-|tained"
                        >contained</reg>
                    <lb/> might be called audacious or stupid, if it had been <lb/> made by a
                    different person; but from Carwin, who could <lb/> not be unaware of the effect
                    which it must naturally <reg orig="pro-|duce">produce</reg>, <lb/> and of the
                    manner in which it would unavoidably be <lb/> treated, it was perfectly
                    inexplicable. He must have <reg orig="count-|ed">counted</reg>
                    <lb/> on the success of some plot, in order to extort my assent. <lb/> None of
                    those motives by which I am usually governed, <lb/> would ever have persuaded me
                    to meet any one of his sex, <lb/> at the time and place which he had prescribed.
                    Much less <lb/> would I consent to a meeting with a man tainted with the <lb/>
                    most detestable crimes, and by whose arts my own safety <lb/> had been so
                    imminently endangered, and my happiness <reg orig="irre-|trievably"
                        >irretrievably</reg>
                    <lb/> destroyed. I shuddered at the idea that such a <lb/> meeting was possible.
                    I felt some reluctance to approach a <lb/> spot which he still visited and
                    haunted.</p>
                <p>Such were the ideas which first suggested themselves on <lb/> the perusal of the
                    letter. Meanwhile, I resumed my <reg orig="jour-|ney">journey</reg>. <lb/> My
                    thoughts still dwelt upon the same topic. <reg orig="Gra-|dually"
                        >Gradually</reg>, <lb/>
                    <pb n="130" entity="eaf033v1_0171" pid="uva-lib:349201"/> from ruminating on
                    this epistle, I reverted to my <lb/> interview with Pleyel. I recalled the
                    particulars of the <lb/> dialogue to which he had been an auditor. My heart sunk
                    <lb/> anew on viewing the inextricable complexity of this <reg
                        orig="decep-|tion">deception</reg>, <lb/> and the inauspicious concurrence
                    of events, which <lb/> tended to confirm him in his error. When he approached
                    <lb/> my chamber door, my terror kept me mute. He put his <lb/> ear, perhaps, to
                    the crevice, but it caught the sound of <lb/> nothing human. Had I called, or
                    made any token that <lb/> denoted some one to be within, words would have
                    ensued; <lb/> and as omnipresence was impossible, this discovery, and the <lb/>
                    artless narrative of what had just passed, would have saved <lb/> me from his
                    murderous invectives. He went into his <reg orig="cham-|ber">chamber</reg>,
                    <lb/> and after some interval, I stole across the entry and <lb/> down the
                    stairs, with inaudible steps. Having secured the <lb/> outer doors, I returned
                    with less circumspection. He heard <lb/> me not when I descended; but my
                    returning steps were <lb/> easily distinguished. Now he thought was the guilty
                        <reg orig="inter-|view">interview</reg>
                    <lb/> at an end. In what other way was it possible for him <lb/> to construe
                    these signals?</p>
                <p>How fallacious and precipitate was my decision! <reg orig="Car-|win's"
                        >Carwin's</reg>
                    <lb/> plot owed its success to a coincidence of events <lb/> scarcely credible.
                    The balance was swayed from its <reg orig="equi-|poise">equipoise</reg>
                    <lb/> by a hair. Had I even begun the conversation with <lb/> an account of what
                    befel me in my chamber, my previous <lb/> interview with Wieland would have
                    taught him to suspect <lb/> me of imposture; yet, if I were discoursing with
                    this ruffian <lb/> when Pleyel touched the lock of my chamber door, and <lb/>
                    when he shut his own door with so much violence, how, he <lb/> might ask, should
                    I be able to relate these incidents? <reg orig="Per-|haps">Perhaps</reg>
                    <lb/> he had withheld the knowledge of these circumstances <lb/> from my
                    brother, from whom, therefore, I could not obtain <lb/> it, so that my innocence
                    would have thus been irresistibly <lb/> demonstrated.</p>
                <p>The first impulse which flowed from these ideas was to <lb/> return upon my
                    steps, and demand once more an interview; <lb/> but he was gone; his parting
                    declarations were <reg orig="remem-|bered">remembered</reg>.</p>
                <p>Pleyel, I exclaimed, thou art gone forever! Are thy <lb/> mistakes beyond the
                    reach of detection? Am I helpless in <lb/>
                    <pb n="131" entity="eaf033v1_0172" pid="uva-lib:349202"/> the midst of this
                    snare? The plotter is at hand. He even <lb/> speaks in the style of penitence.
                    He solicits an <reg orig="inter-|view">interview</reg>
                    <lb/> which he promises shall end in the disclosure of <lb/> something momentous
                    to my happiness. What can he say <lb/> which will avail to turn aside this evil?
                    But why should <lb/> his remorse be feigned? I have done him no injury. His
                    <lb/> wickedness is fertile only of despair; and the billows of <reg
                        orig="re-|morse">remorse</reg>
                    <lb/> will sometime overbear him. Why may not this <lb/> event have already
                    taken place? Why should I refuse to <lb/> see him?</p>
                <p>This idea was present, as it were, for a moment. I <reg orig="sud-|denly"
                        >suddenly</reg>
                    <lb/> recoiled from it, confounded at that frenzy which <lb/> could give even
                    momentary harbor to such a scheme; yet <lb/> presently it returned. At length I
                    even conceived it to <reg orig="de-|serve">deserve</reg>
                    <lb/> deliberation. I questioned whether it was not proper <lb/> to admit, at a
                    lonely spot, in a sacred hour, this man of <reg orig="tre-|mendous"
                        >tremendous</reg>
                    <lb/> and inscrutable attributes, this performer of horrid <lb/> deeds, and
                    whose presence was predicted to call down <lb/> unheard of and unutterable
                    horrors.</p>
                <p>What was it that swayed me? I felt myself divested of <lb/> the power to will
                    contrary to the motives that determined <lb/> me to seek his presence. My mind
                    seemed to be split into <lb/> separate parts, and these parts to have entered
                    into furious <lb/> and implacable contention. These tumults gradually <reg

                    that <reg orig="interpo-|sition">interposition</reg>
                    <lb/> which had hitherto defended me; in those tokens of <lb/> compunction which
                    this letter contained; in the efficacy of <lb/> this interview to restore its
                    spotlessness to my character, <lb/> and banish all illusions from the mind of my
                    friend, <reg orig="contin-|ually">continually</reg>
                    <lb/> acquired new evidence and new strength.</p>
                <p>What should I fear in his presence? This was unlike an <lb/> artifice intended to
                    betray me into his hands. If it were an <lb/> artifice, what purpose would it
                    serve? The freedom of my <lb/> mind was untouched, and that freedom would defy
                    the <reg orig="as-|saults">assaults</reg>
                    <lb/> of blandishments or magic. Force I was not able to <lb/> repel. On the
                    former occasion my courage, it is true, had <lb/> failed at the imminent
                    approach of danger; but then I had <lb/> not enjoyed opportunities of
                    deliberation; I had foreseen <lb/> nothing; I was sunk into imbecility by my
                    previous <lb/> thoughts; I had been the victim of recent disappointments <lb/>
                    <pb n="132" entity="eaf033v1_0173" pid="uva-lib:349203"/> and anticipated ills.
                    Witness my infatuation in opening the <lb/> closet in opposition to divine
                    injunctions.</p>
                <p>Now, perhaps, my courage was the offspring of a no less <lb/> erring principle.
                    Pleyel was forever lost to me. I strove <lb/> in vain to assume his person, and
                    suppress my resentment; <lb/> I strove in vain to believe in the assuaging
                    influence of time, <lb/> to look forward to the birth-day of new hopes, and the
                        <reg orig="re-|exaltation">reexaltation</reg>
                    <lb/> of that luminary, of whose effulgencies I had so <lb/> long and so
                    liberally partaken.</p>
                <p>What had I to suffer worse than was already infficted?</p>
                <p>Was not Carwin my foe? I owed my untimely fate to <lb/> his treason. Instead of
                    flying from his presence, ought I <lb/> not to devote all my faculties to the
                    gaining of an interview, <lb/> and compel him to repair the ills of which he has
                    been the <lb/> author? Why should I suppose him impregnable to <reg
                        orig="argu-|ment">argument</reg>? <lb/> Have I not reason on my side, and
                    the power of <lb/> imparting conviction? Cannot he be made to see the <lb/>
                    justice of unravelling the maze in which Pleyel is <reg orig="bewil-|dered"
                        >bewildered</reg>?</p>
                <p>He may, at least, be accessible to fear. Has he nothing <lb/> to fear from the
                    rage of an injured woman? But suppose <lb/> him inaccessible to such
                    inducements; suppose him to <reg orig="per-|sist">persist</reg>
                    <lb/> in all his flagitious purposes; are not the means of <reg orig="de-|fence"
                        >defence</reg>
                    <lb/> and resistance in my power?</p>
                <p>In the progress of such thoughts, was the resolution at <lb/> last formed. I
                    hoped that the interview was sought by him <lb/> for a laudable end; but, be
                    that as it would, I trusted that, <lb/> by energy of reasoning or of action, I
                    should render it <lb/> auspicious, or at least, harmless.</p>
                <p>Such a determination must unavoidably fluctuate. The <lb/> poet's chaos was no
                    unapt emblem of the state of my mind. <lb/> A torment was awakened in my bosom,
                    which I foresaw <lb/> would end only when this interview was past, and its <reg
                        orig="conse-|quences">consequences</reg>
                    <lb/> fully experienced. Hence my impatience for the <lb/> arrival of the hour
                    which had been prescribed by Carwin.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, my meditations were tumultuously active. <lb/> New impediments to the
                    execution of the scheme were <lb/> speedily suggested. I had apprized Catharine
                    of my <reg orig="inten-|tion">intention</reg>
                    <lb/> to spend this and many future nights with her. Her <lb/> husband was
                    informed of this arrangement, and had <reg orig="zeal-|ously">zealously</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="133" entity="eaf033v1_0174" pid="uva-lib:349204">
                        <fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">14*</fw>
                    </pb> approved it. Eleven o'clock exceeded their hour of <lb/> retiring. What
                    excuse should I form for changing my <lb/> plan? Should I show this letter to
                    Wieland, and submit <lb/> myself to his direction? But I knew in what way he
                    would <lb/> decide. He would fervently dissuade me from going. Nay, <lb/> would
                    he not do more? He was apprized of the offences of <lb/> Carwin, and of the
                    reward offered for his apprehension. <lb/> Would he not seize this opportunity
                    of executing justice <lb/> on a criminal?</p>
                <p>This idea was new. I was plunged once more into <lb/> doubt. Did not equity
                    enjoin me thus to facilitate his arrest? <lb/> No. I disdained the office of
                    betrayer. Carwin was <reg orig="unap-|prized">unapprized</reg>
                    <lb/> of his danger, and his intentions were possibly <reg orig="bene-|ficent"
                        >beneficent</reg>. <lb/> Should I station guards about the house, and make
                    <lb/> an act, intended perhaps for my benefit, instrumental to his <lb/> own
                    destruction? Wieland might be justified in thus <reg orig="em-|ploying"
                        >employing</reg>
                    <lb/> the knowledge which I should impart, but I, by <lb/> imparting it, should
                    pollute myself with more hateful crimes <lb/> than those undeservedly imputed to
                    me. This scheme, <lb/> therefore, I unhesitatingly rejected. The views with
                    which <lb/> I should return to my own house, it would therefore be <reg
                        orig="ne-|cessary">necessary</reg>
                    <lb/> to conceal. Yet some pretext must be invented. <lb/> I had never been
                    initiated into the trade of lying. Yet <lb/> what but falsehood was a deliberate
                    suppression of the <lb/> truth? To deceive by silence or by words is the
                    same.</p>
                <p>Yet what would a lie avail me? What pretext would <lb/> justify this change in my
                    plan? Would it not tend to <reg orig="con-|firm">confirm</reg>
                    <lb/> the imputations of Pleyel? That I should voluntarily <lb/> return to a
                    house, in which honor and life had so lately been <lb/> endangered, could be
                    explained in no way favorable to my <lb/> integrity.</p>
                <p>These reflections, if they did not change, at least <reg orig="sus-|pended"
                        >suspended</reg>
                    <lb/> my decision. In this state of uncertainty I alighted <lb/> at the <hi
                        rend="italic">hut.</hi> We gave this name to the house tenanted by <lb/> the
                    farmer and his servants, and which was situated on the <lb/> verge of my
                    brother's ground, and at a considerable distance <lb/> from the mansion. The
                    path to the mansion was planted <lb/> by a double row of walnuts. Along this
                    path I proceeded <lb/> alone. I entered the parlor, in which was a light just
                        <reg orig="ex-|piring">expiring</reg>
                    <lb/> in the socket. There was no one in the room. I <lb/>
                    <pb n="134" entity="eaf033v1_0175" pid="uva-lib:349205"/> perceived by the clock
                    that stood against the wall that it <lb/> was near eleven. The lateness of the
                    hour startled me. <lb/> What had become of the family? They were usually <reg
                        orig="re-|tired">retired</reg>
                    <lb/> an hour before this; but the unextinguished taper, <lb/> and the unbarred
                    door, were indications that they had not <lb/> retired. I again returned to the
                    hall, and passed from one <lb/> room to another, but still encountered not a
                    human being.</p>
                <p>I imagined that, perhaps, the lapse of a few minutes <lb/> would explain these
                    appearances. Meanwhile I reflected <lb/> that the preconcerted hour had arrived.
                    Carwin was <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg>
                    <lb/> waiting my approach. Should I immediately retire to <lb/> my own house, no
                    one would be apprized of my <reg orig="proceed-|ing">proceeding</reg>. <lb/>
                    Nay, the interview might pass, and I be enabled to <lb/> return in half an hour.
                    Hence no necessity would arise <lb/> for dissimulation.</p>
                <p>I was so far influenced by these views that I rose to <reg orig="exe-|cute"
                        >execute</reg>
                    <lb/> this design; but again, the unusual condition of the <lb/> house occurred
                    to me, and some vague solicitude as to the <lb/> condition of the family. I was
                    nearly certain that my <lb/> brother had not retired; but by what motives he
                    could be <lb/> induced to desert his house thus unseasonably, I could by <lb/>
                    no means divine. Louisa Conway, at least, was at home, <lb/> and had, probably,
                    retired to her chamber; perhaps she <lb/> was able to impart the information I
                    wanted.</p>
                <p>I went to her chamber, and found her asleep. She <lb/> was delighted and
                    surprised at my arrival, and told me <lb/> with how much impatience and anxiety
                    my brother and his <lb/> wife had awaited my coming. They were fearful that some
                    <lb/> mishap had befallen me, and had remained up longer than <lb/> the usual
                    period. Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, <lb/> Catharine would not
                    resign the hope of seeing me. Louisa <lb/> said she had left them both in the
                    parlor, and she knew of <lb/> no cause for their absence.</p>
                <p>As yet I was not without solicitude on account of their <lb/> personal safety. I
                    was far from being perfectly at ease on <lb/> that head, but entertained no
                    distinct conception of the <reg orig="dan-|ger">danger</reg>
                    <lb/> that impended over them. Perhaps to beguile the <reg orig="mo-|ments"
                        >moments</reg>
                    <lb/> of my long protracted stay, they had gone to walk <lb/> upon the bank. The
                    atmosphere, though illuminated only by <lb/> the star light, was remarkably
                    serene. Meanwhile the <reg orig="de-|sirableness">desirableness</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="135" entity="eaf033v1_0176" pid="uva-lib:349206"/> of an interview with
                    Carwin again returned, and <lb/> I finally resolved to seek it.</p>
                <p>I passed with doubting and hasty steps along the path. <lb/> My dwelling, seen at
                    a distance, was gloomy and desolate. <lb/> It had no inhabitant, for my servant,
                    in consequence of my <lb/> new arrangement had gone to Mettingen. The temerity
                    of <lb/> this attempt began to show itself in more vivid colors to my <lb/>
                    understanding. Whoever has pointed steel is not without <lb/> arms; yet what
                    must have been the state of my mind when <lb/> I could meditate, without
                    shuddering, on the use of a <reg orig="mur-|derous">murderous</reg>
                    <lb/> weapon, and believe myself secure merely because <lb/> I was capable of
                    being made so by the death of another? <lb/> Yet this was not my state. I felt
                    as if I was rushing into <lb/> deadly toils, without the power of pausing or
                    receding.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">As</hi> soon as I arrived in sight of the front of the
                    house, my <lb/> attention was excited by a light from the window of my own <lb/>
                    chamber. No appearance could be less explicable. A <lb/> meeting was expected
                    with Carwin, but that he pre-<reg orig="occupi-|ed">occupied</reg>
                    <lb/> my chamber, and had supplied himself with light, was <lb/> not to be
                    believed. What motive could influence him to <lb/> adopt this conduct? could I
                    proceed until this was <reg orig="explain-|ed">explained</reg>? <lb/> Perhaps,
                    if I should proceed to a distance in front, <lb/> some one would be visible. A
                    sidelong but feeble beam <lb/> from the window, fell upon the piny copse which
                    skirted the <lb/> bank. As I eyed it, it suddenly became mutable, and after
                    <lb/> flitting to and fro, for a short time, it vanished. I turned my <lb/> eye
                    again towards the window, and perceived that the light <lb/> was still there;
                    but the change which I had noticed was <lb/> occasioned by a change in the
                    position of the lamp or <reg orig="can-|dle">candle</reg>
                    <lb/> within. Hence, that some person was there was an <reg orig="un-|avoidable"
                        >unavoidable</reg>
                    <lb/> inference.</p>
                <p>I paused to deliberate on the propriety of advancing. <lb/> Might I not advance
                    cautiously, and, therefore, without <lb/> danger? Might I not knock at the door,
                    or call, and be <reg orig="ap-|prized">apprized</reg>
                    <lb/> of the nature of my visitant before I entered? I <reg orig="ap-|proached"
                        >approached</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="136" entity="eaf033v1_0177" pid="uva-lib:349207"/> and listened at the
                    door, but could hear nothing. <lb/> I knocked at first timidly, but afterwards
                    with loudness. <lb/> My signals were unnoticed. I stepped back and looked, <lb/>
                    but the light was no longer discernible. Was it suddenly <lb/> extinguished by a
                    human agent? What purpose but <reg orig="con-|cealment">concealment</reg>
                    <lb/> was intended? Why was the illumination <reg orig="pro-|duced"
                        >produced</reg>, <lb/> to be thus suddenly brought to an end? And why, <lb/>
                    since some one was there, had silence been observed?</p>
                <p>These were questions, the solution of which may be <reg orig="read-|ily"
                        >readily</reg>
                    <lb/> supposed to be entangled with danger. Would not this <lb/> danger, when
                    measured by a woman's fears, expand into <lb/> gigantic dimensions? Menaces of
                    death; the stunning <reg orig="exer-|tions">exertions</reg>
                    <lb/> of a warning voice; the known and unknown attributes <lb/> of Carwin; our
                    recent interview in this chamber; the <reg orig="pre-|appointment"
                        >preappointment</reg>
                    <lb/> of a meeting at this place and hour, all <reg orig="throng-|ed"
                        >thronged</reg>
                    <lb/> into my memory. What was to he done?</p>
                <p>Courage is no definite or steadfast principle. Let that <lb/> man who shall
                    purpose to assign motives to the actions of <lb/> another, blush at his folly
                    and forbear. Not more <reg orig="pre-|sumptuous">presumptuous</reg>
                    <lb/> would it be to attempt the classification of all <lb/> nature, and the
                    scanning of supreme intelligence. I gazed <lb/> for a minute at the window, and
                    fixed my eyes, for a second <lb/> minute, on the ground. I drew forth from my
                    pocket, and <lb/> opened a penknife. This, said I, be my safeguard and <lb/>
                    avenger. The assailant shall perish, or myself shall fall.</p>
                <p>I had locked up the house in the morning, but had the <lb/> key of the kitchen
                    door in my pocket. I, therefore, <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg>
                    <lb/> to gain access behind. Thither I hastened, unlocked <lb/> and entered. All
                    was lonely, darksome and waste. <reg orig="Fa-|miliar">Familiar</reg>
                    <lb/> as I was with every part of my dwelling, I easily <lb/> found my way to a
                    closet, drew forth a taper, a flint, tinder, <lb/> and steel, and in a moment,
                    as it were, gave myself the <reg orig="gui-|dance">guidance</reg>
                    <lb/> and protection of light.</p>
                <p>What purpose did I meditate? Should I explore my <lb/> way to my chamber, and
                    confront the being who had dared <lb/> to intrude into this recess, and had
                    labored for concealment? <lb/> By putting out the light did he seek to hide
                    himself, or <lb/> mean only to circumvent my incautious steps? Yet was it <lb/>
                    not more probable that he desired my absence by thus <reg orig="en-|couraging"
                        >encouraging</reg>
                    <lb/> the supposition that the house was unoccupied? <lb/>
                    <pb n="137" entity="eaf033v1_0178" pid="uva-lib:349208"/> I would see this man
                    in spite of all impediments; ere I died, <lb/> I would see his face, and summon
                    him to penitence and <lb/> retribution; no matter at what cost an interview was
                        <reg orig="pur-|chased">purchased</reg>. <lb/> Reputation and life might be
                    wrested from me by <lb/> another, but my rectitude and honor were in my own <reg
                        orig="keep-|ing">keeping</reg>, <lb/> and were safe.</p>
                <p>I proceeded to the foot of the stairs. At such a crisis <lb/> my thoughts may be
                    supposed at no liberty to range; yet <lb/> vague images rushed into my mind, of
                    the mysterious <reg orig="in-|terposition">interposition</reg>
                    <lb/> which had been experienced on the last night. <lb/> My case, at present,
                    was not dissimilar; and, if my angel <lb/> were not weary of fruitless exertions
                    to save, might not a <lb/> new warning be expected? Who could say whether his
                    <lb/> silence were ascribable to the absence of danger, or to his <lb/> own
                    absence?</p>
                <p>In this state of mind, no wonder that a shivering cold <lb/> crept through my
                    veins; that my pause was prolonged; and, <lb/> that a fearful glance was thrown
                    backward.</p>
                <p>Alas! my heart droops, and my fingers are enervated; <lb/> my ideas are vivid,
                    but my language is faint; now know I <lb/> what it is to entertain
                    incommunicable sentiments. The chain <lb/> of subsequent incidents is drawn
                    through my mind, and <reg orig="be-|ing">being</reg>
                    <lb/> linked with those which forewent, by turns rouse up <lb/> agonies, and
                    sink me into hopelessness.</p>
                <p>Yet I will persist to the end. My narrative may be <reg orig="in-|vaded"
                        >invaded</reg>
                    <lb/> by inaccuracy and confusion; but if I live no longer, <lb/> I will, at
                    least, live to complete it. What but ambiguities, <lb/> abruptnesses, and dark
                    transitions, can be expected from <lb/> the historian who is, at the same time,
                    the sufferer of these <lb/> disasters?</p>
                <p>I have said that I cast a look behind. Some object was <lb/> expected to be seen,
                    or why should I have gazed in that <lb/> direction? Two senses were at once
                    assailed. The same <lb/> piercing exclamation of <hi rend="italic">hold!
                        hold!</hi> was uttered within <lb/> the same distance of my ear. This it was
                    that I heard. <lb/> The airy undulation, and the shock given to my nerves, were
                    <lb/> real. Whether the spectacle which I beheld existed in my <lb/> fancy or
                    without, might be doubted.</p>
                <p>I had not closed the door of the apartment I had just left. <lb/> The staircase,
                    at the foot of which I stood, was eight or ten <lb/>
                    <pb n="138" entity="eaf033v1_0179" pid="uva-lib:349209"/> feet from the door,
                    and attached to the wall through which <lb/> the door led. My view, therefore,
                    was sidelong, and took <lb/> in no part of the room.</p>
                <p>Through this aperture was a head thrust and drawn <lb/> back with so much
                    swiftness, that the immediate conviction <lb/> was, that thus much of a form,
                    ordinarily invisible, had been <lb/> unshrouded. The face was turned towards me.
                    Every <lb/> muscle was tense; the forehead and brows were drawn into <lb/>
                    vehement expression; the lips were stretched as in the act <lb/> of shrieking,
                    and the eyes emitted sparks, which, no doubt, <lb/> if I had been unattended by
                    a light, would have illuminated <lb/> like the corruscations of a meteor. The
                    sound and the <lb/> vision were present, and departed together at the same <reg
                        orig="in-|stant">instant</reg>; <lb/> but the cry was blown into my ear,
                    while the face <lb/> was many paces distant.</p>
                <p>This face was well suited to a being whose performances <lb/> exceeded the
                    standard of humanity, and yet its features <lb/> were akin to those I had before
                    seen. The image of <reg orig="Car-|win">Carwin</reg>
                    <lb/> was blended in a thousand ways with the stream of my <lb/> thoughts. This
                    visage was, perhaps, portrayed by my <lb/> fancy. If so, it will excite no
                    surprise that some of his <reg orig="linea-|ments">lineaments</reg>
                    <lb/> were now discovered. Yet affinities were few and <lb/> unconspicuous, and
                    were lost amidst the blaze of opposite <lb/> qualities.</p>
                <p>What conclusion could I form? Be the face human or <lb/> not, the intimation was
                    imparted from above. Experience <lb/> had evinced the benignity of that being
                    who gave it. Once he <lb/> had interposed to shield me from harm, and subsequent
                    <lb/> events demonstrated the usefulness of that interposition. <lb/> Now was I
                    again warned to forbear. I was hurrying to the <lb/> verge of the same gulf, and
                    the same power was exerted to <lb/> recall my steps. Was it possible for me not
                    to obey? Was <lb/> I capable of holding on in the same perilous career? Yes.
                    <lb/> Even of this I was capable!</p>
                <p>The intimation was imperfect; it gave no form to my <lb/> danger, and prescribed
                    no limits to my caution. I had <reg orig="for-|merly">formerly</reg>
                    <lb/> neglected it, and yet escaped. Might I not trust to <lb/> the same issue?
                    This idea might possess, though <reg orig="imper-|ceptibly">imperceptibly</reg>,
                    <lb/> some influence. I persisted; but it was not <reg orig="mere-|ly"
                        >merely</reg>
                    <lb/> on this account. I cannot delineate the motives that led <lb/>
                    <pb n="139" entity="eaf033v1_0180" pid="uva-lib:349210"/> me on. I now speak as
                    if no remnant of doubt existed in my <lb/> mind as to the supernatural origin of
                    these sounds; but this <lb/> is owing to the imperfection of my language, for I
                    only mean <lb/> that the belief was more permanent, and visited more <reg
                        orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg>
                    <lb/> my sober meditations than its opposite. The <reg orig="imme-|diate"
                        >immediate</reg>
                    <lb/> effects served only to undermine the foundations of <lb/> my judgment and
                    precipitate my resolutions.</p>
                <p>I must either advance or return. I chose the former, <lb/> and began to ascend
                    the stairs. The silence underwent no <lb/> second interruption. My chamber door
                    was closed, but <lb/> unlocked, and, aided by vehement efforts of my courage,
                    <lb/> I opened and looked in.</p>
                <p>No hideous or uncommon object was discernible. The <lb/> danger, indeed, might
                    easily have lurked out of sight, have <lb/> sprung upon me as I entered, and
                    have rent me with his <lb/> iron talons; but I was blind to this fate, and
                    advanced, <lb/> though cautiously, into the room.</p>
                <p>Still every thing wore its accustomed aspect. Neither <lb/> lamp nor candle was
                    to be found. Now, for the first time, <lb/> suspicions were suggested as to the
                    nature of the light which <lb/> I had seen. Was it possible to have been the
                    companion of <lb/> that supernatural visage; a meteorous refulgence <reg
                        orig="produci-|ble">producible</reg>
                    <lb/> at the will of him to whom that visage belonged, and <lb/> partaking of
                    the nature of that which accompanied my <lb/> father's death?</p>
                <p>The closet was near, and I remembered the complicated <lb/> horrors of which it
                    had been productive. Here, perhaps, <lb/> was enclosed the source of my peril,
                    and the gratification of <lb/> my curiosity. Should I adventure once more to
                    explore its <lb/> recesses? This was a resolution not easily formed. I was <lb/>
                    suspended in thought; when glancing my eye on a table, I <lb/> perceived a
                    written paper. Carwin's hand was instantly <reg orig="re-|cognised"
                        >recognised</reg>, <lb/> and snatching up the paper, I read as
                    follows:&mdash;</p>
                <p>"There was folly in expecting your compliance with my <lb/> invitation. Judge how
                    I was disappointed in finding another <lb/> in your place. I have waited, but to
                    wait any longer would <lb/> be perilous. I shall still seek an interview, but it
                    must be <lb/> at a different time and place; meanwhile, I will write this&mdash;
                    <lb/> How will you bear&mdash;How inexplicable will be this <reg
                        orig="transac-|tion!&mdash;An">transaction!&mdash;An</reg>
                    <lb/> event so unexpected&mdash;a sight so horrible!"</p>
                <pb n="140" entity="eaf033v1_0181" pid="uva-lib:349211"/>
                <p>Such was this abrupt and unsatisfactory script. The ink <lb/> was yet moist, the
                    hand was that of Carwin. Hence it <lb/> was to be inferred that he had this
                    moment left the <reg orig="apart-|ment">apartment</reg>, <lb/> or was still in
                    it. I looked back, on the sudden <reg orig="ex-|pectation">expectation</reg>
                    <lb/> of seeing him behind me.</p>
                <p>What other did he mean? What transaction had taken <lb/> place adverse to my
                    expectations? What sight was about <lb/> to be exhibited? I looked around me
                    once more, but saw <lb/> nothing which indicated strangeness. Again I remembered
                    <lb/> the closet, and was resolved to seek in that the solution of <lb/> of
                    these mysteries. Here, perhaps, was enclosed the scene <lb/> destined to awaken
                    my horrors and baffle my foresight.</p>
                <p>I have already said, that the entrance into this closet was <lb/> beside my bed,
                    which, on two sides, was closely shrouded <lb/> by curtains. On that side
                    nearest the closet, the curtain was <lb/> raised. As I passed along I cast my
                    eye thither. I started, <lb/> and looked again. I bore a light in my hand, and
                    brought <lb/> it nearer my eyes, in order to dispel any illusive mists that
                    <lb/> might have hovered before them. Once more I fixed my <lb/> eyes upon the
                    bed, in hope that this more steadfast scrutiny <lb/> would annihilate the object
                    which before seemed to be there.</p>
                <p>This then was the sight which Carwin had predicted! <lb/> This was the event
                    which my understanding was to find <reg orig="in-|explicable"
                    >inexplicable</reg>! <lb/> This was the fate which had been reserved <lb/> for
                    me, but which, by some untoward chance, had befallen <lb/> another!</p>
                <p>I had not been terrified by empty menaces. Violation <lb/> and death awaited my
                    entrance into this chamber. Some <lb/> inscrutable chance had led <hi
                        rend="italic">her</hi> hither before me, and the <reg orig="merci-|less"
                        >merciless</reg>
                    <lb/> fangs of which I was designed to be the prey, had <reg orig="mis-|taken"
                        >mistaken</reg>
                    <lb/> their victim, and had fixed themselves in <hi rend="italic">her</hi>
                    heart. <lb/> But where was my safety? Was the mischief exhausted <lb/> or flown?
                    The steps of the assassin had just been here; <lb/> they could not be far off;
                    in a moment he would rush into <lb/> my presence, and I should perish under the
                    same polluting <lb/> and suffocating grasp!</p>
                <p>My frame shook, and my knees were unable to support <lb/> me. I gazed alternately
                    at the closet door and at the door <lb/> of my room. At one of these avenues
                    would enter the <lb/> exterminator of my honor and my life. I was prepared for <lb/>
                    <pb n="141" entity="eaf033v1_0182" pid="uva-lib:349212">

                    my power to use them were gone. I was <lb/> not qualified, by education and
                    experience, to encounter <lb/> perils like these; or, perhaps, I was powerless
                    because I <lb/> was again assaulted by surprise, and had not fortified my <lb/>
                    mind by foresight and previous reflection against a scene <lb/> like this.</p>
                <p>Fears for my own safety again yielded place to <reg orig="reflec-|tions"
                        >reflections</reg>
                    <lb/> on the scene before me. I fixed my eyes upon her <lb/> countenance. My
                    sister's well known and beloved features <lb/> could not be concealed by
                    convulsion or lividness. What <lb/> direful illusion led thee hither? Bereft of
                    thee, what hold <lb/> on happiness remains to thy offspring and thy spouse? To
                    <lb/> lose thee by a common fate would have been sufficiently <lb/> hard; but
                    thus suddenly to perish&mdash;to become the prey of <lb/> this ghastly death!
                    How will a spectacle like this be <reg orig="en-|dured">endured</reg>
                    <lb/> by Wieland? To die beneath his grasp would not <lb/> satisfy thy enemy.
                    This was mercy to the evils which he <lb/> previously made thee suffer! After
                    these evils death was <lb/> a boon which thou besoughtest him to grant. He
                    entertained <lb/> no enmity against thee; I was the object of his treason; <lb/>
                    but by some tremendous mistake his fury was misplaced. <lb/> But how comest thou
                    hither? and where was Wieland in <lb/> thy hour of distress?</p>
                <p>I approached the corpse; I lifted the still flexible hand, <lb/> and kissed the
                    lips which were breathless. Her flowing <lb/> drapery was discomposed. I
                    restored it to order, and <lb/> seating myself on the bed, again fixed steadfast
                    eyes upon <lb/> her countenance. I cannot distinctly recollect the <reg
                        orig="rumina-|tions">ruminations</reg>
                    <lb/> of that moment. I saw confusedly, but forcibly, that <lb/> every hope was
                    extinguished with the life of <hi rend="italic">Catharine.</hi>
                    <lb/> All happiness and dignity must henceforth be banished from <lb/> the house
                    and name of Wieland; all that remained was to <lb/> linger out in agonies a
                    short existence; and leave to the <lb/> world a monument of blasted hopes and
                    changeable fortune. <lb/> Pleyel was already lost to me; yet, while Catharine
                    lived <lb/> life was not a detestable possession; but now, severed from <lb/>
                    the companion of my infancy, the partaker of all my <lb/> thoughts, my cares,
                    and my wishes, I was like one set <lb/> afloat upon a stormy sea, and hanging
                    his safety upon a <lb/>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">I had</hi> no inclination nor power to move from this spot.
                    <lb/> For more than an hour, my faculties and limbs seemed to <lb/> be deprived
                    of all activity. The door below creaked on <lb/> its hinges, and steps ascended
                    the stairs. My wandering <lb/> and confused thoughts were instantly recalled by
                    these <lb/> sounds, and dropping the curtain of the bed, I moved to a <lb/> part
                    of the room where any one who entered should be <lb/> visible; such are the
                    vibrations of sentiment, that <reg orig="notwith-|standing"
                        >notwithstanding</reg>
                    <lb/> the seeming fulfilment of my fears, and increase <lb/> of my danger, I was
                    conscious, on this occasion, to no <lb/> turbulence but that of curiosity.</p>
                <p>At length he entered the apartment, and I recognised <lb/> my brother. It was the
                    same Wieland whom I had ever <lb/> seen. Yet his features were pervaded by a new
                    expression. <lb/> I supposed him unacquainted with the fate of his wife, <lb/>
                    and his appearance confirmed this persuasion. A brow <lb/> expanding into
                    exultation I had hitherto never seen in <lb/> him, yet such a brow did he now
                    wear. Not only was he <lb/> unapprized of the disaster that had happened, but
                    some <lb/> joyous occurrence had betided. What a reverse was <lb/> preparing to
                    annihilate his transitory bliss! No husband <lb/> ever doated more fondly, for
                    no wife ever claimed so <lb/> boundless a devotion. I was not uncertain as to
                    the effects <lb/> to flow from the discovery of her fate. I confided not at
                    <lb/> all in the efforts of his reason or his piety. There were <lb/> few evils
                    which his modes of thinking would not disarm of <lb/> their sting; but here, all
                    opiates to grief, and all compellers <lb/> of patience were vain. This spectacle
                    would be <reg orig="unavoid-|ably">unavoidably</reg>
                    <lb/> followed by the outrages of desperation, and a <reg orig="rush-|ing"
                        >rushing</reg>
                    <lb/> to death.</p>
                <p>For the present, I neglected to ask myself what motive <lb/>
                    <pb n="143" entity="eaf033v1_0184" pid="uva-lib:349214"/> brought him hither. I
                    was only fearful of the effects to <lb/> flow from the sight of the dead. Yet
                    could it be long <reg orig="con-|cealed">concealed</reg>
                    <lb/> from him? Some time and speedily he would <reg orig="ob-|tain"
                        >obtain</reg>
                    <lb/> this knowledge. No stratagems could considerably or <lb/> usefully prolong
                    his ignorance. All that could be sought <lb/> was to take away the abruptness of
                    the change, and shut out <lb/> the confusion of despair, and the inroads of
                    madness; but <lb/> I knew my brother, and knew that all exertions to console
                    <lb/> him would be fruitless.</p>
                <p>What could I say? I was mute, and poured forth those <lb/> tears on his account,
                    which my own unhappiness had been <lb/> unable to extort. In the midst of my
                    tears, I was not <reg orig="un-|observant">unobservant</reg>
                    <lb/> of his motions. These were of a nature to rouse <lb/> some other sentiment
                    than grief, or, at least, to mix with it <lb/> a portion of astonishment.</p>
                <p>His countenance suddenly became troubled. His hands <lb/> were clasped with a
                    force that left the print of his nails in <lb/> his flesh. His eyes were fixed
                    on my feet. His brain <lb/> seemed to swell beyond its continent. He did not
                    cease <lb/> to breathe, but his breath was stifled into groans. I had <lb/>
                    never witnessed the hurricane of human passions. My <reg orig="ele-|ment"
                        >element</reg>
                    <lb/> had, till lately, been all sunshine and calm. I was <lb/> unconversant
                    with the altitudes and energies of sentiment, <lb/> and was transfixed with
                    inexplicable horror by the <reg orig="symp-|toms">symptoms</reg>
                    <lb/> which I now beheld.</p>
                <p>After a silence and a conflict which I could not interpret, <lb/> he lifted his
                    eyes to heaven, and in broken accents <reg orig="ex-|claimed">exclaimed</reg>,
                    <lb/> "This is too much! any victim but this, and thy <lb/> will be done. Have I
                    not sufficiently attested my faith and <lb/> my obedience? She that is gone.
                    they that have perished, <lb/> were linked with my soul by ties which only thy
                    command <lb/> would have broken; but here is sanctity and excellence <lb/>
                    surpassing human. This workmanship is thine, and it <reg orig="can-|not"
                        >cannot</reg>
                    <lb/> be thy will to heap it into ruins."</p>
                <p>Here suddenly unclasping his hands, he struck one of <lb/> them against his
                    forehead, and continued&mdash;"Wretch! who <lb/> made thee quicksighted in the
                    councils of thy Maker? <reg orig="De-|liverance">Deliverance</reg>
                    <lb/> from mortal fetters is awarded to this being, and <lb/> thou art the

                <p>So saying, Wieland advanced towards me. His words <lb/>
                    <pb n="144" entity="eaf033v1_0185" pid="uva-lib:349215"/> and his motions were
                    without meaning, except on one <reg orig="sup-|position">supposition</reg>.
                    <lb/> The death of Catharine was already known to <lb/> him, and that knowledge,
                    as might have been suspected, <lb/> had destroyed his reason. I had feared
                    nothing less; but <lb/> now that I beheld the extinction of a mind the most <reg
                        orig="lumi-|nous">luminous</reg>
                    <lb/> and penetrating that ever dignified the human form, <lb/> my sensations
                    were fraught with new and insupportable <reg orig="an-|guish">anguish</reg>.</p>
                <p>I had not time to reflect in what way my own safety <lb/> would be effected by
                    this revolution, or what I had to <lb/> dread from the wild conceptions of a
                    madman. He <reg orig="ad-|vanced">advanced</reg>
                    <lb/> towards me. Some hollow noises were wafted <lb/> by the breeze. Confused
                    clamors were succeeded by <lb/> many feet traversing the grass, and then
                    crowding into the <lb/> piazza.</p>
                <p>These sounds suspended my brother's purpose, and he <lb/> stood to listen. The
                    signals multiplied and grew louder; <lb/> perceiving this, he turned from me,
                    and hurried out of my <lb/> sight. All about me was pregnant with motives to
                        <reg orig="aston-|ishment">astonishment</reg>. <lb/> My sister's corpse,
                    Wieland's frantic demeanor, <lb/> and, at length, this crowd of visitants so
                    little accorded with <lb/> my foresight, that my mental progress was stopped.
                    The <lb/> impulse had ceased which was accustomed to give motion <lb/> and order
                    to my thoughts.</p>
                <p>Footsteps thronged upon the stairs, and presently many <lb/> faces shewed
                    themselves within the door of my apartment. <lb/> These looks were full of alarm
                    and watchfulness. They <lb/> pryed into corners as if in search of some
                    fugitive; next their <lb/> gaze was fixed upon me, and betokened all the
                    vehemence <lb/> of terror and pity. For a time I questioned whether these <lb/>
                    were not shapes and faces like that which I had seen at <lb/> the bottom of the
                    stairs, creatures of my fancy or airy <reg orig="ex-|istences"
                    >existences</reg>.</p>
                <p>My eye wandered from one to another, till at length it <lb/> fell on a
                    countenance which I well knew. It was that of <lb/> Mr. Hallet. This man was a
                    distant kinsman of my mother, <lb/> venerable for his age, his uprightness, and
                    sagacity. He <lb/> had long discharged the functions of a magistrate and good
                    <lb/> citizen. If any terrors remained, his presence was <reg
                        orig="suffi-|cient">sufficient</reg>
                    <lb/> to dispel them.</p>

                </pb>
                <p>He approached, took my hand with a compassionate air, <lb/> and said in a low
                    voice, "Where, my dear Clara, are your <lb/> brother and sister?" I made no
                    answer, but pointed to the <lb/> bed. His attendants drew aside the curtain, and
                    while <lb/> their eyes glared with horror at the spectacle which they <lb/>
                    beheld, those of Mr. Hallet overflowed with tears.</p>
                <p>After considerable pause, he once more turned to me. <lb/> "My dear girl, this
                    sight is not for you. Can you confide <lb/> in my care, and that of Mrs.
                    Baynton's? We will see <lb/> all performed that circumstances require."</p>
                <p>I made strenuous opposition to this request. I insisted <lb/> on remaining near
                    her till she was interred. His <reg orig="remon-|strances">remonstrances</reg>,
                    <lb/> however, and my own feelings, shewed me the <lb/> propriety of a temporary
                    dereliction. Louisa stood in <lb/> need of a comforter, and my brother's
                    children of a nurse. <lb/> My unhappy brother was himself an object of
                    solicitude <lb/> and care. At length I consented to relinquish the corpse, <lb/>
                    and go to my brother's, whose house, I said, would need a <lb/> mistress, and
                    his children a parent.</p>
                <p>During this discourse, my venerable friend struggled with <lb/> his tears, but my
                    last intimation called them forth with fresh <lb/> violence. Meanwhile, his
                    attendants stood round in <reg orig="mourn-|ful">mournful</reg>
                    <lb/> silence, gazing on me and at each other. I repeated <lb/> my resolution,
                    and rose to execute it; but he took my hand <lb/> to detain me. His countenance
                    betrayed irresolution and <lb/> reluctance. I requested him to state the reason
                    of his <lb/> opposition to this measure. I entreated him to be explicit. <lb/> I
                    told him that my brother had just been there, and that I <lb/> knew his
                    condition. This misfortune had driven him to <lb/> madness, and his offspring
                    must want a protector. If <lb/> he chose, I would resign Wieland to his care;
                    but his <lb/> innocent and helpless babes stood in instant need of nurse <lb/>
                    and mother, and these offices I would by no means allow <lb/> another to perform
                    while I had life.</p>
                <p>Every word that I uttered seemed to augment his <lb/> perplexity and distress. At
                    last he said, "I think, Clara, I <lb/> have entitled myself to some regard from
                    you. You have <lb/> professed your willingness to oblige me. Now I call upon
                    <lb/> you to confer upon me the highest obligation in your power. <lb/>
                    <pb n="146" entity="eaf033v1_0187" pid="uva-lib:349217"/> Permit Mrs. Baynton to
                    have the management of your <lb/> brother's house for two or three days; then it
                    shall be <lb/> yours to act in it as you please. No matter what are my <lb/>
                    motives in making this request; perhaps I think your age, <lb/> your sex, or the
                    distress which this disaster must occasion, <lb/> incapaciates you for the
                    office. Surely you have no doubt <lb/> of Mrs. Baynton's tenderness or
                    discretion."</p>
                <p>New ideas now rushed into my mind. I fixed my eyes <lb/> steadfastly on Mr.
                    Hallet. "Are they well?" said I. "Is <lb/> Louisa well? Are Benjamin, and
                    William, and Constantine, <lb/> and Little Clara, are they safe? Tell me truly,
                    I beseech <lb/> you!"</p>
                <p>"They are well," he replied; "they are perfectly <lb/> safe."</p>
                <p>"Fear no effeminate weakness in me; I can bear to hear <lb/> the truth. Tell me
                    truly, are they well?"</p>
                <p>He again assured me that they were well.</p>
                <p>"What then," resumed I, "do you fear? Is it possible <lb/> for any calamity to
                    disqualify me for performing my duty <lb/> to these helpless innocents? I am
                    willing to divide the <lb/> care of them with Mrs. Baynton; I shall be grateful
                    for <lb/> her sympathy and aid; but what should I be to desert them <lb/> at an
                    hour like this!"</p>
                <p>I will cut short this distressful dialogue. I still persisted <lb/> in my
                    purpose, and he still persisted in his opposition. This <lb/> excited my
                    suspicions anew; but these were removed by <lb/> solemn declarations of their
                    safety. I could not explain <lb/> this conduct in my friend; but at length
                    consented to go to <lb/> the city, provided I should see them for a few minutes
                    at <lb/> present, and should return on the morrow.</p>
                <p>Even this arrangement was objected to. At length he <lb/> told me they were
                    removed to the city. Why were they <lb/> removed, I asked, and whither? My
                    importunities would <lb/> not now be eluded. My suspicions were roused, and no
                    <lb/> evasion or artifice was sufficient to allay them. Many of <lb/> the
                    audience began to give vent to their emotions in tears. <lb/> Mr. Hallet himself
                    seemed as if the conflict were too hard <lb/> to be longer sustained. Something
                    whispered to my heart <lb/> that havoc had been wider than I now witnessed. I
                    suspected <lb/>
                    <pb n="147" entity="eaf033v1_0188" pid="uva-lib:349218"/> this concealment to
                    arise from apprehensions of the effects <lb/> which a knowledge of the truth
                    would produce in me. I <lb/> once more entreated him to inform me truly of their
                    state. <lb/> To enforce my entreaties, I put on an air of insensibility. <lb/>
                    "I can guess," said I, "what has happened&mdash;They are <lb/> indeed beyond the
                    reach of injury, for they are dead! Is <lb/> it not so?" My voice faltered in
                    spite of my courageous <lb/> efforts.</p>
                <p>"Yes," said he, "they are dead! Dead by the same <lb/> fate, and by the same
                    hand, with their mother!"</p>
                <p>"Dead!" replied I; "what, all?"</p>
                <p>"All!" replied he; "he spared <hi rend="italic">not one!</hi>"</p>
                <p>Allow me, my friends, to close my eyes upon the after <lb/> scene. Why should I
                    protract a tale which I already begin <lb/> to feel is too long? Over this scene
                    at least let me pass <lb/> lightly. Here, indeed, my narrative would be
                    imperfect. <lb/> All was tempestuous commotion in my heart and in my <lb/>
                    brain. I have no memory for aught but unconscious <reg orig="transi-|tions"
                        >transitions</reg>
                    <lb/> and rueful sights. I was ingenious and indefatigable <lb/> in the
                    invention of torments. I would not dispense with <lb/> any spectacle adapted to
                    exasperate my grief. Each pale <lb/> and mangled form I crushed to my bosom.
                    Louisa, whom <lb/> I loved with so ineffable a passion, was denied to me at
                    first, <lb/> but my obstinacy conquered their reluctance.</p>
                <p>They led the way into a darkened hall. A lamp pendant <lb/> from the ceiling was
                    uncovered, and they pointed to a table. <lb/> The assassin had defrauded me of
                    my last and miserable <lb/> consolation. I sought not in her visage, for the
                    tinge of the <lb/> morning, and the lustre of heaven. These had vanished <lb/>
                    with life; but I hoped for liberty to print a last kiss upon <lb/> her lips.
                    This was denied me; for such had been the <lb/> merciless blow that destroyed
                    her, that not a <hi rend="italic">lineament <lb/> remained!</hi></p>
                <p>I was carried hence to the city. Mrs. Hallet was my <lb/> companion and my nurse.
                    Why should I dwell upon the <lb/> rage of fever, and the effusions of delirium?
                    Carwin was <lb/> the phantom that pursued my dreams, the giant oppressor <lb/>
                    under whose arm I was for ever on the point of being <lb/> crushed. Strenuous
                    muscles were required to hinder my <lb/>
                    <pb n="148" entity="eaf033v1_0189" pid="uva-lib:349219"/> flight, and hearts of
                    steel to withstand the eloquence of my <lb/> fears. In vain I called upon them
                    to look upward, to mark <lb/> his sparkling rage and scowling contempt. All I
                    sought <lb/> was to fly from the stroke that was lifted. Then I heaped <lb/>
                    upon my guards the most vehement reproaches, or betook <lb/> myself to wailings
                    on the helplessness of my condition.</p>
                <p>This malady, at length, declined, and my weeping friends <lb/> began to look for
                    my restoration. Slowly, and with <lb/> intermitted beams, memory revisited me.
                    The scenes that <lb/> I had witnessed were revived, became the theme of <reg
                        orig="delib-|eration">deliberation</reg>
                    <lb/> and deduction, and called forth the effusions of <lb/> more rational

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">I had</hi> imperfectly recovered my strength, when I was
                    <lb/> informed of the arrival of my mother's brother, Thomas <lb/> Cambridge.
                    Ten years since, he went to Europe, and was <lb/> a surgeon in the British
                    forces in Germany, during the whole <lb/> of the late war. After its conclusion,
                    some connexion that he <lb/> had formed with an Irish officer, made him retire
                    into Ireland. <lb/> Intercourse had been punctually maintained by letters with
                    <lb/> his sister's children, and hopes were given that he would <lb/> shortly
                    return to his native country, and pass his old age in <lb/> our society. He was
                    now in an evil hour arrived.</p>
                <p>I desired an interview with him for numerous and urgent <lb/> reasons. With the
                    first returns of my understanding I had <lb/> anxiously sought information of
                    the fate of my brother. <lb/> During the course of my disease I had never seen
                    him; and <lb/> vague and unsatisfactory answers were returned to all my <lb/>
                    inquiries. I had vehemently interrogated Mrs. Hallet and <lb/> her husband, and
                    solicited an interview with this <reg orig="unfortu-|nate">unfortunate</reg>
                    <lb/> man; but they mysteriously insinuated that his <reg orig="rea-|son"
                        >reason</reg>
                    <lb/> was still unsettled, and that his circumstances rendered <lb/> an
                    interview impossible. Their reserve on the particulars <lb/> of this
                    destruction, and the author of it, was equally <reg orig="invin-|cible"
                        >invincible</reg>.</p>
                <pb n="149" entity="eaf033v1_0190" pid="uva-lib:349220"/>
                <p>For some time, finding all my efforts fruitless, I had <reg orig="de-|sisted"
                        >desisted</reg>
                    <lb/> from direct inquiries and solicitations, determined, as <lb/> soon as my
                    strength was sufficiently renewed, to pursue <lb/> other means of dispelling my
                    uncertainty. In this state of <lb/> things my uncle's arrival and intention to
                    visit me were <reg orig="an-|nounced">announced</reg>. <lb/> I almost shuddered
                    to behold the face of this <lb/> man. When I reflected on the disasters that had
                    befallen <lb/> us, I was half unwilling to witness that dejection and grief
                    <lb/> which would be disclosed in his countenance. But I <reg orig="be-|lieved"
                        >believed</reg>
                    <lb/> that all transactions had been thoroughly disclosed to <lb/> him, and
                    confided in my importunity to extort from him the <lb/> knowledge that I
                    sought.</p>
                <p>I had no doubt as to the person of our enemy; but the <lb/> motives that urged
                    him to perpetrate these horrors, the <lb/> means that he used, and his present
                    condition, were totally <lb/> unknown. It was reasonable to expect some
                    information <lb/> on this head, from my uncle. I therefore waited his <reg
                        orig="com-|ing">coming</reg>
                    <lb/> with impatience. At length, in the dusk of the evening, <lb/> and in my
                    solitary chamber, this meeting took place.</p>
                <p>This man was our nearest relation, and had ever treated <lb/> us with the
                    affection of a parent. Our meeting, therefore, <lb/> could not be without
                    overflowing tenderness and gloomy <lb/> joy. He rather encouraged than
                    restrained the tears that I <lb/> poured out in his arms, and took upon himself
                    the task of <lb/> comforter. Allusions to recent disasters could not be long
                    <lb/> omitted. One topic facilitated the admission of another. <lb/> At length,
                    I mentioned and deplored the ignorance in which <lb/> I had been kept respecting
                    my brother's destiny, and the <lb/> circumstances of our misfortunes. I
                    entreated him to tell <lb/> me what was Wieland's condition, and what progress
                    had <lb/> been made in detecting or punishing the author of this <reg
                        orig="un-|heard-of">unheard-of</reg>
                    <lb/> devastation.</p>
                <p>"The author!" said he; "Do you know the author?"</p>
                <p>"Alas!" I answered, "I am too well acquainted with him. <lb/> The story of the
                    grounds of my suspicions would be painful <lb/> and too long. I am not apprized
                    of the extent of your <reg orig="pre-|sent">present</reg>
                    <lb/> knowledge. There are none but Wieland, Pleyel, <lb/> and myself, who are
                    able to relate certain facts."</p>
                <p>"Spare yourself the pain," said he. "All that Wieland <lb/> and Pleyel can
                    communicate, I know already. If any <lb/>
                    <pb n="150" entity="eaf033v1_0191" pid="uva-lib:349221"/> thing of moment has
                    fallen within your own exclusive <lb/> knowledge, and the relation be not too
                    arduous for your <lb/> present strength, I confess I am desirous of hearing it.
                        <reg orig="Per-|haps">Perhaps</reg>
                    <lb/> you allude to one by the name of Carwin. I will <reg orig="anti-|cipate"
                        >anticipate</reg>
                    <lb/> your curiosity by saying, that since these disasters, no <lb/> one has
                    seen or heard of him. His agency is, therefore, <lb/> a mystery still
                    unsolved."</p>
                <p>I readily complied with his request, and related as <reg orig="dis-|tinctly"
                        >distinctly</reg>
                    <lb/> as I could, though in general terms, the events <reg orig="trans-|acted"
                        >transacted</reg>
                    <lb/> in the summer house and my chamber. He listened <lb/> without apparent
                    surprise to the tale of Pleyel's errors and <lb/> suspicions, and with augmented
                    seriousness, to my <reg orig="narra-|tive">narrative</reg>
                    <lb/> of the warnings and inexplicable vision, and the letter <lb/> found upon
                    the table. I waited for his comments.</p>
                <p>"You gather from this," said he, "that Carwin is the <reg orig="au-|thor"
                        >author</reg>
                    <lb/> of all this misery."</p>
                <p>"Is it not," answered I, "an unavoidable inference? But <lb/> what know you
                    respecting it? Was it possible to execute <lb/> this mischief without witness or
                    coadjutor? I beseech you <lb/> to relate to me, when and why Mr. Hallet was
                    summoned <lb/> to the scene, and by whom this disaster was first suspected <lb/>
                    or discovered. Surely, suspicion must have fallen upon <lb/> some one, and
                    pursuit was made."</p>
                <p>My uncle rose from his seat, and traversed the floor with <lb/> hasty steps. His
                    eyes were fixed upon the ground, and he <lb/> seemed buried in perplexity. At
                    length he paused, and <lb/> said with an emphatic tone, "It is true; the
                    instrument is <lb/> known. Carwin may have plotted, but the execution was <lb/>
                    another's. That other is found, and his deed is <reg orig="ascer-|tained"

                <p>"Good heaven!" I exclaimed, "what say you? Was <lb/> not Carwin the assassin?
                    Could any hand but his have <reg orig="car-|ried">carried</reg>
                    <lb/> into act this dreadful purpose?"</p>
                <p>"Have I not said," returned he, "that the performance was <lb/> another's?
                    Carwin, perhaps, or heaven, or insanity, <reg orig="prompt-|ed">prompted</reg>
                    <lb/> the murderer; but Carwin is unknown. The actual <lb/> performer has, long
                    since, been called to judgment and <reg orig="con-|victed">convicted</reg>,
                    <lb/> and is, at this moment, at the bottom of a dungeon <lb/> loaded with
                    chains."</p>
                <p>I lifted my hands and eyes. "Who then is this assassin? <lb/>
                    <pb n="151" entity="eaf033v1_0192" pid="uva-lib:349222"/> By what means, and
                    whither was he traced? What is the <lb/> testimony of his guilt?"</p>
                <p>"His own, corroborated with that of a servant maid who <lb/> spied the murder of
                    the children from a closet where she <lb/> was concealed. The magistrate
                    returned from your <reg orig="dwell-|ing">dwelling</reg>
                    <lb/> to your brother's. He was employed in hearing and <lb/> recording the
                    testimony of the only witness, when the <lb/> criminal himself, unexpected,
                    unsolicited, unsought, entered <lb/> the hall, acknowledged his guilt, and
                    rendered himself up to <lb/> justice.</p>
                <p>"He has since been summoned to the bar. The audience <lb/> was composed of
                    thousands whom rumors of this wonderful <lb/> event had attracted from the
                    greatest distance. A long and <lb/> impartial examination was made, and the
                    prisoner was called <lb/> upon for his defence. In compliance with this call he
                        <reg orig="de-|livered">delivered</reg>
                    <lb/> an ample relation of his motives and actions." There <lb/> he stopped.</p>
                <p>I besought him to say who this criminal was, and what the <lb/> instigations that
                    compelled him. My uncle was silent. I <lb/> urged this inquiry with new force. I
                    reverted to my own <lb/> knowledge, and sought in this some basis to conjecture.
                    I <lb/> ran over the scanty catalogue of the men whom I knew; I <lb/> lighted on
                    no one who was qualified for ministering to malice <lb/> like this. Again I
                    resorted to importunity. Had I ever <lb/> seen the criminal? Was it sheer
                    cruelty or diabolical <reg orig="re-|venge">revenge</reg>
                    <lb/> that produced this overthrow?</p>
                <p>He surveyed me, for a considerable time, and listened to <lb/> my interrogations
                    in silence. At length he spoke: "Clara, <lb/> I have known thee by report, and
                    in some degree by <reg orig="ob-|servation">observation</reg>. <lb/> Thou art a
                    being of no vulgar sort. Thy friends <lb/> have hitherto treated thee as a
                    child. They meant well, <lb/> but, perhaps, they were unacquainted with thy
                    strength. I <lb/> assure myself that nothing will surpass thy fortitude.</p>
                <p>"Thou art anxious to know the destroyer of thy family, <lb/> his actions, and his
                    motives. Shall I call him to thy <reg orig="pre-|sence">presence</reg>, <lb/>
                    and permit him to confess before thee? Shall I make <lb/> him the narrator of
                    his own tale?"</p>
                <p>I started on my feet, and looked round me with fearful <lb/> glances, as if the
                    murderer was close at hand. "What do <lb/> you mean?" said I; "put an end, I
                    beseech you, to this <lb/> suspense."</p>
                <pb n="152" entity="eaf033v1_0193" pid="uva-lib:349223"/>
                <p>"Be not alarmed; you will never more behold the face <lb/> of this criminal,
                    unless he be gifted with supernatural <lb/> strength, and sever like threads the
                    constraint of links and <lb/> bolts. I have said that the assassin was arraigned
                    at the <lb/> bar, and that the trial ended with a summons from the judge <lb/>
                    to confess or to vindicate his actions. A reply was <reg orig="immedi-|ately"
                        >immediately</reg>
                    <lb/> made with significance of gesture, and a tranquil <reg orig="majes-|ty"
                        >majesty</reg>, <lb/> which denoted less of humanity than godhead. Judges,
                    <lb/> advocates and auditors were panic struck and breathless <lb/> with
                    attention. One of the hearers faithfully recorded the <lb/> speech. There it
                    is," continued he, putting a roll of <reg orig="pa-|pers">papers</reg>
                    <lb/> in my hand, "you may read it at your leisure."</p>
                <p>With these words my uncle left me alone. My curiosity <lb/> refused me a moment's
                    delay. I opened the papers, and <lb/> read as follows.</p>

                    <lb/> called upon for his defence. He looked around him for <lb/> some time in

                <p>"It is strange; I am known to my judges and my auditors. <lb/> Who is there
                    present a stranger to the character of Wieland? <lb/> who knows him not as a

                <p>"It is true, they were slain by me; they all perished by <lb/> my hand. The task

                <p>"You know that they are dead, and that they were killed <lb/> by me. What more

                    your eyes are not shut; your reason is still vigorous; your <lb/> memory has not

                    <lb/> in this charge! You lead me hither manacled as a <lb/> felon; you deem me
                    worthy of a vile and tormenting death!</p>
                <p>"Who are they whom I have devoted to death? My <lb/> wife&mdash;the little ones,
                    that drew their being from me&mdash;that <lb/> creature who, as she surpassed
                    them in excellence, claimed <lb/> a larger affection than those whom natural
                    affinities bound <lb/> to my heart. Think ye that malice could have urged me
                    <lb/> to this deed? Hide your audacious fronts from the scrutiny <lb/> of
                    heaven. Take refuge in some cavern unvisited by <lb/> human eyes. Ye may deplore
                    your wickedness or folly, but <lb/> ye cannot expiate it.</p>
                <p>"Think not that I speak for your sakes. Hug to your <lb/> hearts this destestable
                    infatuation. Deem me still a <reg orig="mur-|derer">murderer</reg>, <lb/> and
                    drag me to untimely death. I make not an effort <lb/> to dispel your illusion; I
                    utter not a word to cure you of <lb/> your sanguinary folly; but there are
                    probably some in this <lb/> assembly who have come from far; for their sakes,
                    whose <lb/> distance has disabled them from knowing me, I will tell <lb/> what I
                    have done, and why.</p>
                <p>"It is needless to say that God is the object of my <reg orig="su-|preme"
                        >supreme</reg>
                    <lb/> passion. I have cherished, in his presence, a single <lb/> and upright
                    heart. I have thirsted for the knowledge of <lb/> his will. I have burnt with
                    ardor to approve my faith and <lb/> my obedience.</p>
                <p>"My days have been spent in searching for the revelation <lb/> of that will; but
                    my days have been mournful, because my <lb/> search failed. I solicited
                    direction; I turned on every side <lb/> where glimmerings of light could be
                    discovered. I have not <lb/> been wholly uninformed; but my knowledge has always
                        <reg orig="stop-|ped">stopped</reg>
                    <lb/> short of certainty. Dissatisfaction has insinuated itself into <lb/> all
                    my thoughts. My purposes have been pure; my wishes <reg orig="in-|defatigable"
                        >indefatigable</reg>; <lb/> but not till lately were these purposes <reg
                        orig="thorough-|ly">thoroughly</reg>
                    <lb/> accomplished, and these wishes fully gratified.</p>
                <p>"I thank thee, my father, for thy bounty; that thou didst <lb/> not ask a less
                    sacrifice than this; that thou placedst me in a <lb/> condition to testify my
                    submission to thy will! What have <lb/> I withheld which it was thy pleasure to
                    exact? Now may <lb/>
                    <pb n="154" entity="eaf033v1_0195" pid="uva-lib:349225"/> I, with dauntless and
                    erect eye, claim my reward, since I <lb/> have given thee the treasure of my
                    soul.</p>
                <p>"I was at my own house; it was late in the evening; <lb/> my sister had gone to
                    the city, but proposed to return. It <lb/> was in expectation of her return that
                    my wife and I delayed <lb/> going to bed beyond the usual hour; the rest of the
                    family, <lb/> however, were retired.</p>
                <p>"My mind was contemplative and calm; not wholly <reg orig="de-|void">devoid</reg>
                    <lb/> of apprehension on account of my sister's safety. <reg orig="Re-|cent"
                        >Recent</reg>
                    <lb/> events, not easily explained, had suggested the existence <lb/> of some
                    danger; but this danger was without a distinct form <lb/> in our imagination,
                    and scarcely ruffled our tranquillity.</p>
                <p>"Time passed, and my sister did not arrive; her house <lb/> is at some distance
                    from mine, and though her arrangements <lb/> had been made with a view to
                    residing with us, it was <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg>
                    <lb/> that, through forgetfulness, or the occurrence of <reg orig="unfore-|seen"
                        >unforeseen</reg>
                    <lb/> emergencies, she had returned to her own dwelling.</p>
                <p>"Hence it was conceived proper that I should ascertain <lb/> the truth by going
                    thither. I went. On my way my mind <lb/> was full of those ideas which related
                    to my intellectual <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg>. <lb/> In the torrent
                    of fervid conceptions, I lost sight of <lb/> my purpose. Sometimes I stood
                    still; sometimes I <reg orig="wan-|dered">wandered</reg>
                    <lb/> from my path, and experienced some difficulty, on <lb/> recovering from my
                    fit of musing, to regain it.</p>
                <p>"The series of my thoughts is easily traced. At first <lb/> every vein beat with
                    raptures known only to the man whose <lb/> parental and conjugal love is without
                    limits, and the cup of <lb/> whose desires, immense as it is, overflows with
                    gratification. <lb/> I know not why emotions that were perpetual visitants
                    should <lb/> now have recurred with unusual energy. The transition <lb/> was not
                    new from sensations of joy to a consciousness of <lb/> gratitude. The Author of
                    my being was likewise the <reg orig="dis-|penser">dispenser</reg>
                    <lb/> of every gift with which that being was embellished. <lb/> The service to
                    which a benefactor like this was entitled, <lb/> could not be circumscribed. My
                    social sentiments were <lb/> indebted to their alliance with devotion for all
                    their value. <lb/> All passions are base, all joys feeble, all energies
                    malignant, <lb/> which are not drawn from this source.</p>
                <p>"For a time, my contemplations soared above earth and <lb/> its inhabitants. I
                    stretched forth my hands; I lifted my <lb/>
                    <pb n="155" entity="eaf033v1_0196" pid="uva-lib:349226"/> eyes, and exclaimed,
                    O! that I might be admitted to thy <lb/> presence; that mine were the supreme
                    delight of knowing <lb/> thy will, and of performing it! The blissful privilege
                    of direct <lb/> communication with thee, and of listening to the audible <lb/>
                    enunciation of thy pleasure!</p>
                <p>"What task would I not undertake, what privation would <lb/> I not cheerfully
                    endure, to testify my love of thee? Alas! <lb/> thou hidest thyself from my
                    view; glimpses only of thy <lb/> excellence and beauty are afforded me. Would
                    that a <reg orig="mo-|mentary">momentary</reg>
                    <lb/> emanation from thy glory would visit me! that some <lb/> unambiguous token
                    of thy presence would salute my senses!</p>
                <p>"In this mood, I entered the house of my sister. It was <lb/> vacant. Scarcely
                    had I regained recollection of the purpose <lb/> that brought me hither.
                    Thoughts of a different tendency <lb/> had such absolute possession of my mind,
                    that the relations <lb/> of time and space were almost obliterated from my <reg
                        orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg>. <lb/> These wanderings, however,
                    were restrained, and <lb/> I ascended to her chamber.</p>
                <p>"I had no light, and might have known by external <reg orig="ob-|servation"
                        >observation</reg>, <lb/> that the house was without any inhabitant. With
                    <lb/> this, however, I was not satisfied. I entered the room, <lb/> and the
                    object of my search not appearing, I prepared <lb/> to return.</p>
                <p>"The darkness required some caution in descending the <lb/> stair. I stretched my
                    hand to seize the balustrade by which <lb/> I might regulate my steps. How shall
                    I describe the lustre, <lb/> which, at that moment, burst upon my vision!</p>
                <p>"I was dazzled. My organs were bereaved of their <lb/> activity. My eye-lids were
                    half-closed, and my hands <lb/> withdrawn from the balustrade. A nameless fear
                    chilled <lb/> my veins, and I stood motionless. This irradiation did not <lb/>
                    retire or lessen. It seemed as if some powerful effulgence <lb/> covered me like
                    a mantle.</p>
                <p>"I opened my eyes and found all about me luminous <lb/> and glowing. It was the
                    element of heaven that flowed <lb/> around. Nothing but a fiery stream was at
                    first visible; <lb/> but, anon, a shrill voice from behind called upon me to
                    <lb/> attend.</p>
                <p>I turned. It is forbidden to describe what I saw; words, <lb/> indeed, would be
                    wanting to the task. The lineaments of <lb/>
                    <pb n="156" entity="eaf033v1_0197" pid="uva-lib:349227"/> that being, whose veil
                    was now lifted, and whose visage <lb/> beamed upon my sight, no hues of pencil
                    or of language <lb/> can portray.</p>
                <p>"As it spoke, the accents thrilled to my heart. `Thy <lb/> prayers are heard. In
                    proof of thy faith, render me thy <lb/> wife. This is the victim I choose. Call
                    her hither, and <lb/> here let her fall.'&mdash;The sound, and visage, and light

                    <lb/> at once.</p>
                <p>"What demand was this? The blood of Catharine was <lb/> to be shed! My wife was
                    to perish by my hand! I sought <lb/> opportunity to attest my virtue. Little did
                    I expect that a <lb/> proof like this would have been demanded.</p>
                <p>"My wife! I exclaimed; O God! substitute some other <lb/> victim. Make me not the
                    butcher of my wife. My own <lb/> blood is cheap. This will I pour out before
                    thee with a <lb/> willing heart; but spare, I beseech thee, this precious life,
                    <lb/> or commission some other than her husband to perform the <lb/> bloody
                    deed.</p>
                <p>"In vain. The conditions were prescribed; the decree <lb/> had gone forth, and
                    nothing remained but to execute it. I <lb/> rushed out of the house and across
                    the intermediate fields, <lb/> and stopped not till I entered my own parlor.</p>
                <p>"My wife had remained here during my absence, in <lb/> anxious expectation of my
                    return with some tidings of her <lb/> sister. I had none to communicate. For a
                    time, I was <lb/> breathless with my speed. This, and the tremors that shook
                    <lb/> my frame, and the wildness of my looks, alarmed her. <lb/> She immediately
                    suspected some disaster to have happened <lb/> to her friend, and her own speech
                    was as much <reg orig="overpow-|ered">overpowered</reg>
                    <lb/> by emotion as mine.</p>
                <p>"She was silent, but her looks manifested her impatience <lb/> to hear what I had
                    to communicate. I spoke, but with so <lb/> much precipitation as scarcely to be
                    understood; catching <lb/> her, at the same time, by the arm, and forcibly
                    pulling her <lb/> from her seat.</p>
                <p>"Come along with me; fly; waste not a moment; time <lb/> will be lost, and the
                    deed will be omitted. Tarry not; <lb/> question not; but fly with me!</p>
                <p>"This deportment added afresh to her alarms. Her <lb/> eyes pursued mine, and she
                    said, `What is the matter? For <lb/>
                    <pb n="157" entity="eaf033v1_0198" pid="uva-lib:349228">

                    </pb> God's sake, what is the matter? Where would you have <lb/> me go?'</p>
                <p>"My eyes were fixed upon her countenance while she <lb/> spoke. I thought upon
                    her virtues; I viewed her as the <lb/> mother of my babes; as my wife. I
                    recalled the purpose <lb/> for which I thus urged her attendance. My heart
                    faltered, <lb/> and I saw that I must rouse to this work all my faculties. <lb/>
                    The danger of the least delay was imminent.</p>
                <p>"I looked away from her, and again exerting my force, <lb/> drew her towards the
                    door&mdash;`You must go with <reg orig="me&mdash;in-|deed">me&mdash;indeed</reg>
                    <lb/> you must.'</p>
                <p>"In her fright she half resisted my efforts, and again <lb/> exclaimed, `Good
                    heaven! what is it you mean? Where <lb/> go? What has happened? Have you found
                    Clara?'</p>
                <p>" `Follow me, and you will see,' I answered, still urging <lb/> her reluctant
                    steps forward.</p>
                <p>" `What frenzy has seized you? Something must needs <lb/> have happened. Is she
                    sick? Have you found her?'</p>
                <p>" `Come and see. Follow me, and know for yourself.'</p>
                <p>"Still she expostulated, and besought me to explain this <lb/> mysterious
                    behavior. I could not trust myself to answer <lb/> her; to look at her; but
                    grasping her arm, I drew her after <lb/> me. She hesitated, rather through
                    confusion of mind than <lb/> from unwillingness to accompany me. This confusion
                    <lb/> gradually abated, and she moved forward, but with <reg orig="irreso-|lute"
                        >irresolute</reg>
                    <lb/> footsteps, and continual exclamations of wonder and <lb/> terror. Her
                    interrogations of `what was the matter?' <lb/> and `whither was I going?' were
                    ceaseless and vehement.</p>
                <p>"It was the scope of my efforts not to think; to keep up <lb/> a conflict and
                    uproar in my mind in which all order and <lb/> distinctness should be lost; to
                    escape from the sensations <lb/> produced by her voice. I was, therefore,
                    silent. I strove to <lb/> abridge this interval by my haste, and to waste all my
                        <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg>
                    <lb/> in furious gesticulations.</p>
                <p>"In this state of mind we reached my sister's door. She <lb/> looked at the
                    windows and saw that all was desolate&mdash; <lb/> `Why come we here? There is
                    nobody here. I will not <lb/> go in.'</p>
                <p>"Still I was dumb; but opening the door, I drew her <lb/> into the entry. This
                    was the allotted scene; here she was <lb/>
                    <pb n="158" entity="eaf033v1_0199" pid="uva-lib:349229"/> to fall. I let go her
                    hand, and pressing my palms against <lb/> my forehead, made one mighty effort to
                    work up my soul <lb/> to the deed.</p>
                <p>"In vain; it would not be; my courage was appalled; <lb/> my arms nerveless. I
                    muttered prayers that my strength <lb/> might be aided from above. They availed
                    nothing.</p>
                <p>"Horror diffused itself over me. This conviction of my <lb/> cowardice, my
                    rebellion, fastened upon me, and I stood <lb/> rigid and cold as marble. From
                    this state I was somewhat <lb/> relieved by my wife's voice, who renewed her
                    supplications <lb/> to be told why we came hither, and what was the fate of
                    <lb/> my sister.</p>
                <p>"What could I answer? My words were broken and <reg orig="in-|articulate"
                        >inarticulate</reg>. <lb/> Her fears naturally acquired force from the <lb/>
                    observation of these symptoms; but these fears were <reg orig="mis-|placed"
                        >misplaced</reg>. <lb/> The only inference she deduced from my conduct <lb/>
                    was, that some terrible mishap had befallen Clara.</p>
                <p>"She wrung her hands, and exclaimed in an agony, `O <lb/> tell me, where is she?
                    What has become of her? Is she <lb/> sick? Dead? Is she in her chamber? O let me
                    go thither <lb/> and know the worst!'</p>
                <p>"This proposal set my thoughts once more in motion. <lb/> Perhaps what my
                    rebellious heart refused to perform here, <lb/> I might obtain strength enough
                    to execute elsewhere.</p>
                <p>" `Come then,' said I, `let us go.'</p>
                <p>" `I will, but not in the dark. We must first procure a <lb/> light.'</p>
                <p>" `Fly then and procure it; but I charge you, linger not. <lb/> I will await for
                    your return.'</p>
                <p>"While she was gone, I strode along the entry. The <lb/> fellness of a gloomy
                    hurricane but faintly resembled the <reg orig="dis-|cord">discord</reg>
                    <lb/> that reigned in my mind. To omit this sacrifice must <lb/> not be; yet my
                    sinews had refused to perform it. No <reg orig="al-|ternative">alternative</reg>
                    <lb/> was offered. To rebel against the mandate was <lb/> impossible; but
                    obedience would render me the executioner <lb/> of my wife. My will was strong,
                    but my limbs refused <lb/> their office.</p>
                <p>"She returned with a light; I led the way to the <reg orig="cham-|ber"
                        >chamber</reg>; <lb/> she looked round her; she lifted the curtain of the
                    <lb/> bed; she saw nothing.</p>
                <pb n="159" entity="eaf033v1_0200" pid="uva-lib:349230"/>
                <p>"At length, she fixed inquiring eyes upon me. The <lb/> light now enabled her to
                    discover in my visage what <reg orig="dark-|ness">darkness</reg>
                    <lb/> had hitherto concealed. Her cares were now <reg orig="trans-|ferred"
                        >transferred</reg>
                    <lb/> from my sister to myself, and she said in a <reg orig="tremu-|lous"
                        >tremulous</reg>
                    <lb/> voice, "Wieland! you are not well; what ails you? <lb/> Can I do nothing
                    for you?"</p>
                <p>"That accents and looks so winning should disarm me <lb/> of my resolution, was
                    to be expected. My thoughts were <lb/> thrown anew into anarchy. I spread my
                    hand before my <lb/> eyes that I might not see her, and answered only by groans.
                    <lb/> She took my other hand between her's, and pressing it to <lb/> her heart,
                    spoke with that voice which had ever swayed my <lb/> will, and wafted away
                    sorrow.</p>
                <p>" `My friend! my soul's friend! tell me thy cause of <lb/> grief. Do I not merit
                    to partake with thee in thy cares? <lb/> Am I not thy wife?'</p>
                <p>"This was too much. I broke from her embrace, and <lb/> retired to a corner of
                    the room. In this pause, courage <lb/> was once more infused into me. I resolved
                    to execute my <lb/> duty. She followed me, and renewed her passionate <reg
                        orig="en-|treaties">entreaties</reg>
                    <lb/> to know the cause of my distress.</p>
                <p>"I raised my head and regarded her with steadfast looks. <lb/> I muttered
                    something about death, and the injunctions of <lb/> my duty. At these words she
                    shrunk back, and looked at <lb/> me with a new expression of anguish. After a
                    pause, she <lb/> clasped her hands, and exclaimed&mdash;</p>
                <p>" `O Wieland! Wieland! God grant that I am mistaken; <lb/> but surely something
                    is wrong. I see it; it is too plain; <lb/> thou art undone&mdash;lost to me and
                    to thyself.' At the same <lb/> time she gazed on my features with intensest
                    anxiety, in <lb/> hope that different symptoms would take place. I replied <lb/>
                    to her with vehemence&mdash;</p>
                <p>" `Undone! No; my duty is known, and I thank my <lb/> God that my cowardice is
                    now vanquished, and I have <lb/> power to fulfil it. Catharine! I pity the
                    weakness of thy <lb/> nature; I pity thee, but must not spare. Thy life is <lb/>
                    claimed from my hands; thou must die!'</p>
                <p>"Fear was now added to her grief. `What mean you? <lb/> Why talk you of death?
                    Bethink yourself, Wieland; <reg orig="be-|think">bethink</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="160" entity="eaf033v1_0201" pid="uva-lib:349231"/> yourself, and this fit
                    will pass. O why came I hither! <lb/> Why did you drag me hither?'</p>
                <p>" `I brought thee hither to fulfil a divine command. I am <lb/> appointed thy
                    destroyer, and destroy thee I must.' <reg orig="Say-|ing">Saying</reg>
                    <lb/> this I seized her wrists. She shrieked aloud, and <reg orig="en-|deavored"
                        >endeavored</reg>
                    <lb/> to free herself from my grasp; but her efforts were <lb/> vain.</p>
                <p>" `Surely, surely, Wieland, thou dost not mean it. Am I <lb/> not thy wife? and
                    wouldst thou kill me? Thou wilt not; <lb/> and yet&mdash;I see&mdash;thou art
                    Wieland no longer! A fury <reg orig="re-|sistless">resistless</reg>
                    <lb/> and horrible possesses thee&mdash;spare me&mdash;spare&mdash; <lb/>
                    help&mdash;help&mdash;'</p>
                <p>"Till her breath was stopped she shrieked for help&mdash;for <lb/> mercy. When
                    she could speak no longer, her gestures, <lb/> her looks appealed to my
                    compassion. My accursed hand <lb/> was irresolute and tremulous. I meant thy
                    death to be <reg orig="sud-|den">sudden</reg>, <lb/> thy struggles to be brief.
                    Alas! my heart was infirm; <lb/> my resolves mutuable. Thrice I slackened my
                    grasp, and <lb/> life kept its hold, though in the midst of pangs. Her <reg
                        orig="eye-|balls">eyeballs</reg>
                    <lb/> started from their sockets. Grimness and distortion <lb/> took place of
                    all that used to bewitch me into transport, and <lb/> subdue me into
                    reverence.</p>
                <p>"I was commissioned to kill thee, but not to torment <lb/> thee with the
                    foresight of thy death; not to multiply thy <lb/> fears, and prolong thy
                    agonies. Haggard, and pale, and <lb/> lifeless, at length thou ceasedst to
                    contend with thy destiny.</p>
                <p>"This was a moment of triumph. Thus had I <reg orig="success-|fully"
                        >successfully</reg>
                    <lb/> subdued the stubbornness of human passions; the <reg orig="vic-|tim"
                        >victim</reg>
                    <lb/> which had been demanded was given; the deed was <lb/> done past
                    recall.</p>
                <p>"I lifted the corpse in my arms and laid it on the bed. <lb/> I gazed upon it
                    with delight. Such was the elation of <lb/> my thoughts, that I even broke into
                    laughter. I clapped <lb/> my hands and exclaimed, `It is done! My sacred duty is
                    <lb/> fulfilled! To that I have sacrificed, O my God! thy last <lb/> and best
                    gift, my wife!'</p>
                <p>"For a while I thus soared above frailty. I imagined I <lb/> had set myself
                    forever beyond the reach of selfishness; but <lb/> my imaginations were false.
                    This rapture quickly subsided. <lb/> I looked again at my wife. My joyous
                    ebullitions vanished, <lb/>
                    <pb n="161" entity="eaf033v1_0202" pid="uva-lib:349232"/> and I asked myself who
                    it was whom I saw? Methought <lb/> it could not be Catharine. It could not be
                    the woman who <lb/> had lodged for years in my heart; who had slept, nightly,
                    <lb/> in my bosom; who had borne in her womb, who had <reg orig="fos-|tered"
                        >fostered</reg>
                    <lb/> at her breast, the beings who called me father; whom <lb/> I had watched
                    with delight, and cherished with a fondness <lb/> ever new and perpetually
                    growing; it could not be the same.</p>
                <p>"Where was her bloom! These deadly and <reg orig="blood-|suffused"
                        >blood-suffused</reg>
                    <lb/> orbs but ill resemble the azure and ecstatic <reg orig="tender-|ness"
                        >tenderness</reg>
                    <lb/> of her eyes. The lucid stream that meandered over <lb/> that bosom, the
                    glow of love that was wont to sit upon that <lb/> cheek, are much unlike these
                    livid stains and this hideous <lb/> deformity. Alas! these were the traces of
                    agony; the <lb/> gripe of the assassin had been here!</p>
                <p>"I will not dwell upon my lapse into desperate and <reg orig="out-|rageous"
                        >outrageous</reg>
                    <lb/> sorrow. The breath of heaven that sustained me <lb/> was withdrawn, and I
                    sunk into <hi rend="italic">mere man.</hi> I leaped from <lb/> the floor; I
                    dashed my head against the wall; I uttered <lb/> screams of horror; I panted
                    after torment and pain. <reg orig="Eter-|nal">Eternal</reg>
                    <lb/> fire, and the bickerings of hell, compared with what I <lb/> felt, were
                    music and a bed of roses.</p>
                <p>"I thank my God that this degeneracy was transient, that <lb/> he deigned once
                    more to raise me aloft. I thought upon <lb/> what I had done as a sacrifice to
                    duty, and <hi rend="italic">was calm.</hi> My <lb/> wife was dead; but I
                    reflected, that though this source of <lb/> human consolation was closed, yet
                    others were still open. <lb/> If the transports of a husband were no more, the
                    feelings <lb/> of a father had still scope for exercise. When <reg

                    <lb/> of their mother should excite too keen a pang, I <lb/> would look upon
                    them, and <hi rend="italic">be comforted.</hi></p>
                <p>"While I revolved these ideas, new warmth flowed in <lb/> upon my heart&mdash;I
                    was wrong. These feelings were the <lb/> growth of selfishness. Of this I was
                    not aware, and to <lb/> dispel the mist that obscured my perceptions, a new <reg

                    <lb/> and a new mandate were necessary.</p>
                <p>"From these thoughts I was recalled by a ray that was <lb/> shot into the room. A
                    voice spake like that which I had <lb/> before heard&mdash;`Thou hast done well;
                    but all is not done <lb/> &mdash;the sacrifice is incomplete&mdash;thy children

                <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Will</hi> you wonder that I read no farther? Will you not
                    <lb/> rather be astonished that I read thus far? What power <lb/> supported me
                    through such a task I know not. Perhaps <lb/> the doubt from which I could not
                    disengage my mind, that <lb/> the scene here depicted was a dream, contributed
                    to my <lb/> perseverance. In vain the solemn introduction of my uncle, <lb/> his
                    appeals to my fortitude, and allusions to something <reg orig="mon-|strous"
                        >monstrous</reg>
                    <lb/> in the events he was about to disclose; in vain the <lb/> distressful
                    perplexity, the mysterious silence and <reg orig="ambigu-|ous">ambiguous</reg>
                    <lb/> answers of my attendants, especially when the <reg orig="condi-|tion"
                        >condition</reg>
                    <lb/> of my brother was the theme of my inquiries, were <reg orig="re-|membered"
                        >remembered</reg>. <lb/> I recalled the interview with Wieland in my <lb/>
                    chamber, his preternatural tranquillity succeeded by bursts <lb/> of passion and
                    menacing actions. All these coincided with <lb/> the tenor of this paper.</p>
                <p>Catharine and her children, and Louisa were dead. The <lb/> act that destroyed
                    them was, in the highest degree, <reg orig="inhu-|man">inhuman</reg>. <lb/> It
                    was worthy of savages trained to murder, and <reg orig="ex-|ulting"
                        >exulting</reg>
                    <lb/> in agonies.</p>
                <p>Who was the performer of the deed? Wieland! My <lb/> brother! The husband and the
                    father! That man of <reg orig="gen-|tle">gentle</reg>
                    <lb/> virtues and invincible benignity! placable and mild&mdash;an <lb/>
                    idolater of peace! Surely, said I, it is a dream. For <lb/> many days have I
                    been vexed with frenzy. Its dominion <lb/> is still felt; but new forms are
                    called up to diversify and <lb/> augment my torments.</p>
                <p>The paper dropped from my hand, and my eyes followed <lb/> it. I shrunk back, as
                    if to avoid some petrifying influence <lb/> that approached me. My tongue was
                    mute; all the <reg orig="func-|tions">functions</reg>
                    <lb/> of nature were at a stand, and I sunk upon the floor <lb/> lifeless.</p>
                <p>The noise of my fall, as I afterwards heard, alarmed my <lb/> uncle, who was in a
                    lower apartment, and whose <reg orig="apprehen-|sions">apprehensions</reg>
                    <lb/> had detained him. He hastened to my chamber, and <lb/> administered the
                    assistance which my condition required. <lb/> When I opened my eyes I beheld him
                    before me. His <lb/> skill as a reasoner as well as a physician, was exerted to <lb/>
                    <pb n="163" entity="eaf033v1_0204" pid="uva-lib:349234"/> obviate the injurious
                    effects of this disclosure; but he had <lb/> wrongly estimated the strength of
                    my body or of my mind. <lb/> This new shock brought me once more to the brink of
                    the <lb/> grave, and my malady was much more difficult to subdue <lb/> than at
                    first.</p>
                <p>I will not dwell upon the long train of dreary sensations, <lb/> and the hideous
                    confusion of my understanding. Time <lb/> slowly restored its customary firmness
                    to my frame, and <lb/> order to my thoughts. The images impressed upon my <lb/>
                    mind by this fatal paper were somewhat effaced by my <lb/> malady. They were
                    obscure and disjointed like the parts <lb/> of a dream. I was desirous of
                    freeing my imagination <lb/> from this chaos. For this end I questioned my
                    uncle, who <lb/> was my constant companion. He was intimidated by the <lb/>
                    issue of his first experiment, and took pains to elude or <lb/> discourage my
                    inquiry. My impetuosity sometimes <reg orig="com-|pelled">compelled</reg>
                    <lb/> him to have resort to misrepresentations and untruths.</p>
                <p>Time effected that end, perhaps, in a more beneficial <lb/> manner. In the course
                    of my meditations the recollections <lb/> of the past gradually became more
                    distinct. I revolved <lb/> them, however, in silence, and being no longer <reg
                        orig="accompa-|nied">accompanied</reg>
                    <lb/> with surprise, they did not exercise a death dealing <lb/> power. I had
                    discontinued the perusal of the paper in the <lb/> midst of the narrative; but
                    what I read, combined with <reg orig="in-|formation">information</reg>
                    <lb/> elsewhere obtained, threw, perhaps, a sufficient <lb/> light upon these
                    detestable transactions; yet my curiosity <lb/> was not inactive. I desired to
                    peruse the remainder.</p>
                <p>My eagerness to know the particulars of this tale was <lb/> mingled and abated by
                    my antipathy to the scene which <lb/> would be disclosed. Hence I employed no
                    means to effect <lb/> my purpose. I desired knowledge, and, at the same time,
                    <lb/> shrunk back from receiving the boon.</p>
                <p>One morning, being left alone, I rose from my bed, and <lb/> went to a drawer
                    where my finer clothing used to be kept. <lb/> I opened it, and this fatal paper
                    saluted my sight. I <lb/> snatched it involuntarily, and withdrew to a chair. I
                        <reg orig="de-|bated">debated</reg>, <lb/> for a few minutes, whether I
                    should open and read. <lb/> Now that my fortitude was put to trial, it failed. I
                    felt <lb/> myself incapable of deliberately surveying a scene of so <lb/> much
                    horror. I was prompted to return it to its place, but <lb/>
                    <pb n="164" entity="eaf033v1_0205" pid="uva-lib:349235"/> this resolution gave
                    way, and I determined to peruse some <lb/> part of it. I turned over the leaves
                    till I came near the <lb/> conclusion. The narrative of the criminal was
                    finished. <lb/> The verdict of <hi rend="italic">guilty</hi> reluctantly
                    pronounced by the jury, <lb/> and the accused interrogated why sentence of death
                    should <lb/> not pass. The answer was brief, solemn, and emphatical.</p>
                <p>"No. I have nothing to say. My tale has been told. <lb/> My motives have been
                    truly stated. If my judges are <lb/> unable to discern the purity of my
                    intentions, or to credit <lb/> the statement of them, which I have just made; if
                    they <lb/> see not that my deed was enjoined by heaven; that <reg
                        orig="obe-|dience">obedience</reg>
                    <lb/> was the test of perfect virtue, and the extinction of <lb/> selfishness
                    and error, they must pronounce me a murderer.</p>
                <p>"They refuse to credit my tale; they impute my acts <lb/> to the influence of
                    demons; they account me an example <lb/> of the highest wickedness of which
                    human nature is <reg orig="capa-|ble">capable</reg>; <lb/> they doom me to death
                    and infamy. Have I power <lb/> to escape this evil? If I have, be sure I will
                    exert it. I <lb/> will not accept evil at their hand, when I am entitled to
                    <lb/> good; I will suffer only when I cannot elude suffering.</p>
                <p>"You say that I am guilty. Impious and rash! thus <lb/> to usurp the prerogatives
                    of your Maker! to set up your <lb/> bounded views and halting reason, as the
                    measure of truth!</p>
                <p>"Thou, Omnipotent and Holy! Thou knowest that my <lb/> actions were conformable
                    to thy will. I know not what is <lb/> crime; what actions are evil in their
                    ultimate and <reg orig="com-|prehensive">comprehensive</reg>
                    <lb/> tendency or what are good. Thy knowledge, as <lb/> thy power, is
                    unlimited. I have taken thee for my guide, <lb/> and cannot err. To the arms of
                    thy protection, I entrust <lb/> my safety. In the awards of thy justice, I
                    confide for my <lb/> recompense.</p>
                <p>"Come death, when it will, I am safe. Let calumny <lb/> and abhorrence pursue me
                    among men; I shall not be <reg orig="de-|frauded">defrauded</reg>
                    <lb/> of my dues. The peace of virtue, and the glory <lb/> of obedience, will be
                    my portion hereafter."</p>
                <p>Here ended the speaker. I withdrew my eyes from the <lb/> page; but before I had
                    time to reflect on what I had read, <lb/> Mr. Cambridge entered the room. He
                    quickly perceived <lb/> how I had been employed, and betrayed some solicitude
                    <lb/> respecting the condition of my mind.</p>
                <pb n="165" entity="eaf033v1_0206" pid="uva-lib:349236">

                </pb>
                <p>His fears, however, were superfluous. What I had <lb/> read, threw me into a
                    state not easily described. Anguish <lb/> and fury, however, had no part in it.
                    My faculties were <lb/> chained up in wonder and awe. Just then, I was unable
                    <lb/> to speak. I looked at my friend with an air of <reg
                        orig="inquisitive-|ness">inquisitiveness</reg>, <lb/> and pointed at the
                    roll. He comprehended my <lb/> inquiry, and answered me with looks of gloomy
                        <reg orig="acqui-|escence">acquiescence</reg>. <lb/> After some time, my
                    thoughts found their way <lb/> to my lips.</p>
                <p>Such then were the acts of my brother. Such were his <lb/> words. For this he was
                    condemned to die; to die upon <lb/> the gallows! A fate, cruel and unmerited!
                    And is it so? <lb/> continued I, struggling for utterance, which this new idea
                    <lb/> made difficult; is he&mdash;dead!</p>
                <p>"No. He is alive. There could be no doubt as to the <lb/> cause of these
                    excesses. They originated in sudden <reg orig="mad-|ness">madness</reg>; <lb/>
                    but that madness continues, and he is condemned to <lb/> perpetual
                    imprisonment."</p>
                <p>"Madness, say you? Are you sure? Were not these <lb/> sights, and these sounds,
                    really seen and heard?"</p>
                <p>My uncle was surprised at my question. He looked at <lb/> me with apparent
                    inquietude. "Can you doubt," said he, <lb/> "that these were illusions? Does
                    heaven, think you, <reg orig="inter-|fere">interfere</reg>
                    <lb/> for such ends?"</p>
                <p>"O no; I think it not. Heaven cannot stimulate to <lb/> such unheard of outrage.
                    The agent was not good, but <lb/> evil."</p>
                <p>"Nay, my dear girl," said my friend, "lay aside these <lb/> fancies. Neither
                    angel nor devil had any part in this <lb/> affair."</p>
                <p>"You misunderstand me," I answered; "I believe the <lb/> agency to be external
                    and real, but not supernatural."</p>
                <p>"Indeed!" said he, in an accent of surprise, "Whom <lb/> do you then suppose to
                    be the agent?"</p>
                <p>"I know not. All is wildering conjecture. I cannot <lb/> forget Carwin. I cannot
                    banish the suspicion that he was <lb/> the setter of these snares. But how can
                    we suppose it to <lb/> be madness? Did insanity ever before assume this
                    form?"</p>
                <p>"Frequently. The illusion, in this case, was more <lb/> dreadful in its
                    consequenses, than any that has come to my <lb/>
                    <pb n="166" entity="eaf033v1_0207" pid="uva-lib:349237"/> knowledge; but, I
                    repeat that similar illusions are not rare. <lb/> Did you never hear of an
                    instance which occurred in your <lb/> mother's family?"</p>
                <p>"No. I beseech you relate it. My grandfather's death <lb/> I have understood to
                    have been extraordinary, but I know <lb/> not in what respect. A brother, to
                    whom he was much <lb/> attached, died in his youth, and this, as I have heard,
                    <lb/> influenced, in some remarkable way, the fate of my <reg
                        orig="grand-|father">grandfather</reg>; <lb/> but I am unacquainted with
                    particulars."</p>
                <p>"On the death of that brother," resumed my friend, <lb/> "my father was seized
                    with dejection, which was found to <lb/> flow from two sources. He not only
                    grieved for the loss <lb/> of a friend, but entertained the belief that his own
                    death <lb/> would be inevitably consequent on that of his brother. He <lb/>
                    waited from day to day in expectation of the stroke which <lb/> he predicted was
                    speedily to fall upon him. Gradually, <lb/> however, he recovered his
                    cheerfulness and confidence. <lb/> He married, and performed his part in the
                    world with spirit <lb/> and activity. At the end of twenty-one years it happened
                    <lb/> that he spent the summer with his family at a house which <lb/> he
                    possessed on the seacoast in Cornwall. It was at no <lb/> great distance from a
                    cliff which overhung the ocean, and <lb/> rose into the air to a great height.
                    The summit was level <lb/> and secure, and easily ascended on the land side. The
                    <lb/> company frequently repaired hither in clear weather, invited <lb/> by its
                    pure airs and extensive prospects. One evening in <lb/> June my father, with his
                    wife and some friends, chanced to <lb/> be on this spot. Every one was happy,
                    and my father's <lb/> imagination seemed particularly alive to the grandeur of
                    <lb/> the scenery.</p>
                <p>"Suddenly, however, his limbs trembled and his features <lb/> betrayed alarm. He
                    threw himself into the attitude of one <lb/> listening. He gazed earnestly in a
                    direction in which <lb/> nothing was visible to his friends. This lasted for a
                    minute; <lb/> then turning to his companions, he told them that his <lb/>
                    brother had just delivered to him a summons, which must <lb/> be instantly
                    obeyed. He then took a hasty and solemn <lb/> leave of each person, and, before
                    their surprise would allow <lb/> them to understand the scene, he rushed to the
                    edge of <lb/> the cliff, threw himself headlong, and was seen no more.</p>

                <p>"In the course of my practice in the German army, <lb/> many cases, equally
                    remarkable, have occurred. <reg orig="Unques-|tionably">Unquestionably</reg>
                    <lb/> the illusions were maniacal, though the vulgar <lb/> thought otherwise.

                <p>This opinion my uncle endeavored, by various means, to <lb/> impress upon me. I
                    listened to his reasonings and <reg orig="illus-|trations">illustrations</reg>
                    <lb/> with silent respect. My astonishment was great on <lb/> finding proofs of
                    an influence of which I had supposed <lb/> there were no examples, but I was far
                    from accounting <lb/> for appearances in my uncle's manner. Ideas thronged <lb/>
                    into my mind which I was unable to disjoin or to regulate. <lb/> I reflected
                    that this madness, if madness it were, had <lb/> affected Pleyel and myself as
                    well as Wieland. Pleyel <lb/> had heard a mysterious voice. I had seen and
                    heard. A <lb/> form had showed itself to me as well as to Wieland. The <lb/>
                    disclosure had been made in the same spot. The appearance <lb/> was equally
                    complete and equally prodigious in both <reg orig="in-|stances">instances</reg>.
                    <lb/> Whatever supposition I should adopt, had I not <lb/> equal reason to
                    tremble? What was my security against <lb/> influences equally terrific and
                    equally irresistible?</p>
                <p>It would be vain to attempt to describe the state of mind <lb/> which this idea
                    produced. I wondered at the change which <lb/> a moment had effected in my
                    brother's condition. Now <lb/> was I stupified with tenfold wonder in
                    contemplating myself. <lb/> Was I not likewise transformed from rational and
                    human <lb/> into a creature of nameless and fearful attributes? Was I not <lb/>
                    transported to the brink of the same abyss? Ere a new day <lb/> should come, my
                    hands might be imbrued in blood, and my <lb/> remaining life be consigned to a
                    dungeon and chains.</p>
                <p>With moral sensibility like mine, no wonder that this new <lb/> dread was more
                    insupportable than the anguish I had lately <lb/> endured. Grief carries its own
                    antidote along with it. <lb/> When thought becomes merely a vehicle of pain, its
                        <reg orig="pro-|gress">progress</reg>
                    <lb/> must be stopped. Death is a cure which nature or <lb/>
                    <pb n="168" entity="eaf033v1_0209" pid="uva-lib:349239"/> ourselves must
                    administer. To this cure I now looked <reg orig="for-|ward">forward</reg>
                    <lb/> with gloomy satisfaction.</p>
                <p>My silence could not conceal from my uncle the state of <lb/> my thoughts. He
                    made unwearied efforts to divert my <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg>
                    <lb/> from views so pregnant with danger. His efforts, aided <lb/> by time, were
                    in some measure successful. Confidence in <lb/> the strength of my resolution,
                    and in the healthful state of <lb/> my faculties, was once more revived. I was
                    able to devote <lb/> my thoughts to my brother's state, and the causes of this
                    <lb/> disastrous proceeding.</p>
                <p>My opinions were the sport of eternal change. <reg orig="Some-|times"
                        >Sometimes</reg>
                    <lb/> I conceived the apparition to be more than human. I <lb/> had no grounds
                    on which to build a disbelief. I could not <lb/> deny faith to the evidence of
                    my religion; the testimony of <lb/> men was loud and unanimous; both these
                    concurred to <reg orig="per-|suade">persuade</reg>
                    <lb/> me that evil spirits existed, and that their energy was <lb/> frequently
                    exerted in the system of the world.</p>
                <p>These ideas connected themselves with the image of <lb/> Carwin. Where is the
                    proof, said I, that demons may not <lb/> be subjected to the control of men?
                    This truth may be <reg orig="dis-|torted">distorted</reg>
                    <lb/> and debased in the minds of the ignorant. The <reg orig="dog-|mas"
                        >dogmas</reg>
                    <lb/> of the vulgar, with regard to this subject, are glaringly <lb/> absurd;
                    but though these may justly be neglected by the <lb/> wise, we are scarcely
                    justified in totally rejecting the <reg orig="possi-|bility">possibility</reg>
                    <lb/> that men may obtain supernatural aid.</p>
                <p>The dreams of superstition are worthy of contempt. <lb/> Witchcraft, its
                    instruments and miracles, the compact <reg orig="rati-|fied">ratified</reg>
                    <lb/> by a bloody signature, the apparatus of sulphureous smells <lb/> and
                    thundering explosions, are monstrous and chimerical. <lb/> These have no part in
                    the scene over which the genius of <lb/> Carwin presides. That conscious beings,
                    dissimilar from <lb/> human, but moral and voluntary agents as we are, <reg
                        orig="some-|where">somewhere</reg>
                    <lb/> exist, can scarcely be denied. That their aid may <lb/> be employed to
                    benign or malignant purposes, cannot be <lb/> disproved.</p>
                <p>Darkness rests upon the designs of this man. The extent <lb/> of his power is
                    unknown; but is there not evidence that it <lb/> has been now exerted?</p>
                <p>I recurred to my own experience. Here Carwin had <lb/> actually appeared upon the
                    stage; but this was in a human <lb/>
                    <pb n="169" entity="eaf033v1_0210" pid="uva-lib:349240">
                        <fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">17*</fw>
                    </pb> character. A voice and a form were discovered; but one <lb/> was
                    apparently exerted, and the other disclosed, not to <reg orig="be-|friend"
                        >befriend</reg>, <lb/> but to counteract Carwin's designs. There were <lb/>
                    tokens of hostility, and not of alliance between them. <reg orig="Car-|win"
                        >Carwin</reg>
                    <lb/> was the miscreant whose projects were resisted by a <lb/> minister of
                    heaven. How can this be reconciled to the <lb/> stratagem which ruined my
                    brother? There the agency was <lb/> at once preternatural and malignant.</p>
                <p>The recollection of this fact led my thoughts into a new <lb/> channel. The
                    malignity of that influence which governed <lb/> my brother had hitherto been no
                    subject of doubt. His <lb/> wife and children were destroyed; they had expired
                    in <lb/> agony and fear; yet was it indisputably certain that their <lb/>
                    murderer was criminal? He was acquitted at the tribunal <lb/> of his own
                    conscience; his behavior at his trial and since, <lb/> was faithfully reported
                    to me; appearances were uniform; <lb/> not for a moment did he lay aside the
                    majesty of virtue; he <lb/> repelled all invectives by appealing to the Deity,
                    and to the <lb/> tenor of his past life; surely there was truth in this appeal;
                    <lb/> none but a command from heaven could have swayed his <lb/> will; and
                    nothing but unerring proof of divine approbation <lb/> could sustain his mind in
                    its present elevation.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">Such,</hi> for some time, was the course of my meditations.
                    <lb/> My weakness, and my aversion to be pointed at as an <reg orig="ob-|ject"
                        >object</reg>
                    <lb/> of surprise or compassion, prevented me from going <lb/> into public. I
                    studiously avoided the visits of those who <lb/> came to express their sympathy,
                    or gratify their curiosity. <lb/> My uncle was my principal companion. Nothing
                    more <lb/> powerfully tended to console me than his conversation.</p>
                <p>With regard to Pleyel, my feelings seemed to have <reg orig="under-|gone"
                        >undergone</reg>
                    <lb/> a total revolution. It often happens that one passion <lb/> supplants
                    another. Late disasters had rent my heart, and now <lb/> that the wound was in
                    some degree closed, the love which <lb/>
                    <pb n="170" entity="eaf033v1_0211" pid="uva-lib:349241"/> I had cherished for
                    this man seemed likewise to have <reg orig="van-|ished">vanished</reg>.</p>
                <p>Hitherto, indeed, I had had no cause for despair. I was <lb/> innocent of that
                    offence which had estranged him from my <lb/> presence. I might reasonably
                    expect that my innocence <lb/> would at some time he irresistibly demonstrated,
                    and his <lb/> affection for me be revived with his esteem. Now my <reg
                        orig="aver-|sion">aversion</reg>
                    <lb/> to be thought culpable by him continued, but was <reg orig="un-|attended"
                        >unattended</reg>
                    <lb/> with the same impatience. I desired the removal <lb/> of his suspicions,
                    not for the sake of regaining his love, but <lb/> because I delighted in the
                    veneration of so excellent a man, <lb/> and because he himself would derive
                    pleasure from <reg orig="convic-|tion">conviction</reg>
                    <lb/> of my integrity.</p>
                <p>My uncle had early informed me that Pleyel and he had <lb/> seen each other,
                    since the return of the latter from Europe. <lb/> Amidst the topics of their
                    conversation, I discovered that <lb/> Pleyel had carefully omitted the mention
                    of those events <lb/> which had drawn upon me so much abhorrence. I could <lb/>
                    not account for his silence on this subject. Perhaps time <lb/> or some new
                    discovery had altered or shaken his opinion. <lb/> Perhaps he was unwilling,
                    though I were guilty, to injure <lb/> me in the opinion of my venerable kinsman.
                    I understood <lb/> that he had frequently visited me during my disease, had
                    <lb/> watched many successive nights by my bedside, and <reg orig="mani-|fested"
                        >manifested</reg>
                    <lb/> the utmost anxiety on my account.</p>
                <p>The journey which he was preparing to take, at the <lb/> termination of our last
                    interview, the catastrophe of the <reg orig="en-|suing">ensuing</reg>
                    <lb/> night induced him to delay. The motives of this <reg orig="jour-|ney"
                        >journey</reg>
                    <lb/> I had, till now, totally mistaken. They were explained <lb/> to me by my
                    uncle, whose tale excited my astonishment <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg>
                    <lb/> awakening my regret. In a different state of mind, it <lb/> would have
                    added unspeakably to my distress, but now it <lb/> was more a source of pleasure
                    than pain. This, perhaps, is <lb/> not the least extraordinary of the facts
                    contained in this <reg orig="nar-|rative">narrative</reg>. <lb/> It will excite
                    less wonder when I add, that my <lb/> indifference was temporary, and that the
                    lapse of a few days <lb/> shewed me that my feelings were deadened for a time,
                    rather <lb/> than finally extinguished.</p>
                <p>Theresa de Stolberg was alive. She had conceived the <lb/> resolution of seeking
                    her lover in America. To conceal her <lb/>
                    <pb n="171" entity="eaf033v1_0212" pid="uva-lib:349242"/> flight, she had caused
                    the report of her death to be <reg orig="propa-|gated">propagated</reg>. <lb/>
                    She put herself under the conduct of Bertrand, the <lb/> faithful servant of
                    Pleyel. The packet which the latter <lb/> received from the hands of his
                    servant, contained the tidings <lb/> of her safe arrival at Boston, and to meet
                    her there was the <lb/> purpose of his journey.</p>
                <p>This discovery had set this man's character in a new <lb/> light. I had mistaken
                    the heroism of friendship for the <lb/> frenzy of love. He who had gained my
                    affections, may <lb/> be supposed to have previously entitled himself to my <reg
                        orig="re-|verence">reverence</reg>; <lb/> but the levity which had formerly
                    characterized <lb/> the behavior of this man, tended to obscure the greatness of
                    <lb/> his sentiments. I did not fail to remark, that since this lady <lb/> was
                    still alive, the voice in the temple which asserted her <lb/> death, must either
                    have been intended to deceive, or have <lb/> been itself deceived. The latter
                    supposition was <reg orig="inconsis-|tent">inconsistent</reg>
                    <lb/> with the notion of a spiritual, and the former with that <lb/> of a
                    benevolent being.</p>
                <p>When my disease abated, Pleyel had foreborne his visits, <lb/> and had lately set
                    out upon this journey. This amounted to <lb/> a proof that my guilt was still
                    believed by him. I was <lb/> grieved for his errors, but trusted that my
                    vindication would, <lb/> sooner or later, be made.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, tumultuous thoughts were again set afloat by <lb/> a proposal made to
                    me by my uncle. He imagined that <lb/> new airs would restore my languishing
                    constitution, and a <lb/> varied succession of objects tend to repair the shock
                    which <lb/> my mind had received. For this end, he proposed to me to <lb/> take
                    up my abode with him in France or Italy.</p>
                <p>At a more prosperous period, this scheme would have <lb/> pleased for its own
                    sake. Now my heart sickened at the <lb/> prospect of nature. The world of man
                    was shrouded in <lb/> misery and blood, and constituted a loathsome spectacle.
                    <lb/> I willingly closed my eyes in sleep, and regretted that the <lb/> respite
                    it afforded me was so short. I marked with <reg orig="satisfac-|tion"
                        >satisfaction</reg>
                    <lb/> the progress of decay in my frame, and consented to <lb/> live, merely in
                    the hope that the course of nature would <lb/> speedily relieve me from the
                    burthen. Nevertheless, as he <lb/> persisted in his scheme, I concurred in it
                    merely because he <lb/> was entitled to my gratitude, and because my refusal
                    gave <lb/> him pain.</p>
                <pb n="172" entity="eaf033v1_0213" pid="uva-lib:349243"/>
                <p>No sooner was he informed of my consent, than he told <lb/> me I must make
                    immediate preparation to embark, as the <lb/> ship in which he had engaged a
                    passage, would be ready <lb/> to depart in three days. This expedition was <reg
                        orig="unex-|pected">unexpected</reg>. <lb/> There was an impatience in his
                    manner when he <lb/> urged the necessity of despatch, that excited my surprise.
                    <lb/> When I questioned him as to the cause of this haste, he <lb/> generally
                    stated reasons which, at that time, I could not deny <lb/> to be plausible; but
                    which, on the review, appeared <reg orig="insuf-|ficient">insufficient</reg>.
                    <lb/> I suspected that the true motives were concealed, <lb/> and believed that
                    these motives had some connexion with <lb/> my brother's destiny.</p>
                <p>I now recollected that the information respecting Wieland <lb/> which had, from
                    time to time, been imparted to me, was <lb/> always accompanied with airs of
                    reserve and <reg orig="mysterious-|ness">mysteriousness</reg>. <lb/> What had
                    appeared sufficiently explicit at the time it <lb/> was uttered, I now
                    remembered to have been faltering and <lb/> ambiguous. I was resolved to remove
                    my doubts, by <reg orig="visit-|ing">visiting</reg>
                    <lb/> the unfortunate man in his dungeon. Heretofore the <lb/> idea of this
                    visit had occurred to me, but the horrors of his <lb/> dwelling place, his wild
                    yet placid physiognomy, his <reg orig="neglect-|ed">neglected</reg>
                    <lb/> locks, the fetters which constrained his limbs, terrible as <lb/> they
                    were in description, how could I endure to behold!</p>
                <p>Now, however, that I was preparing to take an <reg orig="everlast-|ing"
                        >everlasting</reg>
                    <lb/> farewell of my country, now that an ocean was <reg orig="hence-|forth"
                        >henceforth</reg>
                    <lb/> to separate me from him, how could I part without an <lb/> interview? I
                    would examine his situation with my own <lb/> eyes. I would know whether the
                    representations which had <lb/> been made to me were true. Perhaps the sight of
                    the <reg orig="sis-|ter">sister</reg>
                    <lb/> whom he was wont to love with a passion more than <lb/> fraternal, might
                    have an auspicious influence on his malady.</p>
                <p>Having formed this resolution, I waited to communicate <lb/> it to Mr. Cambridge.
                    I was aware that, without his <reg orig="concur-|rence">concurrence</reg>, <lb/>
                    I could not hope to carry it into execution, and could <lb/> discover no
                    objection to which it was liable. If I had not <lb/> been deceived as to his
                    condition, no inconvenience could <lb/> arise from this proceeding. His consent,
                    therefore, would <lb/> be the test of his sincerity.</p>
                <p>I seized this opportunity to state my wishes on this head. <lb/> My suspicious
                    were confirmed by the manner in which my <lb/>
                    <pb n="173" entity="eaf033v1_0214" pid="uva-lib:349244"/> request affected him.
                    After some pause, in which his <lb/> countenance betrayed every mark of
                    perplexity, he said to <lb/> me, "Why would you pay this visit? What useful
                    purpose <lb/> can it serve?"</p>
                <p>"We are preparing," said I, "to leave the country <reg orig="for-|ever"
                        >forever</reg>. <lb/> What kind of being should I be to leave behind me
                    <lb/> a brother in calamity without even a parting interview? <reg
                        orig="In-|dulge">Indulge</reg>
                    <lb/> me for three minutes in the sight of him. My heart <lb/> will be much
                    easier after I have looked at him, and shed a <lb/> few tears in his
                    presence."</p>
                <p>"I believe otherwise. The sight of him would only <lb/> augment your distress,
                    without contributing, in any degree, <lb/> to his benefit."</p>
                <p>"I know not that," returned I. "Surely the sympathy <lb/> of his sister, proofs
                    that her tenderness is as lively as ever, <lb/> must be a source of satisfaction
                    to him. At present he <lb/> must regard all mankind as his enemies and
                    calumniators. <lb/> His sister he, probably, conceives to partake in the general
                    <lb/> infatuation, and to join in the cry of abhorrence that is <lb/> raised
                    against him. To be undeceived in this respect, to <lb/> be assured that, however
                    I may impute his conduct to <reg orig="delu-|sion">delusion</reg>, <lb/> I still
                    retain all my former affection for his person, and <lb/> veneration for the
                    purity of his motives, cannot but afford <lb/> him pleasure. When he hears that
                    I have left the country <lb/> without even the ceremonious attention of a visit,
                    what will <lb/> he think of me? His magnanimity may hinder him from <lb/>
                    repining, but he will surely consider my behavior as savage <lb/> and unfeeling.
                    Indeed, dear Sir, I must pay this visit. To <lb/> embark with you without paying
                    it, will be impossible. It <lb/> may be of no service to him, but will enable me
                    to acquit <lb/> myself of what I cannot but esteem a duty. Besides," <lb/>
                    continued I, "if it be a mere fit of insanity that has seized <lb/> him, may not
                    my presence chance to have a salutary <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg>?
                    <lb/> The mere sight of me, it is not impossible, may <reg orig="rec-|tify"
                        >rectify</reg>
                    <lb/> his perceptions."</p>
                <p>"Ay," said my uncle, with some eagerness; "it is by <lb/> no means impossible
                    that your interview may have that <lb/> effect; and for that reason, beyond all
                    others, would I <reg orig="dis-|suade">dissuade</reg>
                    <lb/> you from it."</p>
                <pb n="174" entity="eaf033v1_0215" pid="uva-lib:349245"/>
                <p>I expressed my surprise at this declaration. "Is it <lb/> not to be desired that
                    an error so fatal as this should be <lb/> rectified?"</p>
                <p>"I wonder at your question. Reflect on the consequences <lb/> of this error. Has
                    he not destroyed the wife whom he <lb/> loved, the children whom he idolized?
                    What is it that <reg orig="en-|ables">enables</reg>
                    <lb/> him to bear the remembrance, but the belief that he <lb/> acted as his
                    duty enjoined? Would you rashly bereave <lb/> him of this belief? Would you
                    restore him to himself, and <lb/> convince him that he was instigated to this
                    dreadful outrage <lb/> by a perversion of his organs, or a delusion from
                    hell?</p>
                <p>"Now his visions are joyous and elate. He conceives <lb/> himself to have reached
                    a loftier degree of virtue than any <lb/> other human being. The merit of his
                    sacrifice is only <reg orig="en-|hanced">enhanced</reg>
                    <lb/> in the eyes of superior beings, by the detestation <lb/> that pursues him
                    here, and the sufferings to which he is <lb/> condemned. The belief that even
                    his sister has deserted <lb/> him, and gone over to his enemies, adds to his
                    sublimity of <lb/> feelings, and his confidence in divine approbation and future
                    <lb/> recompense.</p>
                <p>"Let him be undeceived in this respect, and what floods <lb/> of despair and of
                    horror will overwhelm him! Instead of <lb/> glowing approbation and serene hope,
                    will he not hate and <lb/> torture himself? Self-violence, or a frenzy far more
                    savage <lb/> and destructive than this, may be expected to succeed. I <lb/>
                    beseech you, therefore, to relinquish this scheme. If you <lb/> calmly reflect
                    upon it, you will discover that your duty lies <lb/> in carefully shunning
                    him."</p>
                <p>Mr. Cambridge's reasonings suggested views to my <reg orig="under-|standing"
                        >understanding</reg>, <lb/> that had not hitherto occurred. I could not but
                    <lb/> admit their validity, but they showed, in a new light, the <lb/> depth of
                    that misfortune in which my brother was plunged. <lb/> I was silent and
                    irresolute.</p>
                <p>Presently I considered, that whether Wieland was a <reg orig="ma-|niac"
                        >maniac</reg>, <lb/> a faithful servant of his God, the victim of hellish
                    <lb/> illusions, or the dupe of human imposture, was by no <lb/> means certain.
                    In this state of my mind it became me to <lb/> be silent during the visit that I
                    projected. This visit should <lb/> be brief; I should he satisfied merely to
                    snatch a look at <lb/> him. Admitting that a change in his opinions were not to <lb/>
                    <pb n="175" entity="eaf033v1_0216" pid="uva-lib:349246"/> be desired, there was
                    no danger, from the conduct which I <lb/> should pursue, that this change should
                    be wrought.</p>
                <p>But I could not conquer my uncle's aversion to this <lb/> scheme. Yet I
                    persisted, and he found that to make me <lb/> voluntarily relinquish it, it was
                    necessary to be more <reg orig="expli-|cit">explicit</reg>
                    <lb/> than he had hitherto been. He took both my hands, and <lb/> anxiously
                    examining my countenance as he spoke, "Clara," <lb/> said he, "this visit must
                    not be paid. We must hasten <lb/> with the utmost expedition from this shore. It
                    is folly to <lb/> conceal the truth from you, and, since it is only by <reg
                        orig="disclos-|ing">disclosing</reg>
                    <lb/> the truth that you can be prevailed upon to lay aside <lb/> this project,
                    the truth shall be told.</p>
                <p>"O my dear girl!" continued he with increasing energy <lb/> in his accent, "your
                    brother's frenzy is, indeed, stupendous <lb/> and frightful. The soul that
                    formerly actuated his frame <lb/> has disappeared. The same form remains; but
                    the wise <lb/> and benevolent Wieland is no more. A fury that is <reg
                        orig="rapa-|cious">rapacious</reg>
                    <lb/> of blood, that lifts his strength almost above that of <lb/> mortals, that
                    bends all his energies to the destruction of <lb/> whatever was once dear to
                    him, possesses him wholly.</p>
                <p>"You must not enter his dungeon; his eyes will no <lb/> sooner be fixed upon you,
                    than an exertion of his force <lb/> will be made. He will shake off his fetters
                    in a moment, <lb/> and rush upon you. No interposition will then be strong or
                    <lb/> quick enough to save you.</p>
                <p>"The phantom that has urged him to the murder of <lb/> Catharine and her children
                    is not yet appeased. Your life, <lb/> and that of Pleyel, are exacted from him
                    by this imaginary <lb/> being. He is eager to comply with this demand. Twice
                    <lb/> he has escaped from his prison. The first time, he no <lb/> sooner found
                    himself at liberty, than he hasted to Pleyel's <lb/> house. It being midnight,
                    the latter was in bed. Wieland <lb/> penetrated unobserved to his chamber, and
                    opened his <reg orig="cur-|tain">curtain</reg>. <lb/> Happily, Pleyel awoke at
                    the critical moment, and <lb/> escaped the fury of his kinsman, by leaping from
                    his <reg orig="cham-|ber">chamber</reg>
                    <lb/> window into the court. Happily, he reached the ground <lb/> without
                    injury. Alarms were given, and after diligent search, <lb/> your brother was
                    found in a chamber of your house, whither, <lb/> no doubt, he had sought
                    you.</p>
                <pb n="176" entity="eaf033v1_0217" pid="uva-lib:349247"/>
                <p>"His chains, and the watchfulness of his guards, were <lb/> redoubled; but again,
                    by some miracle, he restored <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>
                    <lb/> to liberty. He was now incautiously apprized of the <lb/> place of your
                    abode; and had not information of his escape <lb/> been instantly given, your
                    death would have been added to <lb/> the number of his atrocious acts.</p>
                <p>"You now see the danger of your project. You must <lb/> not only forbear to visit
                    him, but if you would save him <lb/> from the crime of embruing his hands in
                    your blood, you <lb/> must leave the country. There is no hope that his malady
                    <lb/> will end but with his life, and no precaution will ensure <lb/> your
                    safety, but that of placing the ocean between you.</p>
                <p>"I confess I came over with an intention to reside among <lb/> you, but these
                    disasters have changed my views. Your own <lb/> safety and my happiness require
                    that you should <reg orig="accompa-|ny">accompany</reg>
                    <lb/> me in my return, and I entreat you to give your <reg orig="cheer-|ful"
                        >cheerful</reg>
                    <lb/> concurrence to this measure."</p>
                <p>After these representations from my uncle, it was <reg orig="impos-|sible"
                        >impossible</reg>
                    <lb/> to retain my purpose. I readily consented to seclude <lb/> myself from
                    Wieland's presence. I likewise acquiesced in <lb/> the proposal to go to Europe;
                    not that I ever expected to <lb/> arrive there, but because, since my principles
                    forbade me to <lb/> assail my own life, change had some tendency to make <reg

                    <lb/> the few days which disease should spare to me.</p>
                <p>What a tale had thus been unfolded! I was hunted to death, <lb/> not by one whom
                    my misconduct had exasperated, who was <lb/> conscious of illicit motives, and
                    who sought his end by <reg orig="cir-|cumvention">circumvention</reg>
                    <lb/> and surprise; but by one who deemed himself <lb/> commissioned for this

                    <lb/> of horror as the last refinement of virtue; whose <reg

                    <lb/> was proportioned to the reverence and love which <lb/> he felt for me, and
                    who was inaccessible to the fear of <reg orig="pun-|ishment">punishment</reg>
                    <lb/> and ignominy.</p>
                <p>In vain should I endeavor to stay his hand by urging the <lb/> claims of a sister
                    or friend; these were his only reasons <lb/> for pursuing my destruction. Had I
                    been a stranger to his <lb/> blood; had I been the most worthless of human kind;
                    my <lb/> safety had not been endangered.</p>
                <p>Surely, said I, my fate is without example. The <reg orig="fren-|zy">frenzy</reg>
                    <lb/> which is charged upon my brother, must belong to <reg orig="my-|self"

                    </pb> My foe is manacled and guarded; but I derive no <lb/> security from these
                    restraints. I live not in a community of <lb/> savages; yet, whether I sit or
                    walk, go into crowds, or hide <lb/> myself in solitude, my life is marked for a
                    prey to inhuman <lb/> violence; I am in perpetual danger of perishing; of <reg

                    <lb/> under the grasp of a brother!</p>
                <p>I recollected the omens of this destiny; I remembered <lb/> the gulf to which my
                    brother's invitation had conducted me; <lb/> I remembered that, when on the
                    brink of danger, the author <lb/> of my peril was depicted by my fears in his
                    form. Thus <lb/> realized, were the creatures of prophetic sleep, and of <reg

                    <lb/> terror!</p>
                <p>These images were unavoidably connected with that of <lb/> Carwin. In this
                    paroxysm of distress, my attention <reg orig="fasten-|ed">fastened</reg>
                    <lb/> on him as the grand deceiver; the author of this black <lb/> conspiracy;
                    the intelligence that governed in this storm.</p>
                <p>Some relief is afforded in the midst of suffering, when its <lb/> author is
                    discovered or imagined; and an object found on <lb/> which we may pour out our
                    indignation and our vengeance. <lb/> I ran over the events that had taken place
                    since the origin of <lb/> our intercourse with him, and reflected on the tenor
                    of that <lb/> description which was received from Ludloe. Mixed up <lb/> with
                    notions of supernatural agency, were the vehement <lb/> suspicions which I
                    entertained, that Carwin was the enemy <lb/> whose machinations had destroyed
                    us.</p>
                <p>I thirsted for knowledge and for vengeance. I regarded <lb/> my hasty departure
                    with reluctance, since it would remove <lb/> me from the means by which this
                    knowledge might be <reg orig="ob-|tained">obtained</reg>, <lb/> and this
                    vengeance gratified. This departure was <lb/> to take place in two days. At the
                    end of two days I was to <lb/> bid an eternal adieu to my native country. Should
                    I not <lb/> pay a parting visit to the scene of these disasters? Should I <lb/>
                    not bedew with my tears the graves of my sister and her <lb/> children? Should I
                    not explore their desolate habitation, <lb/> and gather from the sight of its
                    walls and furniture food for <lb/> my eternal melancholy?</p>
                <p>This suggestion was succeeded by a secret shuddering. <lb/> Some disastrous
                    influence appeared to overhang the scene. <lb/> How many memorials should I meet

                <p>I was tempted to relinquish my design, when it occurred <lb/> to me that I had

                    <lb/> in short hand. I was employed in this manuscript on <lb/> that night when
                    Pleyel's incautious curiosity tempted him to <lb/> look over my shoulder. I was

                    to my house, and this I immediately <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg>
                    <lb/> to do.</p>
                <p>I was not willing to expose myself to opposition from my <lb/> friends, by
                    mentioning my design; I therefore bespoke the <lb/> use of Mr. Hallet's chaise,
                    under pretence of enjoying an <lb/> airing, as the day was remarkably
                    bright.</p>
                <p>This request was gladly complied with, and I directed <lb/> the servant to
                    conduct me to Mettingen. I dismissed him <lb/> at the gate, intending to use, in
                    returning, a carriage <reg orig="be-|longing">belonging</reg>
                    <lb/> to my brother.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> inhabitants of the HUT received me with a mixture
                    <lb/> of joy and surprise. Their homely welcome, and their <reg orig="art-|less"
                        >artless</reg>
                    <lb/> sympathy, were grateful to my feelings. In the midst <lb/> of their
                    inquiries, as to my health, they avoided all allusions <lb/> to the source of my
                    malady. They were honest creatures, <lb/> and I loved them well. I participated
                    in the tears which <lb/> they shed when I mentioned to them my speedy departure
                    <lb/> for Europe, and promised to acquaint them with my welfare <lb/> during my
                    long absence.</p>
                <p>They expressed great surprise when I informed them of <lb/> my intention to visit
                    my cottage. Alarm and foreboding <lb/> overspread their features, and they
                    attempted to dissuade <lb/> me from visiting a house which they firmly believed
                    to be <lb/> haunted by a thousand ghostly apparitions.</p>
                <p>These apprehenions, however, had no power over my <lb/>
                    <pb n="179" entity="eaf033v1_0220" pid="uva-lib:349250"/> conduct. I took an
                    irregular path which led me to my own <lb/> house. All was vacant and forlorn. A
                    small enclosure <lb/> near which the path led, was the burying ground belonging
                    <lb/> to the family. This I was obliged to pass. Once I had <reg
                        orig="in-|tended">intended</reg>
                    <lb/> to enter it, and ponder on the emblems and <reg orig="inscrip-|tions"
                        >inscriptions</reg>
                    <lb/> which my uncle had caused to be made on the tombs <lb/> of Catharine and
                    her children; but now my heart faltered <lb/> as I approached, and I hastened
                    forward that distance might <lb/> conceal it from my view.</p>
                <p>When I approached the recess, my heart again sunk. I <lb/> averted my eyes, and
                    left it behind me as quickly as <lb/> possible. Silence reigned through my
                    habitation, and a <lb/> darkness which closed doors and shutters produced. Every
                    <lb/> object was connected with mine or my brother's history. I <lb/> passed the
                    entry, mounted the stair, and unlocked the door <lb/> of my chamber. It was with
                    difficulty that I curbed my <lb/> fancy and smothered my fears. Slight movements
                    and <lb/> casual sounds were transformed into beckoning shadows <lb/> and
                    calling shapes.</p>
                <p>I proceeded to the closet. I opened and looked round <lb/> it with fearfulness.
                    All things were in their accustomed <lb/> order. I sought and found the
                    manuscript where I was <lb/> used to deposit it. This being secured, there was
                    nothing <lb/> to detain me; yet I stood and contemplated awhile the <reg
                        orig="fur-|niture">furniture</reg>
                    <lb/> and walls of my chamber. I remembered how long <lb/> this apartment had
                    been a sweet and tranquil asylum; I <reg orig="com-|pared">compared</reg>
                    <lb/> its former state with its present dreariness, and <reg orig="re-|flected"
                        >reflected</reg>
                    <lb/> that I now beheld it for the last time.</p>
                <p>Here it was that the incomprehensible behavior of Carwin <lb/> was witnessed;
                    this the stage on which that enemy of <lb/> man showed himself for a moment
                    unmasked. Here the <lb/> menaces of murder were wafted to my ear; and here these
                    <lb/> menaces were executed.</p>
                <p>These thoughts had a tendency to take from me my <reg orig="self-|command"
                        >self-command</reg>. <lb/> My feeble limbs refused to support me, and I
                    <lb/> sunk upon a chair. Incoherent and half-articulate <reg
                        orig="exclama-|tions">exclamations</reg>
                    <lb/> escaped my lips. The name of Carwin was uttered, <lb/> and eternal woes,
                    woes like that which his malice had <reg orig="en-|tailed">entailed</reg>
                    <lb/> upon us, were heaped upon him. I invoked all-seeing <lb/> heaven to drag
                    to light and punish this betrayer, and <reg orig="ac-|cused">accused</reg>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="180" entity="eaf033v1_0221" pid="uva-lib:349251"/> its providence for
                    having thus long delayed the <reg orig="retri-|bution">retribution</reg>
                    <lb/> that was due to so enormous a guilt.</p>
                <p>I have said that the window shutters were closed. A <lb/> feeble light, however,
                    found entrance through the crevices. <lb/> A small window illuminated the
                    closet, and the door being <lb/> closed, a dim ray streamed through the
                    key-hole. A kind <lb/> of twilight was thus created, sufficient for the purposes
                    of <lb/> vision; but, at the same time, involving all minuter objects <lb/> in
                    obscurity.</p>
                <p>This darkness suited the color of my thoughts. I <reg orig="sicken-|ed"
                        >sickened</reg>
                    <lb/> at the remembrance of the past. The prospect of the <lb/> future excited
                    my loathing. I muttered in a low voice, Why <lb/> should I live longer? Why
                    should I drag a miserable being? <lb/> All, for whom I ought to live, have
                    perished. Am I not <lb/> myself hunted to death?</p>
                <p>At that moment, my despair suddenly became vigorous. <lb/> My nerves were no
                    longer unstrung. My powers that had <lb/> long been deadened, were revived. My
                    bosom swelled <lb/> with a sudden energy, and the conviction darted through my
                    <lb/> mind, that to end my torments was, at once, practicable and <lb/>
                    wise.</p>
                <p>I knew how to find way to the recesses of life. I could <lb/> use a lancet with
                    some skill, and could distinguish between <lb/> vein and artery. By piercing
                    deep into the latter, I should <lb/> shun the evils which the future had in
                    store for me, and <lb/> take refuge from my woes in quiet death.</p>
                <p>I started on my feet, for my feebleness was gone, and <lb/> hasted to the closet.
                    A lancet and other small instruments <lb/> were preserved in a case which I had
                    deposited here. <reg orig="In-|attentive">Inattentive</reg>
                    <lb/> as I was to foreign considerations, my ears were <lb/> still open to any
                    sound of mysterious import that should <lb/> occur. I thought I heard a step in
                    the entry. My <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg>
                    <lb/> was suspended, and I cast an eager glance at my <lb/> chamber door, which
                    was open. No one appeared, unless <lb/> the shadow which I discerned upon the
                    floor, was the <reg orig="out-|line">outline</reg>
                    <lb/> of a man. If it were, I was authorized to suspect that <lb/> some one was
                    posted close to the entrance, who possibly <lb/> had overheard my
                    exclamations.</p>
                <p>My teeth chattered, and a wild confusion took place of <lb/> my momentary calm.
                    Thus it was when a terrific visage had <lb/>
                    <pb n="181" entity="eaf033v1_0222" pid="uva-lib:349252">
                        <fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">18*</fw>
                    </pb> disclosed itself on a former night. Thus it was when the <lb/> evil
                    destiny of Wieland assumed the lineaments of something <lb/> human. What horrid
                    apparition was preparing to blast my <lb/> sight?</p>
                <p>Still I listened and gazed. Not long, for the shadow <reg orig="mov-|ed"
                        >moved</reg>; <lb/> a foot, unshapely and huge, was thurst forward; a <lb/>
                    form advanced from its concealment, and stalked into the <lb/> room. It was
                    Carwin!</p>
                <p>While I had breath I shrieked. While I had power over <lb/> my muscles, I
                    motioned with my hand that he should vanish. <lb/> My exertions could not last
                    long; I sunk into a fit.</p>
                <p>O that this grateful oblivion had lasted forever! Too <lb/> quickly I recovered
                    my senses. The power of distinct vision <lb/> was no sooner restored to me, than
                    this hateful form again <lb/> presented itself, and I once more relapsed.</p>
                <p>A second time, untoward nature recalled me from the <lb/> sleep of death. I found
                    myself stretched upon the bed. <lb/> When I had power to look up, I remembered
                    only that I <lb/> had cause to fear. My distempered fancy fashioned to itself
                    <lb/> no distinguishable image. I threw a languid glance round <lb/> me; once
                    more my eyes lighted upon Carwin.</p>
                <p>He was seated on the floor, his back rested against the <lb/> wall, his kness
                    were drawn up, and his face was buried in <lb/> his hands. That his station was
                    at some distance, that his <lb/> attitude was not menacing, that his ominous
                    visage was <reg orig="con-|cealed">concealed</reg>, <lb/> may account for my now
                    escaping a shock, violent <lb/> as those which were past. I withdrew my eyes,
                    but was <lb/> not again deserted by my senses.</p>
                <p>On perceiving that I had recovered my sensibility, he <reg orig="lift-|ed"
                        >lifted</reg>
                    <lb/> his head. This motion attracted my attention. His <lb/> countenance was
                    mild, but sorrow and astonishment sat <lb/> upon his features. I averted my eyes
                    and feebly <reg orig="exclaim-|ed&mdash;&quot;O">exclaimed&mdash;"O</reg>! <lb/>
                    fly&mdash;fly far and forever!&mdash;I cannot behold you <lb/> and live!"</p>
                <p>He did not rise upon his feet, but clasped his hands, and <lb/> said in a tone of
                    deprecation&mdash;"I will fly. I am become a <lb/> fiend, the sight of whom
                    destroys. Yet tell me my offence! <lb/> You have linked curses with my name; you
                    ascribe to me <lb/> a malice monstrous and infernal. I look around; all is <lb/>
                    loneliness and desert! This house and your brother's are <lb/>
                    <pb n="182" entity="eaf033v1_0223" pid="uva-lib:349253"/> solitary and
                    dismantled! You die away at the sight of me! <lb/> My fear whispers that some
                    deed of horror has been <reg orig="per-|petrated">perpetrated</reg>; <lb/> that
                    I am the undesigning cause."</p>
                <p>What language was this? Had he not avowed himself a <lb/> ravisher? Had not this
                    chamber witnessed his atrocious <reg orig="pur-|poses">purposes</reg>? <lb/> I
                    besought him with new vehemence to go.</p>
                <p>He lifted his eyes&mdash;"Great heaven! what have I done? <lb/> I think I know
                    the extent of my offences. I have acted, but <lb/> my action have possibly
                    effected more than I designed. <lb/> This fear has brought me back from my
                    retreat. I come to <lb/> repair the evil of which my rashness was the cause, and
                    to <lb/> prevent more evil. I come to confess my errors."</p>
                <p>"Wretch!" I cried when my suffocating emotions would <lb/> permit me to speak,
                    "the ghosts of my sister and her <reg orig="child-|ren">children</reg>, <lb/> do
                    they not rise to accuse thee? Who was it that blasted <lb/> the intellects of
                    Wieland? Who was it that urged him to <lb/> fury, and guided him to murder? Who,
                    but thou and the <lb/> devil, with whom thou art confederated?"</p>
                <p>At these words a new spirit pervaded his countenance. <lb/> His eyes once more
                    appealed to heaven. "If I have memory, <lb/> if I have being, I am innocent. I
                    intended no ill; but my <lb/> folly, indirectly and remotely, may have caused
                    it; but what <lb/> words are these! Your brother lunatic! His children <lb/>
                    dead!"</p>
                <p>What should I infer from this deportment? Was the <lb/> ignorance which these
                    words implied real or pretended?&mdash; <lb/> Yet how could I imagine a mere
                    human agency in these <lb/> events? But if the influence was preternatural or
                    maniacal <lb/> in my brother's case, they must be equally so in my own. <lb/>
                    Then I remembered that the voice exerted, was to save me <lb/> from Carwin's
                    attempts. These ideas tended to abate my <lb/> abhorrence of this man, and to
                    detect the absurdity of my <lb/> accusations.</p>
                <p>"Alas!" said I, have no one to accuse. Leave me to <lb/> my fate. Fly from a
                    scene stained with cruelty; devoted <lb/> to despair."</p>
                <p>Carwin stood for a time musing and mournful. At length <lb/> he said, "What has
                    happened? I came to expiate my crimes; <lb/> let me know them in their full
                    extent. I have horrible <reg orig="fore-|bodings">forebodings</reg>! <lb/> What
                    has happened?"</p>
                <p>I was silent; but recollecting the intimation given by this <lb/>
                    <pb n="183" entity="eaf033v1_0224" pid="uva-lib:349254"/> man when he was
                    detected in my closet, which implied some <lb/> knowledge of that power which
                    interfered in my favor, I <lb/> eagerly inquired, "What was that voice which
                    called upon <lb/> me to hold when I attempted to open the closet? What <lb/>
                    face was that which I saw at the bottom of the stairs? <reg orig="An-|swer"
                        >Answer</reg>
                    <lb/> me truly."</p>
                <p>"I came to confess the truth. Your allusions are <reg orig="horri-|ble"
                        >horrible</reg>
                    <lb/> and strange. Perhaps I have but faint conceptions of <lb/> the evils which
                    my infatuation has produced; but what <reg orig="re-|mains">remains</reg>
                    <lb/> I will perform. It was <hi rend="italic">my voice</hi> that you heard! It
                    <lb/> was <hi rend="italic">my face</hi> that you saw!"</p>
                <p>For a moment I doubted whether my remembrance of <lb/> events were not confused.
                    How could he be at once <reg orig="sta-|tioned">stationed</reg>
                    <lb/> at my shoulder and shut up in my closet? How could <lb/> he stand near me
                    and yet be invisible? But if Carwin's <lb/> were the thrilling voice and the
                    fiery visage which I had <lb/> heard and seen, then was he the prompter of my
                    brother, <lb/> and the author of these dismal outrages.</p>
                <p>Once more I averted my eyes and struggled for speech. <lb/> "Begone! thou man of
                    mischief! Remorseless and <reg orig="im-|placable">implacable</reg>
                    <lb/> miscreant! begone!"</p>
                <p>"I will obey," said he in a disconsolate voice; "yet, <lb/> wretch as I am, am I
                    unworthy to repair the evils that I have <lb/> committed? I came as a repentant
                    criminal. It is you <lb/> whom I have injured, and at your bar am I willing to
                        <reg orig="ap-|pear">appear</reg>, <lb/> and confess and expiate my crimes.
                    I have deceived <lb/> you; I have sported with your terrors; I have plotted to
                    <lb/> destroy your reputation. I come now to remove your errors; <lb/> to set

                    able.</p>
                <p>"This is the amount of my guilt, and this the fruit of my <lb/> remorse. Will you
                    not hear me? Listen to my confession, <lb/> and then denounce punishment. All I

                <p>Carwin's eyes glared, and his limbs were petrified at this <lb/> intelligence. No

                    <lb/> of these enormities; at the time, however, I was nearly <lb/> insensible

                    having recovered some <reg orig="de-|gree">degree</reg>
                    <lb/> of composure, he spoke&mdash;</p>
                <p>"I am not this villain; I have slain no one; I have prompted <lb/> none to slay;
                    I have handled a tool of wonderful efficacy <lb/> without malignant intentions,
                    but without caution; ample <lb/> will be the punishment of my temerity, if my
                    conduct has <lb/> contributed to this evil." He paused.&mdash;</p>
                <p>I likewise was silent. I struggled to command myself <lb/> so far as to listen to

                            <lb/> without a tongue. In one case, the organ was originally wanting,
                            but <lb/> its place was supplied by a small tubercle, and the uvula was
                            perfect. <lb/> In the other, the tongue was destroyed by disease, but
                            probably a small <lb/> part of it remained.</p><p>This power is

                <p>"For a time the possession of so potent and stupendous <lb/> an endowment elated
                    me with pride. Unfortified by <reg orig="prin-|ciple">principle</reg>, <lb/>
                    subjected to poverty, stimulated by headlong <reg orig="pas-|sions"

                    exerted to <lb/> lead superstition, conquer avarice, or excite awe.</p>
                <p>"I left America, which is my native soil, in my youth. <lb/> I have been engaged
                    in various scenes of life, in which <lb/> my peculiar talent has been exercised
                    with more or less <reg orig="suc-|cess">success</reg>. <lb/> I was finally
                    betrayed by one who called himself <lb/> my friend, into acts which cannot be
                    justified, though they <lb/> are susceptible of apology.</p>
                <p>"The perfidy of this man compelled me to withdraw <lb/> from Europe. I returned
                    to my native country, uncertain <lb/> whether silence and obscurity would save
                    me from his <reg orig="ma-|lice">malice</reg>. <lb/> I resided in the purlieus
                    of the city. I put on the <lb/> garb and assumed the manners of a clown.</p>
                <p>"My chief recreation was walking. My principal haunts <lb/> were the lawns and

                    <lb/> region the luxuriances of nature had been chastened by <lb/> judicious
                    art, and each successive contemplation unfolded <lb/> new enchantments.</p>
                <p>"I was studious of seclusion; I was satiated with the <lb/> intercourse of
                    mankind, and discretion required me to shun <lb/> their intercourse. For these
                    reasons I long avoided the <lb/> observation of your family, and chiefly visited

                    <lb/> its roof, revolving no pleasing meditations. When, in <lb/> my frequent

                    <lb/> I gave a different direction to my steps. One <lb/> evening, when a shower
                    had just passed, judging by the <lb/>
                    <pb n="186" entity="eaf033v1_0227" pid="uva-lib:349257"/> silence that no one
                    was within, I ascended to this building. <lb/> Glancing carelessly round, I
                    perceived an open letter on <lb/> the pedestal. To read it was doubtless an
                    offence against <lb/> politeness. Of this offence, however, I was guilty.</p>
                <p>"Scarcely had I gone half through when I was alarmed <lb/> by the approach of
                    your brother. To scramble down the <lb/> cliff on the opposite side was
                    impracticable. I was <reg orig="unpre-|pared">unprepared</reg>
                    <lb/> to meet a stranger. Besides the awkwardness <reg orig="at-|tending"
                        >attending</reg>
                    <lb/> such an interview in these circumstances, <reg orig="conceal-|ment"
                        >concealment</reg>
                    <lb/> was necessary to my safety. A thousand times had <lb/> I vowed never again
                    to employ the dangerous talent which <lb/> I possessed; but such was the force
                    of habit and the <reg orig="in-|fluence">influence</reg>
                    <lb/> of present convenience, that I used this method of <lb/> arresting his
                    progress and leading him back to the house, <lb/> with his errand, whatever it
                    was, unperformed. I had <lb/> often caught parts, from my station below, of your
                        <reg orig="conver-|sation">conversation</reg>
                    <lb/> in this place, and was well acquainted with the voice <lb/> of your
                    sister.</p>
                <p>"Some weeks after this I was again quietly seated in this <lb/> recess. The
                    lateness of the hour secured me, as I thought, <lb/> from all interruption. In
                    this, however, I was mistaken, <lb/> for Wieland and Pleyel, as I judged by
                    their voices, earnest <lb/> in dispute, ascended the hill.</p>
                <p>"I was not sensible that any inconvenience could <reg orig="possi-|bly"
                        >possibly</reg>
                    <lb/> have flowed from my former exertion; yet it was <reg orig="fol-|lowed"
                        >followed</reg>
                    <lb/> with compunction, because it was a deviation from a <lb/> path which I had
                    assigned to myself. Now my aversion to <lb/> this means of escape was enforced
                    by an unauthorized <reg orig="curi-|osity">curiosity</reg>, <lb/> and by the
                    knowledge of a bushy hollow on the edge <lb/> of the hill, where I should be
                    safe from discovery. Into <lb/> this hollow I thrust myself.</p>
                <p>"The propriety of removal to Europe was the question <lb/> eagerly discussed.
                    Pleyel intimated that his anxiety to go <lb/> was augmented by the silence of
                    Theresa de Stolberg. <lb/> The temptation to interfere in this dispute was
                    irresistible. <lb/> In vain I contended with inveterate habits. I disguised to
                    <lb/> myself the impropriety of my conduct, by recollecting the <lb/> benefits
                    which it might produce. Pleyel's proposal was <reg orig="un-|wise">unwise</reg>,
                    <lb/> yet it was enforced with plausible arguments and <reg
                        orig="inde-|fatigable">indefatigable</reg>
                    <lb/> zeal. Your brother might be puzzled and wearied, <lb/>
                    <pb n="187" entity="eaf033v1_0228" pid="uva-lib:349258"/> but could not be
                    convinced. I conceived that to terminate <lb/> the controversy in favor of the
                    latter was conferring a <reg orig="bene-|fit">benefit</reg>
                    <lb/> on all parties. For this end I profited by an opening <lb/> in the
                    conversation, and assured them of Catharine's <reg orig="irre-|concilable"
                        >irreconcilable</reg>
                    <lb/> aversion to the scheme, and of the death of the <lb/> Saxon baroness. The
                    latter event was merely a <reg orig="conjec-|ture">conjecture</reg>, <lb/> but
                    rendered extremely probable by Pleyel's <reg orig="repre-|sentations"
                        >representations</reg>. <lb/> My purpose, you need not be told, was <reg

                <p>"My passion for mystery, and a species of imposture, <lb/> which I deemed
                    harmless, was thus awakened afresh. This <lb/> second lapse into error made my
                    recovery more difficult. <lb/> I cannot convey to you an adequate idea of the
                    kind of <lb/> gratification which I derived from these exploits; yet I <lb/>
                    meditated nothing. My views were bounded to the passing <lb/> moment, and
                    commonly suggested by the momentary <reg orig="exi-|gence">exigence</reg>.</p>
                <p>"I must not conceal any thing. Your principles teach <lb/> you to abhor a

                    captivated by her charms, and her principles <lb/> were easily seen to be

                    <lb/> but she was taught that the best use of her charms <lb/> consists in the

                    <lb/> converted you into an object of worship. She <lb/> chiefly dwelt upon your

                <p>"Hence a vague project occurred to me, to put this <reg orig="cour-|age"

                    <lb/> to the test. A woman capable of recollection in danger, <lb/> of warding

                    proof of cowardice or courage <lb/> which I expected from you, would have been
                    your <reg orig="remain-|ing">remaining</reg>
                    <lb/> inactive in your bed, or your entering the closet with a <lb/> view to
                    assist the sufferer. Some instances which Judith <lb/> related of your
                    fearlessness and and promptitude made me <lb/> adopt the latter supposition with
                    some degree of confidence.</p>
                <p>"By the girl's direction I found a ladder, and mounted <lb/> to your closet
                    window. This is scarcely large enough to <lb/> admit the head, but it answered
                    my purpose too well.</p>
                <p>"I cannot express my confusion and surprise at your <lb/> abrupt and precipitate
                    flight. I hastily removed the ladder; <lb/> and, after some pause, curiosity and
                    doubts of your safety <lb/> induced me to follow you. I found you stretched on
                    the <lb/> turf before your brother's door, without sense or motion. <lb/> I felt
                    the deepest regret at this unlooked for consequence of <lb/> my scheme. I knew
                    not what to do to procure you relief. <lb/> The idea of awakening the family
                    naturally presented itself. <lb/> This emergency was critical, and there was no
                    time to <reg orig="de-|liberate">deliberate</reg>. <lb/> It was a sudden thought
                    that occurred. I put <lb/> my lips to the key-hole, and sounded an alarm which

                    <lb/> roused the sleepers. My organs were naturally <reg orig="for-|cible"

                </pb>
                <p>"Long and bitterly did I repent of my scheme. I was <lb/> somewhat consoled by
                    reflecting that my purpose had not <lb/> been evil, and renewed my fruitless
                    vows never to attempt <lb/> such dangerous experiments. For some time I adhered,
                    <lb/> with laudable forbearance, to this resolution.</p>
                <p>"My life has been a life of hardship and exposure. In <lb/> the summer I prefer
                    to make my bed of the smooth turf, or, <lb/> at most, the shelter of a summer
                    house suffices. In all my <lb/> rambles I never found a spot in which so many
                    picturesque <lb/> beauties and rural delights were assembled as at Mettingen.
                    <lb/> No corner of your little domain unites fragrance and secrecy <lb/> in so
                    perfect a degree as the recess in the bank. The odour <lb/> of its leaves, the
                    coolness of its shade, and the music of its <lb/> water-fall, had early
                    attracted my attention. Here my <reg orig="sad-|ness">sadness</reg>
                    <lb/> was converted into peaceful melancholy&mdash;here my <lb/> slumbers were
                    sound, and my pleasures enhanced.</p>
                <p>"As most free from interruption, I chose this as the scene <lb/> of my midnight
                    interviews with Judith. One evening, as <lb/> the sun declined, I was seated
                    here, when I was alarmed by <lb/> your approach. It was with difficulty that I
                    effected my <lb/> escape unnoticed by you.</p>
                <p>"At the customary hour, I returned to your habitation, <lb/> and was made
                    acquainted by Judith, with your unusual <lb/> absence. I half suspected the true
                    cause, and felt <reg orig="uneasi-|ness">uneasiness</reg>
                    <lb/> at the danger there was that I should be deprived of <lb/> my retreat; or,
                    at least, interrupted in the possession of it. <lb/> The girl likewise informed
                    me, that among your other <reg orig="sin-|gularities">singularities</reg>, <lb/>
                    it was not uncommon for you to leave your bed, <lb/> and walk forth for the sake
                    of night-airs and starlight <reg orig="con-|templations"
                    >contemplations</reg>.</p>
                <p>"I desired to prevent this inconvenience. I found you <lb/> easily swayed by
                    fear. I was influenced, in my choice of <lb/> means, by the facility and
                    certainty of that to which I had <lb/> been accustomed. All that I foresaw was,
                    that, in future, <lb/> this spot would be cautiously shunned by you.</p>
                <p>"I entered the recess with the utmost caution, and <reg orig="dis-|covered"
                        >discovered</reg>, <lb/> by your breathings, in what condition you were.
                    <lb/> The unexpected interpretation which you placed upon my <lb/> former
                    proceeding, suggested my conduct on the present <lb/> occasion. The mode in
                    which heaven is said by the poet, <lb/>

                    <lb/> to my province, and never failed to occur to me at <lb/> seasons like
                    this. It was requisite to break your slumbers, <lb/> and for this end I uttered
                    the powerful monosyllable, `hold! <lb/> hold!' My purpose was not prescribed by
                    duty, yet surely <lb/> it was far from being atrocious and inexpiable. To effect
                    it, I <lb/> uttered what was false, but it was well suited to my purpose. <lb/>
                    Nothing less was intended than to injure you. Nay, the <lb/> evil resulting from
                    my former act, was partly removed by <lb/> assuring you that in all places but
                    this you were safe.</p>

                <p>"Your house was rendered, by your frequent and long <lb/> absences, easily
                    accessible to my curiosity. My meeting <lb/> with Pleyel was the prelude to
                    direct intercourse with you. <lb/> I had seen much of the world, but your
                    character exhibited <lb/> a specimen of human powers that was wholly new to me.
                    <lb/> My intercourse with your servant furnished me with curious <lb/> details
                    of your domestic management. I was of a different <lb/> sex; I was not your
                    husband; I was not even your friend; <lb/> yet my knowledge of you was of that
                    kind, which conjugal <lb/> intimacies can give, and, in some respects, more
                    accurate. <lb/> The observation of your domestic was guided by me.</p>
                <p>"You will not be surprised that I should sometimes profit <lb/> by your absence,
                    and adventure to examine with my own <lb/> eyes, the interior of your chamber.
                    Upright and sincere, <lb/> you used no watchfulness, and practised no
                    precautions. I <lb/> scrutinized every thing, and pried every where. Your closet
                    <lb/> was usually locked, but it was once my fortune to find the <lb/> key on a

                <p>curiosity in your books. One of these was manuscript, and <lb/> written in
                    characters which essentially agreed with a <reg orig="short-|hand"
                        >shorthand</reg>
                    <lb/> system which I had learned from a Jesuit missionary.</p>
                <p>"I cannot justify my conduct, yet my only crime was <lb/> curiosity. I perused
                    this volume with eagerness. The <lb/> intellect which it unveiled, was brighter
                    than my limited and <lb/> feeble organs could bear. I was naturally inquisitive
                    as to <lb/> your ideas respecting my deportment, and the mysteries <lb/> that
                    had lately occurred.</p>
                <p>"You know what you have written. You know that in <lb/> this volume the key to
                    your inmost soul was contained. If <lb/> I had been a profound and malignant
                    imposter, what <reg orig="plen-|teous">plenteous</reg>
                    <lb/> materials were thus furnished me of stratagems and <lb/> plots!</p>
                <p>"The coincidence of your dream in the summer-house <lb/> with my exclamation, was
                    truly wonderful. The voice <lb/> which warned you to forbear was, doubtless,
                    mine; but <lb/> mixed by a common process of the fancy, with the train of <lb/>
                    visionary incidents.</p>
                <p>"I saw in a stronger light than ever, the dangerousness <lb/> of that instrument
                    which I employed, and renewed my <lb/> resolutions to abstain from the use of it
                    in future; but I was <lb/> destinued perpetually to violate my resolutions. By
                    some <lb/> perverse fate, I was led into circumstances in which the <lb/>
                    exertion of my powers was the sole or the best means of <lb/> escape.</p>
                <p>"On that memorable night on which our last interview <lb/> took place, I came as
                    usual to Mettingen. I was apprized <lb/> of your engagement at your brother's,
                    from which you did <lb/> not expect to return till late. Some incident suggested
                    <lb/> the design of visiting your chamber. Among your books <lb/> which I had
                    not examined, might be something tending to <lb/> illustrate your character, or
                    the history of your family. <lb/> Some intimation had been dropped by you in
                    discourse, <lb/> respecting a performance of your father, in which some <reg
                        orig="im-|portant">important</reg>
                    <lb/> transaction in his life was recorded.</p>
                <p>"I was desirous of seeing this book; and such was my <lb/> habitual attachment to
                    mystery, that I preferred the <reg orig="clandes-|tine">clandestine</reg>
                    <lb/> perusal of it. Such were the motives that induced me <lb/> to make this
                    attempt. Judith had disappeared, and finding <lb/>
                    <pb n="192" entity="eaf033v1_0233" pid="uva-lib:349263"/> the house unoccupied,
                    I supplied myself with a light, and <lb/> proceeded to your chamber.</p>
                <p>"I found it easy, on experiment, to lock and unlock <lb/> your closet door
                    without the aid of a key. I shut myself <lb/> in this recess, and was busily
                    exploring your shelves, when <lb/> I heard some one enter the room below. I was
                    at a loss <lb/> who it could be, whether you or your servant. Doubtful <lb/>
                    however, as I was, I conceived it prudent to extinguish the <lb/> light.
                    Scarcely was this done, when some one entered <lb/> the chamber. The footsteps
                    were easily distinguished to <lb/> be yours.</p>
                <p>"My situation was now full of danger and perplexity. <lb/> For some time, I
                    cherished the hope that you would leave <lb/> the room so long as to afford me
                    an opportunity of escaping. <lb/> As the hours passed, this hope gradually
                    deserted me. It <lb/> was plain that you had retired for the night.</p>
                <p>"I knew not how soon you might find occasion to enter <lb/> the closet. I was
                    alive to all the horrors of detection, and <lb/> ruminated without ceasing, on
                    the behaviour which it would <lb/> be proper, in case of detection, to adopt. I
                    was unable to <lb/> discover any consistent method of accounting for my being
                    <lb/> thus immured.</p>
                <p>"It occurred to me that I might withdraw you from your <lb/> chamber for a few
                    minutes, by counterfeiting a voice from <lb/> without. Some message from your
                    brother might be <reg orig="de-|livered">delivered</reg>, <lb/> requiring your
                    presence at his house. I was <reg orig="de-|terred">deterred</reg>
                    <lb/> from this scheme by reflecting on the resolution I had <lb/> formed, and
                    on the possible evils that might result from it. <lb/> Besides, it was not
                    improbable that you would speedily <lb/> retire to bed, and then, by the
                    exercise of sufficient caution, <lb/> I might hope to escape unobserved.</p>
                <p>"Meanwhile I listened with the deepest anxiety to every <lb/> motion from
                    without. I discovered nothing which <reg orig="betoken-|ed">betokened</reg>
                    <lb/> preparation for sleep. Instead of this I heard deep <lb/> drawn sighs, and
                    occasionally a half expressed and <reg orig="mourn-|ful">mournful</reg>
                    <lb/> ejaculation. Hence I inferred that you were unhappy. <lb/> The true state
                    of your mind with regard to Pleyel your <lb/> own pen had disclosed; but I
                    supposed you to be framed <lb/> of such materials, that, though a momentary
                    sadness might <lb/>

                    </pb> affect you, you were impregnable to any permanent and <lb/> heartfelt
                    grief. Inquietude for my own safety was, for a <lb/> moment, suspended by
                    sympathy with your distress.</p>
                <p>"To the former consideration I was quickly recalled by <lb/> a motion of yours
                    which indicated I knew not what. I <lb/> fostered the persuasion that you would
                    now retire to bed; <lb/> but presently you approached the closet, and detection
                        <reg orig="seem-|ed">seemed</reg>
                    <lb/> to be inevitable. You put your hand upon the lock. I <lb/> had formed no
                    plan to extricate myself from the dilemma in <lb/> which the opening of the door
                    would involve me. I felt <lb/> an irreconcilable aversion to detection. Thus
                    situated, I <lb/> involuntarily seized the door with a resolution to resist your
                    <lb/> efforts to open it.</p>
                <p>"Suddenly you receded from the door. This <reg orig="deport-|ment"
                        >deportment</reg>
                    <lb/> was inexplicable, but the relief it afforded me was <lb/> quickly gone.
                    You returned, and I once more was thrown <lb/> into perplexity. The expedient
                    that suggested itself was <lb/> precipitate and inartificial. I exerted my
                    organs and called <lb/> upon you <hi rend="italic">to hold.</hi></p>
                <p>"That you should persist in spite of this admonition, <lb/> was a subject of
                    astonishment. I again resisted your efforts; <lb/> for the first expedient
                    having failed, I knew not what other <lb/> to resort to. In this state, how was
                    my astonishment <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg>
                    <lb/> when I heard your exclamations!</p>
                <p>"It was now plain that you knew me to be within. <lb/> Further resistance was
                    unavailing and useless. The door <lb/> opened, and I shrunk backward. Seldom
                    have I felt <reg orig="deep-|er">deeper</reg>
                    <lb/> mortification, and more painful perplexity. I did not <lb/> consider that
                    the truth would be less injurious than any lie <lb/> which I could hastily
                    frame. Conscious as I was of a <lb/> certain degree of guilt, I conceived that
                    you would form <lb/> the most odious suspicions. The truth would be <reg
                        orig="imper-|fect">imperfect</reg>, <lb/> unless I were likewise to explain
                    the mysterious <reg orig="admo-|nition">admonition</reg>
                    <lb/> which had been given; but that explanation was of <lb/> too great moment,
                    and involved too extensive consequences <lb/> to make me suddenly resolve to
                    give it.</p>
                <p>"I was aware that this discovery would associate itself <lb/> in your mind, with
                    the dialogue formerly heard in this closet. <lb/> Thence would your suspicions
                    be aggravated, and to escape <lb/> from these suspicions would be impossible.
                    But the mere <lb/>
                    <pb n="194" entity="eaf033v1_0235" pid="uva-lib:349265"/> truth would be
                    sefficiently opprobrious, and deprive me for <lb/> ever of your good
                    opinion.</p>
                <p>"Thus was I rendered desperate, and my mind rapidly <lb/> passed to the
                    contemplation of the use that might be made <lb/> of previous events. Some good
                    genius would appear to <lb/> you to have interposed to save you from injury
                    intended by <lb/> me. Why, I said, since I must sink in her opinion, should
                    <lb/> I not cherish this belief? Why not personate an enemy, <lb/> and pretend
                    that celestial interference has frustrated my <lb/> schemes? I must fly, but let
                    me leave wonder and fear <lb/> behind me. Elucidation of the mystery will always
                    be <lb/> practicable. I shall do no injury, but merely talk of evil <lb/> that
                    was designed, but is now past.</p>
                <p>"Thus I extenuated my conduct to myself, but I <reg orig="scarce-|ly"
                        >scarcely</reg>
                    <lb/> expect that this will be to you a sufficient explication of <lb/> the
                    scene that followed. Those habits which I have imbibed, <lb/> the rooted passion
                    which possesses me for scattering around <lb/> me amazement and fear, you enjoy
                    no opportunities of <lb/> knowing. That a man should wantonly impute to himself
                    <lb/> the most flagitious designs, will hardly be credited, even <lb/> though
                    you reflect that my reputation was already, by my <lb/> own folly, irretrievably
                    ruined; and that it was always in <lb/> my power to communicate the truth, and
                    rectify the <lb/> mistake.</p>
                <p>"I left you to ponder on this scene. My mind was full <lb/> of rapid and
                    incongruous ideas. Compunction, self-<reg orig="upbraid-|ing">upbraiding</reg>,
                    <lb/> hopelessness, satisfaction at the view of those effects <lb/> likely to
                    flow from my new scheme, misgivings as to the <lb/> beneficial result of this
                    scheme, took possession of my mind, <lb/> and seemed to struggle for the
                    mastery.</p>
                <p>"I had gone too far to recede. I had painted myself to <lb/> you as an assassin
                    and ravisher, withheld from guilt only by <lb/> a voice from heaven. I had thus
                    reverted into the path of <lb/> error, and now, having gone thus far, my
                    progress seemed <lb/> to be irrevocable. I said to myself, I must leave these
                        <reg orig="pre-|cincts">precincts</reg>
                    <lb/> forever. My acts have blasted my fame in the eyes <lb/> of the Wielands.
                    For the sake of creating a mysterious <lb/> dread, I have made myself a villain.
                    I may complete this <lb/> mysterious plan by some new imposture, but I cannot
                        <reg orig="ag-|gravate">aggravate</reg>
                    <lb/> my supposed guilt.</p>
                <pb n="195" entity="eaf033v1_0236" pid="uva-lib:349266"/>
                <p>"My resolution was formed, and I was swiftly <reg orig="ruminat-|ing"
                        >ruminating</reg>
                    <lb/> on the means for executing it, when Pleyel appeared in <lb/> sight. This
                    incident decided my conduct. It was plain <lb/> that Pleyel was a devoted lover,
                    but he was, at the same <lb/> time, a man of cold resolves and exquisite
                    sagacity. To <lb/> deceive him would be the sweetest triumph I had ever <lb/>
                    enjoyed. The deception would be momentary, but it <lb/> would likewise be
                    complete. That his delusion would so <lb/> soon be rectified, was a
                    recommendation to my scheme, for <lb/> I esteemed him too much to desire to
                    entail upon him <reg orig="last-|ing">lasting</reg>
                    <lb/> agonies.</p>
                <p>"I had no time to reflect further, for he proceeded, with <lb/> a quick step,
                    towards the house. I was hurried onward <reg orig="in-|voluntarily"
                        >involuntarily</reg>
                    <lb/> and by a mechanical impulse. I followed him <lb/> as he passed the recess
                    in the bank, and shrouding myself <lb/> in that spot, I counterfeited sounds
                    which I knew would <lb/> arrest his steps.</p>
                <p>"He stopped, turned, listened, approached, and <reg orig="over-|heard"
                        >overheard</reg>
                    <lb/> a dialogue whose purpose was to vanquish his belief <lb/> in a point where
                    his belief was most difficult to vanquish. <lb/> I exerted all my powers to
                    imitate your voice, your general <lb/> sentiments, and your language. Being
                    master, by means <lb/> of your journal, of your personal history and most secret
                    <lb/> thoughts, my efforts were the more successful. When I <lb/> review the
                    tenor of this dialogue, I cannot believe but that <lb/> Pleyel was deluded. When
                    I think of your character, <lb/> and of the inferences which this dialogue was
                    intended to <lb/> suggest, it seems incredible that this delusion should be
                    <lb/> produced.</p>
                <p>"I spared not myself. I called myself murderer, thief, <lb/> guilty of
                    innumerable perjuries and misdeeds; that you had <lb/> debased yourself to the
                    level of such a one, no evidence, <lb/> methought, would suffice to convince him
                    who knew you so <lb/> thoroughly as Pleyel; and yet the imposture amounted to
                    <lb/> proof which the most jealous scrutiny would find to be <reg
                        orig="un-|exceptionable">unexceptionable</reg>.</p>
                <p>"He left his station precipitately and resumed his way <lb/> to the house. I saw
                    that the detection of his error would <lb/> be instantaneous, since, not having
                    gone to bed, an <reg orig="imme-|diate">immediate</reg>
                    <lb/> interview would take place between you. At first <lb/>
                    <pb n="196" entity="eaf033v1_0237" pid="uva-lib:349267"/> this circumstance was
                    considered with regret; but as time <lb/> opened my eyes to the possible
                    consequences of this scene, <lb/> I regarded it with pleasure.</p>
                <p>"In a short time the infatuation which had led me thus <lb/> far began to
                    subside. The remembrance of former <reg orig="reason-|ings">reasonings</reg>
                    <lb/> and transactions was renewed. How often I had <lb/> repented this kind of
                    exertion; how many evils were <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg>
                    <lb/> by it which I had not foreseen; what occasions for <lb/> the bitterest
                    remorse it had administered, now passed <lb/> through my mind. The black
                    catalogue of stratagems was <lb/> now increased. I had inspired you with the
                    most vehement <lb/> terrors; I had filled your mind with faith in shadows and
                    <lb/> confidence in dreams; I had depraved the imagination of <lb/> Pleyel; I
                    had exhibited you to his understanding as <reg orig="devot-|ed">devoted</reg>
                    <lb/> to brutal gratifications and consummate in hypocrisy. <lb/> The evidence
                    which accompanied this delusion would be <lb/> irresistible to one whose passion
                    had perverted his <reg orig="judg-|ment">judgment</reg>, <lb/> whose jealousy
                    with regard to me had already been <lb/> excited, and who, therefore, would not
                    fail to overrate the <lb/> force of this evidence. What fatal act of despair or
                    of <lb/> vengeance might not this error produce?</p>
                <p>"With regard to myself, I had acted with a frenzy that <lb/> surpassed belief. I
                    had warred against my peace and my <lb/> fame; I had banished myself from the
                    fellowship of <reg orig="vigor-|ous">vigorous</reg>
                    <lb/> and pure minds; I was self expelled from a scene <lb/> which the
                    munificence of nature had adorned with <reg orig="unrival-|led">unrivalled</reg>
                    <lb/> beauties, and from haunts in which all the muses and <lb/> humanities had
                    taken refuge.</p>
                <p>"I was thus torn by conflicting fears and tumultuous <reg orig="re-|grets"
                        >regrets</reg>. <lb/> The night passed away in this state of confusion;
                    <lb/> and next morning in the gazette left at my obscure lodging, <lb/> I read a
                    description and an offer of reward for the <reg orig="appre-|hension"
                        >apprehension</reg>
                    <lb/> of my person. I was said to have escaped from <lb/> an Irish prison, in
                    which I was confined as an offender <reg orig="con-|victed">convicted</reg>
                    <lb/> of enormous and complicated crimes.</p>
                <p>"This was the work of an enemy, who, by falsehood and <lb/> stratagem, had
                    procured my condemnation. I was, indeed, <lb/> a prisoner, but escaped, by the
                    exertion of my powers, the <lb/> fate to which I was doomed, but which I did not
                    deserve. <lb/> I had hoped that the malice of my foe was exhausted; but <lb/>
                    <pb n="197" entity="eaf033v1_0238" pid="uva-lib:349268"/> I now perceived that
                    my precautions had been wise, for <lb/> that the intervention of an ocean was
                    insufficient for my <lb/> security.</p>
                <p>"Let me not dwell on the sensations which this discovery <lb/> produced. I need
                    not tell by what steps I was induced to <lb/> seek an interview with you, for
                    the purpose of disclosing <lb/> the truth, and repairing, as far as possible,
                    the effects of my <lb/> misconduct. It was unavoidable that this gazette would
                    fall <lb/> into your hands, and that it would tend to confirm every <lb/>
                    erroneous impression.</p>
                <p>"Having gained this interview, I purposed to seek some <lb/> retreat in the
                    wilderness, inaccessible to your inquiry and to <lb/> the malice of my foe,
                    where I might henceforth employ <lb/> myself in composing a faithful narrative
                    of my actions. I <lb/> designed it as my vindication from the aspersions that
                    had <lb/> rested on my character, and as a lesson to mankind on the <lb/> evils
                    of credulity on the one hand, and of imposture on the <lb/> other.</p>
                <p>"I wrote you a billet, which was left at the house of <lb/> your friend, and
                    which I knew would, by some means, <lb/> speedily come to your hands. I
                    entertained a faint hope <lb/> that my invitation would be complied with. I knew
                    not <lb/> what use you would make of the opportunity which this <lb/> proposal
                    afforded you of procuring the seizure of my <reg orig="per-|son">person</reg>;
                    <lb/> but this fate I was determined to avoid, and I had <lb/> no doubt but due
                    circumspection, and the exercise of the <lb/> faculty which I possessed, would
                    enable me to avoid it.</p>
                <p>"I lurked through the day, in the neighborhood of <reg orig="Met-|tingen"
                        >Mettingen</reg>; <lb/> I approached your habitation at the appointed hour:
                    <lb/> I entered it in silence, by a trap door which led into the <lb/> cellar.
                    This had formerly been bolted on the inside, but <lb/> Judith had, at an early
                    period in our intercourse, removed <lb/> this impediment. I ascended to the
                    first floor, but met with <lb/> no one, nor any thing that indicated the
                    presence of a <reg orig="hu-|man">human</reg>
                    <lb/> being.</p>
                <p>"I crept softly up stairs, and at length perceived your <lb/> chamber door to be
                    opened, and a light to be within. It <lb/> was of moment to discover by whom
                    this light was <reg orig="accompa-|nied">accompanied</reg>. <lb/> I was sensible
                    of the inconveniencies to which my <lb/> being discovered at your chamber door
                    by any one within <lb/>
                    <pb n="198" entity="eaf033v1_0239" pid="uva-lib:349269"/> would subject me; I
                    therefore called out in my own voice, <lb/> but so modified that it should
                    appear to ascend from the <lb/> court below, `Who is in the chamber? Is it Miss
                        <reg orig="Wie-|land">Wieland</reg>?'</p>
                <p>"No answer was returned to this summons. I listened, <lb/> but no motion could be
                    heard. After a pause I repeated <lb/> my call, but no less ineffectually.</p>
                <p>"I now approached nearer the door, and adventured to <lb/> look in. A light stood
                    on the table, but nothing human <lb/> was discernible. I entered cautiously, but
                    all was solitude <lb/> and stillness.</p>
                <p>"I knew not what to conclude. If the house were <reg orig="in-|habited"
                        >inhabited</reg>, <lb/> my call would have been noticed; yet some <reg
                        orig="sus-|picion">suspicion</reg>
                    <lb/> insinuated itself that silence was studiously kept by <lb/> persons who
                    intended to surprise me. My approach had <lb/> been wary, and the silence that
                    ensued my call had <reg orig="like-|wise">likewise</reg>
                    <lb/> preceded it; a circumstance that tended to dissipate <lb/> my fears.</p>
                <p>"At length it occurred to me that Judith might possibly <lb/> be in her own room.
                    I turned my steps thither; but she <lb/> was not to be found. I passed into
                    other rooms, and was <lb/> soon convinced that the house was totally deserted. I
                        <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg>
                    <lb/> to your chamber, agitated by vain surmises and <reg orig="op-|posite"
                        >opposite</reg>
                    <lb/> conjectures. The appointed hour had passed, and <lb/> I dismissed the hope
                    of an interview.</p>
                <p>"In this state of things I determined to leave a few lines <lb/> on your toilet,
                    and prosecute my journey to the mountains. <lb/> Scarcely had I taken the pen
                    when I laid it aside, <reg orig="uncer-|tain">uncertain</reg>
                    <lb/> in what manner to address you. I rose from the table <lb/> and walked
                    across the floor. A glance thrown upon the <lb/> bed acquainted me with a
                    spectacle to which my <reg orig="concep-|tions">conceptions</reg>
                    <lb/> of horror had not yet reached.</p>
                <p>"In the midst of shuddering and trepidation, the signal <lb/> of your presence in
                    the court below recalled me to myself. <lb/> The deed was newly done; I only was
                    in the house; what <lb/> had lately happened justified any suspicions, however
                        <reg orig="enor-|mous">enormous</reg>. <lb/> It was plain that this
                    catastrophe was unknown <lb/> to you; I thought upon the wild commotion which
                    the <reg orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg>
                    <lb/> would awaken in your breast; I found the <reg orig="confu-|sion"
                        >confusion</reg>
                    <lb/> of my own thoughts unconquerable, and perceived that <lb/>
                    <pb n="199" entity="eaf033v1_0240" pid="uva-lib:349270"/> the end for which I
                    sought an interview was not now to be <lb/> accomplished.</p>
                <p>"In this state of things it was likewise expedient to <reg orig="con-|ceal"
                        >conceal</reg>
                    <lb/> my being within. I put out the light and hurried <lb/> down the stairs. To
                    my unspeakable surprise, <reg orig="notwith-|standing">notwithstanding</reg>
                    <lb/> every motive to fear, you lighted a candle and <lb/> proceeded to your
                    chamber.</p>
                <p>"I retired to that room below from which a door leads <lb/> into the cellar. This
                    door concealed me from your view <lb/> as you passed. I thought upon the
                    spectacle which was <lb/> about to present itself. In an exigence so abrupt and
                    so <lb/> little foreseen, I was again subjected to the empire of <reg

                    <lb/> and habitual impulses. I dreaded the effects <lb/> which this shocking
                    exhibition, bursting on your unprepared <lb/> senses, might produce.</p>
                <p>"Thus actuated, I stept swiftly to the door, and <reg orig="thrust-|ing"

                    <lb/> my head forward, once more pronounced the mysterious <lb/> interdiction.
                    At that moment, by some untoward fate, your <lb/> eyes were cast back, and you
                    saw me in the very act of <lb/> utterance. I fled through the darksome avenue at
                    which I <lb/> entered, covered with the shame of this detection.</p>
                <p>"With diligence, stimulated by a thousand ineffable <lb/> emotions, I pursued my

                    <lb/> just passed. Nothing excited my wonder so much as the <lb/> means by which
                    you discovered my being in the closet. <lb/> This discovery appeared to be made
                    at the moment when <lb/> you attempted to open it. How could you have otherwise
                    <lb/> remained so long in the chamber apparently fearless and <lb/> tranquil?
                    And yet, having made this discovery, how <lb/> could you persist in dragging me
                    forth; persist in defiance <lb/> of an interdiction so emphatical and

                <p>"But your sister's death was an event detestable and <lb/> ominous. She had been
                    the victim of the most dreadful <lb/> species of assassination. How, in a state
                    like yours, the <lb/> murderous intention could be generated, was wholly <reg

                <p>"I did not relinquish my design of confessing to you the <lb/> part which I had
                    sustained in your family, but I was <lb/> willing to defer it till the task
                    which I had set myself was <lb/> finished. That being done, I resumed the
                    resolution. The <lb/> motives to incite me to this continually acquired force.
                    <lb/> The more I revolved the events happening at Mettingen, <lb/> the more
                    insupportable and ominous my terrors became. <lb/> My waking hours and my sleep
                    were vexed by dismal <reg orig="pre-|sages">presages</reg>
                    <lb/> and frightful intimations.</p>
                <p>"Catharine was dead by violence. Surely my <reg orig="malig-|nant"

                    <lb/> stars had not made me the cause of her death; yet <lb/> had I not rashly
                    set in motion a machine, over whose <reg orig="pro-|gress">progress</reg>
                    <lb/> I had no control, and which experience had shewn <lb/> me was infinite in
                    power? Every day might add to the <lb/> catalogue of horrors of which this was
                    the source, and a <lb/> seasonable disclosure of the truth might prevent
                    numberless <lb/> ills.</p>
                <p>"Fraught with this conception, I have turned my steps <lb/> hither. I find your
                    brother's house desolate; the furniture <lb/> removed, and the walls stained
                    with damps. Your own is <lb/> in the same situation. Your chamber is dismantled
                    and <lb/> dark, and you exhibit an image of incurable grief, and of <lb/> rapid
                    decay.</p>
                <p>"I have uttered the truth. This is the extent of my <lb/> offences. You tell me a
                    horrid tale of Wieland being led <lb/> to the destruction of his wife and
                    children, by some <reg orig="myste-|rious">mysterious</reg>

                    that the amount of my guilt has been truly <lb/> stated. The perpetrator of
                    Catharine's death was unknown <lb/> to me till now; nay, it is still unknown to
                    me."</p>
                <p>At that moment, the closing of a door in the kitchen <lb/> was distinctly heard
                    by us. Carwin started and paused. <lb/> "There is some one coming. I must not be
                    found here <lb/> by my enemies, and need not, since my purpose is <reg

                </pb>
                <p>I had drunk in, with the most vehement attention, every <lb/> word that he had
                    uttered. I had no breath to interrupt his <lb/> tale by interrogations or
                    comments. The power that he <lb/> spoke of was hitherto unknown to me; its
                    existence was <lb/> incredible; it was susceptible of no direct proof.</p>
                <p>He owns that his were the voice and face which I heard <lb/> and saw. He attempts
                    to give a human explanation of these <lb/> phantasms; but it is enough that he
                    owns himself to be the <lb/> agent; his tale is a lie, and his nature devilish.
                    As he <lb/> deceived me, he likewise deceived my brother, and now do <lb/> I
                    behold the author of all our calamities!</p>
                <p>Such were my thoughts when his pause allowed me to <lb/> think. I should have
                    bade him begone if the silence had <lb/> not been interrupted; but now I feared
                    no more for myself; <lb/> and the milkiness of my nature was curdled into hatred
                    <lb/> and rancor. Some one was near, and this enemy of God <lb/> and man might
                    possibly be brought to justice. I reflected <lb/> not that the preternatural
                    power which he had hitherto <reg orig="ex-|erted">exerted</reg>, <lb/> would
                    avail to rescue him from any toils in which his <lb/> feet might be entangled.
                    Meanwhile, looks and not words <lb/> of menace and abhorrence, were all that I
                    could bestow.</p>
                <p>He did not depart. He seemed dubious, whether, by <reg orig="pass-|ing"
                        >passing</reg>
                    <lb/> out of the house, or by remaining somewhat longer where <lb/> he was, he
                    should most endanger his safety. His confusion <lb/> increased when steps of one
                    barefoot were heard upon the <lb/> stairs. He threw anxious glances sometimes at
                    the closet, <lb/> sometimes at the window, and sometimes at the chamber <lb/>
                    door, yet he was detained by some inexplicable fascination. <lb/> He stood as if
                    rooted to the spot.</p>
                <p>As to me, my soul was bursting with detestation and <reg orig="re-|venge"
                        >revenge</reg>. <lb/> I had no room for surmises and fears respecting <lb/>
                    him that approached. It was doubtless a human being, and <lb/> would befriend me
                    so far as to aid me in arresting this <reg orig="of-|fender">offender</reg>.</p>
                <p>The stranger quickly entered the room. My eyes and <lb/> the eyes of Carwin were,
                    at the same moment, darted upon <lb/> him. A second glance was not needed to
                    inform us who <lb/> he was. His locks were tangled, and fell confusedly over
                    <lb/> his forehead and ears. His shirt was of coarse stuff, and <lb/> open at
                    the neck and breast. His coat was once of bright <lb/>
                    <pb n="202" entity="eaf033v1_0243" pid="uva-lib:349273"/> and fine texture, but
                    now torn and tarnished with dust. His <lb/> feet, his legs, and his arms were
                    bare. His features were <lb/> the seat of a wild and tranquil solemnity, but his
                    eyes <reg orig="be-|spoke">bespoke</reg>
                    <lb/> inquietude and curiosity.</p>
                <p>He advanced with a firm step, and looking as in search of <lb/> some one. He saw
                    me and stopped. He bent his sight <lb/> on the floor, and clenching his hands,
                    appeared suddenly <lb/> absorbed in meditation. Such were the figure and <reg
                        orig="deport-|ment">deportment</reg>
                    <lb/> of Wieland! Such, in his fallen state, were the <reg orig="as-|pect"
                        >aspect</reg>
                    <lb/> and guise of my brother!</p>
                <p>Carwin did not fail to recognise the visitant. Care for <lb/> his own safety was
                    apparently swallowed up in the <reg orig="amaze-|ment">amazement</reg>
                    <lb/> which this spectacle produced. His station was <lb/> conspicuous, and he
                    could not have escaped the roving <lb/> glances of Wieland; yet the latter
                    seemed totally <reg orig="uncon-|scious">unconscious</reg>
                    <lb/> of his presence.</p>
                <p>Grief at this scene of ruin and blast was at first the only <lb/> sentiment of
                    which I was conscious. A fearful stillness <lb/> ensued. At length Wieland,
                    lifting his hands, which were <lb/> locked in each other, to his breast,
                    exclaimed, "Father! <lb/> I thank thee. This is thy guidance. Hither thou hast
                    led <lb/> me, that I might perform thy will; yet let me not err; let <lb/> me
                    hear again thy messenger!"</p>
                <p>He stood for a minute as if listening; but recovering <lb/> from his attitude, he
                    continued&mdash;"It is not needed. <reg orig="Das-|tardly">Dastardly</reg>
                    <lb/> wretch! thus eternally questioning the behests of thy <lb/> Maker! weak in
                    resolution! wayward in faith!"</p>
                <p>He advanced to me, and, after another pause, resumed; <lb/> "Poor girl! a dismal
                    fate has set its mark upon thee. Thy <lb/> life is demanded as a sacrifice.
                    Prepare thee to die. Make <lb/> not my office difficult by fruitless opposition.
                    Thy prayers <lb/> might subdue stones; but none but he who enjoined my <lb/>
                    purpose can shake it."</p>
                <p>These words were a sufficient explication of the scene. <lb/> The nature of his
                    frenzy, as described by my uncle, was <lb/> remembered. I who had sought death,
                    was now thrilled <lb/> with horror because it was near. Death in this form,
                    death <lb/> from the hand of a brother, was thought upon with <reg
                        orig="inde-|scribable">indescribable</reg>
                    <lb/> repugnance.</p>
                <p>In a state thus verging upon madness, my eye glanced <lb/>
                    <pb n="203" entity="eaf033v1_0244" pid="uva-lib:349274"/> upon Carwin. His
                    astonishment appeared to have struck <lb/> him motionless and dumb. My life was
                    in danger, and my <lb/> brother's hand was about to be imbrued in my blood. I
                    <lb/> firmly believed that Carwin's was the instigation. I could <lb/> rescue
                    myself from this abhorred fate; I could dissipate this <lb/> tremendous
                    illusion; I could save my brother from the <reg orig="per-|petration"
                        >perpetration</reg>
                    <lb/> of new horrors, by pointing out the devil who <lb/> seduced him; to
                    hesitate a moment was to perish. These <lb/> thoughts gave strength to my limbs,
                    and energy to my <reg orig="ac-|cents">accents</reg>; <lb/> I started on my
                    feet.</p>
                <p>"O brother! spare me, spare thyself; there is thy <reg orig="be-|trayer"
                        >betrayer</reg>. <lb/> He counterfeited the voice and face of an angel,
                    <lb/> for the purpose of destroying thee and me. He has this <lb/> moment
                    confessed it. He is able to speak where he is not. <lb/> He is leagued with
                    hell, but will not avow it; yet he <reg orig="con-|fesses">confesses</reg>
                    <lb/> that the agency was his."</p>
                <p>My brother turned slowly his eyes, and fixed them upon <lb/> Carwin. Every joint
                    in the frame of the latter trembled. <lb/> His complexion was paler than a
                    ghost's. His eye dared <lb/> not meet that of Wieland, but wandered with an air
                    of <lb/> distraction from one space to another.</p>
                <p>"Man," said my brother, in a voice totally unlike that <lb/> which he had used to
                    me, "what art thou? The charge <lb/> has been made. Answer it. The
                    visage&mdash;the voice&mdash;at the <lb/> bottom of these stairs&mdash;at the
                    hour of eleven&mdash;to whom did <lb/> they belong? To thee?"</p>
                <p>Twice did Carwin attempt to speak, but his words died <lb/> away upon his lips.
                    My brother resumed in a tone of <lb/> greater vehemence&mdash;</p>
                <p>"Thou falterest; faltering is ominous; say yes or no; <lb/> one word will
                    suffice; but beware of falsehood. Was it a <lb/> stratagem of hell to overthrow
                    my family? Wast thou the <lb/> agent?"</p>
                <p>I now saw that the wrath which had been prepared for me <lb/> was to be heaped
                    upon another. The tale that I heard from <lb/> him, and his present
                    trepidations, were abundant testimonies <lb/> of his guilt. But what if Wieland
                    should be undeceived! <lb/> What if he shall find his act to have proceeded not
                    from a <lb/> heavenly prompter, but from human treachery! Will not <lb/>
                    <pb n="204" entity="eaf033v1_0245" pid="uva-lib:349275"/> his rage mount into
                    whirlwind? Will not he tear limb from <lb/> limb this devoted wretch?</p>
                <p>Instinctively I recoiled from this image, but it gave place <lb/> to another.
                    Carwin may be innocent, but the impetuosity <lb/> of his judge may misconstrue
                    his answers into a confession <lb/> of guilt. Wieland knows not that mysterious
                    voices and <lb/> appearances were likewise witnessed by me. Carwin may <lb/> be
                    ignorant of those which misled my brother. Thus may <lb/> his answers unwarily
                    betray himself to ruin.</p>
                <p>Such might be the consequences of my frantic <reg orig="precipita-|tion"
                        >precipitation</reg>, <lb/> and these, it was necessary, if possible, to
                    prevent. I <lb/> attempted to speak, but Wieland turning suddenly upon me, <lb/>
                    commanded silence, in a tone furious and terrible. My lips <lb/> closed, and my
                    tongue refused its office.</p>
                <p>"What art thou?" he resumed, addressing himself to <lb/> Carwin. "Answer me;
                    whose form&mdash;whose voice&mdash;was <lb/> it thy contrivance? Answer me."</p>
                <p>The answer was now given, but confusedly and scarcely <lb/> articulated. "I meant
                    nothing&mdash;I intended no ill&mdash;if I <reg orig="un-|derstand&mdash;if"
                        >understand&mdash;if</reg>
                    <lb/> I do not mistake you&mdash;it is too true&mdash;I did <lb/>
                    appear&mdash;in the entry&mdash;did speak. The contrivance was <lb/> mine,
                    but&mdash;"</p>
                <p>These words were no sooner uttered, than my brother <lb/> ceased to wear the same
                    aspect. His eyes were downcast; <lb/> he was motionless; his respiration became
                    hoarse, like that <lb/> of a man in the agonies of death. Carwin seemed unable
                    <lb/> to say more. He might have easily escaped, but the thought <lb/> which
                    occupied him related to what was horrid and <reg orig="unin-|telligible"
                        >unintelligible</reg>
                    <lb/> in this scene, and not to his own danger.</p>
                <p>Presently the faculties of Wieland, which, for a time, were <lb/> chained up,
                    were seized with restlessness and trembling. He <lb/> broke silence. The
                    stoutest heart would have been <reg orig="appal-|led">appalled</reg>
                    <lb/> by the tone in which he spoke. He addressed himself <lb/> to Carwin.</p>
                <p>"Why art thou here? Who detains thee? Go and learn <lb/> better. I will meet
                    thee, but it must be at the bar of thy <lb/> Maker. There shall I bear witness
                    against thee."</p>
                <p>Perceiving that Carwin did not obey, he continued; <lb/> "Dost thou wish me to

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">A few</hi> words more and I lay aside the pen forever. Yet
                    <lb/> why should I not relinquish it now? All that I have said is <lb/>
                    preparatory to this scene, and my fingers, tremulous and <lb/> cold as my heart,
                    refuse any further exertion. This must <lb/> not be. Let my last energies
                    support me in the finishing of <lb/> this task. Then will I lay down my head in
                    the lap of <lb/> death. Hushed will be all my murmurs in the sleep of the <lb/>
                    grave.</p>
                <p>Every sentiment has perished in my bosom. Even <reg orig="friend-|ship"
                        >friendship</reg>
                    <lb/> is extinct. Your love for me has prompted me to this <lb/> task; but I
                    would not have complied if it had not been a <lb/> luxury thus to feast upon my
                    woes. I have justly calculated <lb/> upon my remnant of strength. When I lay
                    down the pen <lb/> the taper of life will expire; my existence will terminate
                    <lb/> with my tale.</p>
                <p>Now that I was left alone with Wieland, the perils of my <lb/> situation
                    presented themselves to my mind. That this <reg orig="par-|oxysm">paroxysm</reg>
                    <lb/> should terminate in havoc and rage it was reasonable <lb/> to predict. The
                    first suggestion of my fears had been <reg orig="dis-|proved">disproved</reg>
                    <lb/> by my experience. Carwin had acknowledged his <lb/> offences, and yet had
                    escaped. The vengeance which I <lb/> had harbored had not been admitted by
                    Wieland, and yet <lb/> the evils which I had endured, compared with those <reg
                        orig="in-|flicted">inflicted</reg>
                    <lb/> on my brother, were as nothing. I thirsted for his <lb/> blood, and was
                    tormented with an insatiable appetite for his <lb/> destruction; but my brother
                    was unmoved, and had <reg orig="dis-|missed">dismissed</reg>
                    <lb/> him in safety. Surely thou wast more than man, <lb/> while I am sunk below
                    the beasts.</p>
                <p>Did I place a right construction on the conduct of <reg orig="Wie-|land"
                        >Wieland</reg>? <lb/> Was the error that misled him so easily rectified? <lb/>
                    <pb n="206" entity="eaf033v1_0247" pid="uva-lib:349277"/> Were views so vivid
                    and faith so strenuous thus liable to <lb/> fading and to change? Was there not
                    reason to doubt the <lb/> accuracy of my perceptions? With images like these was
                    my <lb/> mind thronged, till the deportment of my brother called <lb/> away my
                    attention.</p>
                <p>I saw his lips move and his eyes cast up to heaven. Then <lb/> would he listen
                    and look back, as if in expectation of some <lb/> one's appearance. Thrice he
                    repeated these gesticulations <lb/> and this inaudible prayer. Each time the
                    mist of confusion <lb/> and doubt seemed to grow darker and to settle on his
                        <reg orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg>. <lb/> I guessed at the
                    meaning of these tokens. The <lb/> words of Carwin had shaken his belief, and he
                    was employed <lb/> in summoning the messenger who had formerly communed <lb/>
                    with him, to attest the value of those new doubts. In vain <lb/> the summons was
                    repeated, for his eye met nothing but <reg orig="va-|cancy">vacancy</reg>, <lb/>
                    and not a sound saluted his ear.</p>
                <p>He walked to the bed, gazed with eagerness at the pillow <lb/> which had
                    sustained the head of the breathless Catharine, <lb/> and then returned to the
                    place where I sat. I had no power <lb/> to lift my eyes to his face; I was
                    dubious of his purpose; <lb/> this purpose might aim at my life.</p>
                <p>Alas! nothing but subjection to danger, and exposure to <lb/> temptation, can
                    show us what we are. By this test was I <lb/> now tried, and found to be
                    cowardly and rash. Men can <lb/> deliberately untie the thread of life, and of
                    this I had deemed <lb/> myself capable. It was now that I stood upon the brink
                    of <lb/> fate, that the knife of the sacrificer was aimed at my heart, <lb/> I
                    shuddered and betook myself to any means of escape, <lb/> however monstrous.</p>
                <p>Can I bear to think&mdash;can I endure to relate the outrage <lb/> which my heart
                    meditated? Where were my means of <reg orig="safe-|to">safeto</reg>? <lb/>
                    Resistance was vain. Not even the energy of despair <lb/> could set me on a
                    level with that strength which his terrific <lb/> prompter had bestowed upon
                    Wieland. Terror enables us <lb/> to perform incredible feats; but terror was not
                    then the <lb/> state of my mind; where then were my hopes of rescue?</p>
                <p>Methinks it is too much. I stand aside, as it were, from <lb/> myself; I estimate
                    my own deservings; a hatred, immortal <lb/> and inexorable, is my due. I listen
                    to my own pleas, and <lb/> find them empty and false; yes, I acknowledge that my <lb/>
                    <pb n="207" entity="eaf033v1_0248" pid="uva-lib:349278"/> guilt surpasses that
                    of mankind; I confess that the curses <lb/> of a world, and the frowns of a
                    deity, are inadequate to my <lb/> demerits. Is there a thing in the world worthy
                    of infinite <lb/> abhorrence? It is I.</p>
                <p>What shall I say! I was menaced, as I thought, with <lb/> death, and, to elude
                    this evil, my hand was ready to inflict <lb/> death upon the menacer. In
                    visiting my house, I had made <lb/> provision against the machinations of
                    Carwin. In a fold of <lb/> my dress an open penknife was concealed. This I now
                    <lb/> seized and drew forth. It lurked out of view; but I <lb/> now see that my
                    state of mind would have rendered the <lb/> deed inevitable if my brother had
                    lifted his hand. This <lb/> instrument of my preservation would have been
                    plunged into <lb/> his heart.</p>
                <p>O, insupportable remembrance! hide thee from my view <lb/> for a time; hide it
                    from me that my heart was black enough <lb/> to meditate the stabbing of a
                    brother! a brother thus <reg orig="su-|preme">supreme</reg>
                    <lb/> in misery; thus towering in virtue!</p>
                <p>He was probably unconscious of my design, but presently <lb/> drew back. This
                    interval was sufficient to restore me to <lb/> myself. The madness, the iniquity
                    of that act which I had <lb/> purposed rushed upon my apprehension. For a moment
                    I <lb/> was breathless with agony. At the next moment I <reg orig="re-|covered"
                        >recovered</reg>
                    <lb/> my strength, and threw the knife with violence on <lb/> the floor.</p>
                <p>The sound awoke my brother from his reverie. He <lb/> gazed alternately at me and
                    at the weapon. With a <reg orig="move-|ment">movement</reg>
                    <lb/> equally solemn he stooped and took it up. He placed <lb/> the blade in
                    different positions, scrutinizing it accurately, <lb/> and maintaining, at the
                    same time, a profound silence.</p>
                <p>Again he looked at me, but all that vehemence and <reg orig="lofti-|ness"
                        >loftiness</reg>
                    <lb/> of spirit which had so lately characterized his features, <lb/> were
                    flown. Fallen muscles, a forehead contracted into <lb/> folds, eyes dim with
                    unbidden drops, and a ruefulness of <lb/> aspect which no words can describe,
                    were now visible.</p>
                <p>His looks touched into energy the same sympathies in me, <lb/> and I poured forth
                    a flood of tears. This passion was quickly <lb/> checked by fear, which had now
                    no longer my own, but <lb/> his safety for their object. I watched his
                    deportment in <lb/> silence. At length he spoke;</p>
                <pb n="208" entity="eaf033v1_0249" pid="uva-lib:349279"/>
                <p>"Sister," said he, in an accent mournful and mild, "I <lb/> have acted poorly my
                    part in this world. What thinkest <lb/> thou? Shall I not do better in the
                    next?"</p>
                <p>I could make no answer. The mildness of his tone <reg orig="as-|tonished"
                        >astonished</reg>
                    <lb/> and encouraged me. I continued to regard him <lb/> with wistful and
                    anxious looks.</p>
                <p>"I think," resumed he, "I will try. My wife and my <lb/> babes have gone before.
                    Happy wretches! I have sent <lb/> you to repose, and ought not to linger
                    behind."</p>
                <p>These words had a meaning sufficiently intelligible. I <lb/> looked at the open
                    knife in his hand and shuddered, but <lb/> knew not how to prevent the deed
                    which I dreaded. He <lb/> quickly noticed my fears, and comprehended them. <reg
                        orig="Stretch-|ing">Stretching</reg>
                    <lb/> towards me his hand, with an air of increasing mildness; <lb/> "Take it,"
                    said he; "Fear not for thy own sake, nor for <lb/> mine. The cup is gone by, and
                    its transient inebriation is <lb/> succeeded by the soberness of truth.</p>
                <p>"Thou angel whom I was wont to worship! fearest thou, <lb/> my sister, for thy
                    life? Once it was the scope of my labors <lb/> to destroy thee, but I was
                    prompted to the deed by heaven; <lb/> such, at least, was my belief. Thinkest
                    thou that thy death <lb/> was sought to gratify malevolence? No. I am pure from
                    <lb/> all stain. I believed that my God was my mover!</p>
                <p>"Neither thee nor myself have I cause to injure. I have <lb/> done my duty, and
                    surely there is merit in having sacrificed <lb/> to that, all that is dear to
                    the heart of man. If a devil has <lb/> deceived me, he came in the habit of an
                    angel. If I erred, <lb/> it was not my judgment that deceived me, but my senses.
                    <lb/> In thy sight, Being of beings! I am still pure. Still will I <lb/> look
                    for my reward in thy justice!"</p>
                <p>Did my ears truly report these sounds? If I did not <lb/> err, my brother was
                    restored to just perceptions. He knew <lb/> himself to have been betrayed to the
                    murder of his wife <lb/> and children, to have been the victim of infernal
                    artifice; <lb/> yet he found consolation in the rectitude of his motives. He
                    <lb/> was not devoid of sorrow, for this was written on his <reg
                        orig="coun-|tenance">countenance</reg>; <lb/> but his soul was tranquil and
                    sublime.</p>
                <p>Perhaps this was merely a transition of his former <reg orig="mad-|ness"
                        >madness</reg>
                    <lb/> into a new shape. Perhaps he had not yet awakened <lb/> to the memory of
                    the horrors which he had perpetrated. <lb/>
                    <pb n="209" entity="eaf033v1_0250" pid="uva-lib:349280"/> Infatuated wretch that
                    I was! To set myself up as a model <lb/> by which to judge of my heroic brother!
                    My reason taught <lb/> me that his conclusions were right; but conscious of the
                    <lb/> impotence of reason over my own conduct; conscious of <lb/> my cowardly
                    rashness and my criminal despair, I doubted <lb/> whether any one could be
                    steadfast and wise.</p>
                <p>Such was my weakness, that even in the midst of these <lb/> thoughts, my mind
                    glided into abhorrence of Carwin, and I <lb/> uttered in a low voice, O! Carwin!
                    Carwin! what hast <lb/> thou to answer for?</p>
                <p>My brother immediately noticed the involuntary <reg orig="exclama-|tion"
                        >exclamation</reg>; <lb/> "Clara!" said he, "be thyself. Equity used to be
                    <lb/> a theme for thy eloquence. Reduce its lessons to practice, <lb/> and be
                    just to that unfortunate man. The instrument has <lb/> done its work, and I am
                    satisfied.</p>
                <p>"I thank thee, my God, for this last illumination! My <lb/> enemy is thine also.
                    I deemed him to be man, the man <lb/> with whom I have often communed; but now
                    thy goodness <lb/> has unveiled to me his true nature. As the performer of <lb/>
                    thy behests, he is my friend."</p>
                <p>My heart began now to misgive me. His mournful <reg orig="as-|pect">aspect</reg>
                    <lb/> had gradually yielded place to a serene brow. A new <lb/> soul appeared to
                    actuate his frame, and his eyes to beam <lb/> with preternatural lustre. These
                    symptoms did not abate, <lb/> and he continued:</p>
                <p>"Clara! I must not leave thee in doubt. I know not <lb/> what brought about thy
                    interview with the being whom thou <lb/> callest Carwin. For a time, I was
                    guilty of thy error, and <lb/> deduced from his incoherent confessions that I
                    had been <lb/> made the victim of human malice. He left us at my <reg
                        orig="bid-|ding">bidding</reg>, <lb/> and I put up a prayer that my doubts
                    should be <reg orig="re-|moved">removed</reg>. <lb/> Thy eyes were shut, and thy
                    ears sealed to the <lb/> vision that answered my prayer.</p>
                <p>"I was indeed deceived. The form thou hast seen was <lb/> the incarnation of a
                    demon. The visage and voice which <lb/> urged me to the sacrifice of my family,
                    were his. Now, <lb/> he personates a human form; then he was environed with
                    <lb/> the lustre of heaven.</p>
                <p>"Clara," he continued, advancing closer to me, "thy <lb/> death must come. This
                    minister is evil, but he from whom <lb/>
                    <pb n="210" entity="eaf033v1_0251" pid="uva-lib:349281"/> his commission was
                    received is God. Submit then with all <lb/> thy wonted resignation to a decree
                    that cannot be reversed <lb/> or resisted. Mark the clock. Three minutes are
                    allowed <lb/> to thee, in which to call up thy fortitude, and prepare thee <lb/>
                    for thy doom." There he stopped.</p>
                <p>Even now, when this scene exists only in memory, when <lb/> life and all its
                    functions have sunk into torpor, my pulse <lb/> throbs, and my hairs uprise; my
                    brows are knit, as then; <lb/> and I gaze around me in distraction. I was
                    unconquerably <lb/> averse to death; but death, imminent and full of agony as
                    <lb/> that which was threatened, was nothing. This was not the <lb/> only or
                    chief inspirer of my fears.</p>
                <p>For him, not for myself, was my soul tormented. I might <lb/> die, and no crime,
                    surpassing the reach of mercy, would <lb/> pursue me to the presence of my
                    judge; but my assassin <lb/> would survive to contemplate his deed, and that
                    assassin <lb/> was Wieland!</p>
                <p>Wings to bear me beyond his reach I had not. I could <lb/> not vanish with a
                    thought. The door was open, but my <lb/> murderer was interposed between that
                    and me. Of <reg orig="self-|defence">self-defence</reg>
                    <lb/> I was incapable. The frenzy that lately prompted <lb/> me to blood was
                    gone; my state was desperate; my <reg orig="res-|cue">rescue</reg>
                    <lb/> was impossible.</p>
                <p>The weight of these accumulated thoughts could not be <lb/> borne. My sight
                    became confused; my limbs were <reg orig="seiz-|ed">seized</reg>
                    <lb/> with convulsion; I spoke, but my words were half <lb/> formed:&mdash;</p>
                <p>"Spare me, my brother! Look down, righteous Judge! <lb/> snatch me from this
                    fate! take away this fury from him, or <lb/> turn it elsewhere!"</p>
                <p>Such was the agony of my thoughts, that I noticed not <lb/> steps entering my
                    apartment. Supplicating eyes were cast <lb/> upward, but when my prayer was
                    breathed, I once more <lb/> wildly gazed at the door. A form met my sight; I
                        <reg orig="shud-|dered">shuddered</reg>
                    <lb/> as if the God whom I invoked were present. It was <lb/> Carwin that again
                    intruded, and who stood before me, erect <lb/> in attitude, and steadfast in
                    look!</p>
                <p>The sight of him awakened new and rapid thoughts. His <lb/> recent tale was
                    remembered; his magical transitions and <lb/> mysterious energy of voice.
                    Whether he were infernal or <lb/>
                    <pb n="211" entity="eaf033v1_0252" pid="uva-lib:349282"/> miraculous, or human,
                    there was no power and no need <lb/> to decide. Whether the contriver or not of
                    this spell, he <lb/> was able to unbind it, and to check the fury of my <reg
                        orig="bro-|ther">brother</reg>. <lb/> He had ascribed to himself intentions
                    not malignant. <lb/> Here now was afforded a test of his truth. Let him <reg
                        orig="inter-|pose">interpose</reg>, <lb/> as from above; revoke the savage
                    decree which the <lb/> madness of Wieland has assigned to heaven, and extinguish
                    <lb/> forever this passion for blood!</p>
                <p>My mind detected at a glance this avenue to safety. <lb/> The recommendations it
                    possessed thronged as it were <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg>, <lb/> and
                    made but one impression on my intellect. <reg orig="Re-|moter">Remoter</reg>
                    <lb/> effects and collateral dangers I saw not. Perhaps <lb/> the pause of an
                    instant had sufficed to call them up. The <lb/> improbability that the influence
                    which governed Wieland <lb/> was external or human; the tendency of this
                    stratagem to <lb/> sanction so fatal an error, or substitute a more destructive
                    <lb/> rage in place of this; the sufficiency of Carwin's mere <lb/> muscular
                    forces to counteract the efforts, and restrain the <lb/> fury of Wieland, might,
                    at a second glance, have been <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg>; <lb/>
                    but no second glance was allowed. My first <lb/> thought hurried me to action,
                    and, fixing my eyes upon <lb/> Carwin I exclaimed&mdash;</p>
                <p>"O wretch! once more hast thou come? Let it be to <lb/> abjure thy malice; to
                    counterwork this hellish stratagem; <lb/> to turn from me and from my brother,
                    this desolating rage!</p>
                <p>"Testify thy innocence or thy remorse; exert the <reg orig="pow-|ers"
                        >powers</reg>
                    <lb/> which pertain to thee, whatever they be, to turn aside <lb/> this ruin.
                    Thou art the author of these horrors! What <lb/> have I done to deserve thus to
                    die? How have I merited <lb/> this unrelenting persecution? I adjure thee, by
                    that God <lb/> whose voice thou hast dared to counterfeit, to save my life!</p>
                <p>"Wilt thou then go? leave me! Succorless!"</p>
                <p>Carwin listened to my entreaties unmoved, and turned <lb/> from me. He seemed to
                    hesitate a moment; then glided <lb/> through the door. Rage and despair stifled
                    my utterance. <lb/> The interval of respite was passed; the pangs reserved for
                    <lb/> me by Wieland, were not to be endured; my thoughts <lb/> rushed again into
                    anarchy. Having received the knife from <lb/> his hand, I held it loosely and
                    without regard; but now it <lb/> seized again my attention, and I grasped it
                    with force.</p>
                <pb n="212" entity="eaf033v1_0253" pid="uva-lib:349283"/>
                <p>He seemed to notice not the entrance or exit of Carwin. <lb/> My gesture and the
                    murderous weapon appeared to have <lb/> escaped his notice. His silence was
                    unbroken; his eye, <lb/> fixed upon the clock for a time, was now withdrawn;
                    fury <lb/> kindled in every feature; all that was human in his face <lb/> gave
                    way to an expression supernatural and tremendous. I <lb/> felt my left arm
                    within his grasp.</p>
                <p>Even now I hesitated to strike. I shrunk from his <reg orig="as-|sault"
                        >assault</reg>, <lb/> but in vain.</p>
                <p>Here let me desist. Why should I rescue this event <lb/> from oblivion? Why
                    should I paint this detestable conflict? <lb/> Why not terminate at once this
                    series of horrors?&mdash;Hurry <lb/> to the verge of the precipice, and cast
                    myself forever <reg orig="be-|yond">beyond</reg>
                    <lb/> remembrance and beyond hope?</p>
                <p>Still I live; with this load upon my breast; with this <lb/> phantom to pursue my
                    steps; with adders lodged in my <lb/> bosom, and stinging me to madness; still I
                    consent to live!</p>
                <p>Yes, I will rise above the sphere of mortal passions; I <lb/> will spurn at the
                    cowardly remorse that bids me seek <reg orig="impu-|nity">impunity</reg>
                    <lb/> in silence, or comfort in forgetfulness. My nerves <lb/> shall be new
                    strung to the task. Have I not resolved? I <lb/> will die. The gulf before me is
                    inevitable and near. I <lb/> will die, but then only when my tale is at an
                    end.</p>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">My</hi> right hand, grasping the unseen knife, was still
                        <reg orig="disen-|gaged">disengaged</reg>. <lb/> It was lifted to strike.
                    All my strength was <lb/> exhausted, but what was sufficient to the performance
                    of <lb/> this deed. Already was the energy awakened, and the <lb/> impulse
                    given, that should bear the fatal steel to his heart. <lb/>
                    when&mdash;&mdash;Wieland shrunk back; his hand was withdrawn. <lb/> Breathless
                    with affright and desperation, I stood, freed from <lb/> his grasp; unassailed;
                    untouched.</p>
                <p>Thus long had the power which controled the scene <lb/> forborne to interfere;
                    but now his might was irresistible; <lb/> and Wieland in a moment was disarmed
                    of all his purposes. <lb/>
                    <pb n="213" entity="eaf033v1_0254" pid="uva-lib:349284">

                    </pb> A voice, louder than human organs could produce, shriller <lb/> than

                <p>Trouble and dismay succeeded to the steadfastness that <lb/> had lately been
                    displayed in the looks of Wieland. His eyes <lb/> roved from one quarter to
                    another, with an expression of <lb/> doubt. He seemed to wait for a further
                    intimation.</p>
                <p>Carwin's agency was here easily recognised. I had <reg orig="be-|sought"
                        >besought</reg>
                    <lb/> him to interpose in my defence. He had flown. I <lb/> had imagined him
                    deaf to my prayer, and resolute to see <lb/> me perish; yet he disappeared
                    merely to devise and <reg orig="ex-|ecute">execute</reg>
                    <lb/> the means of my relief.</p>
                <p>Why did he not forbear when this end was <reg orig="accom-|plished"
                        >accomplished</reg>? <lb/> Why did his misjudging zeal and accursed <reg
                        orig="pre-|cipitation">precipitation</reg>
                    <lb/> overpass that limit? Or meant he thus to crown <lb/> the scene, and
                    conduct his inscrutable plots to this <reg orig="consum-|mation"
                        >consummation</reg>?</p>
                <p>Such ideas were the fruit of subsequent contemplation. <lb/> This moment was
                    pregnant with fate. I had no power to <lb/> reason. In the career of my
                    tempestuous thoughts, rent <lb/> into pieces, as my mind was, by accumulating
                    horrors, <reg orig="Car-|win">Carwin</reg>
                    <lb/> was unseen and unsuspected. I partook of Wieland's <lb/> credulity, shook
                    with his amazement, and panted with his <lb/> awe.</p>
                <p>Silence took place for a moment; so much as allowed <lb/> the attention to
                    recover its post. Then new sounds were <lb/> uttered from above.</p>
                <p>"Man of errors! cease to cherish thy delusion; not <lb/> heaven or hell, but thy
                    senses have misled thee to commit <lb/> these acts. Shake off thy frenzy, and
                    ascend into rational <lb/> and human. Be lunatic no longer."</p>
                <p>My brother opened his lips to speak. His tone was <lb/> terrific and faint. He
                    muttered an appeal to heaven. It <lb/> was difficult to comprehend the theme of
                    his inquiries. <lb/> They implied doubt as to the nature of the impulse that
                    <lb/> hitherto had guided him, and questioned whether he had <lb/> acted in
                    consequence of insane preceptions.</p>
                <p>To these interrogatories the voice, which now seemed to <lb/> hover at his
                    shoulder, loudly answered in the affirmative. <lb/> Then uninterrupted silence
                    ensued.</p>
                <pb n="214" entity="eaf033v1_0255" pid="uva-lib:349285"/>
                <p>Fallen from his loftly and heroic station; now finally <lb/> restored to the
                    perception of truth; weighed to earth by the <lb/> recollection of his own
                    deeds; consoled no longer by a <lb/> consciousness of rectitude, for the loss of
                    offspring and <lb/> wife&mdash;a loss for which he was indebted to his own <reg
                        orig="mis-|guided">misguided</reg>
                    <lb/> hand; Wieland was transformed at once into the <lb/>
                    <hi rend="italic">man of sorrows!</hi></p>
                <p>He reflected not that credit should be as reasonably <reg orig="de-|nied"
                        >denied</reg>
                    <lb/> to the last, as to any former intimation; that one might <lb/> as justly
                    be ascribed to erring or diseased senses as the <lb/> other. He saw not that
                    this discovery in no degree affected <lb/> the integrity of his conduct; that
                    his motives had lost none <lb/> of their claims to the homage of mankind; that
                    the <reg orig="prefer-|ence">preference</reg>
                    <lb/> of supreme good, and the boundless energy of duty, <lb/> were undiminished
                    in his bosom.</p>
                <p>It is not for me to pursue him through the ghastly <lb/> changes of his
                    countenance. Words he had none. Now <lb/> he sat upon the floor, motionless in
                    all his limbs, with his <lb/> eyes glazed and fixed; a monument of wo.</p>
                <p>Anon a spirit of tempestuous but undesigning activity <lb/> seized him. He rose
                    from his place and strode across the <lb/> floor, tottering and at random. His
                    eyes were without <lb/> moisture, and gleamed with the fire that consumed his
                    vitals. <lb/> The muscles of his face were agitated by convulsion. His <lb/>
                    lips moved, but no sound escaped him.</p>
                <p>That nature should long sustain this conflict was not to <lb/> be believed. My
                    state was little different from that of my <lb/> brother. I entered, as it were,
                    into his thoughts. My heart <lb/> was visited and rent by his pangs&mdash;Oh
                    that thy frenzy <lb/> had never been cured! that thy madness, with its blissful
                    <lb/> visions, would return! or, if that must not be, that thy scene <lb/> would
                    hasten to a close! that death would cover thee with <lb/> his oblivion!</p>
                <p>What can I wish for thee? Thou who hast vied with <lb/> the great preacher of thy
                    faith in sanctity of motives, <lb/> and in elevation above sensual and selfish!
                    Thou whom thy <lb/> fate has changed into parricide and savage! Can I wish for
                    <lb/> the continuance of thy being? No.</p>
                <p>For a time his movements seemed destitute of purpose. <lb/> If he walked; if he
                    turned; if his fingers were entwined <lb/>
                    <pb n="215" entity="eaf033v1_0256" pid="uva-lib:349286"/> with each other; if
                    his hands were pressed against opposite <lb/> sides of his head with a force
                    sufficient to crush it into pieces; <lb/> it was to tear his mind from self
                    contemplation; to waste <lb/> his thoughts on external objects.</p>
                <p>Speedily this train was broken. A beam appeared to be <lb/> darted into his mind,
                    which gave a purpose to his efforts. <lb/> An avenue to escape presented itself;
                    and now he eagerly <lb/> gazed about him; when my thoughts became engaged by
                    <lb/> his demeanor, my fingers were stretched as by a mechanical <lb/> force,
                    and the knife, no longer heeded or of use, escaped <lb/> from my grasp, and fell
                    unperceived on the floor. His eye <lb/> now lighted upon it; he seized it with
                    the quickness of <lb/> thought.</p>
                <p>I shrieked aloud, but it was too late. He plunged it to <lb/> the hilt in his
                    neck; and his life instantly escaped with the <lb/> stream that gushed from the
                    wound. He was stretched at <lb/> my feet; and my hands were sprinkled with his
                    blood as he <lb/> fell.</p>
                <p>Such was thy last deed, my brother! For a spectacle <lb/> like this was it my
                    fate to be reserved! Thy eyes were <lb/> closed&mdash;thy face ghastly with
                    death&mdash;thy arms, and the <lb/> spot where thou lyedst, floated in thy
                    life's blood! These <lb/> images have not, for a moment, forsaken me. Till I am
                    <lb/> breathless and cold, they must continue to hover in my <lb/> sight.</p>
                <p>Carwin, as I said, had left the room, but he still lingered <lb/> in the house.
                    My voice summoned him to my aid; but I <lb/> scarcely noticed his re-entrance,
                    and now faintly recollect <lb/> his terrified looks, his broken exclamations,
                    his vehement <lb/> avowals of innocence, the effusions of his pity for me, and
                    <lb/> his offers of assistance.</p>
                <p>I did not listen&mdash;I answered him not&mdash;I ceased to <reg orig="up-|braid"
                        >upbraid</reg>
                    <lb/> or accuse. His guilt was a point to which I was <reg orig="in-|different"
                        >indifferent</reg>. <lb/> Ruffian or devil, black as hell or bright as
                    angels, <lb/> thenceforth he was nothing to me. I was incapable of <lb/> sparing
                    a look or a thought from the ruin that was spread <lb/> at my feet.</p>
                <p>When he left me, I was scarcely conscious of any <reg orig="varia-|tion"
                        >variation</reg>
                    <lb/> in the scene. He informed the inhabitants of the hut <lb/> of what had
                    passed, and they flew to the spot. Careless <lb/>
                    <pb n="216" entity="eaf033v1_0257" pid="uva-lib:349287"/> of his own safety, he
                    hasted to the city to inform my friends <lb/> of my condition.</p>
                <p>My uncle speedily arrived at the house. The body of <lb/> Wieland was removed
                    from my presence, and they <reg orig="suppos-|ed">supposed</reg>
                    <lb/> that I would follow it; but no, my home is ascertained; <lb/> here I have
                    taken up my rest, and never will I go hence, <lb/> till, like Wieland, I am
                    borne to my grave.</p>
                <p>Importunity was tried in vain; they threatened to remove <lb/> me by
                    violence&mdash;nay, violence was used; but my soul <lb/> prizes too dearly this
                    little roof to endure to be bereaved of <lb/> it. Force should not prevail when
                    the hoary locks and <lb/> supplicating tears of my uncle were ineffectual. My
                        <reg orig="re-|pugnance">repugnance</reg>
                    <lb/> to move gave birth to ferociousness and frenzy <lb/> when force was
                    employed, and they were obliged to consent <lb/> to my return.</p>
                <p>They besought me&mdash;they remonstrated&mdash;they appealed <lb/> to every duty
                    that connected me with him that made me, <lb/> and with my fellow-men&mdash;in
                    vain. While I live I will not <lb/> go hence. Have I not fulfilled my
                    destiny?</p>
                <p>Why will ye torment me with with your reasonings and <lb/> reproofs? Can ye
                    restore to me the hope of my better <lb/> days? Can ye give me back Catharine
                    and her babes? <lb/> Can ye recall to life him who died at my feet?</p>
                <p>I will eat&mdash;I will drink&mdash;I will lie down and rise up at your <lb/>
                    bidding&mdash;all I ask is the choice of my abode. What is <lb/> there
                    unreasonable in this demand? Shortly will I be at <lb/> peace. This is the spot
                    which I have chosen in which to <lb/> breathe my last sigh. Deny me not, I
                    beseech you, so slight <lb/> a boon.</p>
                <p>Talk not to me, O my revered friend! of Carwin. He <lb/> has told thee his tale,
                    and thou exculpatest him from all <lb/> direct concern in the fate of Wieland.
                    This scene of havoc <lb/> was produced by an illusion of the senses. Be it so; I
                    care <lb/> not from what source these disasters have flowed; it suffices <lb/>
                    that they have swallowed up our hopes and our existence.</p>
                <p>What his agency began, his agency conducted to a close. <lb/> He intended, by the
                    final effort of his power, to rescue me <lb/> and to banish his illusions from
                    my brother. Such is his <lb/> tale, concerning the truth of which I care not.
                    Henceforth <lb/>

                <p><hi rend="small-caps">I imagined</hi> that I had forever laid aside the pen; and
                    <lb/> that I should take up my abode in this part of the world, <lb/> was of all
                    events the least probable. My destiny I believed <lb/> to be accomplished, and I
                    looked forward to a speedy <reg orig="ter-|mination">termination</reg>
                    <lb/> of my life with the fullest confidence.</p>
                <p>Surely I had reason to be weary of existence, to be <reg orig="im-|patient"
                        >impatient</reg>
                    <lb/> of every tie which held me from the grave. I <reg orig="ex-|perienced"
                        >experienced</reg>
                    <lb/> this impatience in its fullest extent. I was not <lb/> only enamoured of
                    death, but conceived, from the <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg>
                    <lb/> of my frame, that to shun it was impossible, even though <lb/> I had
                    ardently desired it; yet here am I, a thousand leagues <lb/> from my native
                    soil, in full possession of life and of health, <lb/> and not destitute of
                    happiness.</p>
                <p>Such is man. Time will obliterate the deepest <reg orig="impres-|sions"

                <p>Perhaps, however, the conquest of despair was chiefly <lb/> owing to an accident
                    which rendered my continuance in my <lb/> own house impossible. At the
                    conclusion of my long, and, <lb/> as I then supposed, my last letter to you, I
                    mentioned my <reg orig="re-|solution">resolution</reg>
                    <lb/> to wait for death in the very spot which had been <lb/> the principal
                    scene of my misfortunes. From this <reg orig="resolu-|tion">resolution</reg>
                    <lb/> my friends exerted themselves with the utmost zeal and <lb/> perseverance
                    to make me depart. They justly imagined <lb/> that to be thus surrounded by
                    memorials of the fate of my <lb/> family, would tend to foster my disease. A
                    swift <reg orig="succes-|sion">succession</reg>
                    <lb/> of new objects, and the exclusion of every thing <reg orig="calcu-|lated"
                        >calculated</reg>
                    <lb/> to remind me of my loss, was the only method of cure.</p>
                <p>I refused to listen to their exhortations. Great as my <lb/> calamity was, to be
                    torn from this asylum was regarded by <lb/> me as an aggravation of it. By a
                    perverse constitution of <lb/> mind, he was considered as my greatest enemy who
                    sought to <lb/> withdraw me from a scene which supplied eternal food to <lb/> my
                    melancholy, and kept my despair from languishing.</p>
                <p>In relating the history of these disasters I derived a <reg orig="simi-|lar"
                        >similar</reg>
                    <lb/> species of gratification. My uncle earnestly dissuaded <lb/> me from this
                    task; but his remonstrances were as fruitless <lb/> on this head as they had
                    been on others. They would <lb/> have withheld from me the implements of
                    writing; but <lb/> they quickly perceived that to withstand would be more <reg
                        orig="in-|jurious">injurious</reg>
                    <lb/> than to comply with my wishes. Having finished <lb/> my tale, it seemed as
                    if the scene were closing. A fever <lb/> lurked in my veins, and my strength was
                    gone. Any <reg orig="exer-|tion">exertion</reg>, <lb/> however slight, was
                    attended with difficulty, and, at <lb/> length, I refused to rise from my
                    bed.</p>
                <p>I now see the infatuation and injustice of my conduct in <lb/> its true colors. I
                    reflect upon the sensations and reasonings <lb/> of that period with wonder and
                    humiliation. That I should <lb/> be insensible to the claims and tears of my
                    friends; that I <lb/> should overlook the suggestions of duty, and fly from that
                    <lb/> post in which only I could be instrumental to the benefit of <lb/> others;
                    that the exercise of the social and beneficent <reg orig="affec-|tions"
                        >affections</reg>, <lb/> the contemplation of nature and the acquisition of
                    <lb/> wisdom should not be seen to be means of happiness still <lb/> within my
                    reach, is, at this time, scarcely credible.</p>
                <p>It is true that I am now changed; but I have not the <lb/>
                    <pb n="219" entity="eaf033v1_0260" pid="uva-lib:349290"/> consolation to reflect
                    that my change was owing to my <reg orig="for-|titude">fortitude</reg>
                    <lb/> or to my capacity for instruction. Better thoughts <lb/> grew up in my
                    mind imperceptibly. I cannot but <reg orig="congratu-|late">congratulate</reg>
                    <lb/> myself on the change, though, perhaps, it merely argues <lb/> a fickleness
                    of temper, and a defect of sensibility.</p>
                <p>After my narrative was ended I betook myself to my <lb/> bed, in the full belief
                    that my career in this world was on <lb/> the point of finishing. My uncle took
                    up his abode with <lb/> me, and performed for me every office of nurse,
                    physician <lb/> and friend. One night, after some hours of restlessness and
                    <lb/> pain, I sunk into deep sleep. Its tranquillity, however, was <lb/> of no
                    long duration. My fancy became suddenly <reg orig="distem-|pered"
                        >distempered</reg>, <lb/> and my brain was turned into a theatre of uproar
                    and <lb/> confusion. It would not be easy to describe the wild and <lb/>
                    fantastical incongruities that pestered me. My uncle, <reg orig="Wie-|land"
                        >Wieland</reg>, <lb/> Pleyel and Carwin were successively and momently <lb/>
                    discerned amidst the storm. Sometimes I was swallowed <lb/> up by whirlpools, or
                    caught up in the air by half-seen and <lb/> gigantic forms, and thrown upon
                    pointed rocks, or cast <lb/> among the billows. Sometimes gleams of light were
                    shot <lb/> into a dark abyss, on the verge of which I was standing, <lb/> and
                    enabled me to discover, for a moment, its enormous <lb/> depth and hideous
                    precipices. Anon, I was transported to <lb/> some ridge of &AElig;tna, and made
                    a terrified spectator of its <lb/> fiery torrents and its pillars of smoke.</p>
                <p>However strange it may seem, I was conscious, even <reg orig="dur-|ing"
                        >during</reg>
                    <lb/> my dream, of my real situation. I knew myself to be <lb/> asleep, and
                    struggled to break the spell, by muscular <reg orig="exer-|tions"
                        >exertions</reg>. <lb/> These did not avail, and I continued to suffer these
                    <lb/> abortive creations till a loud voice, at my bedside, and some <lb/> one
                    shaking me with violence, put an end to my reverie. <lb/> My eyes were unsealed,
                    and I started from my pillow.</p>
                <p>My chamber was filled with smoke, which, though in <lb/> some degree luminous,
                    would permit me to see nothing, and <lb/> by which I was nearly suffocated. The
                    crackling of flames, <lb/> and the deafening clamor of voices without, burst
                    upon my <lb/> ears. Stunned as I was by this hubbub, scorched with <lb/> heat,
                    and nearly choaked by the accumulating vapors, I <lb/> was unable to think or
                    act for my own preservation; I was <lb/> incapable, indeed, of comprehending my
                    danger.</p>
                <pb n="220" entity="eaf033v1_0261" pid="uva-lib:349291"/>
                <p>I was caught up, in an instant, by a pair of sinewy arms, <lb/> borne to the
                    window, and carried down a ladder which had <lb/> been placed there. My uncle
                    stood at the bottom and <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg>
                    <lb/> me. I was not fully aware of my situation till I <lb/> found myself
                    sheltered in the <hi rend="italic">hut,</hi> and surrounded by its <lb/>
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>By neglect of the servant, some unextinguished embers <lb/> had been placed in a
                    barrel in the cellar of the building. <lb/> The barrel had caught fire; this was
                    communicated to the <lb/> beams of the lower floor, and thence to the upper part
                    of <lb/> the structure. It was first discovered by some persons at a <lb/>
                    distance, who hastened to the spot and alarmed my uncle <lb/> and the servants.
                    The flames had already made <reg orig="considera-|ble">considerable</reg>
                    <lb/> progress, and my condition was overlooked till my <lb/> escape was
                    rendered nearly impossible.</p>
                <p>My danger being known, and a ladder quickly procured, <lb/> one of the spectators
                    ascended to my chamber, and effected <lb/> my deliverance in the manner before
                    related.</p>
                <p>This incident, disastrous as it may at first seem, had, in <lb/> reality, a
                    beneficial effect upon my feelings. I was, in some <lb/> degree, roused from the
                    stupor which had seized my <reg orig="facul-|ties">faculties</reg>. <lb/> The
                    monotonous and gloomy series of my thoughts <lb/> was broken. My habitation was
                    levelled with the ground, <lb/> and I was obliged to seek a new one. A new train
                    of <reg orig="im-|ages">images</reg>, <lb/> disconnected with the fate of my
                    family, forced itself <lb/> on my attention, and a belief insensibly sprung up,
                    that <lb/> tranquillity, if not happiness, was still within my reach. <lb/>
                    Notwithstanding the shocks which my frame had endured, <lb/> the anguish of my
                    thoughts no sooner abated than I <reg orig="recov-|ered">recovered</reg>
                    <lb/> my health.</p>
                <p>I now willingly listened to my uncle's solicitations to be <lb/> the companion of
                    his voyage. Preparations were easily <lb/> made, and after a tedious passage, we
                    set our feet on the <lb/> shore of the ancient world. The memory of the past
                    <lb/> did not forsake me; but the melancholy which it generated, <lb/> and the
                    tears with which it filled my eyes, were not <reg orig="unpro-|fitable"
                        >unprofitable</reg>. <lb/> My curiosity was revived, and I contemplated with
                    <lb/> ardor, the spectacle of living manners and the monuments <lb/> of past
                    ages.</p>
                <pb n="221" entity="eaf033v1_0262" pid="uva-lib:349292"/>
                <p>In proportion as my heart was reinstated in the possession <lb/> of its ancient
                    tranquillity, the sentiment which I had <reg orig="cher-|ished">cherished</reg>
                    <lb/> with regard to Pleyel returned. In a short time <lb/> he was united to the
                    Saxon woman, and made his <reg orig="resi-|dence">residence</reg>
                    <lb/> in the neighborhood of Boston. I was glad that <reg orig="cir-|cumstances"
                        >circumstances</reg>
                    <lb/> would not permit an interview to take place <lb/> between us. I could not
                    desire their misery; but I reaped <lb/> no pleasure from reflecting on their
                    happiness. Time, and <lb/> the exertions of my fortitude, cured me, in some
                    degree, <lb/> of this folly. I continued to love him, but my passion was <lb/>
                    disguised to myself; I considered it merely as a more <reg orig="ten-|der"
                        >tender</reg>
                    <lb/> species of friendship, and cherished it without <reg orig="com-|punction"
                        >compunction</reg>.</p>
                <p>Through my uncle's exertions a meeting was brought <lb/> about between Carwin and
                    Pleyel, and explanations took <lb/> place which restored me at once to the good
                    opinion of the <lb/> latter. Though separated so widely, our correspondence
                    <lb/> was punctual and frequent, and paved the way for that <lb/> union which
                    can only end with the death of one of us.</p>
                <p>In my letters to him I made no secret of my former <reg orig="sen-|timents"
                        >sentiments</reg>. <lb/> This was a theme on which I could talk <reg
                        orig="with-|out">without</reg>
                    <lb/> painful, though not without delicate emotions. That <lb/> knowledge which
                    I should never have imparted to a lover, I <lb/> felt little scruple to
                    communicate to a friend.</p>
                <p>A year and a half elapsed when Theresa was snatched <lb/> from him by death, in
                    the hour in which she gave him the <lb/> first pledge of their mutual affection.
                    This event was borne <lb/> by him with his customary fortitude. It induced him,
                        <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/> to make a change in his plans. He
                    disposed of his <lb/> property in America, and joined my uncle and me, who <lb/>
                    had terminated the wanderings of two years at Montpelier, <lb/> which will
                    henceforth, I believe, be our permanent abode.</p>
                <p>If you reflect upon that entire confidence which had <reg orig="sub-|sisted"
                        >subsisted</reg>
                    <lb/> from our infancy between Pleyel and myself; on the <lb/> passion that I
                    had contracted, and which was merely <lb/> smothered for a time; and on the
                    esteem which was <reg orig="mu-|tual">mutual</reg>, <lb/> you will not, perhaps,
                    be surprised that the renovation <lb/> of our intercourse should give birth to
                    that union which at <lb/> present subsists. When the period had elapsed
                    necessary to <lb/> weaken the remembrance of Theresa, to whom he had <lb/>
                    <pb n="222" entity="eaf033v1_0263" pid="uva-lib:349293"/> been bound by ties
                    more of honor than of love, he tendered <lb/> his affections to me. I need not
                    add that the tender was <lb/> eagerly accepted.</p>
                <p>Perhaps you are somewhat interested in the fate of <reg orig="Car-|win"
                        >Carwin</reg>. <lb/> He saw, when too late, the danger of imposture. <lb/>
                    So much affected was he by the catastrophe to which he <lb/> was a witness, that
                    he laid aside all regard to his own safety. <lb/> He sought my uncle, and
                    confided to him the tale which <lb/> he had just related to me. He found a more
                    impartial and <lb/> indulgent auditor in Mr. Cambridge, who imputed to <reg
                        orig="mania-|cal">maniacal</reg>
                    <lb/> illusion the conduct of Wieland, though he conceived <lb/> the previous
                    and unseen agency of Carwin, to have <reg orig="indi-|rectly">indirectly</reg>
                    <lb/> but powerfully predisposed to this deplorable <reg orig="perver-|sion"
                        >perversion</reg>
                    <lb/> of mind.</p>
                <p>It was easy for Carwin to elude the persecutions of <reg orig="Lud-|loe"
                        >Ludloe</reg>. <lb/> It was merely requisite to hide himself in a remote
                    <lb/> district of Pennsylvania. This, when he parted from us, <lb/> he
                    determined to do. He is now probably engaged in the <lb/> harmless pursuits of
                    agriculture, and may come to think, <lb/> without insupportable remorse, on the
                    evils to which his <lb/> fatal talents have given birth. The innocence and <reg
                        orig="useful-|ness">usefulness</reg>
                    <lb/> of his future life may, in some degree, atone for the <lb/> miseries so
                    rashly or so thoughtlessly inflicted.</p>
                <p>More urgent considerations hindered me from mentioning, <lb/> in the course of my
                    former mournful recital, any <reg orig="particu-|lars">particulars</reg>
                    <lb/> respecting the unfortunate father of Louisa Conway. <lb/> That man surely
                    was reserved to be a monument of <reg orig="capri-|cious">capricious</reg>
                    <lb/> fortune. His southern journeys being finished, he <reg orig="re-|turned"
                        >returned</reg>
                    <lb/> to Philadelphia. Before he reached the city he left <lb/> the highway, and
                    alighted at my brother's door. Contrary <lb/> to his expectation, no one came
                    forth to welcome him, or hail <lb/> his approach. He attempted to enter the
                    house, but bolted <lb/> doors, barred windows, and a silence broken only by <reg
                        orig="un-|answered">unanswered</reg>
                    <lb/> calls, shewed him that the mansion was deserted.</p>
                <p>He proceeded thence to my habitation, which he found, <lb/> in like manner,
                    gloomy and tenantless. His surprise may <lb/> be easily conceived. The rustics
                    who occupied the hut <lb/> told him an imperfect and incredible tale. He hasted
                    to <lb/> the city, and extorted from Mrs. Baynton a full disclosure <lb/> of
                    late disasters.</p>
                <pb n="223" entity="eaf033v1_0264" pid="uva-lib:349294"/>
                <p>He was inured to adversity, and recovered, after no long <lb/> time, from the
                    shocks produced by this disappointment of <lb/> his darling scheme. Our
                    intercourse did not terminate with <lb/> his departure from America. We have
                    since met with him <lb/> in France, and light has at length been thrown upon the
                    <lb/> motives which occasioned the disappearance of his wife, in <lb/> the
                    manner which I formerly related to you.</p>
                <p>I have dwelt upon the ardor of their conjugal <reg orig="attach-|ment"
                        >attachment</reg>, <lb/> and mentioned that no suspicion had ever glanced
                    <lb/> upon her purity. This, though the belief was long cherished, <lb/> recent
                    discoveries have shewn to be questionable. No <lb/> doubt her integrity would
                    have survived to the present <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg>, <lb/> if an
                    extraordinary fate had not befallen her.</p>
                <p>Major Stuart had been engaged, while in Germany, in a <lb/> contest of honor with
                    an Aid de Camp of the Marquis of <lb/> Granby. His adversary had propagated a
                    rumor injurious <lb/> to his character. A challenge was sent; a meeting ensued;
                    <lb/> and Stuart wounded and disarmed the calumniator. The <lb/> offence was
                    atoned for, and his life secured by suitable <lb/> concessions.</p>
                <p>Maxwell, that was his name, shortly after, in <reg orig="conse-|quence"
                        >consequence</reg>
                    <lb/> of succeeding to a rich inheritance, sold his <reg orig="com-|mission"
                        >commission</reg>
                    <lb/> and returned to London. His fortune was speedily <lb/> augmented by an
                    opulent marriage. Interest was his sole <lb/> inducement to this marriage,
                    though the lady had been <lb/> swayed by a credulous affection. The true state
                    of his <lb/> heart was quickly discovered, and a separation, by mutual <lb/>
                    consent, took place. The lady withdrew to an estate in a <lb/> distant county,
                    and Maxwell continued to consume his time <lb/> and fortune in the dissipation
                    of the capital.</p>
                <p>Maxwell, though deceitful and sensual, possessed great <lb/> force of mind and
                    specious accomplishments. He <reg orig="con-|trived">contrived</reg>
                    <lb/> to mislead the generous mind of Stuart, and to <reg orig="re-|gain"
                        >regain</reg>
                    <lb/> the esteem which his misconduct, for a time, had <reg orig="for-|feited"
                        >forfeited</reg>. <lb/> He was recommended by her husband to the <reg
                        orig="con-|fidence">confidence</reg>
                    <lb/> of Mrs. Stuart. Maxwell was stimulated by <reg orig="re-|venge"
                        >revenge</reg>, <lb/> and by a lawless passion, to convert this confidence
                    <lb/> into a source of guilt.</p>
                <p>The education and capacity of this woman, the worth of <lb/> her husband, the
                    pledge of their alliance which time had <lb/>
                    <pb n="224" entity="eaf033v1_0265" pid="uva-lib:349295"/> produced, her maturity
                    in age and knowledge of the world <lb/> &mdash;all combined to render this
                    attempt hopeless. Maxwell, <lb/> however, was not easily discouraged. The most
                    perfect <lb/> being, he believed, must owe his exemption from vice to <lb/> the
                    absence of temptation. The impulses of love are so <lb/> subtile, and the
                    influence of false reasoning, when enforced <lb/> by eloquence and passion, so
                    unbounded, that no human <lb/> virtue is secure from degeneracy. All arts being
                    tried, <lb/> every temptation being summoned to his aid, dissimulation <lb/>
                    being carried to its utmost bound, Maxwell, at length, <lb/> nearly accomplished
                    his purpose. The lady's affections <lb/> were withdrawn from her husband and
                    transferred to him. <lb/> She could not, as yet, be reconciled to dishonor. All
                    efforts <lb/> to induce her to elope with him were ineffectual. She <lb/>
                    permitted herself to love, and to avow her love; but at this <lb/> limit she
                    stopped, and was immovable.</p>
                <p>Hence this revolution in her sentiments was productive <lb/> only of despair. Her
                    rectitude of principle preserved her <lb/> from actual guilt, but could not
                    restore to her her ancient <lb/> affection, or save her from being the prey of
                    remorseful <lb/> and impracticable wishes. Her husband's absence <reg
                        orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg>
                    <lb/> a state of suspense. This, however, approached to <lb/> a period, and she
                    received tidings of his intended return. <lb/> Maxwell, being likewise apprized
                    of this event, and having <lb/> made a last and unsuccessful effort to conquer
                    her <reg orig="reluc-|tance">reluctance</reg>
                    <lb/> to accompany him in a journey to Italy, whither he <lb/> pretended an

                    <lb/> the measures which despair might suggest. At the <lb/> same time she
                    received a letter from the wife of <reg orig="Max-|well">Maxwell</reg>, <lb/>
                    unveiling the true character of this man, and <reg orig="reveal-|ing"
                        >revealing</reg>
                    <lb/> facts which the artifices of her seducer had hitherto <lb/> concealed from
                    her. Mrs. Maxwell had been prompted <lb/> to this disclosure by a knowledge of
                    her husband's <reg orig="prac-|tices">practices</reg>, <lb/> with which his own
                    impetuosity had made her <reg orig="ac-|quainted">acquainted</reg>.</p>
                <p>This discovery, joined to the delicacy of her scruples <lb/> and the anguish of
                    remorse, induced her to abscond. This <lb/> scheme was adopted in haste, but
                    effected with <reg orig="consum-|mate">consummate</reg>

                    communication. Between <lb/> these women an ancient intimacy and considerable

                    <lb/> of character subsisted. This disclosure was <reg orig="accom-|panied"

                    <lb/> with solemn injunctions of secrecy, and these <reg orig="in-|junctions"
                        >injunctions</reg>
                    <lb/> were, for a long time, faithfully observed.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Maxwell's abode was situated on the banks of the <lb/> Wey. Stuart was her
                    kinsman; their youth had been spent <lb/> together; and Maxwell was in some
                    degree indebted to the <lb/> man whom he betrayed, for his alliance with this
                        <reg orig="unfortu-|nate">unfortunate</reg>
                    <lb/> lady. Her esteem for the character of Stuart had <lb/> never been
                    diminished. A meeting between them was <reg orig="oc-|casioned">occasioned</reg>
                    <lb/> by a tour which the latter had undertaken, in the <lb/> year after his
                    return from America, to Wales and the <reg orig="wes-|tern">western</reg>
                    <lb/> counties. This interview produced pleasure and <reg orig="re-|gret"
                        >regret</reg>
                    <lb/> in each. Their own transactions naturally became the <lb/> topics of their
                    conversation; and the untimely fate of his <lb/> wife and daughter were related
                    by the guest.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Maxwell's regard for her friend, as well as for the <lb/> safety of her
                    husband, persuaded her to concealment; but <lb/> the former being dead, and the
                    latter being out of the <reg orig="king-|dom">kingdom</reg>, <lb/> she ventured
                    to produce Mrs. Stuart's letter, and to <lb/> communicate her own knowledge of
                    the treachery of <reg orig="Max-|well">Maxwell</reg>. <lb/> She had previously
                    extorted from her guest a <reg orig="pro-|mise">promise</reg>
                    <lb/> not to pursue any scheme of vengeance; but this <reg orig="pro-|mise"
                        >promise</reg>
                    <lb/> was made while ignorant of the full extent of <reg orig="Max-|well's"
                        >Maxwell's</reg>
                    <lb/> depravity, and his passion refused to adhere to it.</p>
                <p>At this time my uncle and I resided at Avignon. Among <lb/> the English resident
                    there, and with whom we maintained a <lb/> social intercourse, was Maxwell. This
                    man's talents and <lb/> address rendered him a favorite both with my uncle and
                    <lb/> myself. He had even tendered me his hand in marriage; <lb/> but this being
                    refused, he had sought and obtained <reg orig="permis-|sion">permission</reg>
                    <lb/> to continue with us the intercourse of friendship. <lb/> Since a legal
                    marriage was impossible, no doubt, his views <lb/>
                    <pb n="226" entity="eaf033v1_0267" pid="uva-lib:349297"/> were flagitious.
                    Whether he had relinquished these views <lb/> I was unable to judge.</p>
                <p>He was one in a large circle at a villa in the environs, to <lb/> which I had
                    likewise been invited, when Stuart abruptly <lb/> entered the apartment. He was
                    recognised with genuine <lb/> satisfaction by me, and with seeming pleasure by
                    Maxwell. <lb/> In a short time, some affair of moment being pleaded, <lb/> which
                    required an immediate and exclusive interview, <reg orig="Max-|well"
                        >Maxwell</reg>
                    <lb/> and he withdrew together. Stuart and my uncle had <lb/> been known to each
                    other in the German army; and the <lb/> purpose contemplated by the former in
                    this long and hasty <lb/> journey, was confided to his old friend.</p>
                <p>A defiance was given and received, and the banks of a <lb/> rivulet, about a
                    league from the city, was selected as the <lb/> scene of this contest. My uncle,
                    having exerted himself <lb/> in vain to prevent a hostile meeting, consented to
                    attend <lb/> them as a surgeon.&mdash;Next morning, at sunrise, was the <lb/>
                    time chosen.</p>
                <p>I returned early in the evening to my lodgings. <reg orig="Prelimi-|naries"
                        >Preliminaries</reg>
                    <lb/> being settled between the combatants, Stuart had <lb/> consented to spend
                    the evening with us, and did not retire <lb/> till late. On the way to his hotel
                    he was exposed to no <lb/> molestation, but just as he stepped within the
                    portico, a <lb/> swarthy and malignant figure started from behind a column,
                    <lb/> and plunged a stiletto into his body.</p>
                <p>The author of this treason could not certainly be <reg orig="disco-|vered"
                        >discovered</reg>; <lb/> but the details communicated by Stuart, <reg
                        orig="respect-|ing">respecting</reg>
                    <lb/> the history of Maxwell, naturally pointed him out as an <lb/> object of
                    suspicion. No one expressed more concern, on <lb/> account of this disaster,
                    than he; and he pretended an <reg orig="ar-|dent">ardent</reg>
                    <lb/> zeal to vindicate his character from the aspersions that <lb/> were cast
                    upon it. Thenceforth, however, I denied <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg>
                    <lb/> to his visits; and shortly after he disappeared from this <lb/> scene.</p>
                <p>Few possessed more estimable qualities, and a better <lb/> title to happiness and
                    the tranquil honors of long life, than <lb/> the mother and the father of Louisa
                    Conway; yet they <lb/> were cut off in the bloom of their days; and their
                    destiny <lb/> was thus accomplished by the same hand. Maxwell was <lb/>
                    <pb n="227" entity="eaf033v1_0268" pid="uva-lib:349298"/> the instrument of
                    their destruction, though the instrument <lb/> was applied to this end in so
                    different a manner.</p>
                <p>I leave you to moralize on this tale. That virtue should <lb/> become the victim
                    of treachery is, no doubt, a mournful <lb/> consideration; but it will not
                    escape your notice, that the <lb/> evils of which Carwin and Maxwell were the
                    authors, owed <lb/> their existence to the errors of the sufferers. All efforts
                    <lb/> would have been ineffectual to subvert the happiness or <lb/> shorten the
                    existence of the Stuarts, if their own frailty had <lb/> not seconded these
                    efforts. If the lady had crushed her <lb/> disastrous passion in the bud, and
                    driven the seducer from <lb/> her presence, when the tendency of his artifices
                    was seen; <lb/> if Stuart had not admitted the spirit of absurd revenge, we
                    <lb/> should not have had to deplore this catastrophe. If <reg orig="Wie-|land"
                        >Wieland</reg>
                    <lb/> had framed juster notions of moral duty, and of the <lb/> divine
                    attributes; or if I had been gifted with ordinary <lb/> equanimity or foresight,
                    the double tongued deceiver would <lb/> have been baffled and repelled.</p>
