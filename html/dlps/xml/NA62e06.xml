                <p> On Thursday Evening, May 6th, 1862, Addie writes to Charlie about her continuing
                    experiences as a school teacher in East Claridon, Ohio. In the teaching
                    tradition of the time, she boards around and in this case, she is boarding with
                    Libbie Armstrong. In this letter, she focuses on her experience with two of her
                    students, Kate and Mary Page. Both students refuse to join the class in morning
                    and afternoon Bible readings and this causes Addie much distress. Addie also
                    continues her conversation about her love and longing for Charlie. </p>

                <p> With a thankful heart I <sic corr="received">recieved</sic><lb/> your precious
                    letter tonight of the 28<hi rend="super">th</hi><unclear>?</unclear> and <orig reg="cheerfully"
                        >cheer-<lb/> fully</orig> devote myself to the pleasure of answering<lb/>
                    it. I wrote ou last eve informing you that I had<lb/> commenced my school. You
                    are mistaken, dear one,<lb/> I shall always be "Addie" at least I hope that
                    to<lb/> you I shall. No difference if they do add the appel<lb/> -lations of
                    "Mistress," "Teacher" yet from under<lb/> these coverings a strong semblance of
                    Addie may<lb/> be recognizable. Yes darling, you heard aright in your<lb/>
                    fanciful vision when you imagined hearing a <orig reg="chapter">chap-<lb/>
                        <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0128"/> ter</orig> read from
                    the <bibl>Bible</bibl>. I should not feel<lb/> my-self worthy the name of
                    teacher, if I could<lb/> not open my school with a chapter from God's Holy<lb/>
                    Book. I also have my scholars learn a verse from<lb/> some portion of
                        the <bibl>Bible</bibl>, which they may choose<lb/> and repeat just before the
                    close of school.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p> I must tell you of a little instance that<lb/> transpired this morning. Two
                    little girls Kate<lb/> and Mary Page have professed a good deal
                        of <unclear>resistance</unclear><lb/> -tance about reading in the morning and
                    it was<lb/> with no little persuasion that I could get them<lb/> to read. They
                    gave no reason why only that they<lb/> "didn't want to". To night I asked
                        Libbie <orig reg="Armstrong">Arm-<lb/> strong</orig> -- one of my scholars if
                    she knew the reason<lb/> She replied that their <hi rend="underline"
                        >entire</hi> <hi rend="underline">family</hi> <hi rend="underline"
                        >were</hi> <hi rend="underline">infidels</hi><lb/> Oh: Charlie: what a
                    thought! The girls cannot be<lb/> over ten and twelve years of age. Charlie
                    dear,<lb/> as you have so kindly offered your assistance to me<lb/> if needed,
                    will you please tell me how to act in<lb/> this instance. You did not think did
                    you that<lb/> I would so soon apply to you, but I do not know<lb/>
                    <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0129"/> how to act. I <hi rend="underline"
                        >cannot</hi> <hi rend="underline">compel</hi> them to join in our morning
                    devotions, but I should so<lb/> love to have <hi rend="underline">all</hi> join.
                    That one act has caused<lb/> many a painful thought so take possession of
                    my<lb/> heart. You also heard aright when you seemed to<lb/> hear me addressing
                    those little hearts left under<lb/> my care, in accents of kindness. (Did
                    you<lb/> see that great drop fall on that other page? How<lb/> provoking) I did
                    so wish to gain their love and<lb/> confidence and how freely they gave it me.
                    Perhaps<lb/> my voice did tremble slightly for it made me<lb/> tremble when I
                    thought of the responsibility which<lb/> rested <add place="inline" hand="h1"><hi
                            rend="underline">rests</hi> I meant</add> upon me. Dearest if my letters
                    produce<lb/> such an effect as to cause your head to ache. I<lb/> will --
                        Oh:<unclear>?</unclear>! I will <unclear>?</unclear> no such think.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p> You request me to describe <name type="place">Claridon</name>
                    <lb/> people. When I say it is lovely romantic and<lb/> beautiful it is
                    described. Its occupants, I have<lb/> not as yet become acquanted with except
                    my<lb/> scholars. Yes, I "board around" or at least am going to. I am at Ms. L--
                    to night.<lb/>
                    <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0130"/> I will give you my "experineces"
                    as<lb/> get is. A lovely place it is, south of my<lb/> school house. Hemlock
                    trees of all sizes are to<lb/> be seen. You ought to see my school room
                    decked<lb/> with Hemlock boughs and wild flowers, it is<lb/> so pleasant.
                    Charlie my darling, you already love<lb/> me far better than I deserve, but
                    nature will show<lb/> its self. Do not take back any of
                    that <unclear>June</unclear> fountain of<lb/> love which flows so tenderly
                    towards your Addie!<lb/> "Is Dora to be one of my scholars?" What an idea!<lb/>
                    Bless you did I forget to tell you that she <unclear>teaches</unclear><lb/>
                        at <name type="place">East Claridon</name>? Yes dearest; I feel that God
                    will<lb/> strengthen me in my duties.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p> How very thankful I am that the "Blockade"<lb/> is raised. You do not know how I
                    missed your letters<lb/> No. Charlie; I can not think it would have been<lb/>
                    right for me to have engaged a school with <orig reg="out-consulting"
                        >out-consul<lb/> -ting</orig> you, for, darling, <hi rend="underline"
                        >some</hi> <hi rend="underline">time</hi> you know I am to be yours<lb/>
                    <hi rend="underline">forever</hi>. How happy the thought is to me, that at some
                    future<lb/> time I can hear you utter the words "My Addie" and feel<lb/> that I
                    am only yours. Oh, Charlie, "Does my heart condemn<lb/> me for loving you"?
                    Never, no, no, never dear darling <unclear>friend</unclear><lb/> nor never will.
                    If you only knew how very very thankful I am<lb/> for your love you would not
                    think my heart condemned<lb/> me for offering any <unclear>finer</unclear> love
