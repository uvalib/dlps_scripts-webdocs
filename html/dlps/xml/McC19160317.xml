            <salute>Dear Marcelle:</salute>
        		</opener>
        		
            <p>
            I’ve been on the
            23 meter Nieuport for several
            days and will soon go to 
            18 meter.  I like the machine
            very much.  Have written to
            Captain Watt asking him if 
            I can be requested at Toul.
            May try for Russian front,
            if I cannot go to Toul.
            </p><p>
            Looking in my 
            diary I find that this day
            last year you had a few
            hours off and we walked in
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0263" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            the Bois from one until three.
            Remember when the French
            Captain on horseback saluted
            me?  It was that day.  Those
            walks were wonderful.  It 
            seemed more like spring then
            than it does here this year
            even tho [sic] we’re in the 
            south.  Maybe it was being
            with you that made the
            Bois seem so lovely.
            </p><p>
            My mother threatens to
            come over.  If she does
            I’ll go to Russia sure,
            for should she be near
            me when I’m at the front
            there would be a scene every
            time I left her and the
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0262" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            strain would be worse
            than my work.
            </p><p>
            I’m very anxious
            to get thru [sic] but I realize
            myself I’m not good enough
            as yet to work over the 
            lines.  Kiffin has been
            at it since Dec. 5th but
            I hope they won’t keep me
            as long as they have him.
            Of course the American
            Escadrille is what’s holding
            him up now.  We have
            a great advantage here in
            possessing a lot of machines
            so no matter how many
            are broken others are ready
            and we get at least three
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0264" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            trips a day.
            </p><p>
            Your little
            calendar is always with
            me and so far has
            kept me from breaking so
            much as a wire of the 
            Nieuport.
            </p>
