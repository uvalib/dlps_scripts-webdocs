<head><hi rend="bold">INTRODUCTION</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> this little book I am going to tell you about some <lb/>
of the women who have been famous in the past. <lb/>
There are perhaps many names more famous than <lb/>
those I have chosen, but it was not always the best <lb/>
women who were the most talked about. In the past <lb/>
it was seldom that any woman, who was not a royal <lb/>
lady or some great aristocrat, became known to the <lb/>
world. In the early days of Christianity, many women <lb/>
suffered bravely for their faith, and later in the convents <lb/>
there were studious nuns who became known for their <lb/>
learning. In the account of St. Hilda you will read <lb/>
of one of the most famous of these. But most women <lb/>
were busy in keeping their houses, and had to do many <lb/>
things which no woman would dream of doing now. <lb/>
Cloth and linen had to be woven at home, simple <lb/>
medicines and ointments were made by the great <lb/>
ladies, who had often to act as doctors as well as <lb/>
nurses. Only few women had any book learning, and <lb/>
it was long before it was thought desirable for a <lb/>
woman to learn to write. When good schools were <lb/>
started for boys, few people thought it desirable to <lb/>
do anything for the education of girls. It was not <lb/>
till the nineteenth century that a change began, and <lb/>
that people as a rule began to think that, as girls had <lb/>
minds as well as boys, it was as well to give them <lb/>
the chance of learning. When you read about Mrs. <lb/>
<pb n="xii" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0020"/>
Somerville, you will see how great was the change in <lb/>
her lifetime. No one troubled to teach her when she <lb/>
was a child, but before her death the first colleges for <lb/>
women were founded at Cambridge.</p>
<p>Joan of Kent is an example of the aimless life led <lb/>
by a great lady in the Middle Ages who was kindly <lb/>
and beloved, but did not know how to make her life <lb/>
of use to others. Margaret Beaumont was also a great <lb/>
lady and might have spent her days in pleasure, but <lb/>
the experiences of her life made her serious, and she <lb/>
used her life and her money in the service of others. <lb/>
Since their day, there have been many great ladies <lb/>
who have been like one or other of these two.</p>
<p>The first way in which women who had no great <lb/>
position in the world made themselves famous was <lb/>
by their care for the poor and the suffering. What <lb/>
such women could do, and there have been very many <lb/>
of them, is seen in the lives of Elizabeth Fry, Sister <lb/>
Dora, and Florence Nightingale. Other women have <lb/>
given their lives to sharing the sorrows and anxieties <lb/>
of their husbands, and by their love and devotion have <lb/>
been their greatest help in difficult times. These are <lb/>
seldom known to fame, but we see examples of them <lb/>
in Lady Rachel Howard and Lady Inglis. But whilst <lb/>
most women would always choose a quiet home life <lb/>
there are others, of whom Mrs. Bishop is an example, <lb/>
who are filled with the spirit of adventure, and like to <lb/>
face difficulties and to see new things. It is not possible <lb/>
in one small book to give examples of all the different <lb/>
kinds of women who have lived for the service of <lb/>
others. I should like to have told you something <lb/>
about the women doctors, the great women teachers, <lb/>
the women writers and novelists. From all their <lb/>
lives you would learn one lesson which is set forth <lb/>
<pb n="xiii" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0021"/>
clearly in the life of Queen Victoria. Nothing worth <lb/>
doing is done without a great deal of trouble. The <lb/>
ruler of a great empire has to work as hard as any <lb/>
girl in a factory, and Queen Victoria is known as a <lb/>
great queen, not because she had talents above other <lb/>
women, but simply because she set herself to do her <lb/>
duty in the position in which God had placed her. In <lb/>
that we can all imitate her.</p>
<p>But what shall I say about the one woman in our <lb/>
book who is not English, the Maid of France? She <lb/>
seems to me to stand apart from all other women, like <lb/>
a beautiful vision for our delight and reverence. But <lb/>
she is like all other good women in this that she did <lb/>
the thing that lay before her. Without fear, in perfect <lb/>
simplicity, she took up the task to which she felt she <lb/>
was called, and went straight on without looking back, <lb/>
even to death.</p>
<p>We do not know what work may be asked from <lb/>
women in the future, but the same spirit will still be <lb/>
needed&mdash;the capacity to take trouble, the readiness to <lb/>
do difficult things when duty calls, and the gentle spirit <lb/>
of love which, in spite of all her learning, made Mrs. <lb/>
Somerville a better wife and mother than most even <lb/>
of those who have devoted themselves entirely to their <lb/>
domestic duties.</p>

ST. HILDA</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Amongst</hi> our forefathers, the wild German tribes who <lb/>
conquered Britain and made it England, women had <lb/>
always held an honourable place. This made it possible <lb/>
for them, in the days when the Christian faith was <lb/>
first preached in England, to do a great deal to help the <lb/>
work of the Church. They did not have to spend their <lb/>
days in fighting like the men, and they were eager to <lb/>
listen to the new teaching which showed them many <lb/>
different ways of serving God and helping their <reg orig="fellow-|creatures">fellow-creatures</reg>. <lb/>
Probably it was the Christian wife of <lb/>
Ethelbert, King of Kent, a French princess, who helped <lb/>
to make him willing to listen to Augustine, the <reg orig="mis-|sionary">missionary</reg> <lb/>
sent from Rome by the Pope to convert the <lb/>
English. Kent was the first of the English kingdoms <lb/>
to become Christian. In the northern part of England <lb/>
there was a great king called Edwin, who ruled over <lb/>
Northumbria and had his capital at York. He seems <lb/>
to have heard much in praise of one of Ethelbert's <lb/>
daughters, Ethelburga, who was so beloved in her <lb/>
family that they called her Tata, the darling. Edwin <lb/>
sent messengers to ask Ethelburga's brother, Eadbald, <lb/>
who had succeeded his father as king, to give him his <lb/>
<pb n="16" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0024"/>
sister in marriage. But Eadbald said that he could <lb/>
not give his sister to a heathen. Edwin would not be <lb/>
refused. He sent messengers again, and said that if <lb/>
only he might have Ethelburga as his wife, he would <lb/>
allow her to worship in her own way, and would be <lb/>
willing to adopt her faith if, on hearing more about it, <lb/>
his wise men should decide that it was better than his <lb/>
own. So Ethelburga was sent to York with Bishop <lb/>
Paulinus as her chaplain. Edwin was true to his word; <lb/>
he treated Paulinus kindly, and after a while listened <lb/>
to his teaching, and when he had consulted his wise <lb/>
men, and they too were willing, he decided to be <lb/>
baptized.</p>
<p>Quickly a little wooden chapel was built on the spot <lb/>
where now stands the great minster of York, and <lb/>
within its walls Edwin and many others were taught <lb/>
the Christian faith. On Easter Eve, in the year 627, he <lb/>
was baptized. Many of his nobles as well as members <lb/>
of his family were baptized with him. Amongst them <lb/>
was a young girl, his great-niece, the Princess Hilda, <lb/>
then fourteen years old. We do not know anything <lb/>
about Hilda's life as a child nor for some years after <lb/>
her baptism. Her mother and her sister were also <lb/>
early converts to Christianity. In some way Hilda <lb/>
must have continued her Christian education, most <lb/>
probably she lived at a religious settlement in the <lb/>
north, and was busy in some sort of work for the <lb/>
Church. In those days all girls either married or <lb/>
entered a convent of some kind. Hilda, a member of <lb/>
a royal family, would certainly have been sought in <lb/>
marriage had it not been known that she had in some <lb/>
way given herself to a religious life. Many royal ladies <lb/>
were founders of convents. They received grants of <lb/>
land from their fathers or brothers and gathered <lb/>
<pb n="17" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0025"/>
round them those who wished to live in peace, away <lb/>
from all the fighting and disturbance of the world. <lb/>
Many royal ladies retired into convents after their <lb/>
husband's death, or sometimes even during their <lb/>
husband's lifetime. In the convents they could study, <lb/>
or do beautiful embroidery for the churches, care for <lb/>
the sick and aged, or teach the children. It was <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
the holiest life that a woman could lead; <lb/>
those men, too, who wished to lead quiet lives and to <lb/>
spend their days in study rather than in fighting could <lb/>
only do so by retiring into a convent. If it had not been <lb/>
for the convents in early times there would have been <lb/>
no books, no learning, no art or industry. It was by <lb/>
the people who lived in the convents that the land was <lb/>
drained and cultivated, and that sheep and oxen were <lb/>
reared. France had become Christian earlier than <lb/>
England, so there were more famous convents there, <lb/>
and ladies belonging to the English royal families used <lb/>
to go over to the French convents to be educated, and <lb/>
often retired to them to end their days.</p>
<p>We are not told that Hilda was sent to a French <lb/>
convent to be educated, but her sister Hereswitha, who <lb/>
had married the King of East Anglia, went after his <lb/>
death to a French convent, and Hilda prepared to join <lb/>
her there. Hilda was by this time thirty-three. All that <lb/>
we know of her life since her baptism is what the old <lb/>
Northumbrian historian, Bede, tells us&mdash;that she lived <lb/>
very nobly among her family and fellow-citizens. <lb/>
Somehow her virtues and gifts attracted the notice <lb/>
of Aidan, the holy Bishop of Lindisfarne, who was <lb/>
working with zeal and devotion to win the wild people <lb/>
of the north for Christ. He seems to have been Hilda's <lb/>
friend and adviser, and he wanted her help in his work. <lb/>
When he heard that she was thinking of going to join <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0026"/>
her sister in France, he begged her to remain among <lb/>
her own people and to help them. Hilda yielded to his <lb/>
wishes, and she first settled down with a few companions <lb/>
on the river Wear. But soon afterwards she was called <lb/>
in the year 647, to be head of a convent in Hartlepool, <lb/>
which had been founded some years before, and was <lb/>
the first convent for women in that part of England.</p>
<p>Those were very anxious days. There had been <lb/>
Christian kings in Northumbria who had made it into <lb/>
a great and strong kingdom, and with the help of <lb/>
Aidan and other holy men had made the people <lb/>
Christian and brought peace into the land. But the <lb/>
Northumbrian kings were attacked by Penda, the last <lb/>
great heathen king in England, a fierce and mighty <lb/>
fighter, and it seemed at times as if he would utterly <lb/>
destroy the power of the Christian kings. Hilda in <lb/>
her quiet convent must have waited anxiously for the <lb/>
news that came of the fighting between Oswy, the <lb/>
King of Northumbria, and Penda, who with his great <lb/>
army of fierce fighters seemed to rush like a torrent <lb/>
over the country. It was eight years after she had <lb/>
gone to Hartlepool, that Oswy with a much smaller <lb/>
army, utterly routed Penda's great host in a battle in <lb/>
which the fierce old heathen king was himself killed. <lb/>
Before the battle Oswy had sworn that if he gained the <lb/>
victory, he would give his infant daughter to God; and <lb/>
he now sent his little &AElig;lfl&aelig;d, not yet a year old, to his <lb/>
kinswoman Hilda to bring up in her convent. With <lb/>
his daughter, he gave also a rich gift of land, so that <lb/>
Hilda might be able to extend her work. The little <lb/>
Elfl&aelig;d was a great delight to Hilda, and grew up to be <lb/>
her dearest companion and fellow-worker.</p>
<p>Hilda had done much at Hartlepool. She had <lb/>
learnt all she could from wise men as to how to order a <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0027"/>
convent. Aidan and all the religious men who knew <lb/>
her used to visit her constantly. They were glad to <lb/>
teach her all they knew, and they loved her dearly <lb/>
because of her wisdom and her delight in the service <lb/>
of God.</p>
<p>In those days the work that women could do for the <lb/>
Church was highly esteemed, and the abbesses who <lb/>
ruled over the convents were very important people. <lb/>
They had to manage large estates as well as to order <lb/>
all the different kinds of work that were carried on in <lb/>
the convent. Many of them were very learned women; <lb/>
and we know of Hilda that she was always eager to <lb/>
learn, and knew well how to teach others what she <lb/>
had learnt. After she had spent some years at <reg orig="Hartle-|pool">Hartlepool</reg>, <lb/>
she decided to found a new convent on some <lb/>
of the lands that had been granted her by King <lb/>
Oswy. She chose a beautiful spot on the top of a high <lb/>
cliff overlooking the sea, at the mouth of the river Esk. <lb/>
This spot was afterwards called Whitby, and by that <lb/>
name Hilda's famous abbey is best known. But though <lb/>
in later times a beautiful abbey church was built there, <lb/>
the ruins of which are still standing, all that Hilda <lb/>
could build was a rude little church made of the split <lb/>
trunks of trees, thatched with rushes. Round the <lb/>
church stood the huts in which Hilda and her nuns <lb/>
lived, with their kitchen and their dining-hall. Farther <lb/>
off, but still in the enclosure of the convent, were huts <lb/>
in which monks lived; for in those early days it often <lb/>
happened that men and women joined together to found <lb/>
one convent. The monks and the nuns lived apart, <lb/>
but Hilda ruled over them all alike. Some of the <lb/>
monks tilled the fields belonging to the convent; and <lb/>
there were barns and farm buildings, as well as rooms <lb/>
for writing and study. Over all these different men <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0028"/>
and women Hilda ruled firmly and wisely. They were <lb/>
all treated alike. There was no one in her convent <lb/>
who was rich and no one who was poor, for those who <lb/>
came there gave all their possessions into the common <lb/>
store. Hilda so ruled that peace and charity prevailed <lb/>
amongst them all. All who knew her called her <lb/>
Mother, because of her singular piety and grace, and <lb/>
<figure id="f2" rend="block" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0028">

<p><hi rend="italic">Photo: Frith &amp; Co.</hi></p>
<p>This was the successor of St. Hilda's building.</p>
</figure>
the fame of her virtues spread far and wide. She <lb/>
loved learning and wished all to study, and made them <lb/>
give much time to the reading of the Bible. Her <lb/>
own wisdom and prudence were so well known that <lb/>
many people, and amongst them even kings and <lb/>
princes, came to her for advice in their difficulties. <lb/>
Amongst those who studied at Whitby many grew <lb/>
afterwards to be famous, and five of those who had <lb/>
lived under Hilda's rule became bishops of the Church. <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0029"/>
But, of all the dwellers at Whitby, the most famous was <lb/>
one who had begun life simply as one of the workers on <lb/>
the farm, the sweet singer C&aelig;dmon.</p>
<p>In those days, at feasts, it was the custom for one after <lb/>
another to be asked for a song, and the harp was passed <lb/>
round the table, each taking it in turn and <reg orig="accompany-|ing">accompanying</reg> <lb/>
himself whilst he sang. C&aelig;dmon thought that he <lb/>
could not sing, and when he saw that his turn was <lb/>
coming near, he used to get up and quietly leave the <lb/>
table and go home. One day he had left the feast in <lb/>
this way and gone to the stable where it was his duty <lb/>
that night to take care of the horses. Having done his <lb/>
work he settled himself to sleep, and in the night one <lb/>
stood by his side, and calling to him, said, "C&aelig;dmon, <lb/>
sing some song to me." He answered, "I cannot sing, <lb/>
for that reason I left the feast and withdrew to this <lb/>
place, because I cannot sing." But he who stood by <lb/>
his side answered, "However, you shall sing." "What <lb/>
shall I sing?" asked C&aelig;dmon; and the answer came, <lb/>
"Sing the beginning of created beings." Then in his <lb/>
dream he sang in praise of God the Creator with words <lb/>
which he had never heard before. When he awoke, <lb/>
he remembered what he had sung, and added more <lb/>
verses to those which had come to him in his dream. <lb/>
He told the steward who was set over him of this gift <lb/>
of song that had been granted to him in his sleep, and <lb/>
the steward took him to the Abbess Hilda. She bade <lb/>
him in the presence of herself and of several learned <lb/>
men repeat the verses which he had made, and they <lb/>
all decided that it must be through the grace of God <lb/>
that this gift had come to him. They explained to <lb/>
him a passage from the Bible and bade him go away <lb/>
and turn it into verse. Next morning he came back <lb/>
and recited to them the excellent verses which he had <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0030"/>
made. Then Hilda bade him give up his work on the <lb/>
farm and come into the convent and become a monk, <lb/>
that he might devote himself to cultivating the gift of <lb/>
song which he had received. She directed some of the <lb/>
brethren to teach him the sacred history contained in <lb/>
the Bible, that he might turn it into song. After they <lb/>
had taught him, C&aelig;dmon would think over all that he <lb/>
had heard, turning it over in his mind as the cow chews <lb/>
the cud, till he brought it out again as harmonious <lb/>
verse, which he would sweetly repeat to his masters, <lb/>
who now in their turn became his hearers. He sang <lb/>
of the Creation and of the doings of the people of Israel <lb/>
and of the life and sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ, <lb/>
and tried by his poems to lead men to love virtue <lb/>
and hate vice. Through his sweet singing great fame <lb/>
came to Hilda's convent, and after some years he died <lb/>
there in great peace and holiness.</p>
<p>We are not told whether Hilda was able as time went <lb/>
on to build a more stately church in place of the rough <lb/>
wooden one which she at first put up, but it seems most <lb/>
likely, considering the fame of her abbey, that she <lb/>
must have done so. She probably was friendly with <lb/>
Benedict Biscop, the Abbot of Wearmouth, which was <lb/>
also in the north of England. Benedict Biscop had <lb/>
made many journeys to France and Italy, and he first <lb/>
brought to England glass windows and beautiful <reg orig="vest-|ments">vestments</reg> <lb/>
for his church, as well as skilled masons and glass <lb/>
workers from France, who taught their craft to the <lb/>
Northumbrians. We cannot doubt that Hilda with her <lb/>
energy and her wisdom got some of these men to come <lb/>
and teach her people also how to put up beautiful <reg orig="build-|ings">buildings</reg>; <lb/>
perhaps Benedict Biscop may have given her <lb/>
some of the treasures, vestments, pictures, or vessels <lb/>
for the church services which he had brought back with <lb/>

him. The fame and importance of the Abbey of Whitby <lb/>
is shown by the fact that it was chosen as the spot in <lb/>
which to hold a great Council of the Church in 664, <lb/>
when many bishops met with King Oswy to settle <lb/>
matters of great importance for the whole Church in <lb/>
England. Hilda had to care for the entertainment of <lb/>
this great gathering and to take part in their discussions. <lb/>
They had met to decide whether in certain matters the <lb/>
customs of the Church of Rome or the customs of the <lb/>
Church in Northumbria should be followed. Hilda <lb/>
was in favour of the customs of Northumbria, but when <lb/>
King Oswy decided that it would be better to do as the <lb/>
rest of the Church did, she was wise enough to give in <lb/>
to his decision, seeing that these were matters which <lb/>
concerned only the order and not the teaching of the <lb/>
Church.</p>
<p>We know that Hilda founded at least one other <lb/>
convent herself, and several others were founded in <lb/>
different parts of England in imitation of the great <lb/>
Abbey of Whitby. For many years she ruled her <reg orig="con-|vent">convent</reg> <lb/>
with wisdom and diligence. At the end of her <lb/>
life she was called to bear the trial of a long illness. <lb/>
For six years she lay ill, but during all that time <reg orig="when-|ever">whenever</reg> <lb/>
possible, she would still teach those under her <lb/>
rule. She bade them serve God dutifully when they <lb/>
were in perfect health, and always return thanks to <lb/>
Him even when in trouble or suffering. How to do <lb/>
this she showed by her own example, for all through <lb/>
her long sickness she never failed to return thanks <lb/>
to God. When at last she felt death drawing near, <lb/>
she gathered all the inmates of her convent around <lb/>
her, and having bidden them to live in peace with <lb/>
one another and with all others, she joyfully <reg orig="wel-|comed">welcomed</reg> <lb/>
death who came to take her from her <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0033"/>
sufferings to new life. She died in 680 at the age of <lb/>
sixty-six.</p>
<p>&AElig;lfl&aelig;d, the daughter of King Oswy, who as an infant <lb/>
had been confided to Hilda's care, succeeded her as <lb/>
abbess. Hilda was honoured as a saint by the Church <lb/>
after her death.</p>

JOAN, THE FAIR MAID OF KENT</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">On</hi> the 19th March 1329, a great English noble, Edmund, <lb/>
Earl of Kent, was beheaded outside the walls of <reg orig="Win-|chester">Winchester</reg>. <lb/>
He was the youngest son of one of England's <lb/>
noblest kings, Edward I.; but he was a weak, vain man, <lb/>
and in the troublous days which followed Edward I.'s <lb/>
death he had been used first by one party and then by <lb/>
another, until he had made many enemies and kept <lb/>
few friends. The wicked Queen Isabella, who had <lb/>
allowed her foolish husband, Edward II., to be murdered, <lb/>
and ruled the country with her favourite, Mortimer, in <lb/>
the name of her young son, Edward III., hated the <lb/>
Earl of Kent. She vowed his ruin and had him <reg orig="con-|victed">convicted</reg> <lb/>
of treason. Men did not love Kent, but it was <lb/>
thought a terrible thing that the son of Edward I. <lb/>
should perish like a traitor. Though he was condemned <lb/>
to death, no one dared lift their hand against him, and <lb/>
from morning till evening the great Earl waited, till <lb/>
a condemned criminal consented to win his own pardon <lb/>
by cutting off the Earl's head. Kent's youngest child, <lb/>
the little Joan, was then only a year old, and two years <lb/>
afterwards Philippa, Queen of Edward III., moved with <lb/>
compassion for her desolate state, took her under her <lb/>
care to bring her up at her court. Many stories told <lb/>
of Queen Philippa show the kindness of her heart, and <lb/>
we cannot doubt that the little Joan was happy under <lb/>
her care. She grew up in the court of Edward III., <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0035"/>
which after his successful wars in France became one <lb/>
of the most magnificent in Europe. Life was a <reg orig="cease-|less">ceaseless</reg> <lb/>
round of festivities and gaieties. Rich booty was <lb/>
brought back from the French wars, and the English <lb/>
ladies copied the extravagant fashions of the French. <lb/>
We read of the feather beds with gorgeous hangings <lb/>
<figure id="f4" rend="block" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0035">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">Tournament.</hi></head>
</figure>
which were used, of the rich furs, of the velvet robes <lb/>
embroidered in silk and pearls, of the trailing dresses <lb/>
which lay in heaps upon the ground in front as well as <lb/>
behind. Joan grew up to be a very beautiful girl and <lb/>
to be very fond of fine clothes. She is said to have <lb/>
been full of charm and to have been clever and brilliant <lb/>
as well. The king's eldest son, Edward, afterwards <lb/>
known as the Black Prince, was two years younger <lb/>
<pb n="28" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0036"/>
than she, and growing up together, they seem to have <lb/>
learnt to love one another.</p>
<p>It was natural that Joan, who is described as the <lb/>
most beautiful and the most lovable of all the maidens <lb/>
of England, should have had many suitors. Her heart <lb/>
was won by Sir Thomas Holland, but whilst he was <lb/>
away at the wars, the Earl of Salisbury tried to win <lb/>
her as his wife. When Holland came back he petitioned <lb/>
the Pope to affirm his right to Joan's hand, and after <lb/>
both sides had been heard, judgment was given that <lb/>
Joan was the wife of Holland. She was then just <lb/>
twenty-one, and shortly afterwards, as both her brothers <lb/>
died, she became her father's heiress and Countess <lb/>
of Kent. Her husband was given various appointments <lb/>
in France, and Joan went there with him several times. <lb/>
She always surrounded herself with luxury of every <lb/>
kind and spent a great deal of money on dress. Holland <lb/>
died in 1360 leaving her still beautiful and charming, <lb/>
with three children. She was at once sought in marriage <lb/>
by many suitors, but she would listen to none of them. <lb/>
An old writer tells us that one day the Black Prince <lb/>
visited her and tried to persuade her to accept one of <lb/>
these suitors, who was a friend of his. She constantly <lb/>
refused, and at last answered, weeping, that she had <lb/>
given herself to the most noble knight under heaven, <lb/>
and that for love of him she would have no other <lb/>
husband as long as she lived, but that she knew that <lb/>
he could never be hers.</p>
<p>Then the Prince implored her to tell him who this <lb/>
most noble knight was, and when she would not <lb/>
speak, he went down on his knees saying that if she <lb/>
would not tell him, he would be her mortal enemy. <lb/>
At last he wrung from her the confession that it <lb/>
was he himself whom she meant, and when he heard <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0037"/>
this, he was filled with love for her, and vowed that he <lb/>
would never have any other wife so long as he lived. <lb/>
Edward was then thirty years of age, and had <reg orig="re-|fused">refused</reg> <lb/>
many princely offers of marriage. Perhaps he <lb/>
had never forgotten the beautiful cousin who had grown <lb/>
up with him, and now when she was free he rejoiced <lb/>
to make her his. It is said that Edward III. was very <lb/>
displeased when he heard that his son had made a <lb/>
marriage contract with Joan, but that Queen Philippa, <lb/>
who had always loved her tenderly, took their part. <lb/>
However this may be, we know that they were married <lb/>
by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Windsor, in the <lb/>
presence of the King, only ten months after the death <lb/>
of Joan's first husband. The marriage took place in <lb/>
October, and they went afterwards to the Prince's castle <lb/>
at Berkhamsted, where they spent Christmas.</p>
<p>In those days a great part of France was under the <lb/>
rule of the King of England, and the knights and nobles <lb/>
of the fair Duchy of Aquitaine which had belonged to <lb/>
the kings of England since the day when it had come to <lb/>
Henry II. through his wife Eleanor, asked Edward III. <lb/>
to send his son to rule over them. The Black Prince <lb/>
was famous for his courage and for the great victories <lb/>
he had won in battle against the King of France. <lb/>
Edward III. thought it only right that his son should <lb/>
have a distinguished position, and he appointed him <lb/>
Prince of Aquitaine. Then the Black Prince and Joan <lb/>
made great preparations for their departure, for they <lb/>
were determined to have a magnificent court in <lb/>
Aquitaine and to take with them many English knights <lb/>
and nobles. The English Parliament found it difficult <lb/>
to provide the large sums of money needed for the <lb/>
luxurious lives of Edward III. and his sons. It was <lb/>
hoped that Aquitaine would be able to provide for <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0038"/>
the needs of the Black Prince and his wife. But they <lb/>
spent so much before their departure in entertaining <lb/>
the King and court for Christmas at their castle, and <lb/>
in supplying themselves with clothes and furniture <lb/>
and all things needed for their journey, that they left <lb/>
England deeply in debt.</p>
<p>Early in the year 1363, they landed at La Rochelle <lb/>
and were received by a great company of knights and <lb/>
gentlemen who welcomed them with much joy. Four <lb/>
days were spent at La Rochelle in feastings and <lb/>
merriment, and then they set out on their journey to <lb/>
Bordeaux. At every town through which they passed, <lb/>
they were received by all the nobles of the <reg orig="neighbour-|hood">neighbourhood</reg>, <lb/>
who crowded to do homage to the Prince.</p>
<p>Aquitaine was a rich and flourishing country, covered <lb/>
with vineyards, and carried on a vigorous wine trade <lb/>
with England. The Prince set up his court at Bordeaux, <lb/>
and it soon became the most brilliant court in Europe. <lb/>
Both the Prince and Princess were alike in being very <lb/>
extravagant and in loving fine clothes and merry-making. <lb/>
Those were the days of chivalry, when the knights were <lb/>
brave and courteous to one another, and loved jousts <lb/>
and tournaments in which they fought together in the <lb/>
presence of noble ladies, and the winner received the <lb/>
prize for his valour from the hand of a fair lady. But <lb/>
in their pursuit of pleasure, the princes and nobles <lb/>
forgot their duties as wise rulers. As long as they <lb/>
could win fame for themselves, and get enough money <lb/>
for their wars and their luxuries, they cared very little <lb/>
for the well-being of the people. In the Black Prince's <lb/>
court at Bordeaux, the pride and magnificence and <lb/>
neglect of the needs of the people which were the <lb/>
weakness of chivalry showed themselves most clearly.</p>
<p>The Black Prince was a noble host; he made every <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0039"/>
one around him happy. Eighty knights and four times <lb/>
as many squires feasted every day at his table. The <lb/>
princess never showed herself except surrounded by <lb/>
many ladies and fair maidens. The luxury of their dress, <lb/>
the strange new fashions in which their clothes were <lb/>
cut and their wonderful head-dresses embroidered <lb/>
<figure id="f5" rend="block" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0039">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">Knight Receiving his Helmet from Lady.</hi></head>
</figure>
with pearls shocked the people, who had been <reg orig="accus-|tomed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
to simpler and severer manners. The princess <lb/>
seems never to have remembered that the money <lb/>
to pay for all these luxuries had to be wrung by <reg orig="taxa-|tion">taxation</reg> <lb/>
from the people. In other ways she ever showed <lb/>
herself warm-hearted and generous, and herself on one <lb/>
occasion pleaded with one of the nobles to diminish the <lb/>
ransom due to him from a prisoner taken in war.</p>
<pb n="32" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0040"/>
<p>The joyous life at Bordeaux was crowned by the birth <lb/>
of a son. Soon afterwards there began to be talk of <lb/>
war with Spain, and it was decided that the Black <lb/>
Prince should lead an expedition there. Great was the <lb/>
despair of the princess when she heard that he was <lb/>
to go. The old chronicler tells us that she lamented <lb/>
bitterly, saying, "Alas! what will happen to me if I <lb/>
shall lose the true flower of gentleness, the flower of <lb/>
magnanimity&mdash;him who in the world has no equal for <lb/>
courage? I have no heart, no blood, no veins, but <lb/>
every member fails me when I think of his departure." <lb/>
But when the prince heard her lamentations, he <reg orig="com-|forted">comforted</reg> <lb/>
her and said, "Lady, cease your lament and be <lb/>
not dismayed, for God is able to do all things." He <lb/>
took his leave of her very tenderly and said, lovingly, <lb/>
"Lady, we shall meet again in such case that we shall <lb/>
have joy both we and all our friends; for my heart <lb/>
tells me this." Then they embraced with many tears, <lb/>
and all the dames and damsels of the court wept also, <lb/>
some weeping for their lovers, some for their husbands.</p>
<p>Shortly before the prince's departure, Joan had given <lb/>
birth to a second son, Richard, called Richard of <lb/>
Bordeaux, from the place of his birth, who afterwards <lb/>
became King Richard II. The Black Prince was away <lb/>
in Spain for a year. He was victorious in the war and on <lb/>
his return he was magnificently welcomed at Bordeaux. <lb/>
A solemn procession of priests bearing crosses came <lb/>
out to meet him, followed by the princess with her <lb/>
elder son then three years old, surrounded by her ladies <lb/>
and her knights. They were full of joy at their meeting, <lb/>
and after tenderly embracing they walked hand in <lb/>
hand to their palace.</p>
<p>For the moment all seemed happy, but it soon <lb/>
appeared that the prince had come back tired and <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0041"/>
worn out. He had succeeded in Spain, but the cause <lb/>
for which he had fought was not a just one. The <lb/>
people of Aquitaine were discontented because of the <lb/>
heavy taxes they had to pay to keep up his luxurious <lb/>
court. It seemed to his enemies a good moment to <lb/>
attack him, and the King of France, anxious to win <lb/>
back some of the lands that he had lost, declared war <lb/>
against the English.</p>
<p>When the war began, the Black Prince was helpless <lb/>
with illness. He was so furious with the French that <lb/>
he had himself carried in a litter to attack them, and, <lb/>
for the first time, he showed himself cruel to the people <lb/>
he conquered. Everything seemed to go wrong. Their <lb/>
eldest son died, to the great grief of the prince and <lb/>
princess, and at last the prince was so ill that he had <lb/>
to give up the command of his army to his brother, <lb/>
John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and return to <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg>. <lb/>
It was a sad coming home, very different from <lb/>
their joyous setting out for France. In England, too, <lb/>
things were going badly; the king was old, and the <lb/>
people were discontented because of the extravagance <lb/>
of the court and the nobles. The Black Prince and <lb/>
his wife retired to their castle at Berkhamsted. He <lb/>
was afflicted with a grievous malady and suffered <lb/>
terribly, but he interested himself in the affairs of the <lb/>
country and supported the Parliament, which was <lb/>
trying to remedy some of the abuses of the <reg orig="govern-|ment">government</reg>. <lb/>
In order to do this, he moved up to London to <lb/>
the royal palace at Westminster. It was there that <lb/>
he died after four years of illness and suffering. He <lb/>
commended his wife and his little son Richard to the <lb/>
care of his father and brothers, and begged his followers <lb/>
that as they had served him, so they would serve his <lb/>
little son. The princess was broken-hearted at her <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0042"/>
husband's death and bewailed herself with bitter <lb/>
tears and lamentations. She was named guardian of <lb/>
her little son Richard, who was then ten years old; <lb/>
he was made Prince of Wales and declared heir to <lb/>
the throne, and only a year passed before, at his <reg orig="grand-|father's">grandfather's</reg> <lb/>
death, he became King of England.</p>
<p>Those were anxious days in England. The country <lb/>
was worn out with the expenses of long wars and of <lb/>
an extravagant court. The people had suffered from <lb/>
a terrible pestilence called the Black Death. <reg orig="Every-|where">Everywhere</reg> <lb/>
there was want and scarcity, which led to bitter <lb/>
discontent. The boy king was surrounded by his <lb/>
uncles, ambitious men, who each wished to be the <lb/>
chief power in the country. His mother, the Princess <lb/>
Joan, does not seem to have had any ambition to take <lb/>
part in public affairs; we do not hear of her mixing <lb/>
herself up in any of the intrigues that went on round <lb/>
the little king; only once or twice she seems to have <lb/>
come forward to make peace. She is said to have <lb/>
been interested in the teaching of John Wiclif, a <lb/>
learned clergyman. Disgusted with the corruption of <lb/>
many of the clergy, he was trying to teach a purer <lb/>
faith, and he had translated the Bible into English so <lb/>
that even the unlearned might read it. But we hear so <lb/>
little about Joan that it is clear that she must have <lb/>
lived very quietly during these troubled days.</p>
<p>The discontent of the people at last led the peasants <lb/>
to rise in revolt in many different parts of the country, <lb/>
and to march on London in order to get redress for <lb/>
their wrongs. Princess Joan had been on a <reg orig="pilgrim-|age">pilgrimage</reg> <lb/>
to Canterbury, where the Black Prince lay buried, <lb/>
when, on her way back, she fell in on crossing <reg orig="Black-|heath">Blackheath</reg> <lb/>
with a crowd of the rebels. The rough men <lb/>
surrounded her, but the charm and beauty which she <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0043"/>
still possessed won their respect and the protection of <lb/>
their leaders. It is said that, after asking her for some <lb/>
kisses, they allowed her to pass on her way unharmed. <lb/>
She went to join her son in the Tower. Richard, then <lb/>
a boy of fifteen, was not frightened by the rebels, who <lb/>
swarmed round the Tower and asked that the king <lb/>
should come out and hear their grievances. He rode <lb/>
out with one or two followers and went to meet the <lb/>
rebels at Mile End, where he promised all that they <lb/>
asked him. But whilst he was away, another band of <lb/>
rebels broke into the Tower. They forced their <lb/>
way into the princess's room and treated her with <lb/>
rough familiarity and rudeness. They plunged daggers <lb/>
into her bed to see if anything was hidden there, and <lb/>
terrified her so much that she fainted. Then her ladies <lb/>
carried her away, and conveyed her in an open boat <lb/>
across the river to a house belonging to the king called <lb/>
the Wardrobe, and there Richard joined her. <reg orig="Mean-|while">Meanwhile</reg> <lb/>
the rebels had seized and murdered the <reg orig="Arch-|bishop">Archbishop</reg>, <lb/>
the chief minister of the king. In the end the <lb/>
rebels were put down after much bloodshed.</p>
<p>Richard II. seems to have had the charm and beauty <lb/>
of his mother, and as a boy at least, the courage of his <lb/>
father, but he did not grow up to be a wise king. He <lb/>
quarrelled with his powerful uncle, John of Gaunt, <lb/>
Duke of Lancaster, who was suspected of wishing to <lb/>
make himself king, and John, angry with his nephew, <lb/>
shut himself up in his castle at Pontefract. The <lb/>
Princess Joan was ill and had grown so stout that <lb/>
travelling was very difficult for her, but in spite of her <lb/>
sufferings she made several journeys to Pontefract to <lb/>
see John of Gaunt and at last succeeded in reconciling <lb/>
him with Richard. Richard treated her with great <lb/>
respect, and when he went away to make war in Scotland, <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0044"/>
he appointed five noble gentlemen to stay with her for <lb/>
her protection, wherever she chose to live. But she <lb/>
could not always persuade him to do as she wished. <lb/>
Her son by her first marriage, John Holland, had a <lb/>
quarrel with another gentleman and slew him <reg orig="treacher-|ously">treacherously</reg>. <lb/>
Richard to punish him seized his lands, and <lb/>
when Joan implored his pardon refused to listen to her. <lb/>
This so grieved her that she fell ill and died whilst <lb/>
Richard was still away in Scotland. In her will she <lb/>
asked to be buried near her first husband in the church <lb/>
at Stamford; and there on Richard's return her funeral <lb/>
took place. The quarrels between her son and his <lb/>
uncles which she had tried to heal grew worse after <lb/>
her death, till they ended in the deposition of Richard, <lb/>
and the choice of John of Gaunt's son, Henry, as king.</p>
<p>Joan was not in any way a great woman, but we feel <lb/>
that there must have been something uncommon about <lb/>
her beauty and her charm for the memory of it to <lb/>
have lasted as it did. It was some time after her <lb/>
death that the name of the Fair Maid of Kent was <lb/>
given her. She is an example of the great lady of <lb/>
those days, kindly, generous, loving brave men, trying <lb/>
to promote peace and kindliness, but extravagant and <lb/>
pleasure-seeking. No evil is told of her, and she seems <lb/>
to have loved both her husbands dearly and to have <lb/>
won their love in return.</p>

JEANNE D'ARC, THE MAID OF FRANCE</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">On</hi> January 6, probably in the year 1412, Jeanne d'Arc <lb/>
was born in Domremy, a little village in Lorraine, the <lb/>
great duchy which lies on the eastern frontier of France. <lb/>
Jeanne's father was a hard-working peasant. He owned <lb/>
horses and cattle and was one of the most respected <lb/>
inhabitants of his village. There were no village <lb/>
schools in those days and Jeanne never learnt to read <lb/>
and write. Her mother taught her the creed and her <lb/>
prayers, as well as sewing and the work about the <lb/>
house. Like other peasant girls she ploughed and <lb/>
worked in the fields and took care of the cattle. She <lb/>
played with the other children, and used to dance <lb/>
and weave garlands with them. Best of all she loved <lb/>
to go into the little church and pray, so that sometimes <lb/>
the other children laughed at her for her piety. She <lb/>
used to nurse the sick, and would even lie all night <lb/>
upon the hearth in order to give up her bed to some <lb/>
poor person.</p>
<p>France was at that time in a very troubled state. <lb/>
The whole land was divided into two parties, the <lb/>
Burgundians and the Armagnacs. The Burgundians <lb/>
had made friends with the English, who under Henry V. <lb/>
had conquered great part of France. Henry V. was <lb/>
dead, but his little son, Henry VI., had been crowned <lb/>
King of France, and his uncle, the Duke of Bedford, <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0046"/>
held Paris and many other towns in the north of <lb/>
France for him. The true King of France, Charles VII., <lb/>
had not been crowned yet, and many people still called <lb/>
him the Dauphin, the name by which the eldest son <lb/>
of the King of France used to be called. He was <lb/>
quite young, of a slow and lazy disposition, and had <lb/>
lost heart, and did not know how to meet the difficulties <lb/>
which surrounded him. News of the sad state of <lb/>
France must often have reached Domremy, brought <lb/>
by travellers of all kinds, pedlars, pilgrims, and <reg orig="wander-|ing">wandering</reg> <lb/>
friars, who carried the news in those days as the <lb/>
newspapers do now.</p>
<p>When Jeanne was about thirteen, at noon one <lb/>
summer's day, she was in her father's garden, when she <lb/>
suddenly saw a strange light and heard a voice <reg orig="speak-|ing">speaking</reg> <lb/>
to her. She was filled with fear and wondered <lb/>
what this could mean. But she believed that it was <lb/>
the voice of God that she heard, and after hearing it <lb/>
thrice, she knew it to be the voice of an angel. Twice <lb/>
or thrice a week she used to hear the voice. It told <lb/>
her to be good and to go often to church, and it also <lb/>
told her that she must go into France. Sometimes <lb/>
there were several voices, and she thought they were <lb/>
the voices of the Archangel Michael and of the Saints <lb/>
Margaret and Catherine. Sometimes she saw their <lb/>
visible shapes, Michael in armour, the Saints crowned <lb/>
with fair crowns. Their voices were beautiful, gentle, <lb/>
and sweet, and a delicate fragrance accompanied them. <lb/>
We cannot explain these visions. Jeanne herself <reg orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg> <lb/>
that she saw and heard the Saints, and that <lb/>
they guided her in all she had to do. After she had <lb/>
seen them, she grew still more devout in her prayers, <lb/>
but though again and again the voices told her to <lb/>
go into France, she waited from three to four years <lb/>

wondering what this could mean, and speaking to no <lb/>
one of the voices. In 1428, they told her to go to <lb/>
the governor of the neighbouring town, Vaucouleurs, <lb/>
and ask him for an armed escort into France, that <lb/>
she might save the town of Orleans, which was <reg orig="be-|sieged">besieged</reg> <lb/>
by the English. She answered, "I am a poor <lb/>
girl, who cannot ride or be a leader in war." But at <lb/>
last the day came when she felt that she could not <lb/>
resist the voices any more. She did not tell her father <lb/>
and mother, but she asked permission to visit a married <lb/>
cousin who lived near Vaucouleurs. Then she <reg orig="per-|suaded">persuaded</reg> <lb/>
her cousin's husband to take her to see the <lb/>
governor. The governor was a blunt, rough soldier, <lb/>
not at all likely to believe in Jeanne's mission. He <lb/>
could not be expected to think that an ignorant girl <lb/>
of sixteen could save France, and he seems only to <lb/>
have laughed at her. She went home not discouraged <lb/>
but quite clear in her mind that next year she would <lb/>
save the Dauphin, and take him to be crowned at <lb/>
Rheims, the city where the French kings had always <lb/>
been crowned.</p>
<p>In 1429 once more she went to Vaucouleurs. It was <lb/>
long before she could get the governor to listen, but her <lb/>
determination never wavered. She said, "I must be <lb/>
with the king by mid-lent if I wear my legs down to <lb/>
the knees." We do not know what at last prevailed <lb/>
upon the governor to let her go, but she found two <lb/>
men who believed in her mission who undertook to <lb/>
lead her to the king, and with them and their two <lb/>
servants she was allowed to start. By the advice of <lb/>
one of these friends, she decided to travel in a man's <lb/>
dress. She wore a tunic, with breeches and boots, and <lb/>
a page's cap. The people of Vaucouleurs gave her a <lb/>
horse. Her friends gathered to see her off, begging <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0049"/>
her not to go, and urging the dangers of the journey. <lb/>
But she answered, "The way is made clear before me. <lb/>
<figure id="f8" rend="block" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0049">

I have my Lord who makes the path smooth to the <lb/>
gentle Dauphin, for to do this deed I was born."</p>
<pb n="42" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0050"/>
<p>Jeanne met with no difficulties on her journey right <lb/>
across France to Chinon, where the king was. At first <lb/>
he would not see her, but at last she was brought into <lb/>
his presence, where he sat surrounded by fifty knights <lb/>
in a hall blazing with fifty torches. No one told her <lb/>
which was the king, but she knew neither fear nor <lb/>
doubt. One who was there says that she came forward <lb/>
with great humility and simplicity, and spoke to the <lb/>
king: "Most noble Lord Dauphin, I come from God <lb/>
to help you and your realm." The king drew her apart <lb/>
and spoke to her for a long time. She told him that <lb/>
she would drive away the English from before Orleans, <lb/>
and that she would lead him to be crowned, and she <lb/>
told him other things which were kept secret between <lb/>
him and her; what they were she would never tell.</p>
<p>The king seemed to those who were watching to <lb/>
rejoice at what he heard, but he was always slow to <lb/>
move. He had to wait and consult many people and <lb/>
test the Maid in many ways to find out whether he <lb/>
might trust her, before he would let her do as she <lb/>
wished. In vain Jeanne prayed and wept, longing to be <lb/>
allowed to bring help to the people of Orleans. She was <lb/>
taken to the city of Poitiers and questioned by learned <lb/>
men. She was so bothered by their many questions <lb/>
that when one asked, "Do you believe in God?" she <lb/>
answered, "More firmly than you do." It was six <lb/>
weeks before it was decided that she might be trusted, <lb/>
and allowed to go to Orleans. Then a suit of steel <lb/>
armour was made for her. She wished to wear a <lb/>
special sword which she said that her voices had told <lb/>
her would be found behind the altar at a little church <lb/>
near Tours. It was found as she had said, covered with <lb/>
rust, which however came off easily when they began <lb/>
to clean it. The people of Tours gave her two splendid <lb/>

</figure>
<pb n="44" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0052"/>
sheaths, one of red velvet and one of cloth of gold for <lb/>
the sword. In her hand she carried her standard, <lb/>
which was white, with angels painted on it and the <lb/>
motto "Jesus Maria." She never used her sword and <lb/>
never killed any one herself. Several men were chosen <lb/>
as her attendants and her two brothers joined her.</p>
<p>When Jeanne was with the army, twice every day <lb/>
she gathered the priests who were there round her <lb/>
banner, and they prayed and sang hymns; men learnt <lb/>
to behave better for her presence. As she neared <lb/>
Orleans, Dunois one of the chief men in the French <lb/>
army, came out to meet her, and said that he was right <lb/>
glad of her coming. With him she made her way into <lb/>
Orleans past the English army. She entered the city <lb/>
by night lest the crowd should be too great; but many <lb/>
bearing torches came to meet her, and men, women, <lb/>
and children pressed lovingly around her. Her business <lb/>
now was to attack the forts which the English had built <lb/>
outside the town. But before she would allow this to <lb/>
be done, she insisted that the English should thrice <lb/>
be summoned to depart in peace. In her clear young <lb/>
voice &lpar;she was only seventeen&rpar; she cried to them across <lb/>
the river, and they shouted back insulting words saying <lb/>
they would burn her if they caught her. But just as <lb/>
Jeanne's coming had filled the French soldiers with <lb/>
new hope and courage, so it had terrified the English. <lb/>
They did not dare attack that slim figure in shining <lb/>
armour. At last the French from the other side began <lb/>
to attack the English forts. Jeanne, worn out, was <lb/>
resting on her bed, she did not know that the fighting <lb/>
had begun. But suddenly she woke with a cry saying <lb/>
that she must go against the English. Quickly her <lb/>
armour was buckled on, she sprang on her horse and <lb/>
was off. On the next five days there was fighting with <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0053"/>
the English, except on Ascension day, when Jeanne <lb/>
would not allow any one to go out. On the last day, the <lb/>
chief of the English forts was attacked and Jeanne <lb/>
led the attack. At noon as she mounted the first <lb/>
scaling ladder set against the wall, an arrow struck her <lb/>
shoulder, piercing her armour. She shrank and wept, <lb/>
but she barely paused to have her wound stanched, <lb/>
and went back to the front. When the sun was <lb/>
sinking and men doubted whether the fort could be <lb/>
taken, her voice was heard crying, "Doubt not, the <lb/>
place is ours." Her faithful followers rallied round her, <lb/>
and one seized her standard and dashed forwards. <lb/>
"Watch," Jeanne said, "till the tail of my standard <lb/>
touches the wall." When it did she said, "Then enter; <lb/>
all is yours." The last terrible assault carried all before <lb/>
it, and the fort was won. When Jeanne saw close at <lb/>
hand the terrors of war, she knelt weeping and praying <lb/>
for the souls of her enemies. Her first act was to go <lb/>
to the church and give thanks, after that she had her <lb/>
wound dressed.</p>
<p>A few days after this glorious victory, Jeanne went <lb/>
with Dunois to visit the Dauphin. Her good sense, <lb/>
which was one of the causes of her wonderful success, <lb/>
made her wish to press on to Rheims; besides her voices <lb/>
had told her that she would only have one year in <lb/>
which to do her work, and she was eager to get on. But <lb/>
the Dauphin hesitated and listened to other advice. <lb/>
"Noble Dauphin," Jeanne pleaded, "hold not such <lb/>
long and wordy councils, but come at once to Rheims <lb/>
and be worthily crowned." She could not persuade <lb/>
him to make haste, and the next month she spent in <lb/>
taking other places from the English. A young noble saw <lb/>
her at that time and wrote to his mother: "To see her <lb/>
and hear her speak, she seems a thing wholly divine."</p>
<pb n="46" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0054"/>
<p>At last her persistence was rewarded, and the Dauphin <lb/>
agreed to march to Rheims. The towns on their way <lb/>
yielded to him, or rather to Jeanne; it was she who <lb/>
ever filled her friends with courage and her foes with <lb/>
fear. Rheims opened its gates to them, and preparations <lb/>
were at once made for the coronation. When Charles <lb/>
was crowned in the great cathedral, the Maid stood <lb/>
next him with her standard in her hand, and when all <lb/>
was over she knelt, embracing his knees and weeping <lb/>
for joy, saying, "Gentle King, now is accomplished the <lb/>
will of God, who decreed that I should raise the siege of <lb/>
Orleans and bring you to this city of Rheims to receive <lb/>
your solemn sacring, thereby showing that you are the <lb/>
true king, and that France should be yours." In less <lb/>
than three months she had accomplished what she had <lb/>
set out from her village to do.</p>
<p>Jeanne had hoped that the day after the coronation, <lb/>
the king would set out for Paris, which was in the <lb/>
hands of his enemies. But again there were delays; <lb/>
Charles consented to make a truce of fifteen days with <lb/>
his enemies. Jeanne's good sense showed her what a <lb/>
mistake this was. Weary of the struggle, she longed <lb/>
that it might be God's pleasure for her to lay down her <lb/>
arms and return to keep her father and mother's sheep. <lb/>
But she would not leave her task. It was nearly six <lb/>
weeks before she was allowed to go against Paris, and <lb/>
she was so badly supported, that in spite of her great <lb/>
courage the attack failed. Once she stood all day in <lb/>
the ditch under the wall in the heat of the fire calling <lb/>
on the enemy to yield, till she was shot in the leg. <lb/>
Then when her men carried her under cover, though <lb/>
she could not move for her wound, she kept on crying <lb/>
out to them to charge, and telling them that the place <lb/>
was theirs if they would. But it was of no avail. Three <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0055"/>
days after the king decided to retreat and go back to <lb/>
<figure id="f10" rend="block" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0055">

</figure>
the Loire. During most of the following winter there <lb/>
was little fighting, but in the spring once more Jeanne <lb/>
<pb n="48" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0056"/>
began to advance on Paris. It was then, one day in <lb/>
Easter week, that her voices told her that she would be <lb/>
captured before Midsummer day, adding that she must <lb/>
take all things well for God would help her. So they <lb/>
warned her every day, but never told her the hour of <lb/>
her captivity. Yet with this terrible fate before her, <lb/>
she rode on; she knew no turning back. A few weeks <lb/>
afterwards she was at Compiegne and led her men <lb/>
out against the enemy. They were surprised by an <reg orig="un-|expected">unexpected</reg> <lb/>
attack as they rode. Thrice Jeanne charged, <lb/>
and drove back the enemy, but more and more soldiers <lb/>
came up; most of Jeanne's men fled, only a few faithful <lb/>
ones stayed with her. The enemy surrounded them <lb/>
and Jeanne was forced from her horse, and carried off. <lb/>
Great was the joy of the English and their French friend, <lb/>
the Duke of Burgundy, when they heard that Jeanne <lb/>
was a prisoner. She was in the hands of a French <lb/>
noble of the English party, and was treated as a prisoner <lb/>
of war, but her enemies planned to sell her to the <lb/>
English, who had always said they would burn her if <lb/>
they could get her. Meanwhile she was kept in the <lb/>
castle of Beaurevoir, and kindly treated by the ladies of <lb/>
the castle. They wished her to lay aside her man's dress, <lb/>
but she refused, saying that she had not yet had leave <lb/>
from God. She did not feel that her mission was ended. <lb/>
She was much distressed by the stories that she heard <lb/>
of the sufferings of the people of Compiegne, the town <lb/>
which she was trying to relieve when she was taken <lb/>
prisoner. She longed to go and help them. She knew, <lb/>
too, that she was to be sold to the English and she <lb/>
dreaded falling into their hands. So one night she <lb/>
tried to escape by leaping from the tower, a height of <lb/>
sixty feet. She was found lying insensible in the ditch, <lb/>
but with no bones broken. She said afterwards that <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0057"/>
<figure id="f11" rend="page" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0057">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">The Coronation of Charles</hi> VII.</head>
</figure>
<pb n="50" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0058"/>
her voices had bidden her not to leap and had told her <lb/>
that Compiegne would be saved. Now the voices <reg orig="com-|forted">comforted</reg> <lb/>
her, bidding her beg God's pardon for having <lb/>
leaped.</p>
<p>Jeanne soon recovered from her injuries, and <reg orig="Com-|piegne">Compiegne</reg> <lb/>
was indeed relieved, but the Maid was sold to <lb/>
the English after she had been some four months a <lb/>
prisoner. She was carried to several different places, <lb/>
and at last to Rouen, where she was imprisoned in the <lb/>
castle with rough, rude men to guard her. No woman <lb/>
was allowed to come near her; she was kept in chains, <lb/>
and night and day had to endure the company of the <lb/>
soldiers. It was because she still hoped that some way <lb/>
of escape might be shown her, that she would not give <lb/>
her promise not to try to escape. Had she done so, <lb/>
she might have been more kindly treated; but her great <lb/>
courage made her ready to bear anything, rather than <lb/>
give up the chance of going back to her task.</p>
<p>Jeanne was to be tried by the Church, because the <lb/>
plan of the English was to treat her as a witch inspired <lb/>
by devils. A French bishop, belonging to the English <lb/>
party, was the chief of her judges, and with him sat <reg orig="forty-|three">forty-three</reg> <lb/>
learned lawyers and clergy to judge the peasant <lb/>
girl of eighteen, before whom the English army had <lb/>
shrunk in terror. The Maid had already been nine <lb/>
months a prisoner when she was brought to trial. She <lb/>
appeared dressed in a black suit like a page, strong in <lb/>
her confidence in the guidance of God, and trusting <lb/>
in her voices to tell her what to answer. The judges <lb/>
could not make her swear to answer truthfully all <lb/>
their questions. She swore to speak the truth on <lb/>
certain subjects, but on others, chiefly on her private <lb/>
communications to the king, she said she would say <lb/>
nothing. First, for six long days she was questioned in <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0059"/>
the public court, the ignorant peasant girl alone amongst <lb/>
her enemies. She never faltered, her answers came <lb/>
quick and ready, though often her judges wearied her <lb/>
by going again and again over the same points. When <lb/>
they asked if she often heard her voices, she said that <lb/>
there was no day when she did not hear them, and she <lb/>
had great need of them. She described once how the <lb/>
voice had awakened her, and she had risen and sat on <lb/>
her bed with folded hands to listen and to give thanks <lb/>
for its coming. Always she showed that all that she <lb/>
had done had been done at the bidding of God. "I <lb/>
would rather have been torn in pieces by four horses <lb/>
than have come into France without God's command," <lb/>
she said. She stated confidently her belief that her <lb/>
king would gain the kingdom of France, adding that <lb/>
it was this revelation that comforted her every day. <lb/>
She never complained, and said that since it had <lb/>
pleased God to allow it, she believed that it was best <lb/>
that she should have been taken. She said that her <lb/>
voices encouraged her to bear her martyrdom patiently, <lb/>
for she would at last come to the heavenly kingdom. <lb/>
When she was asked what she meant by speaking of <lb/>
her martyrdom, she answered that she meant the pains <lb/>
she suffered in prison, and that she thought it probable <lb/>
she would have pains still greater to bear.</p>
<p>For six days she was publicly examined in court, and <lb/>
later, on nine other days, she was secretly examined in <lb/>
prison. During all this time, in spite of her constant <lb/>
entreaties, she was not allowed to hear Mass. On her <lb/>
way to the court she passed in front of a little chapel <lb/>
and she used to kneel to pray at the entrance till <lb/>
even this was forbidden. When at last her <reg orig="examina-|tion">examination</reg> <lb/>
was finished, a long statement was drawn up in <lb/>
which Jeanne was declared to be a witch and a heretic <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0060"/>
and accused of many evil deeds. These accusations <lb/>
were sent to many learned men for their opinion, and <lb/>
all declared that Jeanne's voices were either <reg orig="inven-|tions">inventions</reg> <lb/>
or the work of the devil, and that she was a <lb/>
liar. Meanwhile her judges visited her in prison and <lb/>
exhorted her to submit and own that she had been <lb/>
deceived. It was nearly two months since the <reg orig="be-|ginning">beginning</reg> <lb/>
of her trial. Long sermons were preached at <lb/>
her; she was confused by many questions, difficult for <lb/>
an ignorant girl to answer, and told that it was her duty <lb/>
to submit to the Church. Again and again she <lb/>
answered simply, "I submit to God my Creator." <lb/>
She was ill and worn out with suffering and anxiety. <lb/>
But as she lay upon her bed in prison, she still <lb/>
answered bravely through her weariness, "Come what <lb/>
may, I will do or say no other thing." For a week <lb/>
she lay in her chains, the rude soldiers always with <lb/>
her. Then again others visited her urging her to <lb/>
confess, but she said, "If I saw the fire lit, if I were <lb/>
in the flames, I would say no other thing."</p>
<p>To the last she had hoped that deliverance would <lb/>
come somehow, but now it seemed to her that she was <lb/>
altogether deserted. On the 24th of May she was <lb/>
taken out to the stake in the market-place at Rouen, <lb/>
amongst a shouting crowd of hostile people. There <lb/>
a statement of the accusations against her was read <lb/>
out, and she said that she was willing to do as the <lb/>
Church ordered, and that since the doctors of the <lb/>
Church had decided that her visions and voices were <lb/>
not to be believed in, she would not defend them. <lb/>
She was bidden to sign a paper to this effect, and told <lb/>
that if she did so her life would be spared. We do not <lb/>
know what the paper was that at last Jeanne in her <lb/>
fear and weariness, consented to sign with her mark, <lb/>
<pb n="53" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0061"/>
and we do not know whether she understood what <lb/>
she signed. But a few days afterwards she said, "My <lb/>
voices have told me since that I greatly sinned in <lb/>
that deed, in confessing that I had done ill. What <lb/>
I said, I said in fear of fire."</p>
<p>Jeanne was now handed over to the Church to spend <lb/>
her life in prison. She cried, "Here, some of you <lb/>
church folk, take me to your prisons, and out of the <lb/>
hands of the English." But her judge sent her back to <lb/>
the same horrible prison with the English soldiers. A <lb/>
woman's dress was brought her and she was bidden to <lb/>
wear it. For three days she lay in prison with her legs <lb/>
in irons and chained to a wooden beam. We do not <lb/>
know exactly what happened, but on the third day, <lb/>
it was announced that Jeanne was again wearing the <lb/>
man's dress which she had sworn to her judges that <lb/>
she would not wear again. News was at once taken to <lb/>
the judges that she had relapsed, and they hurried to <lb/>
ask her the reason. She pleaded that it was more <reg orig="con-|venient">convenient</reg> <lb/>
to wear men's dress among men, and said, "I <lb/>
would rather die than remain in irons. If you will <lb/>
release me, and let me go to Mass and lie in gentle <lb/>
prison, I will be good and do what the Church desires." <lb/>
But there was no pity for her. It was decided that she <lb/>
must be given up by the Church to the English to be <lb/>
burnt. It is said that Jeanne cried piteously and tore <lb/>
her hair when she was told her fate. If so, she soon <lb/>
regained her courage. Her last desire was granted her; <lb/>
she was allowed to receive the sacrament. Then she <lb/>
was led out to the market-place, weeping as she went, <lb/>
so that she so moved the hearts of those who were with <lb/>
her and they also wept. She had to wait in the sight <lb/>
of a great crowd whilst a sermon was preached at her. <lb/>
When it was over, she humbly asked forgiveness of all <lb/>
<pb n="54" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0062"/>
and said that she forgave the evil that had been done <lb/>
her. Some who watched were moved to tears, but others <lb/>
were impatient to get away to dinner; so the bailiff said <lb/>
"Away with her." Then Jeanne was led to the scaffold <lb/>
piled with faggots. She climbed it bravely, but asked <lb/>
<figure id="f12" rend="block" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0062">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">The burning of Jeanne.</hi></head>
</figure>
for a cross to hold as she burnt. There was none for <lb/>
her, till an English soldier broke his staff and made a <lb/>
little cross and gave it her. She kissed it and cried to <lb/>
her Saviour for help. To the last she affirmed that <lb/>
she was sure that her voices had come from God and <lb/>
had not deceived her. As she was being chained to <lb/>
the stake, she said, "Ah, Rouen, I fear greatly that <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0063"/>
thou mayst have to suffer for my death." Then as the <lb/>
smoke rose round her, she cried upon the Saints who <lb/>
had befriended her, and with a last strong cry "Jesus," <lb/>
her head sank and she was free from her pain.</p>
<p>The story of Jeanne, the Maid of France, seems too <lb/>
wonderful to be true; but all that we know about her is <lb/>
taken from the words of those who knew and saw her, <lb/>
and from her own words at her trial, recorded not by <lb/>
her friends but by her enemies. It is by her own <lb/>
words that we know her best, and they show us her <lb/>
pure nature, her marvellous courage, her perfect <reg orig="devo-|tion">devotion</reg> <lb/>
to the task given to her. We cannot explain what <lb/>
her voices were, but we know that she believed she <lb/>
heard them, and that somehow this simple peasant <lb/>
maid was taught how to save her king. She <reg orig="accom-|plished">accomplished</reg> <lb/>
her task. It was she who gave the French <lb/>
courage in their hour of despair, and in the end the <lb/>
English were driven out of the land and Charles VII. <lb/>
became king of the whole of France.</p>

MARGARET BEAUFORT</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was in the beginning of the troubled times of the <lb/>
Wars of the Roses that Margaret Beaufort was born. <lb/>
Her father, the Duke of Somerset, was one of the great <lb/>
nobles on the Lancastrian side. He was the grandson <lb/>
of John of Gaunt, son of Edward III., and Duke of <lb/>
Lancaster, who had married a rich and noble heiress. <lb/>
Margaret was born in 1441 in her mother's manor of <lb/>
Bletsoe in Bedfordshire. Only three years after her <lb/>
birth her father died, and the little girl, his only child, <lb/>
was left heiress to vast estates and riches. She passed <lb/>
the early years of her life at Bletsoe with her mother. <lb/>
Great care seems to have been given to Margaret's <lb/>
education. It was not common in those days for girls <lb/>
even to be taught to write, but Margaret was bred in <lb/>
studious habits. She knew French perfectly, and also <lb/>
some Latin, but in later life regretted that she had not <lb/>
been able to gain a fuller knowledge of that language. <lb/>
She was very clever with her needle and is known to <lb/>
have executed beautiful embroidery. Above all she <lb/>
was well taught in religion and trained in habits of <lb/>
piety. But the condition of a great heiress was far <lb/>
from agreeable in those days. It was the custom to <lb/>
give her to some great noble as his ward, and he then <lb/>
had the right to arrange for her marriage as he liked. <lb/>
When Margaret was nine years old, the king gave her <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0065"/>
as ward to the Duke of Suffolk, one of the most powerful <lb/>
men of the time, and he had her brought to court, <lb/>

and wished to marry her to his son. But the king, <lb/>
Henry VI., wanted her to marry his half-brother, <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0066"/>
Edmund Tudor, Earl of Richmond. Margaret was <lb/>
puzzled by these different proposals, and asked the <lb/>
advice of an old lady whom she dearly loved. The old <lb/>
lady bade her ask St. Nicholas, a saint who was thought <lb/>
to care specially for young girls, to help her in this <lb/>
difficult matter. Margaret prayed often to St. Nicholas, <lb/>
and one night, whether she was awake or asleep she <lb/>
did not know, St. Nicholas in the dress of a bishop <lb/>
appeared before her and told her to take Edmund <lb/>
Tudor as her husband. This dream seems to have <lb/>
decided the choice of her mother, and as shortly <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
the Duke of Suffolk fell into disgrace, it came <lb/>
about that Margaret was allowed to marry Edmund <lb/>
Tudor, when she was not quite fifteen years old. After <lb/>
her marriage she went with her husband to live at his <lb/>
castle of Pembroke in Wales, his native country. Only <lb/>
a year afterwards he died, and a few weeks after his <lb/>
death her son Henry was born. At the age of sixteen, <lb/>
only a child herself, she was left a widow, with a child <lb/>
to take care of.</p>
<p>The baby was small and weakly and to it Margaret <lb/>
gave all her care. It was an anxious time for the <lb/>
members of the Lancastrian family. Their rivals the <lb/>
Yorkists were beginning to rise into power, and the <lb/>
little Henry, both on account of his great possessions <lb/>
and because through his descent from John of Gaunt <lb/>
he was so nearly related to King Henry VI., was not <lb/>
likely to find them friendly to him and his mother. <lb/>
Margaret was glad to stay in quiet seclusion at <reg orig="Pem-|broke">Pembroke</reg> <lb/>
Castle under the protection of Jasper Tudor, her <lb/>
husband's brother, now owner of the castle.</p>
<p>Even had he wished, Henry VI. could not have <lb/>
befriended her. He was powerless, sometimes in the <lb/>
hands of those who called themselves his friends, <lb/>
<pb n="59" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0067"/>
sometimes flying before his enemies, whilst the country <lb/>
was distracted with the struggles of the Yorkists and <lb/>
the Lancastrians. Margaret thought it best to seek <lb/>
a protector for herself and her son by marrying Lord <lb/>
Henry Stafford. When Henry VI. was in power she <lb/>
and her son were able to visit the court, but at other <lb/>
times she was only safe in her castle in Wales. At <lb/>
last Edward of York became king as Edward IV. and <lb/>
Henry VI. was cast as a prisoner into the Tower. <lb/>
Edward IV. seized the lands belonging to the little <lb/>
Henry, and his mother feared lest even his life might <lb/>
not be safe, so she was willing that he should escape <lb/>
to France under the care of his uncle Jasper.</p>
<p>Henry was then fourteen. Margaret had watched <lb/>
anxiously over his delicate childhood, moving him <lb/>
about to different places in Wales for the good of his <lb/>
health. He was an intelligent boy, and once when his <lb/>
uncle Jasper had taken him to court to see Henry VI., <lb/>
the king is reported to have said, when he looked at <lb/>
him, "Surely this is he to whom both we and our <lb/>
adversaries shall hereafter give place." His tutor said <lb/>
that he had never seen a boy of so much quickness in <lb/>
learning. But now the poor boy had to leave his <lb/>
mother and his country. The wind drove him and <lb/>
Jasper to land on the coast of Brittany, and when the <lb/>
Duke of Brittany heard of their arrival, he ordered <lb/>
them to be brought to his castle at Vannes. There he <lb/>
kept Henry as a sort of prisoner, but refused to give <lb/>
him up to Edward IV., and though not allowed to <lb/>
leave Vannes, he was at least safe.</p>
<p>For fourteen years Henry was obliged to remain in <lb/>
Brittany, separated from his mother. The Yorkist <lb/>
king, Edward IV., was on the throne, and Margaret, <lb/>
separated from her son, lived as quietly as possible on <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0068"/>
her estates in the country, anxious to save what <lb/>
she could of her money and her lands for Henry. <lb/>
She seems to have stayed in different parts of the <lb/>
country. Wherever she lived, she devoted herself to <lb/>
the care of the poor <lb/>
and the good of the <lb/>
Church. Staying at <lb/>
one of her houses in <lb/>
Devonshire, she found <lb/>
that the priest's house <lb/>
was at some distance <lb/>
from the church so <lb/>
that he had some way <lb/>
to walk to and fro. She <lb/>
therefore presented to <lb/>
the church for ever <lb/>
her own manor-house, <lb/>
with the land around <lb/>
it, for the priest's use, <lb/>
as it was close to the <lb/>
church. She lived <lb/>
chiefly at Collyweston <lb/>
in Northamptonshire, <lb/>
where she built herself <lb/>
a fine house. She was <lb/>
deeply religious, and <lb/>
during these long years <lb/>
she spent much of her <lb/>
time in prayer. She used to get up at five o'clock and <lb/>
spend the hours till ten, which was in those days the <lb/>
hour for dinner, in meditation and prayer. The rest of <lb/>
the day she spent partly in ministering to the wants of <lb/>
the poor and sick, partly in study. Books in those <lb/>
days, just before the introduction of printing, were scarce <lb/>

and precious. Margaret busied herself with translating <lb/>
into English some books of devotion from the French. <lb/>
Amongst other things she was the first to translate into <lb/>
English part of that famous book, "The Imitation," by <lb/>
Thomas &agrave; Kempis, which has helped and comforted so <lb/>
many people. We know little of her second husband, <lb/>
and do not know how much he was with her. He <lb/>
died after they had been married twenty-two years, <lb/>
and in his will he spoke of Margaret with warm love <lb/>
and trust. Shortly after his death, Margaret married <lb/>
for a third time, Lord Stanley, himself a widower with <lb/>
a large family, and one of the most powerful nobles at <lb/>
the court of Edward IV. In those days great people <lb/>
married more from policy than from love. Margaret <lb/>
probably felt that, now that it seemed as if the power <lb/>
of the Yorkists was established, it would be well for <lb/>
her to gain the protection of a powerful noble at court, <lb/>
who might in time help to make it possible for her <lb/>
son to return to England. She now left her quiet life <lb/>
and came to live in a great house in London belonging <lb/>
to her husband. Very shortly afterwards everything <lb/>
was changed by the unexpected death of Edward IV. <lb/>
When his brother, the Duke of Gloucester, made <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
king as Richard III., and caused his little nephews <lb/>
to be murdered in the Tower, there was such discontent <lb/>
in England that it seemed to the friends of the house <lb/>
of Lancaster a good opportunity to destroy the Yorkist <lb/>
power.</p>
<p>Margaret's son Henry, as the descendant of John <lb/>
of Gaunt, was the chief representative of the house <lb/>
of Lancaster. A plan was made to make him king <lb/>
and marry him to Elizabeth, the beautiful young <lb/>
daughter of Edward IV. The Duke of Buckingham, <lb/>
one of the chief nobles of the time and till now a <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0070"/>
friend and supporter of Richard III., was one of the <lb/>
chief movers in this plot. Margaret was travelling one <lb/>
day on the road between Bridgnorth and Worcester, <lb/>
on her way to visit a special shrine at Worcester, when <lb/>
she chanced to meet <lb/>
the Duke of <reg orig="Buck-|ingham">Buckingham</reg>, <lb/>
journeying <lb/>
from Tewkesbury. He <lb/>
told her of the <reg orig="pro-|posed">proposed</reg> <lb/>
plot, and she <lb/>
was naturally eager <lb/>
to help in anything <lb/>
which might bring <lb/>
back her son to her. <lb/>
Reginald Bray, a <reg orig="dis-|creet">discreet</reg> <lb/>
man, who was <lb/>
in Margaret's service <lb/>
and helped in <reg orig="look-|ing">looking</reg> <lb/>
after her estates, <lb/>
was employed in <lb/>
communicating with <lb/>
Henry. The young <lb/>
prince found many <lb/>
friends, and a fleet <lb/>
was got together to <lb/>
bring him to <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg>. <lb/>
But after he <lb/>
had started, a mighty <lb/>
storm arose, scattered his ships, and drove him back <lb/>
to the coast of France with such fury that he narrowly <lb/>
escaped with his life. For the moment all seemed <lb/>
lost. Richard III.'s suspicions were thoroughly aroused. <lb/>
He knew that Margaret had been communicating with <lb/>
her son, and he was very angry with her. But he did <lb/>

not dare to anger her powerful husband, Lord Stanley, <lb/>
by treating her too severely. He bade Stanley keep <lb/>
her safely in some secret place at home, without any <lb/>
servant or company, so that she might have no means <lb/>
of communicating with her son. Stanley himself <lb/>
was really in Henry's <lb/>
favour, and Richard <lb/>
beginning to suspect <lb/>
him seized his eldest <lb/>
son and kept him <lb/>
as a hostage for his <lb/>
father.</p>

</figure>
<p>Somehow <reg orig="commu-|nications">communications</reg> <lb/>
with Henry <lb/>
still went on, and in <lb/>
1485 he landed in <lb/>
Wales, and all men <lb/>
flocked to join him. <lb/>
Stanley, who pretended <lb/>
to keep true to Richard <lb/>
to the last, deserted <lb/>
him just before the <lb/>
battle of Bosworth, <lb/>
where Richard was <lb/>
utterly defeated and <lb/>
killed. His crown was <lb/>
found hanging in a <lb/>
bush by Reginald Bray and brought to Stanley, who <lb/>
placed it on the head of Henry crying, "Long live King <lb/>
Henry VII." It seems likely that Henry first met <lb/>
his mother at Leicester after the battle. She had <lb/>
parted from him fifteen years before, when he was a <lb/>
boy of fourteen, she met him again as King of England. <lb/>
The right that Henry had to the throne came to <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0072"/>
him through his mother. She might have claimed <lb/>
to be queen herself, but she never thought of doing <lb/>
this, nor did she try to take any part in public affairs. <lb/>
Of course all her lands were restored to her, and she <lb/>
was called at court "the full noble Princess Margaret, <lb/>
Countess of Richmond, <lb/>
Mother of our <reg orig="Sove-|reign">Sovereign</reg> <lb/>
Lord the King." <lb/>
She now for the most <lb/>
part lived at her manor <lb/>
of Woking in Surrey, <lb/>
coming to court only <lb/>
on important <reg orig="occa-|sions">occasions</reg>. <lb/>
Henry <reg orig="mar-|ried">married</reg> <lb/>
Elizabeth, the <lb/>
tall golden-haired <lb/>
daughter of Edward <lb/>
IV., a few months after <lb/>
he became king, and <lb/>
Margaret seems to <lb/>
have been with her <lb/>
on all important <reg orig="occa-|sions">occasions</reg>. <lb/>
Perhaps she may <lb/>
have domineered over <lb/>
her a little too much, <lb/>
for the Spanish envoy <lb/>
reported to his court that Elizabeth "was a very noble <lb/>
woman and much beloved, but that she was kept in <reg orig="sub-|jection">subjection</reg> <lb/>
by her mother-in-law, the Countess of Richmond." <lb/>
At any rate, Margaret was by her side on all great <reg orig="occa-|sions">occasions</reg>. <lb/>
Together they watched from behind a lattice <lb/>
the coronation of Henry in Westminster Abbey, and <lb/>
the banquet afterwards in Westminster Hall. Together <lb/>
they went in state in a barge to Greenwich to see a <lb/>

water f&ecirc;te arranged by the Lord Mayor in honour of <lb/>
the king's coronation, where, among other shows, they <lb/>
watched a dragon which was carried along in a barge <lb/>
and spouted fire into the Thames.</p>
<p>Henry VII. always treated his mother with great <reg orig="con-|sideration">consideration</reg>. <lb/>
Margaret seems to have been an authority <lb/>
on matters of etiquette, for before the birth of his <lb/>
first child, Henry asked her to draw up a set of rules <lb/>
about the ceremonies to be observed on the occasion. <lb/>
In these rules it is stated that there were to be two <lb/>
cradles of tree, meaning of wood, one large for state <lb/>
occasions, to be adorned with paintings and furnished <lb/>
with cloth of gold and ermine fur and crimson velvet. <lb/>
At its christening, the child was to carry a little taper <lb/>
in its hand, and 200 torches were to be borne before <lb/>
it to the altar. After the baptism, the torches and <lb/>
the little taper were to be lit and the child was to <lb/>
present the taper at the altar. It looks as if the love <lb/>
for grand ceremonies which distinguished the Tudors <lb/>
had been started by Margaret. Her own household <lb/>
was beautifully ordered. She had drawn up a set of <lb/>
rules for the guidance of all the servants and the <lb/>
ladies and gentlemen, who made up her household, <lb/>
and these rules were read aloud four times a year that <lb/>
all might know and observe them. She visited in <lb/>
turn all her different estates, spending some time at <lb/>
each so that she might see that each was well ordered, <lb/>
and hear the complaints of all those who had any <lb/>
grievances. She herself would constantly speak loving <lb/>
words of encouragement to her servants, bidding them <lb/>
all to do well and to live in peace with one another. She <lb/>
employed a band of minstrels of her own, who would <lb/>
sometimes wander round the country and perform <lb/>
before the king and the court. As was the custom <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0074"/>
in those days, many young gentlemen were educated <lb/>
in her household. Her care of the sick and suffering <lb/>
never failed. She would minister to them with her <lb/>
own hands, and twelve poor folk to whom she gave <lb/>
food and raiment lodged constantly in her house.</p>
<p>Neither did Margaret forget her interest in study. <lb/>
We are told by Bishop Fisher, who knew her well, <lb/>
that she was of singular wisdom far surpassing the <lb/>
common rate of women. She collected a great number <lb/>
of books both English and French, and she was a <lb/>
warm friend to William Caxton, who first introduced <lb/>
printing into England, and who dedicated a book to <lb/>
her which he said had been translated from the French <lb/>
at her request. After Caxton's death in 1496, his <lb/>
assistant, Wynkyn de Worde, became the chief printer <lb/>
in London; he was much favoured by Margaret, and <lb/>
allowed to call himself, "Printer unto the most <reg orig="ex-|cellent">excellent</reg> <lb/>
princess, my lady the king's mother." He <lb/>
published books for Margaret, and amongst others one <lb/>
which she had herself translated from the French.</p>
<p>Margaret had always been a deeply religious woman, <lb/>
but with growing years she gave ever more time to <lb/>
her religious observances. Many hours were spent in <lb/>
prayer and in services in her chapel. She observed <lb/>
strictly all the fasts ordained by the Church, which <lb/>
were very severe in those days, and she wore on certain <lb/>
days in each week a hair shirt, or a hair girdle, next her <lb/>
skin in order to mortify her flesh. In 1497 Margaret <lb/>
appointed a learned Cambridge scholar, John Fisher, <lb/>
whom she had noticed with favour at court, where he <lb/>
had come on business connected with his university, <lb/>
to be her confessor. Fisher gained great influence over <lb/>
her, and he used it for the good of his university, which <lb/>
was then by no means in a prosperous condition. <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0075"/>
Margaret was always generous with her money; Fisher <lb/>
says of her that she hated avarice and covetousness, <lb/>
and she was glad to use her wealth to promote the <lb/>
cause of learning. Under Fisher's guidance she founded <lb/>
professorships at Cambridge and Oxford, which are still <lb/>
called after her. The college where Fisher had himself <lb/>
studied, called God's House, was very poor, and Margaret <lb/>
refounded it under the name of Christ's College, and <lb/>
herself made the statutes under which it was to be <lb/>
governed. She took great interest in it, and kept <lb/>
some rooms in it for herself, where she might stay <lb/>
when she came to Cambridge. Once when she was <lb/>
staying there, before the building of the College was <lb/>
finished, she was looking out of the window when <lb/>
she saw the dean beating a scholar who had <reg orig="mis-|behaved">misbehaved</reg>. <lb/>
She did not interfere to stop the <reg orig="punish-|ment">punishment</reg>, <lb/>
but only called out in Latin, "Lente, Lente" <lb/>
&lpar;gently, gently&rpar;, wishing that the beating might be less <lb/>
severe. It was in Cambridge that the famous scholar <lb/>
Erasmus met her on one of his visits to England, when <lb/>
she was an old lady, and admired her good memory and <lb/>
her ready wit.</p>
<p>Before the buildings of Christ's College were finished, <lb/>
Fisher won Margaret's interest in the foundation of <lb/>
another college, St. John's. At that time, the time <lb/>
which is known as the Renaissance, because art and <lb/>
learning seemed to be born again, men were eager to <lb/>
improve the teaching at the universities, and to make <lb/>
it possible for all who wished to gain knowledge. <lb/>
Fisher was friends with Erasmus and other learned <lb/>
men, and Margaret was willing to help with her money <lb/>
his plans for the advancement of learning, just as she <lb/>
had helped Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde in printing <lb/>
and publishing books. But though, for those days, she <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0076"/>
was a learned woman herself, she does not seem to <lb/>
have thought that other women should be helped to <lb/>
study, and it was only the learning of men that she <lb/>
aided by her gifts.</p>
<p>Henry VII. was interested in his mother's plans and <lb/>
himself visited Cambridge to see her college. He also <lb/>
thought highly of Fisher, and named him Bishop of <lb/>
Rochester. There seems to have been a deep affection <lb/>
between Henry and his mother. Once in writing to <lb/>
her, towards the end of his life, he says that he "is <lb/>
bounden to her for the great and singular motherly <lb/>
love and affection" she has always had for him. In <lb/>
writing to the king, Margaret called him "My own <lb/>
sweet and most dear king and all my worldly joy," and <lb/>
often addressed him as "my dear heart." She had the <lb/>
sorrow of seeing him die before her, but she did not <lb/>
live many months after him. She suffered greatly <lb/>
from rheumatic pains in what Bishop Fisher calls "her <lb/>
merciful and loving hands," so that her ladies and <lb/>
servants wept to see her agony. She died at <reg orig="West-|minster">Westminster</reg> <lb/>
and was buried in Henry VII.'s chapel in <lb/>
Westminster Abbey, where a black marble tomb <reg orig="com-|memorates">commemorates</reg> <lb/>
her memory. Bishop Fisher preached her <lb/>
funeral sermon, and said in it "all England for her <lb/>
death had cause of weeping; the poor creatures that <lb/>
were wont to receive her alms, to whom she was always <lb/>
piteous and merciful, the students of both universities <lb/>
to whom she was a mother, all the learned men of <lb/>
England to whom she was a very patroness, all the <lb/>
good religious men and women, whom she so often <lb/>
was wont to visit and comfort." Margaret's plans for <lb/>
the foundation of St. John's College were not finished <lb/>
at her death, and Wolsey, the favourite of her grandson <lb/>
Henry VIII., tried to get her lands for other purposes. <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0077"/>

</figure>
<pb n="70" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0078"/>
Fisher's efforts succeeded in keeping a great deal for <lb/>
St. John's, though not so much as Margaret had meant <lb/>
to give. She left all her jewels, books, vestments, <lb/>
plate, and altar cloths to her two colleges. She had <lb/>
been specially fond of fine goldsmith's work, and many <lb/>
beautiful things had been made for her, adorned with <lb/>
her own emblem, a daisy, or with the rose and the <reg orig="port-|cullis">portcullis</reg>, <lb/>
which through her descent from the Lancaster <lb/>
and Beaufort families became the Tudor emblems. <lb/>
Besides her colleges, she founded several almshouses, <lb/>
and a school at Wimborne, where her parents were <lb/>
buried. She used her great possessions as a trust <lb/>
which she held for the good of the country, and for <lb/>
herself sought no luxury or display, being, as Bishop <lb/>
Fisher says in his sermon, "temperate in meats and <lb/>
drinks, eschewing banquets and keeping fast days."</p>

RACHEL, LADY RUSSELL</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Rachel Wriothesley</hi> was the daughter of the Earl of <lb/>
Southampton and a French Huguenot lady whom he <lb/>
had married when travelling in France, and who was <lb/>
renowned for her beauty and virtue. Rachel was born <lb/>
in 1636. She never knew her mother, who died when <lb/>
she was an infant. Her father married again, and we <lb/>
know nothing about her relations with her stepmother, <lb/>
but we know that she dearly loved her sisters, and was <lb/>
very good friends with her stepsister. England was <lb/>
passing through troublous times during her childhood <lb/>
on account of the disputes between Charles I. and his <lb/>
Parliament. Lord Southampton was a sensible, <reg orig="moder-|ate">moderate</reg> <lb/>
man, and he could not approve of the king's doings, <lb/>
but he remained true to him and took his side when <lb/>
the civil war broke out. When the terrible end came <lb/>
and Charles I. was beheaded in 1649, Southampton got <lb/>
permission to watch by the king's body during the <lb/>
night after the execution. He is reported to have told <lb/>
a friend that, whilst he was watching, at about two <lb/>
o'clock in the morning, he heard a step on the stair <lb/>
and a man entered, muffled in a cloak, and stood by the <lb/>
body. He heard him sigh, "Cruel necessity," and knew <lb/>
by the voice that it was Cromwell.</p>
<p>Southampton's moderation was so well known that, <lb/>
though he had been the king's friend, the Parliament <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0080"/>
did not seize his lands, and he was suffered to live <lb/>
quietly on one of his estates in Hampshire. Rachel <lb/>
was then about thirteen years old and must have <lb/>
benefited from the companionship of her father during <lb/>
these quiet years. We know nothing of her education, <lb/>
and she does not seem in after life to have possessed <lb/>
any learning; but no doubt it was from her father she <lb/>
gained the good sense and the deep religious faith <lb/>
which distinguished her through life. She was an <lb/>
heiress since her father had no son, and only two of his <lb/>
other daughters survived him. As was the custom in <lb/>
those days, a suitable marriage was soon arranged for <lb/>
her. She was only seventeen when she married Lord <lb/>
Vaughan, who died four years afterwards. All that is <lb/>
known of their married life is that Lady Rachel <lb/>
behaved so as to win the love of her husband's family, <lb/>
who always remained her friends. When her husband <lb/>
died, she went to live in Hampshire with her sister <lb/>
Elizabeth, to whom she was deeply attached. Each of <lb/>
the sisters possessed a fine place in Hampshire, and <lb/>
when Elizabeth died both these places, Tichfield and <lb/>
Stratton, belonged to Rachel. Her father had lived to <lb/>
see the restoration of Charles II. and to be one of his <lb/>
first ministers, but he was now dead and Rachel was <lb/>
completely her own mistress. There was no one to <lb/>
arrange a marriage for her, and she was able to choose <lb/>
for herself a man whom she deeply loved. She had <lb/>
known William Russell, the younger son of the Duke <lb/>
of Bedford, for two years before they were married. <lb/>
He had shown his devotion to her for some time, but <lb/>
perhaps because he was a younger son and she was an <lb/>
heiress, he hesitated at first to ask her to be his wife. <lb/>
They were married at last in 1669, and fourteen years <lb/>
of perfect happiness began for Rachel. The only real <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0081"/>
sorrow that came to her was the death of her sister, <lb/>
whom she described as "a delicious friend." Her other <lb/>
sorrows were her brief separations from her husband <lb/>
when he had to visit his father at Woburn.</p>
<p>William Russell's elder brother had died, and he was <lb/>
now heir to the dukedom of Bedford. He was not a <lb/>
brilliant man, but he was a very good man, devotedly <lb/>
attached to his family and his friends, and very anxious <lb/>
to do his duty. When they were separated, Lady Russell <lb/>
wrote constantly to him, telling him all she heard that <lb/>
might interest him. When he had only been gone a few <lb/>
hours she wrote that she could not "let this first post <lb/>
night pass, without giving my dear man a little talk." <lb/>
Once, when she had gone over to Tunbridge Wells to <lb/>
drink the waters, she wrote: "After a toilsome day, <lb/>
there is some refreshment to be telling our story to our <lb/>
best friends. I have seen your girl well laid in bed, <lb/>
and ourselves have made our suppers upon biscuits, a <lb/>
bottle of white wine, and another of beer mingled my <lb/>
uncle's way, with nutmeg and sugar. Beds and things <lb/>
are all very well here: our want is yourself and good <lb/>
weather." They had three children, two girls and a <lb/>
boy, and her letters are full of allusions to the eldest: <lb/>
"Our little girl is very well, and extremely merry and <lb/>
often calls Papa. She gets new pretty tricks every <lb/>
day." And another time: "Your girls are very well; <lb/>
Miss Rachel has prattled a long story, but I must omit <lb/>
it. She says Papa has sent for her to Woburn, and <lb/>
then she gallops and says she has been there, and a <lb/>
great deal more."</p>
<p>Lord Russell was in Parliament, but at first he did <lb/>
not take much part in public affairs; he had no ambition <lb/>
and liked his quiet home life better than the bustle of <lb/>
public life. For many years he sat silent in Parliament <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0082"/>
but his strong love of liberty and of the Protestant <lb/>
religion at last drove him to be more active. There <lb/>
was much discontent with the government of Charles II. <lb/>
and with the favour which he showed to the Roman <lb/>
Catholics. Lord Russell joined himself with a number <lb/>
of others, to whom the nickname of Whigs was given, <lb/>
who were anxious to maintain the rights of Parliament, <lb/>
and to prevent the king's brother James, Duke of York, <lb/>
who was a Roman Catholic, from being considered <lb/>
the heir to the throne. Lady Russell was very anxious <lb/>
lest her husband should do or say anything rash, and <lb/>
even once sent him a little note to the House of <reg orig="Parlia-|ment">Parliament</reg> <lb/>
begging him to be silent. People were then very <lb/>
excited and very bitter against those who thought <lb/>
differently from them. An impostor, named Titus <lb/>
Oates, pretended to have discovered a popish plot to <lb/>
destroy the king, and by his false accusations caused <lb/>
many innocent men to be put to death. A few years <lb/>
afterwards, others pretended to have discovered a <lb/>
Whig plot to kill Charles II. and his brother. Lord <lb/>
Russell had not joined in any of the violent accusations <lb/>
made against those opposed to him, nor had he been <lb/>
aware of any plot, but he was a man of great influence, <lb/>
one of the leaders amongst the Whigs, and he too was <lb/>
anxious to keep James from succeeding to the throne. <lb/>
When people were angry and alarmed at the supposed <lb/>
Whig plot, the king and his friends thought it a good <lb/>
opportunity to get rid of some of the Whig leaders. <lb/>
There was one amongst them, Lord Howard, who was <lb/>
ready to secure his own safety by betraying the others. <lb/>
Lord Russell knew that he was in danger, and one day <lb/>
a man was set at his front gate to watch and prevent <lb/>
his going out. But there was no one at his back gate <lb/>
so that he could easily have escaped had he wished. <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0083"/>
This was perhaps what his enemies wanted. But he felt <lb/>
that to escape would be the same thing as confession <lb/>
of his guilt. He sent his wife out to ask the opinion <lb/>
of his friends, and they agreed with him. So he stayed <lb/>
quietly at home, and the next day he was fetched to <lb/>
appear before the King's Council, and was afterwards <lb/>
sent as a close prisoner to the Tower. He knew the <lb/>
fury of his enemies, and said to his servant that "they <lb/>
would have his life;" and when the servant answered <lb/>
that he hoped they would not have the power, he said, <lb/>
"Yes, the devil is loose."</p>
<p>From that moment, Lord Russell allowed himself <lb/>
no hope. He looked upon himself as a dying man, <lb/>
and turned his thoughts away from this world to <lb/>
another world. But his friends, of course, were eager <lb/>
to do everything to save him. We can imagine what <lb/>
the suffering of his wife must have been; she who had <lb/>
found it hard to bear a separation of a few days, had <lb/>
now to face the terrible probability that he would be <lb/>
condemned to death for high treason. Her first letter <lb/>
to him in the Tower was sent concealed in a cold <lb/>
chicken. Afterwards she seems to have been able to <lb/>
communicate with him more easily. Her courage was <lb/>
equal to her love, and she set to work at once to try <lb/>
to collect evidence in his favour. Her efforts never <lb/>
ceased during the fortnight which passed before he <lb/>
was brought to trial, and she got hold of every possible <lb/>
fact that could be urged in his defence. Moreover, <lb/>
she was brave and self-controlled enough to determine <lb/>
to be present at his trial. She wrote to ask his leave <lb/>
saying: "Your friends believing I can do you some <lb/>
service at your trial, I am extremely willing to try; <lb/>
my resolution will hold out&mdash;pray let yours. But it <lb/>
may be the court will not let me; however, do you <lb/>
<pb n="76" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0084"/>
let me try." When Lord Russell was brought before <lb/>
the Bar at the Old Bailey, he asked for pen, ink, and <lb/>
paper, and the use of the papers that he had, and <lb/>
said, "May I have somebody to write to help my <lb/>
memory?" He was told that he might have one of <lb/>
his servants to write for him, and he answered, "My <lb/>
wife is here, my lord, to do it." The Lord Chief Justice <lb/>
said, "If my lady please to give herself the trouble." <lb/>
So Lady Russell was allowed to be at his side to help <lb/>
him. He was accused of conspiring against the king's <lb/>
life, and of plotting to raise a rebellion in England. <lb/>
Both these accusations he firmly denied. The witnesses <lb/>
against him were men of despicable character and <lb/>
there is no doubt that their evidence was false; but <lb/>
the jury found him guilty, and he was condemned to <lb/>
death as a traitor.</p>
<p>There was only a week left before he was to be <lb/>
executed. His wife and his friends could not give up <lb/>
hope. His father offered the king &pound;50,000 if he would <lb/>
spare his life, and begged him not to bring his grey <lb/>
hairs in sorrow to the grave. People of all kinds <reg orig="in-|terceded">interceded</reg> <lb/>
with Charles, but it was all in vain. Lady <lb/>
Russell never ceased her efforts. It was suggested <lb/>
that she should try to surprise the king in the park <lb/>
and throw herself at his feet, but this does not seem <lb/>
to have been possible. At her earnest entreaty Lord <lb/>
Russell wrote to the king asking his pardon for having <lb/>
been present at any meetings which may have been <lb/>
unlawful or provoking to the king. But Charles never <lb/>
hesitated. He seems to have regarded Lord Russell <lb/>
as a dangerous person. Lord Russell himself was <lb/>
absolutely resigned to his fate, and only wished to <lb/>
be left in peace to prepare for his death. Every day <lb/>
he was visited by a clergyman, Dr. Burnet, who has <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0085"/>
left an account of his last days, and Lady Russell was <lb/>
also much with him. She did not distress him by her <lb/>
lamentations, but showed a greatness of spirit which <lb/>
was an immense comfort to him. Sometimes when he <lb/>
spoke of her, the tears would come into his eyes and <lb/>
he would quickly change the subject. Once he said <lb/>
that he wished she would give up beating every bush <lb/>
for his preservation. But he realised that it would <lb/>
help her afterwards to think that she had done <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
in her power, just as it helped her during those <lb/>
sad days to have something to do. He was always <lb/>
cheerful and ready to talk and even joke with those <lb/>
who came to see him, but he gave his mind chiefly to <lb/>
prayer and religious thoughts, and to preparing a <reg orig="state-|ment">statement</reg> <lb/>
of his opinions which he wished to be distributed <lb/>
after his death. On the last evening of his life, he signed <lb/>
this paper and sent it to be printed. Then some of <lb/>
his friends and his children came to see him, and he <lb/>
was calm and cheerful with his children as usual. He <lb/>
bade his wife stay to supper with him, saying, "Stay <lb/>
and sup with me, let us eat our last earthly food <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg>." <lb/>
He talked cheerfully during supper on various <lb/>
subjects, and particularly of his two daughters. When <lb/>
a note was brought to Lady Russell with some new <lb/>
plan for his deliverance, he turned it into ridicule, so <lb/>
that those who were with him were amazed. At ten <lb/>
o'clock Lady Russell had to leave him. He kissed her <lb/>
four or five times, and she, brave to the last, kept her <lb/>
sorrow so within herself that she gave him no <reg orig="dis-|turbance">disturbance</reg> <lb/>
by their parting. After she was gone, he <lb/>
said, "Now the bitterness of death is past," and he <lb/>
talked long about the blessing she had been to him, <lb/>
and what a comfort it was that in spite of her great <lb/>
tenderness she had never wished him to do a base <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0086"/>
thing in order to save his life. He said, "What a <lb/>
week should I have passed, if she had been crying <lb/>
on me to turn informer and be a Lord Howard." He <lb/>
thanked God for giving him such a wife, and said that <lb/>
it was a great comfort to him that he left his children <lb/>
in such a mother's hands, and that she had promised <lb/>
to him to take care of herself for their sakes. Then <lb/>
he turned to think of the great change that was before <lb/>
him, and at last went to bed and slept soundly. Those <lb/>
who were with him next morning were amazed at the <lb/>
temper he was in. He thanked God that there was <lb/>
no sort of fear nor hurry in his thoughts, and so he <lb/>
prayed and waited till they came to take him in his <lb/>
coach to his execution. He was still cheerful as he <lb/>
went, singing softly a psalm to himself. As they came <lb/>
near his own house and then turned from it into <lb/>
another street, he said, "I have often turned to the <lb/>
other hand with great comfort, and now I turn to this <lb/>
with greater." But as he looked towards his house, <lb/>
some tears were seen to fall from his eyes. So he <lb/>
remained calm and cheerful till he laid his head on <lb/>
the block and all his troubles were over.</p>
<p>We do not know and we can hardly bear to think <lb/>
how his wife passed those terrible hours after she had <lb/>
parted from him. Seven years afterwards she wrote: <lb/>
"There was something so glorious in the object of my <lb/>
biggest sorrow, I believe, that in some measure kept <lb/>
me from being then overwhelmed." She was roused, <lb/>
only a few days after Lord Russell's death, to defend <lb/>
his memory, since it was asserted that the paper which <lb/>
he had written before his death, and which had been <lb/>
printed and widely read, was not his but had been <lb/>
written by Dr. Burnet. She wrote to the king <reg orig="de-|scribing">describing</reg> <lb/>
herself as a woman "amazed with grief," and <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0087"/>
begged him to believe that "he who in all his life <lb/>
was observed to act with the greatest clearness and <lb/>
<figure id="f20" rend="block" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0087">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">Lord William Russell Taking leave of his Children previous to his <lb/>
Execution</hi>, 1683. &lpar;<hi rend="italic">After J. Bridges.</hi>&rpar;</head>
</figure>
sincerity, would not at the point of death do so false <lb/>
a thing as to deliver for his own what was properly <lb/>
not so." Still Dr. Burnet was regarded with such <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0088"/>
suspicion that he thought it wise to leave the country <lb/>
for a time.</p>
<p>Lady Russell left London and went with her children <lb/>
to Woburn, the place of the Duke of Bedford, her <reg orig="father-|in-law">father-in-law</reg>. <lb/>
She had kind friends to help her in her sorrow. <lb/>
The Duke of Bedford cherished her and her children <lb/>
with tender affection, and for long she made her home <lb/>
with him. He addressed her in his letters as his <lb/>
"dearest daughter," and signed himself "your most <lb/>
affectionate father and friend." A clergyman, Dr. <reg orig="Fitz-|william">Fitzwilliam</reg>, <lb/>
who had been her father's chaplain and had <lb/>
known her from infancy, wrote often to her, and to him <lb/>
she poured out her sorrow, as to one who had known <lb/>
both her and her husband and had seen their life <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg> <lb/>
and therefore would be patient with her whilst <lb/>
her "disordered thoughts" and her "amazed mind" <lb/>
made it difficult for her to speak of anything but her <lb/>
grief. She had promised her husband that she would <lb/>
live for her children, and to their care she now devoted <lb/>
herself, determining to teach them herself, and we do <lb/>
not hear that her daughters ever had any other teacher. <lb/>
Mr. Hoskins, her lawyer, helped her in the management <lb/>
of her affairs with most tender sympathy, and tried to <lb/>
persuade her by degrees to take some interest in them, <lb/>
so that she might not be too entirely absorbed in her <lb/>
sorrow. He told her that great persons had great trials, <lb/>
but also had more opportunity than common people to <lb/>
fit their minds to bear them.</p>
<p>Her children were too young to know what they had <lb/>
lost, and she was determined to do all in her power for <lb/>
them, and particularly for her son, that he might not <lb/>
feel, if he grew to be a man, that it would have been <lb/>
better for him had he had a mother "less ignorant or <lb/>
less negligent." She said that she had no choice in any <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0089"/>
matter for herself, and could not like one way better than <lb/>
another, so long as what was done was for the good of <lb/>
those young creatures whose service was all the business <lb/>
she had in the world. But she hardly realised how dear <lb/>
her children were to her, till the serious illness of her <lb/>
little boy showed her what it would cost her to part with <lb/>
him. When he recovered she felt that she had indeed <lb/>
something still to live for, and that she might be blessed <lb/>
with some joy and satisfaction through her children. <lb/>
Her little boy was heir to his grandfather, the Duke of <lb/>
Bedford, and on all matters connected with his education <lb/>
she consulted the duke. Neither of them wished to <lb/>
make him begin study too soon, but Lady Russell was <lb/>
anxious that he should have a French tutor, that he <lb/>
might learn the language. There were many <reg orig="Hugue-|nots">Huguenots</reg> <lb/>
in England, who had fled from the persecutions <lb/>
in France, and by engaging one of them she was able <lb/>
both to do a charity and to be of use to her son.</p>
<p>Only two years after Lord Russell's execution <lb/>
Charles II. had died and been succeeded by his brother, <lb/>
James II. James II.'s attempt to upset the authority <lb/>
of Parliament, and to rule by his own will alone, led to <lb/>
the rebellion which, in 1688, made his daughter, Mary, <lb/>
and her husband, William of Orange, King and Queen <lb/>
of England. Whilst these stirring events were passing, <lb/>
Lady Russell was living quietly in the country, her only <lb/>
fear was lest her children should run any risk. Once <lb/>
things were settled, she knew that she could count upon <lb/>
the friendship of William and Mary, and at the Duke <lb/>
of Bedford's wish, she went with him to London. She <lb/>
was full of thankfulness for the change, and wrote that <lb/>
it was difficult to believe that it was more than a dream, <lb/>
yet it was real and an amazing mercy. Her husband's <lb/>
friend, Dr. Burnet, came over with Mary, and was made <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0090"/>
Bishop of Salisbury. One of the first acts of the new <lb/>
government was to reverse the sentence passed on Lord <lb/>
Russell, and the House of Commons decreed that his <lb/>
execution had been a murder.</p>
<p>Lady Russell was now in a position of influence and <lb/>
importance, but she did not change her quiet way of <lb/>
living. A paper that she wrote about this time for <lb/>
her children shows her loving anxiety for them. In it, <lb/>
after bidding them never to forget their prayers <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
and evening, she tells them about her own prayers, <lb/>
and how she always carried with her a little piece of <lb/>
paper on which she noted her faults, that she might <lb/>
ask forgiveness for them; in this way she had gained a <lb/>
habit of constant watchfulness.</p>
<p>One of her anxieties had been to arrange suitable <lb/>
marriages for her children, and it was a great joy <lb/>
to her when her husband's closest friend, the Duke of <lb/>
Devonshire, proposed that his son should marry her <lb/>
eldest daughter. When this marriage was decided on, <lb/>
Lady Elizabeth was only fourteen and Lord Cavendish <lb/>
not sixteen. Lady Russell had to go to London to <lb/>
make the necessary arrangements, and felt it right to <lb/>
go more into society, though she said that going <lb/>
to parties was hard for one with a heavy and weary <lb/>
mind. The marriage was delayed by the bride having <lb/>
an attack of measles, and when it did take place, the <lb/>
young couple only spent three weeks together under <lb/>
Lady Russell's care, and then Lord Cavendish was sent <lb/>
to finish his education by travelling on the continent <lb/>
for two years. A few years later Lady Russell married <lb/>
her younger daughter to the eldest son of the Duke of <lb/>
Rutland, the best match in England. When her son <lb/>
was only fifteen, a seat in Parliament was offered her <lb/>
for him, but she refused because she thought him too <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0091"/>
young. She had, however, already arranged a marriage <lb/>
for him to a girl in whose education she took the <lb/>
deepest interest. He was married when he was fifteen, <lb/>
but his wife stayed at home with her mother and he <lb/>
went to Oxford for a year's study, during which his <lb/>
mother often visited him. At seventeen he was sent <lb/>
to travel abroad, as Lady Russell believed that to "live <lb/>
well in the world, it is for certain necessary to know <lb/>
the world well." During his travels he caused her <lb/>
some anxiety for he took to gambling, and lost so <lb/>
much money that when he came home, she had to ask <lb/>
his grandfather for money to pay his debts. Shortly <lb/>
afterwards his grandfather died, and he became Duke <lb/>
of Bedford. Now it seemed as if Lady Russell's <lb/>
anxieties were over, since her three children were all <lb/>
happily married, but sorrow followed her to the last. Her <lb/>
son, in the fulness of life and health, was seized with <lb/>
smallpox, the haunting terror of those days before <lb/>
vaccination was discovered. His wife and children had <lb/>
to fly from the infection, and only his mother, with her <lb/>
never-failing courage, stayed to soothe his last moments. <lb/>
Shortly afterwards her younger daughter, the Duchess <lb/>
of Rutland, died. Once again a demand was made on <lb/>
Lady Russell's courage. Her only remaining daughter, <lb/>
the Duchess of Devonshire, had just given birth to a <lb/>
child; it was feared that, if she heard of the death <lb/>
of her sister, the shock might be fatal; so her mother <lb/>
stayed with her and did not let her learn the truth, <lb/>
telling her that she had that day seen her sister out <lb/>
of bed, by which she really meant that she had seen <lb/>
her in her coffin.</p>
<p>Another trouble of Lady Russell's later life was the <lb/>
fear of blindness; but she bore this calamity with <lb/>
patience till an operation restored her sight. She <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0092"/>
lived till the age of eighty-eight, when she died after a <lb/>
short illness, watched over by the loving care of her <lb/>
only remaining child. During a long life, her courage, <lb/>
her love, her faith had never failed her in spite of her <lb/>
sore trials. It is interesting to remember that three of <lb/>
the chief families of England, the houses of <reg orig="Devon-|shire">Devonshire</reg>, <lb/>
Bedford, and Rutland, look back to this pure, <lb/>
warm-hearted woman and her murdered husband as <lb/>
their common ancestors.</p>

ELIZABETH FRY</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> and round Norwich have gathered for a long time <lb/>
many of the chief families belonging to the Society of <lb/>
Friends, the religious body whose members are <reg orig="com-|monly">commonly</reg> <lb/>
called Quakers. It was founded by an earnest <lb/>
Christian preacher in the seventeenth century, who <lb/>
taught men to lead a true and simple Christian life, <lb/>
to have nothing to do with what he considered vain <lb/>
pleasures, such as music and dancing, to dress very <lb/>
simply, to worship in silence without any set prayers or <lb/>
any ordained minister, waiting for the Spirit to move <lb/>
one of the members to pray or address the meeting. <lb/>
The Gurneys were one of the chief families belonging <lb/>
to the Society of Friends; and John Gurney, who lived <lb/>
at Earlham, a nice country place near Norwich, was the <lb/>
father of seven daughters and four sons. The third of <lb/>
these daughters, Elizabeth, was born in 1780, and when <lb/>
she was only twelve years old her mother died, leaving <lb/>
Catherine, the eldest child, who was not quite seventeen, <lb/>
to take her place as well as she could. The Gurneys <lb/>
were a very happy, lively family. They did not follow <lb/>
the Quaker rules strictly; they rode about the country <lb/>
on their ponies, dressed in scarlet habits, and loved <lb/>
dancing and singing and gaiety of all kinds. But they <lb/>
were carefully educated and brought up to take a deep <lb/>
interest in religion. Elizabeth was delicate, and could <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0094"/>
not study much; neither did she often go to Meeting, <lb/>
as the Friends call their religious gathering, partly <lb/>
because she was not strong, and partly because it bored <lb/>
her. One day, when she was eighteen, she had gone to <lb/>
Meeting wearing some very smart boots, which pleased <lb/>
her very much; they were purple, laced with scarlet. <lb/>
She was restless and sat and looked at her boots. But <lb/>
presently a stranger began to preach, a visitor from <lb/>
America. She was forced to listen, and was so moved <lb/>
with what she heard that she began to weep. This was <lb/>
the beginning of a great change in her; she awoke to <lb/>
the reality of religion, and began to feel that she must <lb/>
become what was called a plain Friend, one who <lb/>
followed the rules of the Society in every particular. <lb/>
But first she wished to know more of the world, and, <lb/>
with her father's consent, she paid a visit to London, <lb/>
where she shared in a great deal of gaiety. Still her <lb/>
determination to give it all up only grew stronger. Her <lb/>
sisters, though they dearly loved her, did not share her <lb/>
ideas, and grieved when she would not join their <reg orig="amuse-|ments">amusements</reg>. <lb/>
She found some satisfaction in teaching poor <lb/>
children in Norwich, for whom there were no schools <lb/>
in those days. At last many of her difficulties were <lb/>
settled by her marriage, when she was twenty, with <lb/>
Mr. Joseph Fry, who was also a plain Friend. His family <lb/>
were so strict that amongst her new relations Elizabeth <lb/>
found herself the gay one of the family, instead of the <lb/>
strict one as she had been in her own home.</p>
<p>The Frys lived in London, in the city, as business <lb/>
men then did; later they lived also at Plasket House in <lb/>
Essex, then a beautiful country place, but now covered <lb/>
by the crowded population of East Ham. They had a <lb/>
large family, eleven children in all, and Mrs. Fry was <reg orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg> <lb/>
to her husband and her children, but from the first <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0095"/>
she did not feel that on their account she must give up <lb/>
<figure id="f21" rend="block" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0095">

</figure>
all work for others. She visited the poor and helped <lb/>
the suffering wherever she could. She was naturally <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0096"/>
timid and unwilling to put herself forward. Amongst <lb/>
Friends it is the constant habit to trust to the guidance <lb/>
of the Holy Spirit to show both what should be done <lb/>
and to gain strength to do it. As a young woman <lb/>
Mrs. Fry had felt shy even at reading the Bible at <lb/>
family prayers in her own house. As she grew older <lb/>
she began to feel that it might be her duty to speak at <lb/>
the Friends' Meetings. She seemed at last to be driven <lb/>
by the Holy Spirit to do so, and though frightened <lb/>
beforehand, when once she had begun all was easy. <lb/>
The Meeting which she attended was pleased with her <lb/>
speaking and chose her for one of their regular ministers. <lb/>
This was when she was thirty-one and already the <lb/>
mother of seven children. After this she was a frequent <lb/>
speaker at Friends' Meetings all over the country.</p>
<p>The Friends as a body were always anxious to help <lb/>
suffering and misery of every kind. Some gentlemen <lb/>
well known to Mrs. Fry, having learnt of the miserable <lb/>
condition of the women in Newgate, then one of the <lb/>
chief prisons in London, asked her to visit them one <lb/>
winter to see if she could not do something to improve <lb/>
their condition. It was a terrible scene that Mrs. Fry <lb/>
found when, alone with one other lady, she entered <lb/>
Newgate prison in January 1813. In four rooms were <lb/>
crowded nearly 300 women and with them many <lb/>
children. Those who had been tried, and those who <lb/>
had not yet been tried, were all herded together, whether <lb/>
guilty of grave or trifling crimes. There was no woman <lb/>
to take care of them; day and night they were under <lb/>
the charge of one man and his son. They had no <lb/>
employment of any kind; they had no clothing supplied <lb/>
but what they had on when they came. In rags and dirt <lb/>
they slept on the filthy floor without any bedding, and <lb/>
they cooked, lived, and slept in the same rooms. When <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0097"/>
strangers visited them, as seems to have been allowed, <lb/>
they all started begging, and when they were given any <lb/>
money they at once bought drink, which could be got <lb/>
in the prison. Their language and their conduct were <lb/>
alike terrible, and the governor of the prison himself <lb/>
feared to go amongst them. He begged Mrs. Fry and <lb/>
her companion to remove the watches which hung at <lb/>
their sides lest they should be snatched from them by <lb/>
the women, but they paid no heed to his warning. <lb/>
The two ladies had brought with them a supply of <lb/>
warm garments which they distributed amongst the <lb/>
wretched prisoners, and before leaving each said a few <lb/>
words of prayer, which moved some of their listeners <lb/>
to tears.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fry did not forget what she had seen at <reg orig="New-|gate">Newgate</reg>, <lb/>
but it was four years before she was able to do <lb/>
anything more for the prisoners. She was much taken <lb/>
up with family affairs, and she was often ill. She had <lb/>
her own large family, and besides her many brothers and <lb/>
sisters, most of them with families of their own, who all <lb/>
wished her to share their joys and troubles. She was <lb/>
devoted in her care of her children, nursed them when <lb/>
they were ill, and was so gentle and loving in her ways <lb/>
that all little children loved her; but the cares of a large <lb/>
household were burdensome to her and she was glad <lb/>
to give over the management of the house to her <lb/>
daughters as they grew old enough. At Christmas <lb/>
1816, she again visited Newgate, and this time she asked <lb/>
to be left alone with the women for some hours. She <lb/>
read to them out of the Bible and explained what she <lb/>
had read. The children of the wretched women, <reg orig="half-|naked">half-naked</reg> <lb/>
and pining for want of proper food and exercise, <lb/>
especially called forth her pity. She spoke to the <lb/>
mothers about the terrible dangers of their growing <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0098"/>
up in such a place, and said that if they were willing to <lb/>
help, she would get permission to start a school for the <lb/>
children. The mothers agreed with tears of joy. The <lb/>
governor of the prison had not much hope that <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
would come of the experiment, but he agreed <lb/>
to allow an empty cell to be used as a school. A <lb/>
teacher was found amongst the prisoners, a young <lb/>
woman, Mary Connor, who was in prison for stealing a <lb/>
watch. Next day the school was opened, and so many <lb/>
wished to learn that room could not be found for all <lb/>
in the cell. For fifteen months Mary Connor taught the <lb/>
prison school with much devotion; then she was given <lb/>
a free pardon, but died of consumption shortly <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg>. <lb/>
Mrs. Fry and a little group of ladies, whom she <lb/>
interested in the work, helped her constantly. One of <lb/>
these described her first visit to the prison by saying <lb/>
that she felt as if she were going into a den of wild <lb/>
beasts. The half-naked women begging at the top of <lb/>
their voices, struggled together to get to the front of the <lb/>
railing which divided the room. The ladies as they <lb/>
passed through to the school were horrified at the <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg> <lb/>
of these poor women, who spent their time in <reg orig="gam-|bling">gambling</reg>, <lb/>
betting, swearing, fighting, singing, and dancing.</p>
<p>At first it seemed as if the only thing that could <lb/>
be done would be to choose out the least vicious and <lb/>
to try, by keeping them apart, to bring them to a <lb/>
better life. No one thought it possible to do anything <lb/>
for the most degraded. But Mrs. Fry, as she talked <lb/>
with them and got to know them, could not give up <lb/>
hope of being able in some way to be of use to all. She <lb/>
wanted at least to teach them some sort of work; but the <lb/>
officers of the prison assured her that they would only <lb/>
destroy or steal any materials she might give them. <lb/>
Still she was determined to find a way, and a few weeks <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0099"/>
afterwards she wrote: "A way has very remarkably <lb/>
been opened for us, beyond all expectations, to bring <lb/>
into order the poor prisoners." She was able to form <lb/>
a small association of ladies for the "improvement of <lb/>
the female prisoners at Newgate," and the city <reg orig="magis-|trates">magistrates</reg> <lb/>
gave her permission to introduce order and work <lb/>
into the prison if it could be done. She and her <reg orig="fellow-|workers">fellow-workers</reg> <lb/>
made their plans, and drew up a set of rules <lb/>
for the life of those prisoners who had been tried. They <lb/>
then gathered the women together, told them what <lb/>
they intended to do for them, and read the rules one <lb/>
by one to them, asking whether they would keep them. <lb/>
All held up their hands in sign of approval after each <lb/>
rule was read, and in the same way they chose monitors <lb/>
amongst themselves to see that the rules were kept. <lb/>
Each day, before work was begun, one of the ladies read <lb/>
the Bible and prayed with the women. All went on so <lb/>
smoothly and well that every one was amazed. After <lb/>
six months, the untried prisoners begged that they too <lb/>
might have work provided for them, which was done.</p>
<p>By degrees, in spite of her desire to keep it quiet, <lb/>
people all over the country began to hear of the work <lb/>
that Mrs. Fry was doing at Newgate, and wrote to ask <lb/>
her advice to help them to improve the condition of <lb/>
other prisons. The House of Commons was led to take <lb/>
interest in the state of the prisons, and invited Mrs. Fry <lb/>
to tell what she knew about them to a committee chosen <lb/>
to look into the matter. It was not only the bad <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
of the prisons that troubled her, but the nature <lb/>
of the law, which then punished with death, not only <lb/>
as at present the crime of murder, but also forgery and <lb/>
various kinds of stealing. Mrs. Fry saw many women <lb/>
condemned to death, and was specially troubled by the <lb/>
case of one young woman who had passed some forged <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0100"/>
notes at the request of the man she loved. She tried <lb/>
in vain to obtain her pardon; and her fate determined <lb/>
her not to rest until the law were changed.</p>
<p>In those days persons guilty of serious crime, who <lb/>
were not condemned to death, were sent as convicts to <lb/>
some of the distant colonies. They were taken to the <lb/>
docks through the streets in open waggons, shouting to <lb/>
the crowd as they passed and behaving with the utmost <lb/>
disorder. This, too, Mrs. Fry set herself to change. She <lb/>
asked that the women might be taken in covered <reg orig="car-|riages">carriages</reg>, <lb/>
and promised them that if they would behave <lb/>
quietly she and some of the ladies would come to see <lb/>
them off. Her own carriage followed the long line of <lb/>
coaches which took the women, 128 in number, with <lb/>
their children to the docks. When she reached the <lb/>
ship she was dismayed at the miserable arrangements <lb/>
made for the convicts, who were herded together with <lb/>
no one to care for them and nothing to do. She <lb/>
succeeded in dividing them into classes of twelve with <lb/>
a monitor to keep order over each, and found a corner <lb/>
of the ship where a school could be arranged for the <lb/>
children, with one of the convicts as teacher. To get <lb/>
occupation for the women she collected great quantities <lb/>
of scraps of cloth of all kinds, and set them to make <lb/>
patchwork quilts, which she heard would easily be sold <lb/>
in the colonies. In this way they were able to earn a <lb/>
little money to help them when they came to settle in <lb/>
a new land. She gave Bibles and prayer-books to the <lb/>
monitors for the use of their classes, and made <reg orig="arrange-|ments">arrangements</reg> <lb/>
for those who wished, to learn to read. When <lb/>
the day came for the ship to sail, Mrs. Fry was there to <lb/>
say a last good-bye. She stood at the door of the cabin <lb/>
with her friends and the captain; the women were <lb/>
gathered in front of her, many of the sailors had climbed <lb/>

<pb n="94" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0102"/>
into the rigging so as to see better what was going on, <lb/>
even the crews in neighbouring ships leant over the <lb/>
sides to watch. Mrs. Fry opened her Bible and amidst <lb/>
profound silence read some verses in her beautiful clear <lb/>
voice. Then she paused for a moment, knelt down on <lb/>
the deck and prayed for God's blessing, whilst many of <lb/>
the women wept. After this a boat carried her to the <lb/>
shore, and the women strained their eyes to see her as <lb/>
long as possible.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fry's work at Newgate was talked about <reg orig="every-|where">everywhere</reg>. <lb/>
People of all kinds&mdash;bishops, ministers of <lb/>
religion, great nobles, and smart ladies, even members <lb/>
of the royal family&mdash;came to Newgate to hear Mrs. Fry <lb/>
teach and pray with the prisoners. It became a <reg orig="fashion-|able">fashionable</reg> <lb/>
amusement, but the solemn scene could not fail to <lb/>
affect even the most frivolous. As they listened to Mrs. <lb/>
Fry's winning voice, with its beautiful silvery tones, they <lb/>
forgot to think of the prisoners and thought only of the <lb/>
way in which the words she had spoken touched their <lb/>
own lives. The silence that followed used to be broken <lb/>
by sobs from prisoners and visitors alike.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fry gave her mind not only to teaching the <lb/>
prisoners and trying to lessen their sufferings, but to <lb/>
studying the whole question of prison reform. She <lb/>
wished to see things so changed that prisons might <reg orig="be-|come">become</reg> <lb/>
places where criminals should not only be punished <lb/>
but helped to become better. She travelled all over the <lb/>
country, sometimes with her husband, sometimes with <lb/>
her brothers, who were also zealous workers in prison <lb/>
reform, visiting the different prisons. Journeys were <lb/>
sometimes undertaken also to visit Friends' Meetings and <lb/>
speak at them; but wherever she went she always tried <lb/>
to inspect the prison, to form ladies' committees to visit <lb/>
the prisons, and to persuade the authorities to improve <lb/>
<pb n="95" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0103"/>
their arrangements. She tried to be of use to other <lb/>
people also. There was a great deal of smuggling in <lb/>
those days, and there had to be many stations of <reg orig="coast-|guards">coastguards</reg> <lb/>
to watch for smugglers. Mrs. Fry was sorry for <lb/>
the dull and lonely lives led by many of these men, <lb/>
and with the help of her friends provided for their use <lb/>
libraries of books at all the coastguard stations.</p>
<p>She went to Ireland also to visit the prisons <lb/>
with her brother, who was deeply interested in the <lb/>
same work, and later they visited Jersey. Whenever <lb/>
she was in London, she paid a weekly visit to Newgate, <lb/>
and she sometimes visited the men as well as the women. <lb/>
The Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, was full of <reg orig="admira-|tion">admiration</reg> <lb/>
for her work, and helped her to get improvements <lb/>
made in the care of the women and children on the <lb/>
convict ships.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fry's fame had spread over Europe, and when <lb/>
she was already fifty-nine, with many grandchildren <lb/>
growing up around her, she decided to visit France <lb/>
and study French prisons. Wherever she went she <lb/>
was received with much enthusiasm. Some of the <lb/>
prisons that she saw she admired very much, but in <lb/>
others she noticed much to criticise, and she always <lb/>
freely expressed her opinions. In some towns in France <lb/>
she was able to form committees of ladies to visit the <lb/>
prisons. After a second visit she prepared a long <lb/>
report for the French government about the prisons <lb/>
she had seen, and the reforms she thought desirable. <lb/>
Repeated requests came to her to visit new places, <lb/>
and she made a third journey to the continent with <lb/>
her brother, when they got as far as Berlin. In Prussia <lb/>
she was treated with much honour by the king and <lb/>
queen, and by many members of the royal family. The <lb/>
following year the King of Prussia came to England, <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0104"/>
and one of the things he was most anxious to do whilst <lb/>
in London was to be present at one of Mrs. Fry's visits <lb/>
to Newgate. He came to the prison accompanied by the <lb/>
Lord Mayor and many gentlemen. There in one of the <lb/>
wards Mrs. Fry and some of the ladies were gathered <lb/>
with about sixty of the poor women. She told them <lb/>
that the presence of such distinguished visitors must <lb/>
not be allowed to distract their attention, and she read <lb/>
the Bible and prayed with them as usual. The same <lb/>
day the king drove out to see her at her own house <lb/>
in the country, and she presented to him her large <lb/>
family, sons and daughters, with their wives and <lb/>
twenty-five grandchildren. She writes of the day: <lb/>
"Our meal was handsome and fit for a king, yet not <lb/>
extravagant, everything most complete and nice. I <lb/>
sat by the king, who appeared to enjoy his dinner, <lb/>
perfectly at his ease and very happy with us."</p>
<p>Once more after this Mrs. Fry visited France, but <lb/>
she was growing feeble and tired out with her many <lb/>
labours. She had to suffer some months of illness, <lb/>
during which her daughters tended her with the <lb/>
greatest devotion. She wrote herself that she was <lb/>
much struck in this illness with the manner in which <lb/>
her children had been raised up as her helpers. Many <lb/>
sorrows came to her in her last years from the death <lb/>
of her relations, but suffering and sorrow did not shake <lb/>
her faith. She had the comfort during the last years <lb/>
of her life, of hearing of all the improvements that <lb/>
were being made in the prisons, to reform which she <lb/>
had done so much. To the last she shared all the <lb/>
joys and sorrows of her children and of the other <lb/>
members of her large family. For about two years she <lb/>
led more or less the life of an invalid, and died in <lb/>
October 1845, at the age of sixty-five.</p>
<pb n="97" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0105"/>
<p>It has only been possible to tell a very little of all <lb/>
the work she did for others during the years of her <lb/>
busy life. But whilst she did all this public work, <lb/>
and influenced kings and governments in favour of <reg orig="re-|forms">reforms</reg>, <lb/>
and ministered herself to the needs of the sinful <lb/>
and the suffering, she never forgot her duties as a <reg orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg> <lb/>
wife and the mother of a large family of children, <lb/>
who loved her with the deepest tenderness. Neither did <lb/>
she neglect her brothers and sisters and their children. <lb/>
Her public work, though it absorbed much time and <lb/>
thought, did not take her away from her other duties. <lb/>
She remains an example of what a woman can do who <lb/>
feels the call to serve others, and who does not believe <lb/>
that she can refuse to obey that call even though she <lb/>
has a family and a husband to care for.</p>

MARY SOMERVILLE</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Mary Fairfax</hi>, who grew up to be the most learned <lb/>
woman of her day, was born in Scotland in 1780. Her <lb/>
father was a captain in the navy, and whilst he was <lb/>
away with his ship, her mother, who was not at all well <lb/>
off, lived quietly with her children at Burntisland, a <lb/>
small seaport on the coast of Fife. She did not take <lb/>
much trouble about Mary's education. In those days it <lb/>
was not thought necessary that girls should learn <lb/>
much; Mary was taught to read the Bible and to say <lb/>
her prayers morning and evening, but otherwise was <lb/>
allowed to grow up a wild creature. As a little girl of <lb/>
seven or eight she pulled the fruit for preserving, <lb/>
shelled the peas and beans, fed the poultry, and looked <lb/>
after the dairy. She did not care for dolls, and had no <lb/>
one to play with her, for her only brother was some <lb/>
years older; but she was very happy in the garden, and <lb/>
loved to watch the birds and learnt to know them by <lb/>
their flight.</p>
<p>When her father came home from sea, he was shocked <lb/>
to find Mary, who was then nearly nine years old, such <lb/>
a savage. She had not yet been taught to write, but <lb/>
she used to read the "Arabian Nights," "Robinson <lb/>
Crusoe," and the "Pilgrim's Progress." He was horrified <lb/>
too at her strong Scotch accent, and made her read <lb/>
aloud to him that he might correct it. This she found <lb/>
<pb n="99" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0107"/>
a great trial, but she delighted in helping her father in <lb/>
the care of his garden, to which he was devoted. He at <lb/>

</figure>
last felt that something more must be done to educate <lb/>
her, and said to her mother: "Mary must at least know <lb/>
how to write and keep accounts." So at ten years old <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0108"/>
she was sent to a boarding school. The change from <lb/>
her wild, free life made her wretched, and she spent <lb/>
her days in tears. They were very particular in those <lb/>
days that a girl's figure should be straight, and used <lb/>
strange means to ensure this. Mary was perfectly <lb/>
straight and well-made, but she was enclosed in stiff <lb/>
stays with a steel busk; bands were fastened over her <lb/>

frock to make her shoulder-blades meet at the back, <lb/>
and a sort of steel collar was put under her chin, <lb/>
supported on a rod which was fastened to the busk in <lb/>
her stays. Under these uncomfortable conditions, she <lb/>
and the other girls of her age had to do their lessons. <lb/>
These lessons were far from interesting. The chief <lb/>
thing she had to do was to learn by heart a page of <lb/>
Johnson's Dictionary, so as to be able, not only to spell <lb/>
all the words and give their meaning, but to repeat <lb/>
the page quickly. She also learnt to write, and was <lb/>
taught a little French and English grammar.</p>
<p>A year at this school was supposed to finish her <lb/>
education, and it is not surprising that when she got <lb/>
home again at the age of eleven she could not write <lb/>
a tidy letter. She was reproached with not having <lb/>
profited better by the money spent on keeping her at <lb/>
an expensive school; her mother said that she would <lb/>
have been content had she only learnt to write well <lb/>
and to keep accounts, as that was all a woman was <lb/>
expected to know. Mary was delighted to be free <lb/>
again, and felt like a wild animal escaped out of a <lb/>
cage. She spent hours on the seashore studying the <lb/>
shells and the stones, and watching the crabs and <reg orig="jelly-|fish">jellyfish</reg>. <lb/>
When bad weather kept her indoors, she read <lb/>
every book she could find, and especially delighted in <lb/>
Shakespeare, but an aunt who visited them found fault <lb/>
with her mother for letting her spend so much time in <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0109"/>
reading, and she was sent to the village school to learn <lb/>
plain sewing. She soon made a fine linen shirt for her <lb/>
brother so well that she was taken away from school <lb/>
and given the charge of all the house linen, which she <lb/>
had to make and to mend. But she was vexed that <lb/>
people should find fault with her reading, and thought <lb/>
it unjust that women should have been given a desire <lb/>
for knowledge, if it were wrong for them to acquire it. <lb/>
Every opportunity for study was used by her, and when <lb/>
a cousin lent her a French book, she set to work, with <lb/>
the help of a dictionary and the little grammar she had <lb/>
learnt at school, to make out the sense of it. There were <lb/>
two small globes in the house, and her mother allowed <lb/>
the village schoolmaster to come during a few weeks in <lb/>
the winter evenings to teach her how to use them. She <lb/>
loved to watch the stars from her bedroom window, <lb/>
and to find out their names on the celestial globe.</p>
<p>When Mary was thirteen, her mother spent a winter <lb/>
in Edinburgh, and then at last Mary went to a school <lb/>
where she learnt a little arithmetic and to write <lb/>
properly. An uncle gave her a piano, and she had <lb/>
lessons in playing it. When they got back to <reg orig="Burnt-|island">Burnt-island</reg> <lb/>
she used to spend four or five hours daily at her <lb/>
piano. She also began to teach herself Latin, but did <lb/>
not dare to tell this to any one till she went to stay <lb/>
with an uncle who was very kind to her. She told <lb/>
him what she was doing, and he encouraged her by <lb/>
telling her about learned women in the past, and what <lb/>
was more, read Virgil with her in his study every <lb/>
morning for an hour or two. Whilst staying with <lb/>
another uncle in Edinburgh, she attended a dancing <lb/>
school, and learnt to dance minuets and reels. Party <lb/>
politics were violent in those days, and Mary's father <lb/>
and uncle were strong Tories. She heard such bitter <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0110"/>
abuse of the Liberals that her sense of justice was <lb/>
revolted, and she adopted Liberal opinions, which she <lb/>
stuck to all her life.</p>
<p>Mary Fairfax was probably about fifteen when one <lb/>
day a friend showed her a monthly magazine <reg orig="con-|taining">containing</reg> <lb/>
coloured pictures of ladies' dresses and puzzles. <lb/>
She was surprised to see strange lines mixed up with <lb/>
letters in the puzzles in a way that she could not <lb/>
understand, and asked her friend what they were. She <lb/>
was told that they were a kind of arithmetic called <lb/>
algebra, but her friend could not tell her what algebra <lb/>
was. On going home she looked amongst the family <lb/>
books to see if there was one which would explain <lb/>
algebra. She could only find one about navigation, <lb/>
which she studied, though she could but dimly <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg> <lb/>
it. She had no one of whom she could ask <lb/>
questions, and knew that she would only be laughed at <lb/>
if she spoke of her desire for knowledge, so that she <lb/>
often felt sad and forlorn. But she managed to teach <lb/>
herself enough Greek to read Xenophon and Herodotus. <lb/>
The next winter she spent in Edinburgh again and <lb/>
was sent to a drawing school, and got on well with <lb/>
drawing; but it was not till the following summer, <lb/>
when her youngest brother was studying with a tutor, <lb/>
that she ventured to ask the tutor to get her books <lb/>
about algebra and Euclid, and she was able to begin <lb/>
the studies which were to make her famous as a <reg orig="mathe-|matician">mathematician</reg>. <lb/>
She worked very hard, for she had many <lb/>
household duties to perform, and to spend much time <lb/>
on music and painting, which were the only studies <lb/>
of which her mother approved. She could only study <lb/>
mathematics by sitting up late at night, and burnt <lb/>
so many candles that the servants complained to her <lb/>
mother, and her candle was ordered to be taken away <lb/>
<pb n="103" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0111"/>
when she went to bed. Then she used to keep up her <lb/>
studies by going over in the dark what she had already <lb/>
learnt.</p>
<p>By this time Mary was grown up, and was a <reg orig="remark-|ably">remarkably</reg> <lb/>
pretty girl, very small and delicate-looking. She <lb/>
began to go out to parties in Edinburgh, which she <lb/>
much enjoyed, and where she was much admired; but <lb/>
all the time she never lost sight of what she felt to <lb/>
be the main object of her life, the pursuit of her <lb/>
studies. She painted at the art school, she practised <lb/>
her piano for five hours every day, she made all <lb/>
her own dresses, even her ball dresses, she spent her <lb/>
evenings working and talking with her mother. To <lb/>
get time for her other studies, she used to rise at <lb/>
daybreak, and, after dressing, wrapt herself in a blanket <lb/>
to keep warm, and read algebra or classics till <reg orig="break-|fast">breakfast</reg> <lb/>
time. So amidst difficulties of all kinds she <lb/>
struggled on with her studies; no one, except her <lb/>
uncle Dr. Somerville, ever gave her any help or <reg orig="en-|couragement">encouragement</reg>.</p>
<p>When she was twenty-four, Mary Fairfax married <lb/>
her cousin, Samuel Grieg, and went to live in London. <lb/>
Her husband was out at his work all day and she had <lb/>
plenty of time for her studies. But though he did <lb/>
not interfere with what she did, he gave her no help <lb/>
or encouragement. He knew nothing of science himself, <lb/>
and did not believe that women were capable of <reg orig="in-|tellectual">intellectual</reg> <lb/>
work. She struggled on as best she could <lb/>
and took lessons in French so as to learn to speak it. <lb/>
After three years her husband died, leaving her with <lb/>
two little boys, one of whom did not live to grow up. <lb/>
Mary went back to live with her parents; she cared <lb/>
for her children with the utmost tenderness, but she <lb/>
still devoted herself to her mathematical studies, and <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0112"/>
she was able to get advice and help from a professor in <lb/>
Edinburgh. To get time to study she still rose early, <lb/>
for during most of the day she was busy with her <lb/>
children, and the evening she devoted to her father. <lb/>
People thought her queer and foolish, because she did <lb/>
not go into society; but she did not care for their <lb/>
criticisms, and made real progress in her studies.</p>
<p>She had several proposals of marriage, but refused <lb/>
them all till, in 1812, she agreed to marry her cousin, <lb/>
Dr. William Somerville, son of the uncle who had been <lb/>
the only person to help her in her studies when she <lb/>
was a girl. When her engagement was known, one <lb/>
of Dr. Somerville's sisters, who was younger than <lb/>
herself and unmarried, wrote to her saying she "hoped <lb/>
she would give up her foolish manner of life and studies <lb/>
and make a respectable and useful wife to her brother." <lb/>
This made Dr. Somerville very indignant, and he wrote <lb/>
a severe and angry letter to his sister. After this none <lb/>
of his family dared to interfere with his wife again. <lb/>
His father was delighted with his choice, for he <reg orig="under-|stood">understood</reg> <lb/>
and loved his niece. Some of the family were <lb/>
much astonished, when in the summer after the marriage <lb/>
they were staying together in the lakes, and one of <lb/>
them fell ill and expressed a wish for currant jelly, to <lb/>
find that Mrs. Somerville, in spite of her learning, was <lb/>
able at once to make some excellent jelly.</p>
<p>The marriage was an absolutely happy one. Dr. <lb/>
Somerville loved and admired his wife and was very <lb/>
proud of her learning. For the first time she had <reg orig="en-|couragement">encouragement</reg> <lb/>
to pursue her studies instead of having <lb/>
obstacles thrown in her way. At first they lived in <reg orig="Edin-|burgh">Edinburgh</reg>, <lb/>
but, in 1816, Dr. Somerville received an <reg orig="appoint-|ment">appointment</reg> <lb/>
in London, and they moved there and settled in <lb/>
Hanover Square. Many friends gathered round them, <lb/>
<pb n="105" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0113"/>
and Mrs. Somerville enjoyed intercourse with other <lb/>
learned people, especially with Sir William Herschel, the <lb/>
great astronomer. She not only went on with her <reg orig="scien-|tific">scientific</reg> <lb/>
studies, but she took lessons in painting. She and <lb/>
her husband enjoyed making together a collection of <lb/>
minerals. They added to it on their travels in France <lb/>
and Italy, which were an immense delight to her. <lb/>
Several children were born to Mrs. Somerville, but only <lb/>
one son of her first marriage and two daughters of her <lb/>
second marriage lived to grow up. She was a devoted <lb/>
mother, and gave much time to the care of her children. <lb/>
She gave her morning hours to domestic duties, and <lb/>
was determined that her daughters should not suffer <lb/>
as she had done from want of a good education. She <lb/>
taught them herself all the subjects she was able to <lb/>
teach, giving three hours to their lessons every morning. <lb/>
Her house was carefully managed, and she used to read <lb/>
the newspapers diligently as she was keenly interested <lb/>
in politics; she read, too, all the most important new <lb/>
books on all kinds of subjects. Science was her special <lb/>
study, but she loved poetry and read all the great <lb/>
authors in Latin and Greek as well as in French and <lb/>
Italian. She was very fond of music and devoted to <lb/>
painting, and was very clever and neat with her needle, <lb/>
and she also enjoyed society very much. Miss <reg orig="Edge-|worth">Edgeworth</reg>, <lb/>
the novelist, after meeting her in 1822, described <lb/>
her as small and slight, with smiling eyes and a <reg orig="charm-|ing">charming</reg> <lb/>
face, quiet and modest in her ways, with a very <lb/>
soft voice and a pleasant Scotch accent. She said <lb/>
of her: "While her head is among the stars her feet <lb/>
are firm upon the earth."</p>
<p>Mrs. Somerville never herself introduced learned <reg orig="sub-|jects">subjects</reg> <lb/>
into general talk, but when others did she spoke <lb/>
of them simply and naturally without assuming any <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0114"/>
superior knowledge. Yet, of course, other learned people <lb/>
soon found out how much she knew. When she was <lb/>
in Edinburgh, she had written, at the request of the <lb/>
editor, a learned article on comets for the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly <lb/>
Review</hi>, but she had no idea of writing any book till, <lb/>
in 1827, a letter came from Lord Brougham to Dr. <lb/>
Somerville asking whether Mrs. Somerville would write, <lb/>
for a series he was interested in, a book on a very <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg> <lb/>
French work about the stars written by the <lb/>
famous astronomer, La Place. Mrs. Somerville had met <lb/>
La Place in Paris; he had said of her that she was the <lb/>
only woman who could understand his works, and Lord <lb/>
Brougham wrote that she was the only person who could <lb/>
write the book he wanted, and if she would not write <lb/>
it, it must be left undone. Mrs. Somerville writes <lb/>
herself that she was surprised beyond expression by <lb/>
this letter. She thought Lord Brougham must be <lb/>
mistaken as to her powers, and that it would be very <lb/>
presumptuous in her "to attempt to write on such <lb/>
a subject or indeed on any other." However, Lord <lb/>
Brougham called in person to press his request, and at <lb/>
last she agreed, on condition that no one should know <lb/>
what she was trying to do, and that if she failed the <lb/>
manuscript should be put into the fire.</p>
<p>She had now to try to make time for more work in <lb/>
her busy life. This she did by getting up earlier to see <lb/>
to her household duties, but she was much disturbed by <lb/>
interruptions. People did not think that a woman was <lb/>
like a man and could have any real work to do. <reg orig="Fre-|quently">Frequently</reg> <lb/>
friends or relations would arrive when she was in <lb/>
the midst of a difficult problem and say, "I have come <lb/>
to spend a few hours with you." She had no other room <lb/>
to work in but the drawing-room, and as soon as the <lb/>
bell warned her of a visitor, she used to cover up her <lb/>
<pb n="107" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0115"/>
books and papers with a piece of muslin so that no one <lb/>
should know what she was doing. She learnt by habit <lb/>
to put up with interruptions, and to go back at once <lb/>
when alone again, to the point where she had left off. <lb/>
She did her work in the same room where her children <lb/>
prepared their lessons after she had taught them, and <lb/>
she was never impatient when they brought their little <lb/>
difficulties to her, but answered them quickly and <lb/>
quietly and went back to her own work. She could <lb/>
so abstract her mind that even talking or practising <lb/>
on the piano did not disturb her.</p>
<p>When the book was finished and sent to be looked at, <lb/>
Mrs. Somerville felt very nervous as to what might be <lb/>
thought of it. It made her very happy and proud <lb/>
when the great astronomer, Sir John Herschel, wrote <lb/>
to say that he had read it with the highest admiration, <lb/>
and added: "Go on thus and you will leave a memorial <lb/>
of no common kind to posterity; and, what you will <lb/>
value far more than fame, you will have accomplished <lb/>
a most useful work." Her book was received with <reg orig="im-|mense">immense</reg> <lb/>
praise. The scientific societies hastened to show <lb/>
her honour; her bust was ordered to be executed by the <lb/>
great sculptor, Chantrey, and placed in the hall of the <lb/>
Royal Society of London, and at the prime minister's <lb/>
request, the king granted her a pension of &pound;200 a year. <lb/>
The relations who had found fault with her ways were <lb/>
now astonished at her success, and were loud in her <lb/>
praise; but most of all she valued the deep delight of <lb/>
her husband, who had always encouraged her, and <lb/>
whose pride in her knew no bounds.</p>
<p>After this success other scientific books were written <lb/>
by Mrs. Somerville. Much of her work was done in <lb/>
Italy, where they went on account of Dr. Somerville's <lb/>
health. In Rome, as in London, Mrs. Somerville never <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0116"/>
allowed anything to interfere with her morning's work, <lb/>
but in the afternoon she enjoyed keenly going about to <lb/>
see the wonderful sights of the city or making excursions <lb/>
into the country. She wrote to her son in 1841 that <lb/>
she had undertaken a book more fit for the combination <lb/>
of a society than for a single hand to accomplish. This <lb/>
was her book on Physical Geography, with which she <lb/>
was at first so dissatisfied that she wished to burn it. <lb/>
But her husband begged her to send it to Sir John <lb/>
Herschel, who advised that it should be published, <lb/>
and it went through six editions.</p>
<p>In 1860, Mrs. Somerville had the great sorrow of <lb/>
losing her husband, who died in Florence at the age of <lb/>
eighty-nine. One who knew them well and had only <lb/>
lately seen them together, spoke of them as giving the <lb/>
most beautiful instance of united old age. Mrs. <reg orig="Somer-|ville">Somerville</reg> <lb/>
continued to live in Italy with her two daughters, <lb/>
first in Spezzia and afterwards in Naples. To the last <lb/>
she worked on, writing a new book, bringing out new <lb/>
editions of her old books, and working at them so as to <lb/>
include in them the latest scientific discoveries. She <lb/>
used to study in bed every day from eight in the morning <lb/>
till twelve or one o'clock. A little bird, a mountain <lb/>
sparrow, was her constant companion for eight years <lb/>
and would sit and even go to sleep on her arm whilst <lb/>
she wrote. It was a real sorrow when one day it <reg orig="dis-|appeared">disappeared</reg> <lb/>
and was found drowned in a water jug. She <lb/>
still painted, and enjoyed sketching the beautiful view <lb/>
that could be seen from her windows.</p>
<p>In 1869 there was an agitation in England to gain for <lb/>
women the right to vote in Parliamentary elections. <lb/>
Mrs. Somerville thought decidedly that women ought to <lb/>
have the vote and signed petitions for it, and she felt it <lb/>
to be an honour to be put on the General Committee <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0117"/>
for Woman Suffrage in London. She thought that in <lb/>
many ways the laws were unjust to women, and also <lb/>
that there was still a strong prejudice against the higher <lb/>
education of women. She was much interested in all <lb/>
that was being done in England to improve girls' <reg orig="edu-|cation">education</reg>, <lb/>
remembering well her own difficulties as a girl, <lb/>
and heard with much delight of the establishment of <lb/>
<figure id="f24" rend="block" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0117">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">Somerville College, Oxford.</hi></head>
</figure>
the women's colleges at Cambridge. After her death <lb/>
one of the first women's colleges at Oxford was named <lb/>
after her, Somerville College. In 1868 she was much <lb/>
interested in a tremendous eruption of Mount Vesuvius, <lb/>
the volcano which she could see from her windows on <lb/>
the other side of the bay of Naples. Day after day she <lb/>
watched with a telescope the glowing streams of lava <lb/>
and the flame and smoke which burst from the <reg orig="moun-|tain">mountain</reg>, <lb/>
carrying with it great rocks into the air. It was <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0118"/>
a great pleasure to her to see some distinguished men <lb/>
of science, who came from England to see the eruption, <lb/>
and who spent an evening with her, during which she <lb/>
enjoyed much scientific conversation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Somerville lived to a great old age. When she <lb/>
was ninety her eyesight and the powers of her mind <lb/>
were still perfectly good. She still studied science and <lb/>
the higher mathematics in the early morning hours, <lb/>
afterwards she would read Shakespeare or Dante, or <lb/>
Homer in the original. She regularly read the <reg orig="news-|papers">newspapers</reg>, <lb/>
and enjoyed a cheerful novel in the evening, <lb/>
or a game of bezique with her daughters. It was for her <lb/>
a constant joy to watch the sunsets over the bay of <lb/>
Naples; the flowers or seaweeds which her daughters <lb/>
brought in from their walks, or the tame birds she had <lb/>
in her room, were always a delight. She had ever been <lb/>
deeply religious, and everything in nature spoke to her <lb/>
of the great God who had created all things, whilst the <lb/>
laws which were revealed to her in her scientific studies <lb/>
gave her ever new cause to love and adore her heavenly <lb/>
Father. Friends from England and Italy came often <lb/>
to see her, for she was much beloved. Her only <lb/>
infirmity was that she was very deaf; but no one, young <lb/>
or old, thought it a hardship to sit by the little, <lb/>
sweet, frail old lady and tell her about the things <lb/>
that were going on in the world outside in which she <lb/>
still took so keen an interest. Even when she was <lb/>
ninety-two she would drive out sometimes for several <lb/>
hours. She often forgot recent events and the names <lb/>
of people, but she wrote herself at the age of ninety-two: <lb/>
"I am still able to read books on the higher algebra for <lb/>
four or five hours in the morning, and even to solve the <lb/>
problems. Sometimes I find them difficult, but my old <lb/>
obstinacy remains, for if I do not succeed to-day <lb/>
<pb n="111" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0119"/>
I attack them again on the morrow. I also enjoy <lb/>
reading about all the new discoveries and theories in <lb/>
the scientific world and in all branches of science." She <lb/>
thought much of the last journey that lay before her, <lb/>
but wrote that it did not disturb her tranquillity, for <lb/>
though deeply sensible of her utter unworthiness, she <lb/>
trusted in the infinite mercy of her Almighty Creator. <lb/>
Tended by the loving care of her daughters, she was <lb/>
perfectly happy. Her beautiful life ended in perfect <lb/>
peace and her pure spirit passed away so gently that <lb/>
those around her scarcely perceived that she had left <lb/>
them. She died in her sleep one morning at the age <lb/>
of ninety-two.</p>

JULIA SELINA INGLIS</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">There</hi> were many brave Englishwomen in India during <lb/>
the terrible days of the Indian mutiny, many as brave <lb/>
as Mrs. Inglis, but we are able to know what she went <lb/>
through at the time, because of the diary which she kept <lb/>
and in which she wrote down what happened day after <lb/>
day, and in reading about her adventures we can <reg orig="im-|agine">imagine</reg> <lb/>
something of what others suffered. She was the <lb/>
daughter of a great lawyer, who became Lord Chancellor <lb/>
and the first Lord Chelmsford, and when she was <reg orig="twenty-|eight">twenty-eight</reg> <lb/>
she married Colonel Inglis, a brave soldier, and <lb/>
went out with him to India. Six years afterwards the <lb/>
mutiny broke out, caused by the discontent of the native <lb/>
troops, who turned upon their English officers. Lucknow <lb/>
was in the heart of the most disaffected district. <lb/>
Lieutenant-Colonel Inglis had gone there with his <reg orig="regi-|ment">regiment</reg>, <lb/>
the 32nd, in January 1857; his wife and their <lb/>
three little boys were with him, and they lived together <lb/>
in a pleasant little bungalow. Sir Henry Lawrence was <lb/>
the Commissioner, as the governor of a district of India <lb/>
was called. He was very anxious about the state of <lb/>
affairs, and as the months passed and news came to <lb/>
Lucknow of the outbreak of the mutiny in other parts, <lb/>
he daily expected that the native troops in Lucknow <lb/>
would mutiny also. On the 16th May they heard that <lb/>
the great city of Delhi was in the hands of the <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0121"/>
mutineers. Then Sir Henry Lawrence ordered that <lb/>
the wives and children of the officers at Lucknow should <lb/>
leave their own houses and come into the Residency, the <lb/>
place in the centre of the city where the Commissioner <lb/>
lived, and near which the troops were quartered. This <lb/>
he thought he could defend against the natives if they <lb/>
should mutiny. He invited the ladies belonging to the <lb/>
32nd regiment to stay in his house that they might be <lb/>
near their husbands.</p>
<p>Mrs. Inglis got herself and her children ready as <lb/>
quickly as possible, and then rode up and down the road <lb/>
outside her house waiting for the officer who was to <lb/>
escort them. It was an hour before Colonel Case arrived <lb/>
with a troop of cavalry. He rode in front and Mrs. <lb/>
Inglis followed on her pony with the other ladies and <lb/>
the children behind them. The city was as quiet as if <lb/>
it were asleep, and they reached Sir Henry Lawrence's <lb/>
house in safety. Mrs. Inglis writes: "I think it was <lb/>
the longest day I ever passed, as, of course, we could <lb/>
settle to nothing. John &lsqb;her husband&rsqb; came in the <lb/>
evening and read the service with me; he told me he <lb/>
did not think we should ever return to our house." <lb/>
At dinner she sat next Sir Henry, who was very grave <lb/>
and silent. About 130 English women and children <lb/>
took refuge in the Residency, and were given rooms <lb/>
in the different houses and offices there. In Sir Henry <lb/>
Lawrence's house there were eleven ladies and fifteen <lb/>
children, and in spite of all he had to do, he took <lb/>
endless trouble to make them comfortable. Mrs. Inglis <lb/>
had a small room for herself and her three children. <lb/>
Colonel Inglis had to stay with his soldiers, and she <lb/>
used to drive with her friend Mrs. Case to camp that <lb/>
they might spend a little time each day with their <lb/>
husbands. These visits were a great treat to them, <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0122"/>
but they had to return before dusk, and even so, <lb/>
driving through the city was not very prudent, as there <lb/>
were many ill-looking men about. Mrs. Inglis drove <lb/>
her pony herself and went at a very good pace. At first <lb/>
she was cheerful enough and inclined to laugh at the <lb/>
absurd reports that reached them, till her husband <lb/>
checked her, saying, "It's no laughing matter, the <lb/>
most dreadful reports reach us daily." From that <lb/>
moment she realised the true seriousness of their <lb/>
position. The very next day she was just going to bed <lb/>
when a gentleman knocked at her door and bade her <lb/>
bring her children and come up to the top of the house <lb/>
immediately. She dressed them as quickly as possible <lb/>
and hurried to the roof and found all the inmates of the <lb/>
house gathered together looking towards the camp where <lb/>
many fires were blazing. The chaplain offered prayer, <lb/>
and the men prepared to defend the position in case <lb/>
they were attacked. At midnight a note came to Mrs. <lb/>
Inglis from her husband, and every one crowded round <lb/>
her to hear the news. He said that for the moment <lb/>
the rising was over, and he did not think that it had <lb/>
been general. Then they all lay down to rest. But at <lb/>
noon the next day, they heard of a rising all over the <lb/>
city, and every one was bidden to come to the Residency <lb/>
for safety. There was terrible confusion and <reg orig="excite-|ment">excitement</reg>, <lb/>
every one fearing the worst. A few minutes' talk <lb/>
with her husband, who came in the evening, was a great <lb/>
comfort to Mrs. Inglis. She had to share her small <lb/>
room now with her friend Mrs. Case and her sister. <lb/>
Everything possible was done to strengthen their <lb/>
position. About 765 native troops had remained <lb/>
faithful, and they with 927 European troops were <lb/>
quartered in houses all round the Residency, which <lb/>
were connected by a hastily built wall. Many native <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0123"/>
servants were faithful to their masters, and Mrs. Inglis <lb/>
had a devoted native butler and nurse, who did all they <lb/>
could to help her. Her husband had a little room in <lb/>
the house, so she could see him sometimes for a few <lb/>
minutes, but he was terribly busy. Morning and <lb/>
evening the chaplain read prayers, and every Sunday <lb/>
there were services, which were a great comfort.</p>
<p>On June 13th, Mrs. Inglis asked her husband if he <lb/>
thought the enemy would attack them and if they would <lb/>
be able to hold out. He answered that he believed that <lb/>
they would be attacked, that their position was a bad one, <lb/>
and they would have a hard struggle. She says she <lb/>
was glad to know what to expect, as it enabled her to <lb/>
prepare for the worst. She describes their life as most <lb/>
wearisome. The heat was very great; it was impossible <lb/>
to read much, but they occupied their time in making <lb/>
clothes for the refugees, and this employment was a <lb/>
comfort. She always slept with her children on the <lb/>
roof of the house, and the nights in the open air were <lb/>
very pleasant. The view of the city and the country <lb/>
around was very beautiful, and so calm and peaceful <lb/>
that it was impossible to think it could be the scene <lb/>
of war. Colonel Inglis slept in the garden with the <lb/>
soldiers. Occasionally he managed to come during the <lb/>
day into his wife's room for a few minutes. She never <lb/>
left the house, except once for a walk with the chaplain <lb/>
to see the fortifications. The church was used for <lb/>
service for the last time on June 14th, after that it was <lb/>
turned into a storehouse for grain. Mrs. Inglis herself <lb/>
laid in all the stores she could get, sugar, arrowroot, <lb/>
beer, wine, and food for the goats who supplied milk <lb/>
for the children.</p>
<p>About this time Mrs. Inglis began to feel ill, and it <lb/>
was discovered that she had the smallpox. She wished <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0124"/>
to be moved to a tent so as not to expose others to <reg orig="infec-|tion">infection</reg>, <lb/>
but it was decided that the risk would be too great; <lb/>
for it was known that a great force of rebels were <reg orig="ap-|proaching">approaching</reg> <lb/>
the city, and that they would soon be besieged. <lb/>
All the troops in Lucknow were now brought in from <lb/>
the camp and stationed in and about the Residency and <lb/>
a fort near by. Then, on June 30th, some of them were <lb/>
ordered out to meet and drive back the rebels. But <lb/>
the natives with the guns proved faithless and deserted <lb/>
the English, so that the force had to retreat. Mrs. Inglis, <lb/>
ill though she was, could not stay in bed, and posted <lb/>
herself at the window to see the sad sight of the troops <lb/>
straggling back in twos and threes. She and her friend <lb/>
Mrs. Case were in terrible anxiety about their husbands. <lb/>
Just then Colonel Inglis came in; he was crying, and, <lb/>
after kissing his wife, he turned to Mrs. Case and said, <lb/>
"Poor Case." Mrs. Inglis writes that never will she <lb/>
forget the shock of his words, nor the cry of agony from <lb/>
his widow. Colonel Inglis had to leave them at once. <lb/>
In all the horror of the moment there was no time for <lb/>
thought. The rebels were firing heavily on the <reg orig="Resi-|dency">Residency</reg>, <lb/>
and the room was not safe. Hastily collecting <lb/>
a few necessaries, Mrs. Inglis and her children took <reg orig="re-|fuge">refuge</reg> <lb/>
with the other ladies in a room below, which was <lb/>
almost underground; the shot was flying about so <lb/>
quickly that they could not venture out, and not long <lb/>
after they had left their room upstairs a shell fell into <lb/>
it. Fortunately her native servants were faithful, and <lb/>
brought them food during the day.</p>
<p>At night the firing grew less, and Colonel Inglis came <lb/>
in to take them over to a room he had prepared for <lb/>
them in a building which had been the gaol, and which <lb/>
was fairly safe. It was only 12 ft. by 6, and there she <lb/>
and her children stayed with Mrs. Case and her sister. <lb/>
<pb n="117" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0125"/>
They were all so worn out with wretchedness that <lb/>
they slept that night. Next day they did what they <lb/>
could to make their room comfortable. It had neither <lb/>
doors nor windows, only open arches, and they hung up <lb/>
<figure id="f25" rend="block" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0125">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">The Gateway of the Residency, Lucknow, showing marks <lb/>
of Shot and Shell on the Brickwork.</hi></head>
</figure>
curtains to make some sort of privacy. Though the <lb/>
smallpox was then at its height, Mrs. Inglis suffered <lb/>
no harm from the anxieties of that terrible day; but <lb/>
she was alarmed lest her children should catch the <lb/>
disease, as she could not keep them from her bed. But <lb/>
fortunately they did not take any harm, and she seems <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0126"/>
to have recovered quickly. There were two wells in <lb/>
their courtyard, so that they had a plentiful supply <lb/>
of water, and for the moment there was plenty of <lb/>
food.</p>
<p>The next day another terrible attack was made by <lb/>
the rebels. As they sat trembling in the midst of the <lb/>
heavy cannonading, feeling sure that the enemy must <lb/>
get in, Mrs. Case proposed that they should say the <lb/>
litany, which they did, she and her sister kneeling by <lb/>
Mrs. Inglis's bed. Mrs. Inglis writes that the soothing <lb/>
effect was marvellous; they grew calm in spite of their <lb/>
alarm. Next morning Sir Henry Lawrence was wounded <lb/>
by a shell that burst into his room. There was no hope <lb/>
of his recovery, and after three days of awful suffering, <lb/>
nobly borne, he died, leaving the entire command to <lb/>
Colonel Inglis. Day after day one or other of the little <lb/>
garrison or of the women were hit by shells. The <lb/>
chaplain was shot whilst shaving one morning. Mrs. <lb/>
Inglis watched anxiously over her children, who grew <lb/>
pale and thin from the confinement and the terrible <lb/>
heat. July 16th, was her little boy's birthday, and she <lb/>
thought sadly of the other children of his father's <reg orig="regi-|ment">regiment</reg> <lb/>
who on that day used to have a dinner and a <lb/>
dance in his honour. She did not know that on that <lb/>
very day those other poor children were murdered by <lb/>
the rebels at Cawnpore.</p>
<p>Every day the anxiety grew. They had hoped before <lb/>
this to hear of English troops coming to relieve them, <lb/>
but no news came. There was nothing to be done but <lb/>
to wait and try to keep back the rebels, whose attacks <lb/>
were constant. Death was always near. One evening <lb/>
Mrs. Inglis was standing outside the door with her baby <lb/>
in her arms when she heard something whiz past her <lb/>
ears. She rushed inside, and afterwards found a piece <lb/>
<pb n="119" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0127"/>
of shell buried in the ground just where she had been <lb/>
standing. Her children were her greatest comfort, and <lb/>
as she had them to amuse and look after she never had <lb/>
an idle moment. Sometimes she tried to read aloud, <lb/>
but it was impossible for them to fix their minds on a <lb/>
book. In their games the children would imitate what <lb/>
was going on around them. They made balls of earth <lb/>
and threw them against the wall saying that they were <lb/>
shells bursting. Johnny, the eldest boy, would hear <lb/>
where a bullet fell and run and pick it up whilst it was <lb/>
still warm. They slept through all the firing and never <lb/>
seemed frightened.</p>
<p>Sunday services were regularly held, and again and <lb/>
again at the worst moments prayer was their only <reg orig="sup-|port">support</reg>. <lb/>
Mrs. Inglis used to visit the other ladies as much <lb/>
as she could; and, being of a hopeful nature herself, <lb/>
managed to raise their spirits. Her own best moment <lb/>
in the day was in the early morning, when her husband <lb/>
used to come to see her and sit outside her door <reg orig="drink-|ing">drinking</reg> <lb/>
his tea. One day a shell burst in their own <reg orig="court-|yard">courtyard</reg>; <lb/>
the children were playing about and for a moment <lb/>
her anxiety was intense, till she saw that they were all <lb/>
safe. Tales of hairbreadth escapes were heard daily; one <lb/>
doctor had his pillow under his head shot without his <lb/>
being hurt. But there were many who did not escape <lb/>
and the condition of the wounded in the heat and the <lb/>
crowded hospital left little hope of recovery. Anxiety <lb/>
and constant work turned Colonel Inglis's hair grey <lb/>
during the long suspense. Their position was growing <lb/>
desperate. He knew that General Havelock was trying <lb/>
to fight his way through the rebels and come to their <lb/>
help, for a native spy carried letters between the two <lb/>
commanders, written in Greek characters and rolled <lb/>
up and hidden in a quill. General Havelock wished <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0128"/>
Colonel Inglis to be ready to help his approach by an <lb/>
attack from inside, but Colonel Inglis was obliged to <lb/>
write on August 16th, after more than six weeks of siege, <lb/>
that this was impossible, owing to the weak condition <lb/>
of his shattered force. Food was growing scarce, and <lb/>
there was much sickness. On one evening five babies <lb/>
were buried.</p>
<p>It was not till near the end of September that the <lb/>
sound of distant guns struck Mrs. Inglis's ear one day <lb/>
and told her that relief was near. Each boom seemed <lb/>
to her to say, "We are coming to save you." Five <lb/>
days afterwards, on September 25th, at six in the <lb/>
evening, she heard tremendous cheering and knew that <lb/>
the relief had come. She was standing outside her <lb/>
door, when a soldier came rushing up to fetch the <lb/>
Colonel's sword, which he had not worn since the <lb/>
siege began. A few minutes afterwards the Colonel <lb/>
himself entered, bringing with him Colonel Havelock, <lb/>
a short grey-haired man. He had fought his way in <lb/>
with the relief force. He shook hands with Mrs. <lb/>
Inglis, saying that he feared she had suffered a great <lb/>
deal. She could hardly speak to answer him, and only <lb/>
longed to be alone with her husband. Colonel Inglis <lb/>
felt the same, and after taking Havelock out, returned <lb/>
in a few minutes, and, kissing her, exclaimed, "Thank <lb/>
God for this." For a brief moment there was unmixed <lb/>
happiness. Then the thought rushed into her mind <lb/>
of all the others whose lot was so different from hers <lb/>
and whose dear ones had perished in the siege.</p>
<p>A moment later a messenger came asking if they <lb/>
had any cold meat for starving officers, and very soon <lb/>
Mrs. Inglis learnt how severely those who had come to <lb/>
their rescue had suffered as they fought their way in <lb/>
through the narrow streets of the town. She also heard <lb/>
<pb n="121" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0129"/>
of the wonderful scene when they at last got in and <lb/>
met the besieged. On all sides were hand-shakings <lb/>
and warm greetings, the relieving soldiers lifting the <lb/>
children of the besieged in their arms and kissing them. <lb/>
But little by little Mrs. Inglis realised that, though <lb/>
relieved, they were not rescued. The soldiers who had <lb/>
fought their way in under Outram and Havelock were <lb/>
not enough to drive back the enemy or even to take <lb/>
the women and children safely out of Lucknow. They <lb/>
were only able to help them to resist the besiegers, and <lb/>
their presence increased the anxiety about the supply <lb/>
of food, which was getting very low and had to be <lb/>
used with the greatest care. The number of wounded <lb/>
was also terribly increased, and the state of the <reg orig="over-|crowded">overcrowded</reg> <lb/>
hospital and the want of all the things needed <lb/>
for the care and comfort of the patients added greatly <lb/>
to their suffering. The only chance now was to hold <lb/>
out till the coming of Sir Colin Campbell with more <lb/>
troops, and meanwhile the attacks of the enemy <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg> <lb/>
in fury; there was constant firing and no place <lb/>
was really safe, so that Mrs. Inglis was never easy if her <lb/>
children were out of her sight.</p>
<p>During the siege, Mrs. Inglis had found a little white <lb/>
hen which used to stay about their room and be fed by <lb/>
her children. When food grew scarce they decided to kill <lb/>
and eat it; but that very morning Johnny ran in <lb/>
exclaiming, "O, mamma, the white hen has laid an egg." <lb/>
One of the officers, whose leg had been cut off, was very <lb/>
ill and weak, and Mrs. Inglis at once took the egg, a <lb/>
great luxury in those days, to him. The hen laid an <lb/>
egg for him every day till he died and then ceased <lb/>
for the rest of the siege, but they would not kill it <lb/>
after that.</p>
<p>It was not till the middle of November, seven weeks <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0130"/>
after the coming of Havelock, that they knew that <lb/>
Sir Colin Campbell was near. It was Colonel Inglis's <lb/>
birthday, and they invited another officer to dinner, and <lb/>
actually had a fruit tart for dinner, a luxury which <lb/>
Mrs. Inglis would not have dreamt of had not her hope <lb/>
of relief been high. Little Johnny ran out to call their <lb/>
guest, screaming at the top of his voice, "Come to <lb/>
dinner; we've got a pudding."</p>
<p>It was November 17th, a most anxious, exciting day, <lb/>
when Sir Colin Campbell at last reached Lucknow. <lb/>
He did not come inside the entrenchments, and when <lb/>
Colonel Inglis arrived very late to dinner it was with <lb/>
the bad news that they were all to leave the Residency <lb/>
the next evening. Sir Colin did not think he was <lb/>
strong enough to recapture the town, and felt that the <lb/>
utmost he could do was to carry off in safety the garrison <lb/>
and the women and children. It was a bitter blow to <lb/>
Colonel Inglis to be told that he must leave in the <lb/>
hands of the enemy the place which he had so long <lb/>
defended at such terrible loss. He offered to stay and <lb/>
hold it if 1000 men could be left to him and the women <lb/>
and children removed; but it was not allowed, and there <lb/>
was nothing to do but to obey. There was a hurried <lb/>
packing of all such things as could be taken with them. <lb/>
The women and children started, late on the afternoon <lb/>
of November 19th, to leave the place where they had <lb/>
been closely besieged for nearly five months. The road <lb/>
by which they were led out of the town was considered <lb/>
safe, except in three places on which the enemy were <lb/>
firing at intervals. There an officer carried the children <lb/>
and they all ran as fast as they could, but Mrs. Inglis <lb/>
did not feel in the least afraid. In a large garden in <lb/>
the outskirts of the town they found the other women <lb/>
and children, and the officers of Sir Colin Campbell's <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0131"/>
force, who were all most kind, and feasted them with <lb/>
tea and bread and butter, which were great luxuries. <lb/>
Sir Colin came and talked to Mrs. Inglis for some time <lb/>
and was most attentive, but she said that all the while <lb/>
she knew that he was wishing them very far away, and <lb/>
no wonder, for without the women and children to <lb/>
take care of, he would have been free to attack the <lb/>
enemy. It was ten at night before they started on <lb/>
their journey with an escort of soldiers. Mrs. Inglis <lb/>
with her three children and three other ladies and <lb/>
another child were squeezed tightly together in one <lb/>
bullock waggon. She had only just got her baby to <lb/>
sleep when the word halt was called, silence was <lb/>
ordered, and all lights were put out. Clearly an <lb/>
attack was feared, and she was terrified lest her baby <lb/>
should begin crying again and betray where they were. <lb/>
After waiting in absolute silence for a quarter of an <lb/>
hour, the order was given to move on, and in two hours <lb/>
they reached a camp where tents had been got ready <lb/>
for them and food prepared and they could lie down <lb/>
and sleep. Next morning some of the officers invited <lb/>
Mrs. Inglis and her friends to breakfast, and she writes <lb/>
that, though she hopes she was not very greedy, she <lb/>
much appreciated the good things with which their <lb/>
table was loaded. The next day she had the great joy <lb/>
of receiving the home letters from her mother and <lb/>
friends in England which had been accumulating for <lb/>
five months, and she was able to write home herself.</p>
<p>Colonel Inglis had been left behind to bring out <lb/>
the garrison, which he did at night without the loss <lb/>
of any men. It was an immense relief to Mrs. Inglis <lb/>
when he reached the camp in safety. The next day <lb/>
they started on their march, the great procession of <lb/>
carriages and carts with the women, children, and <lb/>
<pb n="124" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0132"/>
luggage, guarded by the soldiers. They could only <lb/>
move very slowly and often had to stop because the <lb/>
carriages and carts got hemmed together. Several <lb/>
days were spent in this way. Mrs. Inglis could not <lb/>
see her husband every day, and great was her joy when <lb/>
he could visit her for a few minutes. She tells how <lb/>
on Sundays, if he came, they read the service together, <lb/>
and how at another time she could have a quiet walk <lb/>
and talk with him. They passed through Cawnpore, <lb/>
where a bright moon shone on the ruined houses, and <lb/>
everything reminded them of the horrors that had <lb/>
taken place there a few months before, when their <lb/>
fellow-countrywomen with their children had been <lb/>
cruelly butchered by the rebels. Eighteen days after <lb/>
leaving Lucknow they reached the railway. It had <lb/>
been a most trying and fatiguing journey, especially for <lb/>
the sick and wounded, over rough roads, in crowded, <lb/>
jolting carts. The train took them to Allahabad, where <lb/>
they were received with enthusiastic cheering from <lb/>
the crowds gathered to greet them, a reception which <lb/>
Mrs. Inglis felt most overpowering. At last they were <lb/>
in a safe place and could rest. By degrees steamers <lb/>
carried them down the Ganges to Calcutta. Mrs. <lb/>
Inglis was glad to linger amongst the last, for her <lb/>
husband was at Cawnpore with the troops, and at <lb/>
Allahabad she could hear daily from him. She begged <lb/>
him to let her stay where she was, instead of going <lb/>
back to England, but he would not consent. As she <lb/>
travelled down the Ganges to Calcutta, a wearisome <lb/>
journey of three weeks in an overcrowded steamer, she <lb/>
heard from her fellow-passengers the stories of their <lb/>
hardships and losses. It was wonderful to think that <lb/>
she and her husband and three children were all safe. <lb/>
Strangely enough their dangers were not over yet, for <lb/>
<pb n="125" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0133"/>
the steamer that was taking them from Calcutta to <lb/>
England struck a rock and the passengers had to <lb/>
make their escape in small boats through the heavy <lb/>
surf. The waves were very high, and seemed as if <lb/>
they would swamp them, but little Johnny laughed <lb/>
merrily each time they broke over the boat. <reg orig="Fortu-|nately">Fortunately</reg> <lb/>
they were picked up by a passing ship, and <lb/>
ultimately reached England in safety. Colonel Inglis <lb/>
stayed for some months in Cawnpore, but then his <lb/>
health broke down, which was not surprising after the <lb/>
terrible time he had been through. He was forced to <lb/>
ask for leave and was able to join his wife in England.</p>

FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Florence Nightingale</hi>, who has done so much to <lb/>
improve the nursing of the sick, was born on May 12, <lb/>
1820, at Florence, in Italy, and was named after her <lb/>
birthplace. Her parents soon went back to live in <lb/>
England, where her father owned a country-house, <lb/>
called Lea Hurst, in Derbyshire. They spent their <lb/>
summers in Derbyshire, and in the autumn moved to <lb/>
Embley Park, in Hampshire, another house belonging <lb/>
to Mr. Nightingale. Florence grew up loving the <lb/>
country and the country people who lived round her <lb/>
home. As a little girl she was very fond of dolls, and <lb/>
used to pretend that they were ill, and nurse them, <lb/>
and bandage their broken limbs, with the greatest care <lb/>
and skill. She was devoted to animals and had many <lb/>
pets for whom she cared tenderly. Once, when she <lb/>
was out riding on her pony, she came upon an old <lb/>
shepherd whose dog had had his leg hurt by some <lb/>
mischievous boys. The shepherd thought that there <lb/>
was nothing to be done but to kill the dog to put it <lb/>
out of its misery. But Florence begged to be allowed <lb/>
to try to cure it. The leg proved not to be broken, <lb/>
and Florence poulticed it so cleverly that the dog was <lb/>
soon well again.</p>
<p>Florence was educated at home. Her father was <lb/>
very particular about her studies, and she learnt well <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0135"/>
and quickly. Even as a child she loved to visit sick <lb/>
people, and as soon as she was grown up, she spent <lb/>
<figure id="f26" rend="block" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0135">

</figure>
most of her time in the cottages and in the village <lb/>
school. The old and the sick loved her visits, and her <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0136"/>
gentle, clever ways did much to ease their suffering. <lb/>
For the children, she invented all kinds of amusements, <lb/>
and delighted in playing with them. She also held a <lb/>
Bible class for the elder girls. So far her life had been <lb/>
spent much like that of many other English girls. She <lb/>
was pretty and charming and known to be very clever; <lb/>
she had travelled a good deal, and her home-life, with <lb/>
parents who delighted in her and one sister to whom <lb/>
she was devoted, was absolutely happy. But every <lb/>
year her interest in nursing the sick grew stronger. She <lb/>
had been much impressed by meeting Elizabeth Fry, <lb/>
and by hearing from her of the Institute of Kaiserswerth <lb/>
in Germany, where deaconesses were trained for nursing <lb/>
the sick poor. In order to find out how the sick were <lb/>
nursed in her own country, she visited some of the <lb/>
chief hospitals, and was grieved to find what ignorant, <lb/>
rough women the nurses were. They had no training, <lb/>
and did little for the comfort of the patients; the <lb/>
hospitals were dirty and badly kept, and the nurses <lb/>
were much given to drinking. Miss Nightingale also <lb/>
travelled in France, Germany, and Italy to visit the <lb/>
hospitals. There she found things on the whole much <lb/>
better, as the nursing was mostly done by nuns, or <lb/>
Sisters of Charity, religious women who had given their <lb/>
lives for the service of their fellow-creatures.</p>
<p>When she was twenty-nine, Miss Nightingale decided <lb/>
to go herself to Kaiserswerth to study nursing. She <lb/>
spent only a few months there, but she was delighted <lb/>
with what she saw and learned. Many years <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
she wrote: "Never have I met with a higher love, <lb/>
a purer devotion than there. There was no neglect. <lb/>
The food was poor&mdash;no coffee but bean coffee&mdash;no luxury <lb/>
but cleanliness." She was much loved at Kaiserswerth; <lb/>
and an English lady who was there eleven years <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0137"/>
was told that many of "the sick remembered <lb/>
much of her teaching, and some died happily, blessing <lb/>
her for having led them to Jesus." Miss Nightingale <lb/>
wrote a little book about Kaiserswerth, in which she <lb/>
urged that women should be encouraged to work, and <lb/>
should be trained properly for their work. She herself <lb/>
at first used the knowledge that she had gained in <lb/>
tending the poor who lived near her own home. After <lb/>
a while, she moved to London that she might be able <lb/>
to help in other charitable work. She was interested <lb/>
in a Home that had been started for sick governesses, <lb/>
which she heard was in a very unsatisfactory <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg>, <lb/>
and went to live there herself, shutting <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
off from all society that she might care for the <lb/>
sick women in the Home, and arrange for its proper <lb/>
management. She was not at all strong, and after a <lb/>
time grew ill from the strain of too much work and <lb/>
had to go back to the country to rest.</p>
<p>It was about this time that England and France <lb/>
declared war on Russia, and the Crimean War began. <lb/>
England had not been at war for forty years, and the <lb/>
army was in no way well prepared. The country rejoiced <lb/>
to hear of the victory of the Alma won over the <lb/>
Russians, but people learnt with indignation of the <lb/>
sufferings of the soldiers after the battle. Nothing was <lb/>
ready for the care of the wounded, even food and <lb/>
clothing were scarce. Letters from the Crimea told <lb/>
terrible stories of the sufferings of the men. The <lb/>
French had fifty Sisters of Mercy to tend their sick, <lb/>
but the English had no female nurses. In the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> <lb/>
newspaper, a long letter, giving an account of the terrible <lb/>
state of things, was published, which ended with these <lb/>
words: "Are there no devoted women amongst us, <lb/>
able and willing to go forth to minister to the sick and <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0138"/>
suffering soldiers of the East in the hospitals at Scutari? <lb/>
Are none of the daughters of England, at this extreme <lb/>
hour of need, ready for such a work of mercy?" Many <lb/>
were stirred by this appeal and sent in offers of help to <lb/>
the War Office. Mr. Sidney Herbert, the Minister for <lb/>
War, was eager to send the needed help, but he felt <lb/>
that to send out women not trained for such work <lb/>
would be useless. He knew Miss Nightingale <reg orig="inti-|mately">intimately</reg>, <lb/>
and it seemed to him that she was the one <lb/>
woman in England whose character and training fitted <lb/>
her to take the lead in this matter. He got the <reg orig="per-|mission">permission</reg> <lb/>
of the government to ask her to undertake the <lb/>
post of Superintendent of Nurses for the Crimea. <lb/>
Then he wrote to her to tell her the state of affairs. A <lb/>
large barrack hospital had been set apart for the sick <lb/>
and wounded soldiers at Scutari on the Bosphorus. <lb/>
Here the wounded were brought by ship from the <lb/>
Crimea. Masses of stores were being sent out, but <lb/>
there were no female nurses, and as women had never <lb/>
been employed to nurse soldiers, there were no <reg orig="ex-|perienced">experienced</reg> <lb/>
nurses ready to go, though many devoted <lb/>
women had offered their services. Mr. Herbert felt <lb/>
that there would be great difficulty in ruling the band <lb/>
of untrained nurses, and in making the new <reg orig="arrange-|ments">arrangements</reg> <lb/>
work smoothly with the medical and military <lb/>
authorities. He told Miss Nightingale that, if she <lb/>
would go, she should have full authority over the <lb/>
nurses, and the support of the government in all she <lb/>
might wish to do. He said that the whole success of <lb/>
the plan depended upon her willingness to go, and that <lb/>
her experience, her knowledge, her place in society <lb/>
gave her the power to do this work which no one else <lb/>
possessed. In those days it was quite a new thing to <lb/>
think of a lady being a nurse at all, and quite an <lb/>
<pb n="131" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0139"/>
unheard-of thing that a lady should go to nurse soldiers. <lb/>
Mr. Herbert thought that if this new plan succeeded, it <lb/>
would do an enormous amount of good both then and <lb/>
afterwards.</p>
<p>Miss Nightingale too, had read the letter in the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and was thinking over it in her home in the <lb/>
country. Before Mr. Herbert's letter reached her, she <lb/>
wrote to him of her own accord offering her services to <lb/>
go as nurse to the hospitals at Scutari. The moment <lb/>
had come for which unconsciously she had been long <lb/>
preparing, and she was ready for the work which came <lb/>
to her. Her letter crossed Mr. Herbert's. It was <lb/>
written on October 15, 1854, and immediately it was <lb/>
announced in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> that Miss Nightingale had been <lb/>
appointed Superintendent of Nurses at Scutari. She at <lb/>
once set to work to collect the band of thirty-eight <lb/>
nurses whom she was to take out with her. There <lb/>
were a few Institutions in existence for training nurses, <lb/>
and to these Miss Nightingale appealed for volunteers. <lb/>
Twenty-four of those she took out came from such <lb/>
places. Six days after she had made her offer to go, <lb/>
she was ready to start with her band complete. They <lb/>
crossed the Channel to Boulogne, where the people <lb/>
had heard of their coming; the fishwives turned out <lb/>
to meet them, and insisted on carrying their bags <lb/>
from the boat to the train. They, too, were interested <lb/>
in the war where English and French soldiers were <lb/>
fighting side by side, and as they walked with them <lb/>
they begged the nurses to take care of any of their <lb/>
dear ones should they meet them. With tears and <lb/>
warm shakes of the hand they bade farewell to them, <lb/>
crying, "Long live the sisters," as the train carried them <lb/>
away.</p>
<p>On November 4th, Miss Nightingale and her nurses <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0140"/>
reached Scutari, where the poor men in hospital had <lb/>
heard of their coming, but could not believe the <lb/>
good news. One man cried when he saw them, <reg orig="ex-|claiming">exclaiming</reg>, <lb/>
"I can't help it when I see them. Only <lb/>
think of English women coming out here to nurse <lb/>
us! It seems so homelike and comfortable." It was <lb/>
a terrible state of things that Miss Nightingale found <lb/>
in the hospitals. The filth, misery, and disorder were <lb/>
indescribable. In the long corridors the wounded <lb/>
men lay crowded together; many of them had not <lb/>
even had their wounds dressed, nor their broken limbs <lb/>
set. There were no vessels for water, no towels or <lb/>
soap, no hospital clothes. The men lay in their <lb/>
uniforms, stiff with blood. The beds were reeking <lb/>
with infection, and rats and vermin of every kind <lb/>
swarmed over them. There was no time to plan <reg orig="re-|forms">reforms</reg> <lb/>
or to bring any order into the hospitals before <lb/>
more wounded from the battle of Inkermann arrived <lb/>
in terrible numbers, only twenty-four hours after Miss <lb/>
Nightingale had come. Her courage rose to the <lb/>
occasion, terrible though it was, and inspired her <reg orig="com-|panions">companions</reg>. <lb/>
Whilst they all worked without ceasing to <lb/>
do what they could to help the worst suffering, she, <lb/>
in the midst of all her labours, thought out what could <lb/>
be done to bring order into the awful confusion. She <lb/>
had to see that proper supplies of all the things needed <lb/>
for the comfort of the soldiers were sent out from <lb/>
England, and to make arrangements for the <reg orig="distribu-|tion">distribution</reg> <lb/>
of the stores when they arrived. Her energy and <lb/>
her disregard of some of the rules laid down by the <lb/>
military authorities about the distribution of the stores <lb/>
made some people very angry, and there was a <lb/>
good deal of grumbling at what they considered her <lb/>
unnecessary haste and her interference. But Miss <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0141"/>
<figure id="f27" rend="page" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0141">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">Florence Nightingale at Scutari&mdash;A Mission of Mercy.</hi></head>
<p>&lpar;<hi rend="italic">After the Picture by Jerry Barrett.</hi>&rpar;</p>
</figure>
<pb n="134" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0142"/>
Nightingale cared for nothing so long as she could <lb/>
do the task for which she had been sent out. She <lb/>
set up a kitchen where food could be cooked for the <lb/>
sick and wounded, and a laundry where their clothes <lb/>
could be washed and disinfected. She wrote to England <lb/>
clear accounts of the state of things she had found, <lb/>
without any grumbling, but pointed out what had to <lb/>
be done for the proper care of the men. Opposition <lb/>
to her ways disappeared as it became clear how <reg orig="ad-|mirable">admirable</reg> <lb/>
were the results of her work. She won the <lb/>
orderlies to work with the utmost patience and devotion <lb/>
under the direction of the lady nurses; so that she <lb/>
could say that not one of them failed her in obedience, <lb/>
thoughtful attention, and considerate delicacy. They <lb/>
were rough, ignorant men, but in the midst of scenes <lb/>
of loathsome disease and death they showed to Miss <lb/>
Nightingale and her nurses the most courteous chivalry <lb/>
and constant gentleness, and she never heard from <lb/>
them a word that could shock her.</p>
<p>The gratitude and devotion of the patients to her <lb/>
knew no bounds. At nights she used to pass through <lb/>
the long corridors, and the endless wards&mdash;there were <lb/>
four miles of wards in the hospital&mdash;carrying a little <lb/>
lamp in her hand, so as to see that all was well, and <lb/>
from this the patients learnt to call her "the lady of the <lb/>
lamp." They felt that she was their good angel, and <lb/>
one of them said afterwards, describing the comfort <lb/>
it was even to see her pass, "She would speak to one <lb/>
and another, and nod and smile to many more, but <lb/>
she could not do it to all for we lay there by hundreds; <lb/>
but we would kiss her shadow as it fell, and lay our <lb/>
heads on the pillow again content."</p>
<p>Huddled together in two or three damp rooms in the <lb/>
basement of the hospital, Miss Nightingale found a <lb/>
<pb n="135" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0143"/>
great number of poor women, the wives of the soldiers, <lb/>
with their babies, living in the utmost misery and <reg orig="dis-|comfort">discomfort</reg>. <lb/>
She did not rest till she had arranged better <lb/>
quarters for them. Some ladies were found to befriend <lb/>
them. Those whose husbands had been killed in the <lb/>
war were sent back to England, many were given work <lb/>
in the laundry which Miss Nightingale had started, <lb/>
and a school was opened for the children.</p>
<figure id="f28" rend="block" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0143">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">Florence Nightingale in one of the Wards of the <lb/>
Hospital at Scutari.</hi></head>
</figure>
<p>When the winter came on, the sufferings of the <lb/>
soldiers increased. The army was engaged in the siege <lb/>
of Sevastopol, and Miss Nightingale described the <reg orig="suffer-|ings">sufferings</reg> <lb/>
endured by the soldiers there in a letter to a friend: <lb/>
"Fancy working five nights out of seven in the trenches! <lb/>
Fancy being thirty-six hours in them at a stretch, with <lb/>
no food but raw salt pork sprinkled with sugar, rum, <lb/>
and biscuit; nothing hot&hellip; fancy through all this the <lb/>
army preserving their courage and patience as they <lb/>
<pb n="136" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0144"/>
have done. There is something sublime in the <reg orig="spec-|tacle">spectacle</reg>." <lb/>
The hospitals were crowded with men brought <lb/>
in ill from the results of this exposure. Early in 1855 <lb/>
fifty more trained nurses were sent out from England, <lb/>
and they came in time to help in a terrible outbreak <lb/>
of cholera which filled the hospital with new patients, <lb/>
most of whom died after a few hours' suffering. <reg orig="Frost-|bitten">Frostbitten</reg> <lb/>
men were brought in too from Sevastopol, and of <lb/>
all these sufferers at least half died in spite of the care <lb/>
of the nurses. Again and again it was Miss Nightingale <lb/>
who comforted the dying and received from them the <lb/>
last message to be sent to the dear ones at home. <lb/>
She wrote down their words and took care of their <lb/>
watches or other possessions which they wished to <lb/>
send home.</p>
<p>The hearts of people in England were stirred by all <lb/>
they heard of the sufferings of the soldiers and of the <lb/>
devotion of the nurses. Supplies of every kind were sent <lb/>
out in great quantities, and all that was needed was that <lb/>
their use should be wisely organised. Miss Nightingale <lb/>
was much helped by the arrival of M. Soyer, the famous <lb/>
French cook, who came out at his own expense to organise <lb/>
the cooking in the hospitals. He introduced new stoves <lb/>
and many reforms in the kitchens, and was a most <reg orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg> <lb/>
admirer of the Lady-in-Chief, as Miss Nightingale <lb/>
was called.</p>
<p>After six months' work at Scutari, Miss Nightingale <lb/>
set out to visit the hospitals in the Crimea itself. <lb/>
M. Soyer and several of her nurses went with her. She <lb/>
rode to the camp near Balaclava, where she could hear <lb/>
the thunder of the guns which besieged Sevastopol. As <lb/>
she passed through the camp, some of the men who had <lb/>
been her patients at Scutari recognised her, and greeted <lb/>
her with a hearty cheer. The hundreds of sick in the <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0145"/>
field hospital were delighted to receive a visit from the <lb/>
lady of whom they had heard so much. Afterwards <lb/>
she rode right up into the trenches outside Sevastopol, <lb/>
so that the sentry was alarmed at her daring. Next day <lb/>
she visited another hospital at Balaclava and left some <lb/>
of her nurses to work there. She was on board the ship <lb/>
which was to take her back to Scutari, when she was <lb/>
suddenly seized with a very bad attack of Crimean fever. <lb/>
The doctors said that she must at once be taken to the <lb/>
Sanatorium at Balaclava. Laid on a stretcher she was <lb/>
carried by the soldiers up the mountain side. For a <lb/>
few days it was thought that she was dying, but <reg orig="pre-|sently">presently</reg> <lb/>
the joyful news was spread that she was better. <lb/>
She herself says that the first thing that helped her to <lb/>
recover was her joy over a bunch of wild flowers that <lb/>
had been brought her. Whilst she lay ill she was visited <lb/>
by Lord Raglan, the Commander-in-Chief of the army, <lb/>
who wished to thank her for all that she had done for <lb/>
the troops. She would not hear of going back to <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg> <lb/>
after her illness as her friends wished, but as soon <lb/>
as possible returned to Scutari.</p>
<p>In the autumn, Sevastopol fell, and this brought the <lb/>
war to an end. But Miss Nightingale would not return <lb/>
home as the hospitals were still full of sick and wounded <lb/>
who could not be moved. She paid another visit to <lb/>
the hospitals in the Crimea, and travelled from one <lb/>
place to another over the bad mountain roads, in a <lb/>
carriage which had been specially made for her. She <lb/>
did much for the comfort of the soldiers, who had to <lb/>
stay on in the Crimea, and started libraries for them <lb/>
and reading-huts where they could go to sit and read; <lb/>
lectures and classes were also provided for them, and <lb/>
arrangements made to enable them to send home easily <lb/>
money and letters to their families.</p>
<pb n="138" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0146"/>
<p>Before she left the Crimea, Miss Nightingale set up, <lb/>
at her own cost, a white marble cross twenty feet high <lb/>
as a monument to the dead. It was dedicated to the <lb/>
memory of the soldiers who had perished and to the <lb/>
nurses who had died in tending them, and on it was <lb/>
written in English and Russian, "Lord, have mercy <lb/>
upon us."</p>
<p>From all sides she received tributes for her services. <lb/>
The Sultan gave her a diamond bracelet; Queen <lb/>
Victoria sent her a beautiful jewel specially designed <lb/>
by Prince Albert. Speaking in the House of Lords, <lb/>
Lord Ellesmere said: "The hospitals are empty. The <lb/>
angel of mercy still lingers to the last on the scene of <lb/>
her labours; but her mission is all but accomplished. <lb/>
Those long arcades of Scutari, in which dying men sat <lb/>
up to catch the sound of her footstep or the flutter of <lb/>
her dress, and fell back on the pillows content to have <lb/>
seen her shadow as it passed, are now comparatively <lb/>
deserted. She may be thinking how to escape, as best <lb/>
she may, on her return, the demonstration of a nation's <lb/>
appreciation of the deeds and motives of Florence <lb/>
Nightingale." This was just what Miss Nightingale <lb/>
wished to do. The government offered to bring her <lb/>
home in a man-of-war, but she travelled quietly back <lb/>
under the name of Miss Smith, so that her uncommon <lb/>
name might not attract attention to her. When <lb/>
she got to her own home, she went in by the back <lb/>
door. Crowds of people used to gather round the <lb/>
park in the following weeks in the hope of seeing <lb/>
her, but she refused to receive any sort of public <lb/>
welcome.</p>
<p>As soon as the war came to an end, before Miss <lb/>
Nightingale had returned home, a movement was <lb/>
started to give her a testimonial from the nation. <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0147"/>
Her friends had said that the only testimonial she <lb/>
would accept would be one which would help on the <lb/>
cause of providing trained nurses for the hospitals; <lb/>
and a Nightingale Hospital Fund was started to be <lb/>
given to her on her return to start her work of reform. <lb/>
Public meetings were held in support of this fund and <lb/>
when Miss Nightingale got back it had reached &pound;48,000. <lb/>
With the help of friends she considered how best this <lb/>
money could be used. She was too ill to undertake <lb/>
herself as she had intended to manage the new institute <lb/>
for training nurses or to do more than advise from her <lb/>
sick room what had best be done. She had hoped that <lb/>
rest would completely restore her health, and even <lb/>
wished to go out to India to nurse when the mutiny <lb/>
broke out in 1857; but this was impossible. After her <lb/>
return from the Crimea she led almost continuously <lb/>
an invalid life; but it was not an idle life. She directed <lb/>
all the arrangements for using the Nightingale Fund, <lb/>
which was chiefly devoted to starting a school for <lb/>
training nurses at St. Thomas' Hospital in London; <lb/>
the Nightingale nurses will always keep alive the <lb/>
memory of her name. In all other matters connected <lb/>
with nursing she always took an active interest, <lb/>
especially in the health of the soldiers and in nursing <lb/>
in the army, and also in starting district nurses to nurse <lb/>
the sick poor in their own homes. Her advice was <lb/>
constantly sought, and she wrote many papers about <lb/>
nursing which were most useful, especially a very <lb/>
popular little book called "Notes on Nursing." But <lb/>
for more than fifty years since her wonderful work in <lb/>
the Crimea, she has lived a secluded life as an invalid, <lb/>
though it has been a life full of work and thought for <lb/>
the service of others. She is still living &lpar;in 1909&rpar; <lb/>
but is a complete invalid. The great lesson of her <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0148"/>
life is, that she had prepared herself so well that <lb/>
when the opportunity for doing a great piece of work <lb/>
came to her, she was able to use it. She had <lb/>
learnt and studied, and when the need came she was <lb/>
ready.</p>

ISABELLA BIRD, AFTERWARDS MRS. BISHOP</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Isabella Bird</hi>, who afterwards became famous as a <lb/>
traveller, was the daughter of a clergyman. She was <lb/>
born in 1831, and spent her childhood in a country <lb/>
village in Cheshire of which her father was vicar. She <lb/>
was a frail, delicate child, and as it was good for her to <lb/>
be as much in the open air as possible, her father used <lb/>
to put her on a cushion before him when he rode round <lb/>
his parish. As soon as she was old enough, she rode a <lb/>
horse of her own, going with her father wherever he <lb/>
went. He made her notice everything they passed by <lb/>
the way, and questioned her about all that she saw. <lb/>
In after years she looked back to these early days as <lb/>
having taught her to be perfectly at home on a horse, <lb/>
to observe accurately everything that she saw, to love <lb/>
the flowers and the plants and to know their names and <lb/>
uses, to measure distances with her eye, and to watch <lb/>
the signs of the seasons. She was educated by her <lb/>
mother, and said that no one could teach as her mother <lb/>
did, since she made everything so wonderfully <reg orig="interest-|ing">interesting</reg>. <lb/>
By the time she was seven, Isabella was an eager <lb/>
reader of books of all kinds, even of serious history. <lb/>
When she was eleven, her father moved to a parish in <lb/>
Birmingham, and there she soon became a keen Sunday <lb/>
school teacher and worker in the parish; later, her <lb/>
father again had a country living in Huntingdonshire. <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0150"/>
Isabella was not strong, and the doctor recommended a <lb/>
sea-voyage; so when she was twenty-three, she made <lb/>
her first journey, going to Canada and America. She <lb/>
wrote such interesting letters home describing all that <lb/>
she saw that her father urged her to make a book out <lb/>
of them, and soon after she came home her first book, <lb/>
"The Englishwoman in America" appeared, and it was <lb/>
much praised.</p>
<p>It was a bitter grief to Isabella when her father died <lb/>
in 1858. She spoke of him as the mainspring and <lb/>
object of her life. Her mother now settled in Edinburgh, <lb/>
and Isabella paid frequent visits to the Highlands and <lb/>
the Hebrides, and interested herself much in the <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
of the Highlanders, who were then very poor. <lb/>
She helped many to emigrate, and worked hard to <lb/>
provide outfits for them. She was often ill, but wrote <lb/>
a great deal whilst lying on her sofa; she brought out <lb/>
another book about America, and sent many articles to <lb/>
magazines. Writing was very easy to her. After some <lb/>
years in Edinburgh, Mrs. Bird died, a crushing sorrow <lb/>
to her two daughters. Isabella wrote: "She has been <lb/>
my one object for the eight years of her widowhood." <lb/>
Isabella sought comfort in working for the poor people <lb/>
in Edinburgh and tried to do something to get rid of <lb/>
the miserable slums in that city. She wrote a book <lb/>
about them to rouse people to a sense of shame. Her <lb/>
hard work was often interrupted by distressing illness; <lb/>
she suffered a great deal from her spine, but even when <lb/>
ill, she managed to read and study. The doctors <lb/>
recommended a voyage for her health, and parting with <lb/>
much sorrow from her sister, she started in 1872 for <lb/>
New York and went on from there to New Zealand and <lb/>
then to the Sandwich Islands. She loved the sea and <lb/>
wrote that it was like living in a new world, it was so <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0151"/>

</figure>
<pb n="144" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0152"/>
free, so fresh, so careless, so unfettered. The beauty of <lb/>
the Sandwich Islands fascinated her, and the book she <lb/>
wrote about her visit to them helped others to enjoy <lb/>
what she had seen.</p>
<p>She went next to America, determined to explore <lb/>
the Rocky Mountains, which were then much less <lb/>
known than they are now. Her journey amongst <lb/>
the mountains was made on horseback; her habit of <lb/>
riding since her childhood and her intimate knowledge <lb/>
of horses enabled her to spend with real enjoyment <lb/>
long days riding through the mountains, on steep and <lb/>
difficult paths, and sometimes in wild snowstorms. <lb/>
She rode astride like a man, in a dress which she had <lb/>
devised for herself, consisting of full Turkish trousers <lb/>
with frills reaching to her boots, over them a skirt <lb/>
which came down to her ankles, and a loose jacket. <lb/>
She stayed in log huts with settlers in the mountains, <lb/>
helping them with their work and much interested in <lb/>
watching the kind of life they led. The scenery was <lb/>
magnificent, and the fine air and the free open life <lb/>
suited her, and made her feel well and strong. She <lb/>
spent some time with some settlers in a high valley <lb/>
amongst the mountains, sleeping alone in a log hut. <lb/>
She used to ride out with the men to help them drive <lb/>
in the cattle which had strayed on the mountains, and <lb/>
managed so well that they called her a good cattle-man. <lb/>
Towards the end of October she started on a long <lb/>
ride through the mountains alone. She had luggage <lb/>
for some weeks, including a black silk dress packed <lb/>
behind her saddle, and felt very independent. The <lb/>
greater part of her journey was through a white world, <lb/>
for the mountains were covered with snow and the <lb/>
nights were intensely cold. The nights she passed <lb/>
generally in log huts with the settlers, who were always <lb/>
<pb n="145" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0153"/>
glad to show her hospitality. Some of the men were <lb/>
very wild and rough, but they always behaved well to <lb/>
her, and she came to trust and admire many of the <lb/>
men of the mountains and loved to hear their talk <lb/>
about the wonderful world of nature in which they <lb/>
lived. The newspapers wrote about the strange English <lb/>
woman and her lonely ride through the mountains, and <lb/>
often when she reached a new place, she found that the <lb/>
people had already heard of her.</p>
<p>One man she came across, who was known as <lb/>
Mountain Jim, was leading a very wild life, but had <lb/>
been a gentleman of good birth and education. <reg orig="Meet-|ing">Meeting</reg> <lb/>
her and riding about with her brought out all that <lb/>
was good in him. He gave up his evil habits of <lb/>
drinking, swearing, and fighting, and became a changed <lb/>
man. He was bitterly grieved at parting from her, but <lb/>
promised to keep straight, and his letters to her showed <lb/>
that he did. Unfortunately, not many months <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg>, <lb/>
he was shot by another man in a fit of passion.</p>
<p>Miss Bird got back to her sister in Edinburgh after <lb/>
nearly two years' travelling, and set to work to make a <lb/>
book out of her letters home. She could never stay <lb/>
quiet for long and travelled about in England, Scotland, <lb/>
and Switzerland, and when in Edinburgh was busy <lb/>
with all kinds of work for others. Soon she began to <lb/>
dream of another long journey. This time it was <lb/>
Japan she wished to visit; she dreaded parting from <lb/>
her sister, but she was always better travelling than <lb/>
when at home, and hoped that another journey would <lb/>
still more improve her health. She started for Japan <lb/>
in 1878, when she was forty-seven years old, determined <lb/>
not to go to the well-known places but to the almost <lb/>
unknown interior of the country. She was told that <lb/>
the difficulties in the way of such a journey would be <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0154"/>
very great, and that no English lady had as yet travelled <lb/>
through the interior. When she reached Japan many <lb/>
tried to dissuade her from her plans, but she engaged <lb/>
a Japanese servant and made her preparations for her <lb/>
journey, in spite of feeling a little nervous. She was <lb/>
afraid of being afraid. But very soon she could laugh <lb/>
at her fears and misfortunes, though she had endless <lb/>
discomforts to put up with. Everywhere there were <lb/>
fleas and mosquitoes, and as strangers were seldom seen <lb/>
in the interior, she was tormented by the crowds who <lb/>
turned out to see her and allowed her no privacy. <lb/>
Still she found that the Japanese crowds were quiet <lb/>
and gentle and did not press rudely upon her. As she <lb/>
got further inland, the villages became horribly dirty, <lb/>
and the women were filthy and hardly clothed. Her <lb/>
servant was deeply grieved that she should see such <lb/>
things, and once sat on a stone with his face buried in <lb/>
his hands, he was so distressed.</p>
<p>Her journey was made fatiguing by bad horses, and <lb/>
by very bad weather. Rain fell in torrents, and she was <lb/>
glad to use one of the straw rain cloaks which the <lb/>
Japanese women wear. But she was not discouraged <lb/>
by the difficulties of her first journey, and determined <lb/>
to visit Yezo, the island north of Japan, where live a <lb/>
wild people known as the hairy Ainos. In order really <lb/>
to study the ways of these people, she spent three days <lb/>
and two nights in the hut of their chief, sleeping in a <lb/>
sort of bunk in the wall, with a mat hung in front of <lb/>
her. The men of the place used this hut as a club, and <lb/>
crowded in at night to sit round the fire piled up with <lb/>
logs. She wrote: "I never saw such a magnificent <lb/>
sight as that group of magnificent savages with the <lb/>
fitful firelight on their faces, and the row of savage <lb/>
women in the background." They were very kind and <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0155"/>
courteous to her; she was treated as an honoured guest <lb/>
in every house she entered, and she returned their <lb/>
kindness by attending to the sick. It was with real <lb/>
regret that she left the friendly, gentle Ainos, after <reg orig="care-|fully">carefully</reg> <lb/>
studying their habits and manner of life. She <lb/>
returned to Tokio, the capital of Japan, and stayed two <lb/>
months with the British minister, studying Japanese <lb/>
ways and making excursions into the neighbourhood. <lb/>
From there she sailed to Hong-Kong and then to <lb/>
Canton and the Malay States, and then turned <reg orig="home-|wards">homewards</reg>, <lb/>
stopping at Cairo on the way, where she fell very <lb/>
ill. Her travels in the East had not suited her health, <lb/>
but they had filled her with new interests and taught her <lb/>
many things. Her books about her travels were better <lb/>
written after this, and attracted much admiration and <lb/>
interest. She was becoming a famous woman. But all <lb/>
the enjoyment of her success was spoilt to her by the <lb/>
serious illness of her beloved sister, who died the year <lb/>
after Miss Bird's return.</p>
<p>Miss Bird was now alone in the world, but she had a <lb/>
devoted friend in Dr. Bishop, who had for some years <lb/>
attended her sister and was with her in her last illness. <lb/>
He had several times asked Miss Bird to marry him, <lb/>
but she had always said that her heart was given to <lb/>
her sister. Now in her loneliness, he repeated his <lb/>
request and she at last consented, and they were <lb/>
married in the spring after her sister's death. She was <lb/>
fifty, ten years older than her husband. He promised <lb/>
that when the need of travel awoke in her, she should <lb/>
go to whatever end of the earth beckoned to her. He <lb/>
used to say that the only rival he had in her heart was <lb/>
the high tableland of Central Asia. As it turned out <lb/>
she never left him for long. He became ill soon after <lb/>
their marriage, and was almost a complete invalid till <lb/>
<pb n="148" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0156"/>
he died five years afterwards. Dr. Bishop was a man <lb/>
of noble character, and Mrs. Bishop was devoted to him <lb/>
and mourned him all her life. She was now altogether <lb/>
alone except for her friends, and there was no one to <lb/>
keep her from the long and dangerous journeys in wild <lb/>
countries which she loved. She, who was always ill <lb/>
when in civilised countries, often spending weeks on <lb/>
her sofa because of pains in her back, seemed to be <lb/>
able to endure anything when she was travelling and <lb/>
leading a wild, free life. One thing that helped her <lb/>
was that she was able to eat anything. Dr. Bishop said <lb/>
that she had the appetite of a tiger and the digestion <lb/>
of an ostrich. At first after her husband's death, she <lb/>
busied herself with bringing out her books of travel <lb/>
and with caring for the poor people amongst whom her <lb/>
sister had worked. She also wished to learn nursing, <lb/>
and spent three months in London in the surgical <lb/>
wards of a hospital. Dr. Bishop had been much <lb/>
interested in medical missions, and she decided to <lb/>
found a mission hospital in his memory. It was nearly <lb/>
three years after his death when she started on her <lb/>
next long journey, going first to India and on to <lb/>
Kashmere, where she thought of founding her hospital.</p>
<p>In her early days Mrs. Bishop had felt no interest <lb/>
in missions, indeed she rather disliked them. She <lb/>
thought it a mistake to interfere with the ways and <lb/>
beliefs of other people, and on her travels used to try <lb/>
to avoid mission houses. Dr. Bishop's influence had <lb/>
changed her opinion by first giving her an interest <lb/>
in medical missions; what she saw afterwards in <lb/>
Eastern countries turned her into a warm friend of <lb/>
all Christian missions. She made great friends with <lb/>
Dr. Neve, the medical missionary of the Church <lb/>
Missionary Society in Kashmere, and with him arranged <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0157"/>
for the building of the John Bishop Memorial Hospital <lb/>
at Islamabad. It was a great pleasure to her that <lb/>
Dr. Neve had been a student under her husband. <lb/>
When this was settled, she was glad to escape from <lb/>
the crowds of Anglo-Indians who haunted Kashmere, <lb/>
and whose hubbub she found intolerable, for a ride of <lb/>
twenty-eight days through the Himalayas to Lesser <lb/>
Thibet as far as Leh, travelling alone with native <lb/>
servants and camping out at night. When she got <lb/>
back to India, she found it possible to carry out a <lb/>
long cherished plan and make a journey into Persia. <lb/>
Before she started, she visited several mission stations, <lb/>
and founded another hospital in memory of her sister, <lb/>
called the Henrietta Bird Hospital, which also was <lb/>
under the care of an old pupil of her husband's.</p>
<p>The journey through Persia began at Bagdad and <lb/>
lasted nearly a year. The first part lay through wild <lb/>
lonely mountains, where no English lady had ever <lb/>
been; here she had the companionship of an English <lb/>
officer, who was travelling for scientific purposes. It <lb/>
was an awful journey, and she would never have <reg orig="under-|taken">undertaken</reg> <lb/>
it had she known the hardships she would have <lb/>
to face&mdash;the long marches, the wretched food, the <lb/>
abominable accommodation, the brutal barbarism of the <lb/>
people. The weather was terrible: ceaseless rain, or <lb/>
deep snow in the high mountains. The nights had to <lb/>
be spent in cold, filthy caravanserais, as the rough inns <lb/>
of the East are called, mere shelters, which three or <lb/>
four hundred mules and their drivers often shared <lb/>
with Mrs. Bishop's party. There was constant danger <lb/>
from robbers, and everywhere curious crowds <reg orig="sur-|rounded">surrounded</reg> <lb/>
her, allowing her no rest or peace; they used <lb/>
to feel and pull her hair, to finger all her things, <lb/>
and examine her clothes when she hung them up at <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0158"/>
night. They brought their sick in crowds to her to <lb/>
be healed. One evening, when she had got a mud <lb/>
hovel to herself and was suffering from a severe chill, <lb/>
lying down covered with blankets, she heard a noise, <lb/>
and looking up saw the room thronged with men, <lb/>
women, and children, covered with sores, and suffering <lb/>
from all kinds of diseases. She had to get up and <lb/>
listen for two hours to their tales of suffering, <reg orig="inter-|preted">interpreted</reg> <lb/>
to her by her servant. It was painful indeed <lb/>
to be able to do but little for them. The next morning <lb/>
they were all there again. She could only give them <lb/>
ointments for their sores, lotions for their eyes, or some <lb/>
few simple medicines, and had to send most of them <lb/>
sadly away. The cold was so bitter and the storms <lb/>
so terrible in crossing the mountains that it was a <lb/>
wonder that Mrs. Bishop and her whole party did not <lb/>
perish. She felt that they would never have got <lb/>
through had it not been for the splendid Arab horses <lb/>
which carried them with unfailing spirit through all the <lb/>
difficult places.</p>
<p>Forty-six days brought them to Teheran, one of the <lb/>
chief cities of Persia, and here she rested in comfort <lb/>
for three weeks in the house of the English minister, <lb/>
and then they started for another and longer journey <lb/>
of exploration among the mountains. Again terrible <lb/>
hardships and dangers were endured. Every day after <lb/>
the fatigues of the journey, diseased and infirm people <lb/>
crowded her camp, and she did all she could to <lb/>
help them. One of the chiefs came to her one day <lb/>
for medicine, and as he lingered, watching her care <lb/>
for the people, he asked her why she took so much <lb/>
trouble for people unknown to her. She answered by <lb/>
telling him, through her interpreter, the story of Jesus <lb/>
Christ. When he had heard what she had to say, he <lb/>
<pb n="151" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0159"/>
said sadly, "He is the Hakim &lpar;doctor&rpar; for us, send <lb/>
us such a one as He was."</p>
<p>These people are Mahometans, and seeing the little <lb/>
help and comfort their religion gave to them, and the <lb/>
miserable lives to which it condemned their women, <lb/>
made Mrs. Bishop still more keen about Christian <lb/>
missions. In the larger towns she often visited the <lb/>
houses of the chiefs, and went into the women's <lb/>
quarters, where the many wives of the chief and his <lb/>
children lived shut up together. They were never <lb/>
allowed to go out, and spent their days in quarrelling, <lb/>
eating sweetmeats, and dressing and dyeing their hair. <lb/>
They asked her for love potions and charms, and <lb/>
wondered why she did not dye her hair, and for what <lb/>
purpose she could be travelling.</p>
<p>For the last part of her journey, Mrs. Bishop was quite <lb/>
alone with her servants, as the English officer had to <lb/>
go elsewhere. Her chief companion was the Arab horse <lb/>
on which she rode, which she called "Boy," and which <lb/>
was as gentle and affectionate as a child. He often <lb/>
slept in her tent, and would come and rub his nose <lb/>
against her face to attract her attention. He carried <lb/>
her safely from Burjurid, in the centre of Persia, to <lb/>
Trebizond, on the shores of the Black Sea, a journey of <lb/>
four months. In dangers and hardships her courage <lb/>
never failed. She was robbed of most of her travelling <lb/>
necessaries, and had to do without them as she could <lb/>
not replace them; she had strange food, and often had <lb/>
to do without food at all; and yet she got safely through <lb/>
though she was a small, delicate woman, fifty-nine years <lb/>
of age. In all she had travelled 2500 miles since she <lb/>
started on her journey through Persia. Wherever there <lb/>
were mission stations, she enjoyed the hospitality of the <lb/>
missionaries, and she was much impressed by their <reg orig="self-|denying">self-denying</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0160"/>
work. The last part of her journey was through <lb/>
Armenia where she saw with much sympathy the <reg orig="cour-|age">courage</reg> <lb/>
and endurance of the Christian Armenians, poor, <lb/>
ignorant people, who clung to their ancient faith in spite <lb/>
of cruel persecution. They begged her to send them <lb/>
teachers, for their own priests were poor and ignorant <lb/>
because they could not afford to go away to study. One <lb/>
of the priests said to her, "Beseech for a teacher to come <lb/>
and sit among us and lighten our darkness." England <lb/>
he thought could send teachers, for he said, "England is <lb/>
very rich."</p>
<p>From Trebizond Mrs. Bishop travelled quickly back <lb/>
to England, and was soon very busy preparing a book <lb/>
with an account of her travels. But she found time to <lb/>
speak at many missionary meetings, so anxious was she <lb/>
to plead the cause of the poor people whom she had <lb/>
seen. Her pleasant voice and way of speaking and all <lb/>
the interesting things she had to tell made people eager <lb/>
to hear her, and she spoke also to gatherings of learned <lb/>
men. She was considered one of the greatest of <lb/>
missionary advocates, and an address, in which she <lb/>
pleaded for the poor secluded women in Eastern lands, <lb/>
was printed and sent all over the world. She spoke of <lb/>
the terrible sins of the non-Christian lands in the East <lb/>
and of the degradation of the women, and said she would <lb/>
give all she had to help them.</p>
<p>As usual when at home Mrs. Bishop was constantly <lb/>
ill, and only three years passed before she started on <lb/>
another journey. She longed for the East and wished <lb/>
to visit China and Japan. Whilst she was at home, <lb/>
she had taken lessons in photographing, that she might <lb/>
be able to take better photographs on her travels. She <lb/>
improved immensely, and after this her books were <lb/>
always illustrated by her own beautiful photographs. <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0161"/>
She first went to Korea, the strange country which lies <lb/>
between China and Japan, and which both those countries <lb/>
desired to possess. At first she did not like Korea nor <lb/>
its people, but she soon grew to love them, and especially <lb/>
enjoyed the beautiful, sunny climate. She wrote that <lb/>
she felt this journey to be more absorbing in its interest <lb/>
than any she had yet had. During the three years that <lb/>
she now spent in the East, she paid three visits to Korea, <lb/>
in order that she might thoroughly study the land and <lb/>
its people. She had a great many hardships to go <lb/>
through in some parts of her journey. Once after riding <lb/>
for eleven hours under a hot sun, she found the only <lb/>
night's lodging she could get was in a filthy fishing <lb/>
village full of the vilest smells. Her room in the inn <lb/>
was such an awful black hole, full of vermin and rats, <lb/>
that when her Chinese servant left her for the night he <lb/>
said, "I hope you won't die." In other places she was <lb/>
annoyed by the crowds who came to stare at her, never <lb/>
having seen an Englishwoman before. Once her <lb/>
servant had his arm broken by a fall from his horse, <lb/>
and she was obliged to set it herself. He was so touched <lb/>
with her care of him that, in spite of his pain, he <reg orig="some-|how">somehow</reg> <lb/>
managed to do his work just as usual, and said, <lb/>
"The foreign woman looked so sorry, and touched my <lb/>
arm as if I had been one of her own people. I shall do <lb/>
my best."</p>
<p>Between her visits to Korea, Mrs. Bishop went back <lb/>
to Japan, and also travelled in China. Her first object <lb/>
was to visit the mission stations in China, and she was <lb/>
much interested in all she saw, especially in the medical <lb/>
missions, and was full of admiration for the missionaries. <lb/>
On a second visit to China she made a long journey <lb/>
into the interior, going up first by boat on the river <lb/>
Yangtze for 300 miles, and then alone 300 more miles <lb/>
<pb n="154" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0162"/>
into the country in a carrying chair borne by Chinese, <lb/>
the only way of travelling. Far in the interior, she <lb/>
visited the missionaries of the China Inland Mission, <lb/>
and there she gave money to found a hospital to be <lb/>
called the Henrietta Bird Hospital after her sister. <lb/>
Wherever she went she photographed, undisturbed by <lb/>
the curious crowds who gathered round her. Once as <lb/>
she was being carried along, the people got so angry <lb/>
because she would not stop her chair to let them have <lb/>
a good look at her, that they threw stones at her, and <lb/>
one hit her a sharp blow on the head from which she <lb/>
suffered for a long time.</p>
<p>In 1897, after an absence of over three years, Mrs. <lb/>
Bishop came back to London. She had accomplished <lb/>
these long and tiring journeys at the age of sixty-six. <lb/>
She brought back with her a beautiful collection of <lb/>
photographs which she had taken, and materials for <lb/>
writing two books, one on Korea and one on her travels <lb/>
in China. She busied herself with writing her books, <lb/>
lecturing about her travels, and speaking at missionary <lb/>
meetings and doing all she could for the cause of <lb/>
missions. She tried to settle down in a house, and took <lb/>
first one in London and then one in the country, but <lb/>
never stayed anywhere long, and was as usual always <lb/>
ill as soon as she tried to live in a civilised country. <lb/>
So after a while she went off to Morocco, and there at <lb/>
the age of seventy she travelled through the wild parts <lb/>
of the country, riding astride on a superb horse and <lb/>
camping out at night. This was her last journey. <lb/>
After she got back to England she still lectured and <lb/>
spoke for missions, and studied photography. She <lb/>
began to plan another journey to China, but she fell <lb/>
ill in Edinburgh. For some months she was confined <lb/>
to bed, but still saw her friends, and was full of eager <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0163"/>
interest in everything that happened. She was not <lb/>
afraid to die, and waited peacefully for the end, saying <lb/>
that she was going home. She died in March 1904, at <lb/>
the age of seventy-one. Those who wish to know about <lb/>
her travels and the wonderful things she saw must <lb/>
read her many books, which are full of life and <reg orig="adven-|ture">adventure</reg> <lb/>
and enable us to share her experiences and admire <lb/>
her pluck and energy.</p>

SISTER DORA</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Dorothy Pattison</hi>, who was afterwards known as Sister <lb/>
Dora, was born in 1832 in a little village called <reg orig="Haux-|well">Hauxwell</reg>, <lb/>
near Richmond, in Yorkshire, of which her father <lb/>
was the rector. She was the youngest but one of a <lb/>
family of twelve children, of whom ten were daughters. <lb/>
They grew up in all the enjoyment of country life. <lb/>
Dorothy was delicate as a child and not allowed to do <lb/>
regular lessons, but she describes herself as having all <lb/>
the same been a great romp, as wild and merry as a <lb/>
boy, and good at all outdoor sports&mdash;riding, rowing, <lb/>
shooting, swimming, and skating. But even as a tiny <lb/>
child she loved to wash and nurse her dolls, and longed <lb/>
to be able to do the same for real people. When she <lb/>
talked over the future with her nearest sister she used <lb/>
to say, "I'll be a nurse or a lady doctor and do <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
for my patients." When she was twelve, one of <lb/>
her sisters fell ill, and Dorothy begged, at first in vain, <lb/>
to be allowed to sit up with her and nurse her, but at <lb/>
last she managed to slip into the room unnoticed, and <lb/>
once she was there, she was allowed to stay and helped <lb/>
to nurse her sister till she was well. A couple of years <lb/>
afterwards a fever broke out in the village, and an old <lb/>
woman whom Dorothy knew very well took it. She <lb/>
called at the house to ask how she was and found the <lb/>
old woman left quite alone. In a moment, she made <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0165"/>
up her mind, and without thinking of what her parents <lb/>
might say, she hung up her coat and jacket behind the <lb/>
door and told the old woman she had come to stay <lb/>
with her. In the evening she sent a message home to <lb/>
<figure id="f30" rend="block" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0165">

</figure>
say that she was going to stay all night, and word came <lb/>
back that, as she had chosen to stay without permission, <lb/>
she must now remain with the old woman. She washed <lb/>
her and nursed her and read the Bible to her, but she <lb/>
grew worse and worse, and the next night she died. A <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0166"/>
kind neighbour came in and helped to lay her out, but <lb/>
Dorothy, tired out and frightened, was left to spend the <lb/>
night alone in the cottage. Next morning she sent a <lb/>
message to the Rectory to say that the poor woman <lb/>
had died, might she come home. But the answer came <lb/>
back, "Stay where you are till you are sent for." She <lb/>
was terrified lest her parents had cast her off and <lb/>
she should never be allowed to go home. But soon <lb/>
a carriage arrived with her old nurse to carry her off <lb/>
to spend a month at the seaside, so that she might be <lb/>
free from all infection before going home. When at <lb/>
last she returned home she was welcomed as a little <lb/>
heroine, and got rather puffed up by the praise she <lb/>
received.</p>
<p>As she got stronger and able to study more, she was <lb/>
inclined to rebel at the time spent over lessons, and <lb/>
said she did not see why, as she was going to be a nurse, <lb/>
she should learn languages and music. But she was <lb/>
told that a nice Christian nurse should learn everything <lb/>
she had time for; she might some day have French or <lb/>
German patients, and music would be a pleasure to <lb/>
everybody; it would not do to be one-sided, for she <lb/>
ought to be able to care for the minds and souls of her <lb/>
patients as well as for their bodies. So she was <reg orig="per-|suaded">persuaded</reg> <lb/>
to study gladly, and would often wonder how <lb/>
the thing she was learning would come in afterwards. <lb/>
Later she found that there was not a single thing she <lb/>
had learnt which had not in some way been hallowed <lb/>
in the service of God. She used to say to others, <lb/>
"Never feel that it is waste of time to get knowledge <lb/>
of any kind; you can never tell how handy it may <lb/>
come in."</p>
<p>Dora grew up to be a very handsome woman. By the <lb/>
time she was twenty, all her delicacy had disappeared <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0167"/>
and she was tall and strong. She had very high <lb/>
spirits and was always full of fun and ready to see <lb/>
the funny side of people and things. Her laughter <lb/>
and her happy voice, singing as she went about the <lb/>
house, were the delight of her father, who called her his <lb/>
sunshine. But though she loved her home and her <lb/>
rides and walks on the moors, she did not find there <lb/>
enough occupation for her active nature. Her mother <lb/>
died after a long time of ill-health, during which Dora <lb/>
had been one of her devoted nurses, and now Dora <lb/>
longed for some real work. Her father did not wish <lb/>
her to leave home, but he did not forbid it, and at last <lb/>
when she was twenty-nine, Dora went to be <reg orig="school-|mistress">schoolmistress</reg> <lb/>
at Woolston, a little village in <reg orig="Buckingham-|shire">Buckinghamshire</reg>. <lb/>
She lived there alone in a tiny cottage, loving <lb/>
the children who came to her school, and making herself <lb/>
the friend of all the poor and sick in the village. She <lb/>
did not feel, however, that this was her real work; and <lb/>
after three years she decided to join the Sisterhood of <lb/>
the Good Samaritans. She had learnt to know these <lb/>
Sisters in Yorkshire, as they had their chief home at <lb/>
Coatham, which was not very far from her old home. <lb/>
The Sisters had a Convalescent Home under their care, <lb/>
and many of them went out from Coatham to work in <lb/>
other towns.</p>
<p>After she joined the Sisterhood, Sister Dora, as she <lb/>
was now called, had to work very hard. The Sisters <lb/>
did all the work of the house, and Sister Dora cleaned <lb/>
floors and grates, swept and dusted, and for a time <lb/>
acted as cook. She sometimes felt it very hard to <lb/>
have to do all this work. Once when a gentleman <lb/>
whom she knew came into the kitchen where she was <lb/>
peeling potatoes, she pulled her hood over her face so <lb/>
that he might not see her. In after life she found the <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0168"/>
great advantage of having learnt how to do all the <lb/>
work of a house herself. She thought some of the <lb/>
rules very strict; but still she was very happy there, <lb/>
and the Sisters loved her. She was able also to learn <lb/>
more about nursing, as the Sisters had a Cottage <lb/>
Hospital near Middlesborough, to which she was sent. <lb/>
Sometimes, too, she was sent to nurse private patients, <lb/>
and sometimes to nurse in another Cottage Hospital <lb/>
for accidents at Walsall, which was managed by the <lb/>
Coatham Sisters.</p>
<p>At last Sister Dora settled altogether at Walsall, in <lb/>
charge of the little hospital there. Walsall is a great <lb/>
manufacturing centre, with coal pits, blast furnaces, and <lb/>
many kinds of factories. It had then no large hospital; <lb/>
the little Cottage Hospital was chiefly intended for <lb/>
accidents, and the patients were for the most part men <lb/>
and boys from the pits and workshops. There were <lb/>
also a large number of out-patients, men, women, and <lb/>
children. As most of the cases were accidents, Sister <lb/>
Dora was particularly anxious to become a good surgical <lb/>
nurse, and the chief surgeon at the hospital, when he <lb/>
saw how quick and clever she was, taught her all that <lb/>
he could, so that she could attend to many cases herself <lb/>
without the help of the doctor. The hospital in which <lb/>
she at first nursed was very small and inconvenient, <lb/>
with only fourteen beds, but a few years after Sister <lb/>
Dora settled in Walsall a new hospital was built on the <lb/>
top of the hill on which the town lies. It had <reg orig="twenty-|eight">twenty-eight</reg> <lb/>
beds, conveniently arranged in three wards, so <lb/>
that it was just possible for an active woman like Sister <lb/>
Dora to do all the nursing herself. She had the help <lb/>
of an old servant of her family, who came to live with <lb/>
her and who soon learnt to be a very capable nurse <lb/>
herself. Other women were engaged to sit up at night <lb/>
<pb n="161" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0169"/>
with the patients, and, later, Sister Dora used to have <lb/>
lady pupils who learnt nursing under her.</p>
<p>It was a very hard life, full of ceaseless work and <lb/>
responsibility, but Sister Dora threw her whole heart <lb/>
into it, and loved her work and the people for whom <lb/>
she worked. Once settled at Walsall, she never wished <lb/>
to leave it. Speaking to a friend about her work, she <lb/>
said, "I generally find that the more I have to do the <lb/>
stronger and happier I feel. It is hard enough <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
at night, when I have been round to all the <lb/>
patients and left them comfortable and asleep, and am <lb/>
just going to bed myself, to be called down by the bell, <lb/>
or perhaps roused by it just as I am falling asleep. <lb/>
But then I think 'the Master calleth thee,' and jump <lb/>
up and go down, to find perhaps some poor drunken <lb/>
man or woman, and it is difficult to recognise the <lb/>
Master in such poor degraded creatures as come to be <lb/>
doctored up." She had a wonderful power over the <lb/>
men and boys amongst whom she worked. She <reg orig="sym-|pathised">sympathised</reg> <lb/>
deeply with all their pain and trouble, and <lb/>
made them feel as if their troubles were her own, but <lb/>
she tried to make them forget their pain by her bright <lb/>
talk and her laughter and jokes. She would raise their <lb/>
spirits by her delightful fun, till an Irishman said once, <lb/>
"Make you laugh! she'd make you laugh when you <lb/>
were dying." Whenever she had a spare minute, she <lb/>
would read to them or talk to them or play games with <lb/>
them. She allowed no bad talk or quarrelling in the <lb/>
wards, and tried to mend her patients' morals as well as <lb/>
their limbs. They each of them knew that they had a <lb/>
real friend in her, and that she prayed for each and <lb/>
cared deeply what became of them. They loved to <lb/>
come and see her after they had left the hospital, and <lb/>
were always sure of a welcome. She tried hard to cure <lb/>
<pb n="162" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0170"/>
them from their drinking ways, showing them again <lb/>
and again how hard it was to heal the wounds of those <lb/>
who drank; and when they were brought in at night <lb/>
wounded after a drunken brawl, after dressing their <lb/>
wounds with all her usual gentleness, she would ask <lb/>
them why they did not behave like respectable members <lb/>
of society, instead of fighting in the streets and getting <lb/>
her up at unearthly hours of the night to mend their <lb/>
broken heads.</p>
<p>Sister Dora was devoted to children and they loved <lb/>
her, and she knew how to get them to bear patiently <lb/>
the dressing of their wounds. Often when a child was <lb/>
miserable and in pain, she would carry it about with <lb/>
her on one arm as she went through the wards, saying, <lb/>
"Don't you cry, Sister's got you," whilst with her other <lb/>
hand she attended to the patients. Many children <lb/>
suffering from terrible burns used to be brought to <lb/>
the hospital, and she grew so clever in treating them <lb/>
that the surgeons trusted them entirely to her care. <lb/>
Once a child was brought in so badly burnt that it <lb/>
was plain it had only a few hours to live. All pain <lb/>
had ceased, but the child was terrified. Sister Dora <lb/>
gave up all other work in order to comfort her. She <lb/>
sat by the bed for some hours talking to her about <lb/>
Jesus Christ and His love for little children, and about <lb/>
heaven where she would never feel hunger and pain <lb/>
again. The child grew peaceful and happy, and her <lb/>
last words were, "When you come to heaven, Sister, <lb/>
I'll meet you at the gates with a bunch of flowers."</p>
<p>Sister Dora felt special sympathy for the men who <lb/>
had been so hurt that it seemed necessary for them <lb/>
to have an arm or leg cut off. She knew well how <lb/>
difficult this made it for them to earn a livelihood, and <lb/>
she devoted all her skill to saving the wounded limb <lb/>
<pb n="163" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0171"/>
if possible. One night a fine healthy young man was <lb/>
brought in with his arm torn and twisted by a machine. <lb/>
The doctor said that nothing could save it, and that <lb/>
he must cut it off at once. Sister Dora was moved <lb/>
by the despair of the poor man; she looked long at <lb/>
his arm and at himself, and the man cried out, "O <lb/>
Sister! save my arm for me; it's my right arm." When <lb/>
she turned to the doctor and asked if she might try <lb/>
to save the arm, he only asked her if she was mad, and <lb/>
said that the man's life could not be saved unless his <lb/>
arm were taken off at once. But she turned to the <lb/>
patient and said, "Are you willing for me to try to <lb/>
save your arm, my man?" He was willing, but the <lb/>
surgeon was very angry, and refused to help her, saying, <lb/>
"Remember, it's your arm," and telling her she must <lb/>
take all the responsibility. Night and day for three <lb/>
weeks she tended him, naturally feeling terribly anxious <lb/>
as to what would happen. She often said afterwards, <lb/>
"How I prayed over that arm." At the end of that <lb/>
time she asked the surgeon to come and look at her <lb/>
work, and when she unbandaged the arm and showed <lb/>
it to him, straightened and in a healthy, promising <lb/>
condition, he exclaimed, "Why you have saved it, and <lb/>
it will be a useful arm to him for many a long year." <lb/>
It is not surprising that Sister Dora wept with joy at <lb/>
her success, nor that the man became one of her <lb/>
most devoted admirers. He was nicknamed "Sister's <lb/>
Arm" in the hospital, and used to come back often <lb/>
to see her after he had left.</p>
<p>Another man himself tells how she had to persuade <lb/>
him to allow his leg to be taken off as the only way of <lb/>
saving his life. He had grown so thin and wasted that <lb/>
she used to carry him upstairs in her arms so that he <lb/>
might join in the prayers she held for the whole <lb/>
<pb n="164" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0172"/>
hospital. He was eight months in the hospital, and he <lb/>
says, "I learned to love Sister Dora as a mother." He <lb/>
tells how she used in the afternoons to attend to the <lb/>
out-patients, "dress their wounds, set a broken arm, <lb/>
sew up a cut, or draw teeth, in fact anything that was <lb/>
required of her she would do, and always with the <lb/>
tenderest care and the kindest word to all." She often <lb/>
amused the men with tales of her doings in the country <lb/>
as a girl, and told them about her riding and <reg orig="fox-|hunting">fox-hunting</reg>, <lb/>
and this man who watched her life in the <lb/>
hospital for eight months says, "those patients who <lb/>
were the most trouble, she seemed the fondest of." She <lb/>
knew how to get the men to help her by making them <lb/>
wait upon one another; generally there was some boy <lb/>
who had to stay a long while in the hospital, who <lb/>
waited upon her as a devoted slave. After she had <lb/>
been four years at the hospital, to show their gratitude <lb/>
for all she had done, her patients subscribed fifty <lb/>
pounds amongst themselves with which they bought a <lb/>
small carriage and pony for her. She delighted in <lb/>
using it to send convalescents for a drive, and found it <lb/>
a help in taking her to visit sick people in their homes. <lb/>
She seldom took a holiday herself, and once was three <lb/>
years at the hospital without any break, but if she <lb/>
did go away into the country with friends, she <reg orig="en-|joyed">enjoyed</reg> <lb/>
everything with all her old energy, bathing or <lb/>
skating, taking long walks, when she would lead the <lb/>
way in scaling fences or fording streams. Sometimes <lb/>
she took patients who were convalescent for <reg orig="expedi-|tions">expeditions</reg> <lb/>
into the country or to visit Lichfield Cathedral. <lb/>
The old patients specially loved to revisit the hospital <lb/>
on Sundays, when, after a clergyman had held a short <lb/>
service, Sister Dora used to speak to them herself, <lb/>
and then lead them in the singing of many hymns. <lb/>
<pb n="165" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0173"/>
She always had a small Bible in her pocket, and <lb/>
studied it whenever she had a spare minute.</p>
<p>In 1875 there was a terrible outbreak of smallpox in <lb/>
Walsall. There was an isolation hospital on the <reg orig="out-|skirts">outskirts</reg> <lb/>
of the town, but in those days people were not <lb/>
compelled by law to send smallpox patients away, and <lb/>
they refused to go of their own accord, for they said <lb/>
that they would rather die at home. It was very <lb/>
necessary for the welfare of the town that they should <lb/>
be persuaded to go to the hospital and not spread the <lb/>
terrible infection by staying in their own homes. So <lb/>
Sister Dora offered to leave her hospital and go to <lb/>
take charge of the Smallpox Hospital. She knew that <lb/>
the people trusted her, and thought that they would <lb/>
come if she was there. Her offer was gladly accepted; <lb/>
all through the town the news ran, "Sister is going to <lb/>
the Epidemic Hospital." Her lady pupils were left <lb/>
to take charge of the hospital, and she went off to her <lb/>
lonely work with the surgeon of the hospital to show <lb/>
her the way. It seemed such a lonely and desolate <lb/>
spot that even her courage failed her at the door, and <lb/>
she cried out, "Oh take me back, I cannot endure this <lb/>
dreadful place." But the surgeon knew her real courage, <lb/>
and only said, "Come in." It was an admirably <lb/>
planned little hospital, and she was delighted with it. <lb/>
There were twenty-eight beds, and she had not been <lb/>
half-an-hour in the hospital before seven patients <lb/>
arrived, to be followed by many more. Her only <lb/>
regular helper was the porter, an old man, who did all <lb/>
he could for her when he was sober, but used sometimes <lb/>
to go away and get drunk, leaving her alone for the <lb/>
whole night. Two old women came in from the <lb/>
workhouse to help her in washing the clothes and <lb/>
bedding, but much of the scrubbing and cleaning she <lb/>
<pb n="166" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0174"/>
had to do herself, as well as all the nursing. One of <lb/>
the police who came to see her told her that the people <lb/>
in the town declared they should not mind having <lb/>
the smallpox with "Sister" to nurse them. Some few <lb/>
people were brave enough to visit her in her loneliness, <lb/>
and to bring her books and flowers and news of her <lb/>
patients at the hospital.</p>
<p>One of the old patients, an engine-stoker, went often <lb/>
to see her after his day's work was done. He had been <lb/>
twice in the hospital under her care, and he said, "I <lb/>
could not tell you all her goodness to me, words would <lb/>
fail me if I tried." She was full of courage and joy in <lb/>
her work, and wrote to a friend: "You must not fret. <lb/>
I rejoice that He has permitted one so unworthy to <lb/>
work for Him; and oh, if He should think me fit to lay <lb/>
down my life for Him, rejoice, rejoice, at so great a <lb/>
privilege." Even her sense of fun did not leave her, <lb/>
and she wrote a long letter to her old patients at the <lb/>
Cottage Hospital, calling them all by their nicknames <lb/>
and sending messages to each. She said of a boy who <lb/>
was her special slave: "What shall I say to my beloved <lb/>
Sam. I wish I had my boy here. I send him twenty <lb/>
kisses and hope he has been in church to-day and in <lb/>
time. He must not sulk all the time I am away. I <lb/>
have two blessed babies, who alternately keep up music <lb/>
all day and night, accompanied by an Irishwoman's <lb/>
tongue, so I am not dull. Have you been singing <reg orig="to-|day">today</reg>? <lb/>
You must sing particularly, 'Safe in the arms <lb/>
of Jesus' and think of me. Living or dying, I am <lb/>
His. Oh, my children, you all love me for the very <lb/>
little I do for you; but oh, if you would only think <lb/>
what Jesus has done, and is doing for you, your hearts <lb/>
would soon be full of love for Him, and you would all <lb/>
choose Him for your Master."</p>
<pb n="167" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0175"/>
<p>Towards the middle of May, the Smallpox Hospital <lb/>
was empty and she hoped soon to leave; but before she <lb/>
was ready to go new patients were brought in, and this <lb/>
happened several times, so that it was not till the <lb/>
middle of August, after six months' work at the <reg orig="Small-|pox">Smallpox</reg> <lb/>
Hospital, that she was able to close it.</p>
<p>The following October a terrible explosion occurred <lb/>
at the furnace of some ironworks, and eleven men were <lb/>
covered with streams of molten metal. In their agony <lb/>
they jumped into a neighbouring canal, and were with <lb/>
difficulty rescued and taken in cabs to the hospital. <lb/>
Burnt all over and frightfully disfigured, they were <lb/>
carried in and laid on the floor till a ward could be <lb/>
cleared for them. It was a terrible scene, even the <lb/>
doctors could hardly stay in the ward, but Sister Dora <lb/>
never ceased in her devoted care of the men. Cries <lb/>
came from most of them, "Sister, come and dress me." <lb/>
"Do dress me," "Oh, you don't know how bad I am." <lb/>
She could only answer, "Oh my poor men, I'll dress you <lb/>
all, if you'll give me time." One poor man, seeing how <lb/>
distracted she was by the different cries for help, said, <lb/>
"Sister Dora, I want to be dressed very bad, but if <lb/>
there's any wants you worse go and do them first." He <lb/>
was in terrible pain and died during the night. Of the <lb/>
eleven only two recovered. Some lingered for as long <lb/>
as ten days, and during that time Sister Dora never <lb/>
went to bed, and hardly left the ward. One of those <lb/>
who survived described how she went from bed to <lb/>
bed talking, laughing, even joking with the men; <lb/>
telling them stories, doing everything she could to <lb/>
distract them from their pain, and pointing out the <lb/>
way to heaven to those who were to die. He spoke <lb/>
with delight of her visits to his bedside at night when <lb/>
he was recovering, saying, "It did you good only to <lb/>
<pb n="168" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0176"/>
look at her," and ending with, "What we felt for her I <lb/>
couldn't tell you; my tongue won't say it."</p>
<p>One result of this terrible accident was that the ward <lb/>
in which the burnt men had lain was so poisoned that <lb/>
it could not be used again, and it was decided to build <lb/>
a new hospital. In the meanwhile, a house was fitted <lb/>
up as a temporary hospital. It was a tiring life for <lb/>
Sister Dora, as the temporary hospital was small and <lb/>
not at all convenient, and many patients had to be <lb/>
nursed in their own homes. It was at this time that <lb/>
she first began to find it difficult to lift her patients, <lb/>
and after a while she was compelled to consult a doctor <lb/>
about her health. He discovered that she had a mortal <lb/>
malady. It was possible that an operation might do <lb/>
her some good, but it was by no means certain. She <lb/>
determined to go on as usual, and made him promise to <lb/>
tell no one of her illness. She worked harder than <lb/>
ever and would not give in. She drove about in her <lb/>
little pony carriage to visit her patients, and no one <lb/>
was allowed to know that anything was wrong with her. <lb/>
Then an outbreak of fever in the temporary hospital <lb/>
made it necessary to close it, and as the new hospital <lb/>
was not yet ready it was possible for Sister Dora to <lb/>
leave Walsall. She visited her relations and went to <lb/>
Paris and London to study improvements in surgical <lb/>
science. All the time her disease was growing worse, <lb/>
and still she told no one. Her wish was to die at <lb/>
Walsall amongst her own people, and as the hospital <lb/>
was not ready, a little house near to it was taken for <lb/>
her. People could not believe that she was dying. She <lb/>
was surrounded with all the care that love could give <lb/>
her, and often her visitors were surprised to see her, in <lb/>
spite of pain and weakness, still her old self, full of fun <lb/>
and jokes. Her interest in the new hospital was very <lb/>

keen, and she rejoiced that it was finished in time for <lb/>
her to know of its opening. She listened eagerly to all <lb/>
that was told her about it, and gave her advice about <lb/>
all the arrangements. Often she suffered terribly, and <lb/>
when at last she died, on Christmas eve, 1878, it was <lb/>
with relief that her friends heard that her pain was <lb/>
over. She was carried to her grave by some of the <lb/>
railway men for whom she had cared with so much <lb/>
devotion. The Bishop was there and great numbers <lb/>
of the clergy, and there came, too, hundreds of her <lb/>
patients and an immense crowd consisting of nearly <lb/>
all the people of the town.</p>
<p>When, later, it was discussed what memorial of her <lb/>
should be placed in Walsall some suggested a <reg orig="Con-|valescent">Convalescent</reg> <lb/>
Home, as what she herself would most have <lb/>
desired; but the working men of the town were quite <lb/>
clear that what they wanted was a statue of Sister Dora. <lb/>
One of them said that of course they could not forget <lb/>
her, but that they wanted her to be there, so that when <lb/>
strangers came and saw the statue and asked who it <lb/>
was, they might answer, "Who's that? Why that's our <lb/>
Sister Dora." So her statue in her nurse's dress, as she <lb/>
lived and worked amongst them, stands in the centre <lb/>
of Walsall to remind the people of her life of love. <lb/>
The workmen spoke of her as "the most saintly thing <lb/>
that was ever given us."</p>

QUEEN VICTORIA</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> is impossible in one short chapter to tell about all <lb/>
the things that made Queen Victoria's reign famous, <lb/>
and I am only going to tell something about her own <lb/>
life and to try to show what kind of a woman she <lb/>
was. Her father was the Duke of Kent, son of King <lb/>
George III., and her mother was a German princess. <lb/>
The Princess Victoria was their only child, and she was <lb/>
born in 1819 in Kensington Palace. It was possible <lb/>
that the little princess might some day be Queen of <lb/>
England, but at her birth she had three uncles living, <lb/>
older than her father, who would all have a right to <lb/>
the throne before her. She was only a few months <lb/>
old when her father and grandfather died and her <lb/>
eldest uncle became king as George IV. Her mother, <lb/>
a German lady, was very lonely in England. Her chief <lb/>
adviser was her brother Leopold, then living in <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg>; <lb/>
he made the Duchess of Kent feel how important <lb/>
her position was as mother of the child who might be <lb/>
queen some day. He said that she must be brought <lb/>
up in England; so the duchess consented to live on at <lb/>
Kensington Palace and devoted herself to the education <lb/>
of her child. In after years the Queen, writing about <lb/>
her childhood, said that her chief pleasure was visiting <lb/>
her uncle Leopold, who lived at Claremont, near Esher. <lb/>
She was brought up very simply and always slept in <lb/>
<pb n="172" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0180"/>
her mother's bedroom. When she stayed at Claremont <lb/>
or by the seaside, where they often went, she did her <lb/>
lessons in her governess's bedroom. She was not fond <lb/>
of learning, and did not know her letters till she was <lb/>
five. George IV. had quarrelled with her father, and <lb/>
did not like her mother, and took very little notice of <lb/>
them; but she went as a child to see him at Windsor, <lb/>
and remembered how he took her by the hand, saying, <lb/>
"Give me your little paw." Next day he met her <lb/>
driving in the park and stopped his carriage and said, <lb/>
"Pop her in," and she was very pleased to drive by his <lb/>
side in the carriage with its servants in scarlet liveries.</p>
<p>When she was thirteen her mother gave her a small <lb/>
red morocco book in which to write her diary, and from <lb/>
that day till a few days before her death, she used to <lb/>
write down every night the events of the day. As a <lb/>
little girl she wrote down the hours of her lesson, when <lb/>
she went out riding, or was taken to the theatre or to <lb/>
hear music, and when she washed Dash, her pet dog.</p>
<p>The princess's governess was a German lady, Fr&auml;ulein <lb/>
Lehzen, whom she adored, though she was greatly in <lb/>
awe of her; she spoke German before she learned <lb/>
English, but her mother took care that she should <lb/>
learn English well. When she was eight a clergyman, <lb/>
Mr. Davys, was appointed to direct her education. He <lb/>
chose a number of teachers for her, and himself taught <lb/>
her religion and history. Her life was strict and dull, <lb/>
and in after years she did not look back to her childhood <lb/>
as a happy time. George IV. died when she was six <lb/>
and was succeeded by his brother, William IV., who had <lb/>
no children, so that Princess Victoria was now heir to <lb/>
the throne. Her mother did not get on with William IV. <lb/>
and did not like her to go to court, and this made the <lb/>
King very angry, though he was always very kind to <lb/>

the little princess when she visited him privately. She <lb/>
was not allowed to go to his coronation, because the <lb/>
King and her mother could not agree as to the place <lb/>
she should take in the procession. This was a great <lb/>
disappointment and she wept bitterly&mdash;nothing could <lb/>
console her, not even her dolls.</p>
<p>It was a great grief to the princess when her uncle <lb/>
Leopold left England to become King of Belgium. She <lb/>
was devotedly attached to him and he to her, and she <lb/>
always looked to him for advice and guidance. They <lb/>
wrote to one another constantly in terms of the deepest <lb/>
affection. He recommended her books to read and <lb/>
discussed the affairs of Europe with her. As part of <lb/>
her education her mother used to take her on tours <lb/>
through different parts of England, when they visited <lb/>
the great nobles and some of the chief sights and most <lb/>
important cities. She was sometimes a little tired by <lb/>
all the stiff ceremonies she had to go through, though <lb/>
she liked seeing people. She was very fond of music <lb/>
and dancing, spent much of her time in singing, and <lb/>
learnt to play the harp.</p>
<p>When she was sixteen, she was confirmed by the <lb/>
Archbishop of Canterbury, and he spoke to her so <lb/>
seriously about the duties of her position that she was <lb/>
drowned in tears and frightened to death. One of her <lb/>
uncle Leopold's most cherished plans was that the <lb/>
princess should marry her cousin, Prince Albert of <reg orig="Saxe-|Coburg">Saxe-Coburg</reg>; <lb/>
and when she was seventeen, he arranged that <lb/>
Prince Albert, who was a few months younger, should <lb/>
visit England with his father and elder brother. The <lb/>
visit was a great success. The princess wrote to her <lb/>
uncle: "They are both very amiable, very good and kind, <lb/>
and extremely merry, just as young people should be. <lb/>
Albert is extremely handsome &hellip; they are excessively <lb/>
<pb n="175" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0183"/>
fond of music, like me." A fortnight later she wrote: <lb/>
"I must thank you, my beloved uncle, for the <reg orig="pros-|pect">prospect</reg> <lb/>
<figure id="f33" rend="block" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0183">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">Portrait of Prince Albert.</hi></head>
</figure>
of great happiness you have contributed to give <lb/>
me in the person of dear Albert. Allow me, then, my <lb/>
<pb n="176" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0184"/>
dearest uncle, to tell you how delighted I am with him, <lb/>
and how much I like him in every way. He possesses <lb/>
every quality that could be desired to make me perfectly <lb/>
happy. He is so sensible, so kind, and so good, and so <lb/>
amiable too. He has, besides, the most pleasing and <lb/>
delightful exterior and appearance you can possibly <lb/>
see." Prince Albert thought his cousin very amiable <lb/>
and wonderfully self-possessed. Nothing was, however, <lb/>
said about marriage during this visit and the prince <lb/>
returned to Germany.</p>
<p>Just after the princess was eighteen, her uncle, King <lb/>
William IV., died, on June 20, 1837. She herself <reg orig="de-|scribed">described</reg> <lb/>
in her journal what happened afterwards: "I was <lb/>
awoke at six o'clock by Mama, who told me that the <lb/>
Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were <lb/>
here and wished to see me. I got out of bed, and went <lb/>
into my sitting-room &lpar;only in my dressing-gown&rpar; and <lb/>
alone, and saw them." They told her that the King <lb/>
was dead, and, kneeling to kiss her hand, greeted as Queen <lb/>
the slim young girl just roused from sleep. A couple <lb/>
of hours later, Lord Melbourne, the Prime Minister, <lb/>
came to see her, and she wrote: "I saw him in my room <lb/>
and, of course, quite alone, as I shall always do all my <lb/>
ministers." She who had been so carefully guarded by <lb/>
mother and governess had now to act alone, and it <lb/>
seems, from the way she notes it in her journal, as if <lb/>
she was glad. She held her first Council that morning, <lb/>
and again writes that she went to it quite alone. There <lb/>
she read the speech that Lord Melbourne had <reg orig="pre-|pared">prepared</reg> <lb/>
for her to the ministers and privy-councillors. <lb/>
Every one was struck with the way in which she bore <lb/>
herself. Though she was very short, not five feet tall, <lb/>
her movements were dignified and graceful. Her voice, <lb/>
which was very beautiful, was clear and untroubled and <lb/>
<pb n="177" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0185"/>
thrilled her hearers. The blush on her cheek added <lb/>
to the interest and charm of her appearance. Lord <lb/>
Wellington said, "She not merely filled her chair, she <lb/>
filled the room." She was quite composed; she wrote <lb/>
in after years that she took things as they came, as she <lb/>
knew they must <lb/>
be. What she was <lb/>
feeling she wrote <lb/>
that night in her <lb/>
diary: "Since it <lb/>
has pleased <reg orig="Provi-|dence">Providence</reg> <lb/>
to place me <lb/>
in this station, I <lb/>
shall do my utmost <lb/>
to fulfil my duty <reg orig="to-|wards">towards</reg> <lb/>
my country; <lb/>
I am very young, <lb/>
and perhaps in <lb/>
many, though not <lb/>
in all, things <reg orig="in-|experienced">inexperienced</reg>, <lb/>
but I <lb/>
am sure that very <lb/>
few have more <lb/>
real good will and <lb/>
more real desire to <lb/>
do what is fit and <lb/>
right than I have;" she wrote, too, in large letters, <lb/>
"I AM QUEEN."</p>

<p>She was delighted with the kindness of Lord <lb/>
Melbourne, her Prime Minister, and he from the first <lb/>
felt deeply the charm of the girl-queen, whose steps <lb/>
he guided like a father. After the quiet, dull life <lb/>
she had led hitherto, it was an amazing change for <lb/>
her, and she enjoyed it to the full. She loved meeting <lb/>
<pb n="178" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0186"/>
people and enjoyed the large dinners at which she <lb/>
presided. She loved her long rides with the ladies <lb/>
and gentlemen of her court; she enjoyed the court <lb/>
balls, at which she used to dance all night. But she <lb/>
was also determined from the first to do her work <lb/>
as Queen. She felt that the country was hers, that <lb/>
the ministers were hers, and that the people were <lb/>
her people, whom she had to govern. From the first <lb/>
she showed that as Queen she was going to be <reg orig="inde-|pendent">independent</reg> <lb/>
of her mother. The duchess lived with her <lb/>
but she had a separate set of rooms, and was allowed no <lb/>
share in public business. Long hours were spent by the <lb/>
Queen with Lord Melbourne, talking over public affairs, <lb/>
that she might learn to understand them. He constantly <lb/>
dined with her, and when he did always sat next her, <lb/>
and often talked to her of books and of people whom <lb/>
he had known. She wrote in her diary: "He has such <lb/>
stores of knowledge, such a wonderful memory; he <lb/>
knows about everybody and everything, and he <reg orig="im-|parts">imparts</reg> <lb/>
all his knowledge in such a kind and agreeable <lb/>
manner."</p>
<p>Another friend and adviser was Baron Stockmar, <lb/>
a German friend of the Queen's uncle, Leopold, whom <lb/>
he had sent to England to help her to understand <lb/>
politics. He was a wise man, of great knowledge, and <lb/>
taught the Queen how she must keep out of party <lb/>
politics, and what were the limits of her power. It <lb/>
was difficult to know exactly what was the power <lb/>
of the sovereign in England. The monarchy was <lb/>
not popular when Victoria became Queen. Neither <lb/>
George IV. nor William IV. had been much respected, <lb/>
and they had had little influence on affairs. Victoria <lb/>
had a high idea of her position as well as of her duties <lb/>
as Queen, but she had to learn exactly how much she <lb/>
<pb n="179" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0187"/>
was able to do. Sometimes she was deeply vexed <lb/>
when she could not get her own way, and she made <lb/>
some mistakes at first. But her strong sense of duty <lb/>
kept her in the right way, and showed her the kind <lb/>
of influence she could use. Her ministers might <lb/>
change, but she was always there, and as she took <lb/>
the greatest trouble to know all that was going on, <lb/>
and read all the most important dispatches written by <lb/>
her ministers, she soon got a very wide understanding <lb/>
of affairs, particularly of foreign politics. It was a <lb/>
strange life for a girl. All the morning she read <lb/>
dispatches, or signed her name to papers, or talked <lb/>
to her ministers. Then came her long rides, her <lb/>
music and singing, a game of battledore and <reg orig="shuttle-|cock">shuttlecock</reg> <lb/>
with some of her ladies, a dinner, followed by <lb/>
dancing, music, cards, or wise talk with her ministers. <lb/>
She enjoyed it all, the power and the freedom, and the <lb/>
attention paid to her by the waiting crowds when she <lb/>
rode out.</p>
<p>Shortly after her accession, she went to live at <lb/>
Buckingham Palace. It had been built in the reign <lb/>
of George IV., but neither he nor William IV. had <lb/>
lived there; it was not at all a convenient house, and <lb/>
afterwards the Queen improved it very much. She <lb/>
at first thought Windsor a very melancholy place, but <lb/>
she learnt to like it when in the summer her uncle <lb/>
Leopold stayed there with her, and she wrote after <lb/>
his visit: "I have passed such a pleasant time here, <lb/>
the pleasantest summer I have ever passed in my <lb/>
life." She was very hospitable, and invited many <lb/>
relations and other guests to stay at Windsor, and <lb/>
liked to show them all over the castle, even into the <lb/>
kitchen.</p>
<p>The Queen's first public appearance of importance <lb/>
<pb n="180" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0188"/>
was when, the month after her accession, she dissolved <lb/>
Parliament, and herself read her speech from the <lb/>
throne. Her voice was said to be exquisite, and her <lb/>
manner of speaking quite perfect. Next year came <lb/>
her coronation. She seems to have enjoyed the great <lb/>
day immensely. As she drove through the enthusiastic <lb/>
crowds on her way to Westminster Abbey, she felt <lb/>
proud to be the Queen of such a nation. When she <lb/>
got back to the palace, ten hours after she had set <lb/>
out, she did not really feel tired, and after dinner felt <lb/>
much gratified when Lord Melbourne said to her, with <lb/>
tears in his eyes, "You did it beautifully&mdash;every part <lb/>
of it with so much taste." Later, from her mother's <lb/>
balcony, she watched the fireworks.</p>
<p>The idea of her marriage with Prince Albert was still <lb/>
cherished; but she was in no hurry, and meanwhile was <lb/>
very anxious about his education. She wrote to her <lb/>
uncle that it was her great desire to see "Albert a very <lb/>
good and distinguished young man." In 1839 he again <lb/>
visited England with his brother, and it was not long <lb/>
before the two young people fell genuinely in love with <lb/>
one another. It was the Queen who had to make the <lb/>
proposal. She called him to her room and, feeling it <lb/>
a very nervous moment, told him of her wish. She <lb/>
wrote to her uncle: "The warm affection he showed me <lb/>
on learning this gave me great pleasure&hellip; I love him <lb/>
more than I can say&hellip; I do feel very, very happy." <lb/>
They were married the following February, and the <lb/>
Queen found in Prince Albert all the happiness she had <lb/>
hoped for. In after years when she looked back, she <lb/>
felt that the years of her reign before their marriage <lb/>
were the least sensible and satisfactory parts of her <lb/>
whole life, "because of the constant amusement and <lb/>
flattery and mere politics" in which she had lived. <lb/>

</figure>
<pb n="182" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0190"/>
Now she had the joy of a companion to help her in all <lb/>
her work and to share her life with her. But at first <lb/>
there were difficulties. Prince Albert was not popular; <lb/>
he was too German for English people to understand <lb/>
him. The Queen bitterly resented the attacks made on <lb/>
him. The ministers did not like him to take any part <lb/>
in affairs, and his position was very uncomfortable. But <lb/>
in time he showed how much he could help the Queen, <lb/>
and came to share all her work. They had nine children, <lb/>
and the Queen was a devoted mother, so it was well <lb/>
that she had the prince's help in her public life. Her <lb/>
love and admiration for him were unbounded. After <lb/>
three years of married life, she wrote to her uncle: "I <lb/>
am grateful for possessing &lpar;really without vanity or <lb/>
flattery or blindness&rpar; the most perfect being as a husband <lb/>
in existence, or who ever did exist; and I doubt <lb/>
whether anybody ever did love or respect another as <lb/>
I do my dear angel."</p>
<p>In 1842 they paid their first visit to Scotland, and <lb/>
enjoyed it immensely. So much did the Queen love <lb/>
the quiet and liberty of her life in Scotland, that after <lb/>
several visits she rented Balmoral House in <reg orig="Aberdeen-|shire">Aberdeenshire</reg> <lb/>
that she might have a Scotch home of her own; <lb/>
and after a while was able to buy the estate and build a <lb/>
new house on it. She did not like London after her <lb/>
marriage, and wanted a place where she and her family <lb/>
could live undisturbed by too many officials, so she <lb/>
also bought a place in the Isle of Wight and built <lb/>
Osborne House there. At both Osborne and Balmoral <lb/>
life was very simple. The Queen would run in and out <lb/>
of the house as she liked, and walked about alone, visiting <lb/>
the cottagers and enjoying her talks with them.</p>
<p>The Queen and Prince Albert gave much attention <lb/>
to the education of their children. Lady Lyttelton was <lb/>
<pb n="183" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0191"/>
named royal governess and superintended the nursery. <lb/>
The children were brought up very simply; the Queen <lb/>
spent as much time as she could with them, played with <lb/>
them, and interested herself in their friends and their <lb/>
pets, and they were encouraged to act little plays and <lb/>
recite poetry to their parents. Prince Albert, like the <lb/>
Queen, was very musical, and they often sang together. <lb/>
When the famous composer, Mendelssohn, visited <lb/>
England, he was invited to Buckingham Palace, and <lb/>
they both sang to his accompaniment. He said that <lb/>
the Queen sang "really quite faultlessly and with <lb/>
charming feeling and expression." They also loved <lb/>
the theatre, and plays were often acted at Windsor.</p>
<p>Several times the Queen visited Germany with Prince <lb/>
Albert, and they also went to Ireland. But wherever <lb/>
they were they never failed in their attention to public <lb/>
business. It was a great grief to the Queen when a <lb/>
change in the government came, and Lord Melbourne <lb/>
had to resign. But she always remained friends with <lb/>
him and wrote to him constantly. At first she dreaded <lb/>
having to do with his successor, Sir Robert Peel, but she <lb/>
grew to like and admire him very much. With nearly <lb/>
all her ministers her relations were most cordial; only <lb/>
with Lord Palmerston did she find it difficult to get on, <lb/>
and she never was quite easy with Gladstone. They <lb/>
all alike admired her industry and strong sense of duty, <lb/>
and her great knowledge of public affairs.</p>
<p>In 1851 the first International Exhibition was held <lb/>
in London. The idea of such an exhibition was Prince <lb/>
Albert's, and at first it met with great opposition, both <lb/>
at home and abroad. But it turned out a triumphant <lb/>
success. Many foreign princes came to the opening <lb/>
ceremony. The Queen described it to her uncle as "the <lb/>
greatest day in our history, the most beautiful and <reg orig="impos-|ing">imposing</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="184" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0192"/>
and touching spectacle ever seen, and the triumph <lb/>
of my beloved Albert." People hoped that this great <lb/>
gathering of all nations would prove a festival of peace. <lb/>
But it was only a very few years afterwards that the <lb/>
<figure id="f36" rend="block" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0192">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">Lord Palmerston.</hi></head>
<p>From a seated figure in Hayter's Reformed Parliament <lb/>
in the National Portrait Gallery.</p>
</figure>
Crimean War broke out. In this war England took <lb/>
part as the ally of Napoleon III. who had just made <lb/>
himself Emperor of France. The Queen followed the <lb/>
war with the deepest anxiety. She felt proud of the <lb/>
conduct of her troops, as she always called them; she <lb/>
<pb n="185" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0193"/>
welcomed them on their return, presented them with <lb/>
medals with her own hands, and did all in her power <lb/>
to show sympathy with their sufferings. Before the <lb/>
war was over, she paid her first visit to Paris to show <lb/>
her friendship for the Emperor, whose personal charm <lb/>
at that time attracted her very much; later she learnt <lb/>
<figure id="f37" rend="block" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0193">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">William Ewart Gladstone.</hi></head>
</figure>
to distrust him. She was received with immense <lb/>
enthusiasm, and wrote that she was "delighted, <reg orig="en-|chanted">enchanted</reg>, <lb/>
amused, and interested, and had never seen <lb/>
anything more beautiful and gay than Paris."</p>
<p>When the Crimean War was over, the Queen visited <lb/>
Aldershot, and reviewed the troops herself. She started <lb/>
a new order, called the Victoria Cross, to be given to <lb/>
<pb n="186" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0194"/>
those soldiers who had done some specially brave act, <lb/>
and gave it herself to fifty-two men at a review in <lb/>
Hyde Park.</p>
<p>In 1856 her eldest daughter was betrothed to the <lb/>
Crown Prince of Prussia. The Queen was delighted, <lb/>
and showed her high spirits by dancing vigorously at <lb/>
all the balls given in honour of the betrothal. She <lb/>
even danced a Scottish reel to the bagpipes. The <lb/>
next year came the great anxiety <lb/>
of the Indian mutiny. The Queen <lb/>
felt it much more distressing than <lb/>
the Crimean War, "where there was <lb/>
glory and honourable warfare, and <lb/>
where the poor women and children <lb/>
were safe." It was also a sorrow to <lb/>
part from her eldest daughter when <lb/>
she married, but she rejoiced in her <lb/>
happiness and visited her in <reg orig="Ger-|many">Germany</reg>. <lb/>
In 1859, at the age of <lb/>
thirty-nine, she became a <reg orig="grand-|mother">grandmother</reg> <lb/>
when her first grandchild, <lb/>
the present Emperor of Germany, <lb/>
was born. Her family were an <reg orig="ever-|growing">ever-growing</reg> <lb/>
joy to her, and life was full of interest and <lb/>
happiness.</p>

</figure>
<p>But in the year 1861 a sudden end came to her <reg orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg>. <lb/>
In the spring her mother died; and she wrote <lb/>
as a broken-hearted child to her uncle, saying that she <lb/>
could not imagine life without her. A greater blow was <lb/>
awaiting her. Before the end of the year, Prince Albert <lb/>
fell ill, and, almost before his illness was known to be <lb/>
serious, he died. The Queen was utterly crushed. In <lb/>
her first broken-hearted letter to her uncle, she said: "My <lb/>
life as a happy one is ended, the world is gone for me." <lb/>

It was indeed a terrible loss for her. She had absolutely <lb/>
depended on him and leant on his advice, and she had <lb/>
loved him and looked up to him as a perfect being. <lb/>
Ten years before, she had written about his wonderful <lb/>
fitness for business and politics, and added: "I grow <lb/>
daily to dislike them both, more and more. We <lb/>
women are not made for governing&mdash;and if we are <lb/>
good women, we must dislike these masculine <reg orig="occupa-|tions">occupations</reg>." <lb/>
Now she was left to govern alone, bereft of <lb/>
what had been the joy of her home life. Immense <lb/>
sympathy was shown to her and she was much touched <lb/>
by it. She determined to take her husband's example <lb/>
as her guide, and to give the same minute care as he <lb/>
had given to public affairs. But she shut herself up in <lb/>
absolute seclusion, seeing no one but her family and <lb/>
those whom she had to see for business.</p>
<p>At first, people accepted the Queen's seclusion as <lb/>
natural and respected her grief. But as the years <lb/>
passed and she made no change, many complaints <lb/>
were made of her neglect of the duties of her position. <lb/>
The newspapers published criticisms of her conduct, <lb/>
which deeply wounded her. She made no change, and <lb/>
spoke of herself as a cruelly misunderstood woman. At <lb/>
first, her only public appearances were to unveil statues <lb/>
of her husband, and occasionally she opened Parliament. <lb/>
She worked as hard as ever at public business, and was <lb/>
much taken up with family affairs and with the <reg orig="arrange-|ments">arrangements</reg> <lb/>
for the marriage of her children. She liked best <lb/>
to be at Balmoral, and felt Windsor a sad and gloomy <lb/>
place. During these years her seclusion led to her <lb/>
being decidedly unpopular, and it may rightly be <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
the one serious mistake in her life.</p>
<p>The serious illness of the Prince of Wales in 1871 <lb/>
roused much sympathy and helped to make the Crown <lb/>
<pb n="189" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0197"/>
again more popular. When Mr. Disraeli became Prime <lb/>
Minister the Queen began to find public business more <lb/>
interesting. He was not only clever, but he took much <lb/>
trouble to be agreeable to her and to amuse her, so <lb/>
that she became really fond of him. She was delighted <lb/>

with his Indian policy, which ended in her being <reg orig="pro-|claimed">proclaimed</reg> <lb/>
Empress of India in 1876. She much enjoyed <lb/>
this new honour, and showed her feeling for India by <lb/>
having Indian servants to attend upon her, and by <lb/>
beginning to learn Hindustani.</p>
<p>As the years passed, many sorrows came to the Queen <lb/>
through the death of relations and friends; especially <lb/>
she felt the death of her second daughter, Princess <lb/>
<pb n="190" entity="Creighton_SomeFamousWomen_0198"/>
Alice. She continued to exert much influence on <lb/>
public affairs, and always did all in her power to help <lb/>
to keep the peace in Europe. In 1879 she visited Italy <lb/>
for the first time, and she often repeated her visit and <lb/>
travelled also in other countries, always in a very quiet <lb/>
and simple way.</p>
<p>In 1887 the Queen had been on the throne for fifty <lb/>
years, and she was persuaded to keep her Jubilee <lb/>
publicly. On the Jubilee Day, June 21, 1887, she went <lb/>
in procession, preceded by thirty-two princes of her own <lb/>
family, sons, sons-in-law, and grandsons, to a <reg orig="thanks-|giving">thanksgiving</reg> <lb/>
service in Westminster Abbey. Representatives <lb/>
of all the countries of Europe, of India, and the colonies <lb/>
followed her. The immense crowds who gathered to <lb/>
see her pass received her with an enthusiasm which <lb/>
deeply touched her. She said on her return to <lb/>
Buckingham Palace that she was very tired but very <lb/>
happy. The same enthusiasm attended other <reg orig="celebra-|tions">celebrations</reg> <lb/>
in connection with the Jubilee. In her old age <lb/>
the Queen was as popular, perhaps even more popular, <lb/>
than she had been in her youth. People in all the <lb/>
wide lands which made up the British Empire felt that <lb/>
she was the outward sign of the unity of the Empire. <lb/>
They venerated her for her long and blameless life, <lb/>
devoted to duty. In far distant lands, black and <lb/>
savage people honoured the great white Queen and <lb/>
trusted in her justice.</p>
<p>After the Jubilee, she went about a little more and <lb/>
saw more people; she visited Berlin, and spent some <lb/>
time in the south of Europe each year. She received <lb/>
many royal visitors, and once more there were concerts <lb/>
and dramatic performances at court. In spite of her <lb/>
age she still gave as much attention as ever to business, <lb/>
and would spend two or three hours a day going <lb/>

through papers, and signing her name to public <lb/>
documents.</p>
<p>In 1897 when she had reigned sixty years, her second, <lb/>
or diamond, Jubilee was celebrated. This time a great <lb/>
state procession was made all through London, and on <lb/>
reaching St. Paul's Cathedral, the Queen's carriage <lb/>
paused at the bottom of the steps for a brief service of <lb/>
thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Her last years were clouded by the war in South Africa. <lb/>
Amidst all the gloom that followed on the news of the <lb/>
disasters suffered there by the English troops, the <lb/>
Queen never despaired of ultimate success. She took <lb/>
every opportunity of showing her sympathy with her <lb/>
soldiers, and telling them of her gratitude for their <lb/>
exertions. The war was not over when she began to <lb/>
show signs of failing health. One of the last things <lb/>
she did was to receive Lord Roberts, to hear from him <lb/>
about the state of things in Africa. Little more than a <lb/>
week afterwards she died, at the age of eighty-one.</p>
<p>When we think over her long life and the great <lb/>
position she filled, we find that she owed her influence <lb/>
more to the strong sense of duty she always had, and <lb/>
to her constant determination to do what she felt to be <lb/>
right, than to any special gifts or talents she possessed. <lb/>
She was a wonderful woman because she was always <lb/>
true to the best that she knew, and it is this that <lb/>
makes her an example for us all.</p>
