                <p>Noting that it gave him great pride and pleasure to do so, the
                    Rector introduced the University’s two Rhodes Scholars, <name>Ms. Meghan
                        Sullivan</name> of Greensboro, North Carolina, and – <hi rend="italic">in absentia</hi> – <name>Mr.
                        Justin Mutter</name> of Chattanooga, Tennessee (<name>Mr. Mutter</name> is
                    working in Haiti); <name>Ms. Sullivan and Mr. Mutter</name> will matriculate in
                    the University of Oxford in the fall. <name>Ms. Sullivan</name> will read
                    philosophy and <name>Mr. Mutter</name> will read theology.</p>

                <pb n="6788"/>

                <p>The Rector also introduced <name>Mr. Markus Weisner</name> of
                    Midlothian, the University’s Mitchell Scholar. The Mitchell Scholarship provides
                    for a year of study in Ireland, and <name>Mr. Weisner</name> will matriculate in
                    Trinity College, Dublin, in the fall.</p>

                <p>The Rector next introduced <name>Ms. Nicole Hurd</name>, the
                    Director of the Center for Undergraduate Excellence, and explained that
                        <name>Ms. Hurd</name> had overseen the selection process for both the Rhodes
                    and the Mitchell at the University, and had encouraged and advised <name>Ms.
                        Sullivan and Messrs. Mutter and Weisner</name> through the further stages of
                    the national competitions for both scholarships.</p>

                <head type="main">THE PRESIDENT’S REPORT</head>

                <p>The President gave his customary report to the Board.</p>

                <p>The President gave a quick overview of legislation of interest to
                    the University pending in the General Assembly, particularly the charter bills.</p>

                <p>The President then reported to the Board that the <hi rend="italic">Virginia
                    Quarterly Review</hi> in December was given the Parnassus Award for Significant
                    Editorial Achievement by the Council of Editors of Learned Journals. The
                    Parnassus Award “recognizes a single issue, published within the previous three
                    years, that epitomizes the journal’s mission and at the same time meets the
                    highest standards of editorial practice.” The issue of the Quarterly cited by
                    the Council was the Spring 2004 issue, only the second issue of the magazine
                    produced under the editorship of <name>Mr. Theodore Genoways</name>. The
                    President then introduced Mr. Genoways to the Board.</p>

                <p>The President noted the recent death of The Honorable Hunter
                    Andrews, who represented the City of Hampton in the Senate in Richmond for many
                    years. Senator Andrews, who was Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, was a
                    great friend to higher education.</p>

                <p>The President also noted the death of <name>Ms. Shirley
                    Menaker</name>, Associate Provost, and the departure of <name>Mr. William
                    Harmon</name>, Senior Vice President, in December to become the President of
                    Central College in the Houston Community College system.</p>

                <p>Among the significant gifts received since the last meeting of the
                    Board are $6million in pledge payments to the Virginia Athletics Foundation, the

                    Meyers</name> of Marblehead, Massachusetts. gave $5.2million to the Curry School
                    for the Newton and Rita Meyers Professorship and toward the construction of a
                    new building.</p>

                <p>The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of America made a $4.8million
                    grant to the School of Medicine for cancer research and Amvest Corporation of

                    represents another five percent interest in the copy of the Declaration of
                    Independence and additional gifts to the Library.</p>

                <p>Some new pledges made since the October meeting of the Board

                <p><name>Larry J. Sabato</name>, University Professor and Director of
                    the Center for the Study of Politics, as a student thirty years ago, promised
                    President Shannon that he would give a million dollars to the University. He has
                    now pledged $1million to the University’s campaign to support the Center for
                    Politics. The President noted that even though <name>Mr. Sabato</name> is
                    legendary for his frugal lifestyle, his gift represents a tremendous personal
                    sacrifice and a devotion to the University that is unmatched.</p>
                <pb n="6790"/>
