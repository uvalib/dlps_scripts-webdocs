            <p>
            Thanks for your letter
            and the many compliments.  Don’t
            fool yourself about what I’m
            going to do for I do not share
            your confidence in my ability.
            </p><p>
            With us the war is
            still going on in its rentless [sic] way,
            and to make things worse the
            coal at the thermal baths is
            running short and one is forced to
            take only a lukewarm bath now 
            and then.  The social features are 
            improving.  Cowden was decorated with
            the Midaille Militaire and we had a
            big review at the field.  One of
            our drivers was killed with a bomb
            a Boche dropped and we gave him
            the sportiest funeral seen around
            these parts in years.  To morrow
            we’re to have another joy ride
            thru [sic] the Val d’Ajol to attend the
            funeral of a Captain of a near by
            escadrille who was killed owing to
            his motor stopping.  Cowden has beat
            it back to Paris before the lustre [sic]
            of his Midaille is dimmed and Prince
            who has just returned is going
            back.  From all this you will
            know that our Babies have not 
            been born.  Five have arrived only so
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0312" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            Chapman, Cowden, Prince and I are without.
            Kiffin did well yesterday.  He was
            trying out his machine and while
            in the air a terrific ground wind
            came up.  Two Farmers standing
            on the field were blown over and
            wrecked but Kiffin managed to come
            down in a skilful [sic] way and landed.
            Mechanics immediately grabbed his machine
            to keep it from being blown
            away.

            Rosa is still as pretty as ever.
            But have I told you about Rosa?
            She is of Italian birth but raised
            in France.  For charm of manner, grace 
            of figure, and beauty of face she can
            give them all a head start and
            then beat in a walk.  Rosa serves
            beer in a home like cafe on the hill,
            and unless they make her stop I’m
            going to become a beer drinker.  She
            has the trimmest ankles I’ve seen
            in ages and it mellows the beer
            to watch her walk towards one
            with it.  The only draw back is that
            Rosa’s people never let her out of sight
            and so I have to talk with the
            family and say “Bonjour Coco” to the parrot.
            </p><p>
            To morrow the five that are 
            ready will go over the lines so
            we’re really getting started.  Bill Thaw

            asked about you and sends his best
            regards.

            I received a letter from Betty’s
            mother telling me her daughter had
            improved remarkably in the three
            days before writing and they hoped 
            soon to move her to Paris.
            </p><p>
            I’m sorry you’ve been feeling
            badly.  You’ve had a tough time of it
            this year.
            </p><p>
            Well I hope that I’ll get my
            plane in a few days and can
            get to work.  This lazy life of
            <unclear>Luxeuil [sp?]</unclear> is getting on my nerves.  As
            a summer resorter I’m enjoying
            myself tho [sic].  The town has Paris
            looking like a place of which the
            late Anthony Comstock might be mayor.
            </p><p>
            Walter Lovell wants to get into 
            aviation and I’m giving him the
            information.  Hope he does join for I
            know he’ll make good.
            </p><p>
            Must hurry along now and drink
            my afternoon’s cup of Luxeuil hot 
            water.
