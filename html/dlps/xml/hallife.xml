                <head>PREFACE</head>


                <p> This book contains a life of Columbus, written with the hope of interesting all
                    classes of readers. </p>
                <p>His life has often been written, and it has sometimes been well written. The
                    great book of our countryman, Washington Irving, is a noble model of diligent
                    work given to a very difficult subject. And I think every person who has dealt
                    with the life of Columbus since Irving's time, has expressed his gratitude and
                    respect for the author. </p>
                <p>According to the custom of biographers, in that time and since, he includes in
                    those volumes the whole history of the West India islands, for the period after
                    Columbus discovered them till his death. He also thinks it his duty to include
                    much of the history of Spain and of the Spanish court. I do not myself believe
                    that it is wise to attempt, in a book of biography, so considerable a study of
                    the history of the time. Whether it be wise or not, I have not attempted it in
                    this book. I have rather attempted to follow closely the personal fortunes of
                        <pb n="6"/> Christopher Columbus, and, to the history around him, I have
                    given only such space as seemed absolutely necessary for the illustration of
                    those fortunes. </p>
                <p>I have followed on the lines of his own personal narrative wherever we have it.
                    And where this is lost I have used the absolutely contemporary authorities. I
                    have also consulted the later writers, those of the next generation and the
                    generation which followed it. But the more one studies the life of Columbus the
                    more one feels sure that, after the greatness of his discovery was really known,
                    the accounts of the time were overlaid by what modern criticism calls myths,
                    which had grown up in the enthusiasm of those who honored him, and which form no
                    part of real history. If then the reader fails to find some stories with which
                    he is quite familiar in the history, he must not suppose that they are omitted
                    by accident, but must give to the author of the book the credit of having used
                    some discretion in the choice of his authorities. </p>
                <p>When I visited Spain in 1882, I was favored by the officers of the Spanish
                    government with every facility for carrying my inquiry as far as a short <pb
                        n="7"/> visit would permit. Since that time Mr. Harrisse has published his
                    invaluable volumes on the life of Columbus. It certainly seems as if every
                    document now existing, which bears upon the history, had been collated by him.
                    The reader will see that I have made full use of this treasure-house. </p>
                <p>The Congress of Americanistas, which meets every year, brings forward many
                    curious studies on the history of the continent, but it can scarcely be said to
                    have done much to advance our knowledge of the personal life of Columbus. </p>
                <p>The determination of the people of the United States to celebrate fitly the great
                    discovery which has advanced civilization and changed the face of the world,
                    makes it certain that a new interest has arisen in the life of the great man to
                    whom, in the providence of God, that discovery was due. The author and
                    publishers of this book offer it as their contribution in the great celebration,
                    with the hope that it may be of use, especially in the direction of the studies
                    of the young.</p>

                    <lb/> EARLY LIFE OF COLUMBUS.<lb/>
                    <lb/> HIS BIRTH AND BIRTH-PLACE &mdash; HIS EARLY EDUCATION &mdash; HIS
                    EXPERIENCE AT SEA &mdash; HIS MARRIAGE AND RESIDENCE IN LISBON &mdash;
                    HIS PLANS FOR THE DISCOVERY OF A WESTWARD PASSAGE TO THE INDIES. </head>

                <p>Christopher Columbus was born in the Republic of Genoa. The honor of his
                    birth-place has been claimed by many villages in that Republic, and the house in
                    which he was born cannot be now pointed out with certainty. But the best
                    authorities agree that the children and the grown people of the world have never
                    been mistaken when they have said: "America was discovered in 1492 by
                    Christopher Columbus, a native of Genoa." </p>
                <p>His name, and that of his family, is always <pb n="14"/> written Colombo, in the
                    Italian papers which refer to them, for more than one hundred years before his
                    time. In Spain it was always written Colon; in France it is written as Colomb;
                    while in England it has always kept its Latin form, Columbus. It has frequently
                    been said that he himself assumed this form, because Columba is the Latin word
                    for "Dove," with a fanciful feeling that, in carrying Christian light to the
                    West, he had taken the mission of the dove. Thus, he had first found land where
                    men thought there was ocean, and he was the messenger of the Holy Spirit to
                    those who sat in darkness. It has also been assumed that he took the name of
                    Christopher, "the Christ-bearer," for similar reasons. But there is no doubt
                    that he was baptized "Christopher," and that the family name had long been
                    Columbo. The coincidences of name are but two more in a calendar in which poetry
                    delights, and of which history is full. </p>
                <p>Christopher Columbus was the oldest son of Dominico Colombo and Suzanna
                    Fontanarossa. This name means Red-fountain. He bad two brothers, Bartholomew and
                    Diego, whom we shall <pb n="15"/> meet again. Diego is the Spanish way of
                    writing the name which we call James. </p>
                <p>It seems probable that Christopher was born in the year 1436, though some writers
                    have said that he was older than this, and some that he was younger. The record
                    of his birth and that of his baptism have not been found. </p>
                <p>His father was not a rich man, but he was able to send Christopher, as a boy, to
                    the University of Pavia, and here he studied grammar, geometry, geography and
                    navigation, astronomy and the Latin language. But this was as a boy studies, for
                    in his fourteenth year he left the university and entered, in hard work, on "the
                    larger college of the world." If the date given above, of his birth, is correct,
                    this was in the year 1450, a few years before the Turks took Constantinople,
                    and, in their invasion of Europe, affected the daily life of everyone, young or
                    old, who lived in the Mediterranean countries. From this time, for fifteen
                    years, it is hard to trace along the life of Columbus. It was the life of an
                    intelligent young seaman, going wherever there was a voyage for him. He says
                    himself, "I <pb n="16"/> passed twenty-three years on the sea. I have seen all
                    the Levant, all the western coasts, and the North. I have seen England; I have
                    often made the voyage from Lisbon to the Guinea coast." This he wrote in a
                    letter to Ferdinand and Isabella. Again he says, "I went to sea from the most
                    tender age and have continued in a sea life to this day. Whoever gives himself
                    up to this art wants to know the secrets of Nature here below. It is more than
                    forty years that I have been thus engaged. Wherever any one has sailed, there I
                    have sailed." </p>
                <p>Whoever goes into the detail of the history of that century will come upon the
                    names of two relatives of his &mdash; Colon el Mozo (the Boy, or the
                    Younger) and his uncle, Francesco Colon, both celebrated sailors. The latter of
                    the two was a captain in the fleets of Louis XI of France, and imaginative
                    students may represent him as meeting Quentin Durward at court. Christopher
                    Columbus seems to have made several voyages under the command of the younger of
                    these relatives. He commanded the Genoese galleys near Cyprus in a war which the
                    Genoese had with the <pb n="17"/> Venetians. Between the years 1461 and 1463 the
                    Genoese were acting as allies with King John of Calabria, and Columbus had a
                    command as captain in their navy at that time. </p>
                <p>"In 1477," he says, in one of his letters, "in the month of February, I sailed
                    more than a hundred leagues beyond Tile." By this he means Thule, or Iceland.
                    "Of this island the southern part is seventy-three degrees from the equator, not
                    sixty-three degrees, as some geographers pretend." But here he was wrong. The
                    Southern part of Iceland is in the latitude of sixty-three and a half degrees.
                    "The English, chiefly those of Bristol, carry their merchandise, to this island,
                    which is as large as England. When I was there the sea was not frozen, but the
                    tides there are so strong that they rise and fall twenty-six cubits." </p>
                <p>The order of his life, after his visit to Iceland, is better known. He was no
                    longer an adventurous sailor-boy, glad of any voyage which offered; he was a man
                    thirty years of age or more. He married in the city of Lisbon and settled
                    himself there. His wife was named Philippa. She was the daughter of an Italian
                    gentleman <pb n="18"/> named Bartolomeo Muniz de Perestrello, who was, like
                    Columbus, a sailor, and was alive to all the new interests which geography then
                    presented to all inquiring minds. This was in the year 1477, and the King of
                    Portugal was pressing the expeditions which, before the end of the century,
                    resulted in the discovery of the route to the Indies by the Cape of Good Hope. </p>
                <p>The young couple had to live. Neither the bride nor her husband had any fortune,
                    and Columbus occupied himself as a draftsman, illustrating books, making
                    terrestrial globes, which must have been curiously inaccurate, since they had no
                    Cape of Good Hope and no American Continent, drawing charts for sale, and
                    collecting, where he could, the material for such study. Such charts and maps
                    were beginning to assume new importance in those days of geographical discovery.
                    The value attached to them may be judged from the statement that Vespucius paid
                    one hundred and thirty ducats for one map. This sum would be more than five
                    hundred dollars of our time. </p>
                <p>Columbus did not give up his maritime enter-<pb n="19"/> prises. He made voyages
                    to the coast of Guinea and in other directions. </p>
                <p>It is said that he was in command of one of the vessels of his relative Colon el
                    Mozo, when, in the Portuguese seas, this admiral, with his squadron, engaged
                    four Venetian galleys returning from Flanders. A bloody battle followed. The
                    ship which Christopher Columbus commanded was engaged with a Venetian vessel, to
                    which it set fire. There was danger of an explosion, and Columbus himself,
                    seeing this danger, flung himself into the sea, seized a floating oar, and thus
                    gained the shore. He was not far from Lisbon, and from this time made Lisbon his
                    home for many years.<ref n="1" target="HalLife.1">[*]</ref>
                </p>
                <p>It seems. clear that, from the time when he arrived in Lisbon, for more than
                    twenty years, he was at work trying to interest people in his "great design," of
                    western discovery. He says himself, "I was constantly corresponding with learned
                    men, some ecclesiastics and some laymen, some Latin and some Greek, some Jews
                    and some <pb n="20"/> Moors." The astronomer Toscanelli was one of these
                    correspondents. </p>
                <p>We must not suppose that the idea of the roundness of the earth was invented by
                    Columbus. Although there were other theories about its shape, many intelligent
                    men well understood that the earth was a globe, and that the Indies, though they
                    were always reached from Europe by going to the East, must be on the west of
                    Europe also. There is a very funny story in the travels of Mandeville, in which
                    a traveler is represented as having gone, mostly on foot, through all the
                    countries of Asia, but finally determines to return to Norway, his home. In his
                    farthest eastern investigation, he hears some people calling their cattle by a
                    peculiar cry, which he had never heard before. After he returned home, it was
                    necessary for him to take a day's journey westward to look after some cattle he
                    had lost. Finding these cattle, he also heard the same cry of people calling
                    cattle, which he had heard in the extreme East, and now learned, for the first
                    time, that he had gone round the world on foot, to turn and come back by the
                    same route, when he was only a day's <pb n="21"/> journey from home, Columbus
                    was acquainted with such stories as this, and also had the astronomical
                    knowledge which almost made him know that the world was round, "and, like a
                    ball, goes spinning in the air." The difficulty was to persuade other people
                    that, because of this roundness, it would be possible to attain Asia by sailing
                    to the West. </p>
                <p>Now all the geographers of repute supposed that there was not nearly so large a
                    distance as there proved to be, in truth, between Europe and Asia. Thus, in the
                    geography of Ptolemy, which was the standard book at that time, one hundred and
                    thirty-five degrees, a little more than one-third of the earth's circumference,
                    is given to the space between the extreme eastern part of the Indies and the
                    Canary Islands. In fact, as we now know, the distance is one hundred and eighty
                    degrees, half the world's circumference. Had Columbus believed there was any
                    such immense distance, he would never have undertaken his voyage. </p>
                <p>Almost all the detailed knowledge of the Indies which the people of his time had,
                    was given by <pb n="22"/> the explorations of Marco Polo, a Venetian traveler of
                    the thirteenth century, whose book had long been in the possession of European
                    readers. It is a very entertaining book now, and may well be recommended to
                    young people who like stories of adventure. Marco Polo had visited the court of
                    the Great Khan of Tartary at Pekin, the prince who brought the Chinese Empire
                    into very much the condition in which it now is. He had, also, given accounts of
                    Japan or Cipango, which he had himself never visited. Columbus knew, therefore,
                    that, well east of the Indies, was the island of Cipango, and he aimed at that
                    island, because he supposed that that was the nearest point to Europe, as in
                    fact it is. And when finally he arrived at Cuba, as the reader will see, he
                    thought he was in Japan. </p>
                <p>Columbus's father-in-law had himself been the Portuguese governor of the island
                    of Porto Santo, where he had founded a colony. He, therefore, was interested in
                    western explorations, and probably from him Columbus collected some of the
                    statements which are known to have influenced him, with regard to floating
                    matters from the <pb n="23"/> West, which are constantly borne upon that island
                    by the great currents of the sea. </p>
                <p>The historians are fond of bringing together all the intimations which are given
                    in the Greek and Latin classics, and in later authors, with regard to a land
                    beyond Asia. Perhaps the most famous of them is that of Seneca, "In the later
                    years there shall come days in which Ocean shall loose his chains, and a great
                    land shall appear . . . and Thule shall not be the last of the worlds." </p>
                <p>In a letter which Toscanelli wrote to Columbus in 1474, he inclosed a copy of a
                    letter which he had already sent to an officer of Alphonso V, the King of
                    Portugal. In writing to Columbus, he says, "I see that you have a great and
                    noble desire to go into that country (of the East) where the spices come from,
                    and in reply to your letter I send you a copy of that which I addressed some
                    years ago to my attached friend in the service of the most serene King of
                    Portugal. He had an order from his Highness to write me on this subject. . . .
                    If I had a globe in my hand, I could show you what is needed. But I prefer to
                    mark out the route on a chart like a marine <pb n="24"/> chart, which will be an
                    assistance to your intelligence and enterprise. On this chart I have myself
                    drawn the whole extremity of our western shore from Ireland as far down as the
                    coast of Guinea toward the South, with all the islands which are to be found on
                    this route. Opposite this [that is, the shores of Ireland and Africa] I have
                    placed directly at the West the beginning of the Indies with the islands and
                    places where you will land. You will see for yourself how many miles you must
                    keep from the arctic pole toward the equator, and at what distance you will
                    arrive at these regions so fertile and productive of spices and precious
                    stones." In Toscanelli's letter, he not only indicates Japan, but, in the middle
                    of the ocean, he places the island of Antilia. This old name afterwards gave the
                    name by which the French still call the West Indies, Les Antilles. Toscanelli
                    gives the exact distance which Columbus will have to sail: "From Lisbon to the
                    famous city of Quisay [Hang-tcheou-fou, then the capital of China] if you take
                    the direct route toward the West, the distance will be thirty-nine hundred
                    miles. And from Antilia to Japan it will be two <pb n="25"/> hundred and
                    twenty-five leagues." Toscanelli says again, "You see that the voyage that you
                    wish to attempt is much legs difficult than would be thought. You would be sure
                    of this if you met as many people as I do who have been in the country of
                    spices." </p>
                <p>While there were so many suggestions made that it would be possible to cross the
                    Atlantic, there was one man who determined to do this. This man was Christopher
                    Columbus. But he knew well that he could not do it alone. He must have money
                    enough for an expedition, he must have authority to enlist crews for that
                    expedition, and he must have power to govern those crews when they should arrive
                    in the Indies. In our times such adventures have been conducted by mercantile
                    corporations, but in those times no one thought of doing any such thing without
                    the direct assistance and support of some monarch. </p>
                <p>It is easy now to see and to say that Columbus himself was singularly well fitted
                    to take the charge of the expedition of discovery. He was an excellent sailor
                    and at the same time he was a learned geographer and a good mathematician. <pb
                        n="26"/> He was living in Portugal, the kings of which country had, for many
                    years, fostered the exploration of the coast of Africa, and were pushing
                    expeditions farther and farther South. </p>
                <p>In doing this, they were, in a fashion, making new discoveries. For Europe was
                    wholly ignorant of the western coast of Africa, beyond the Canaries, when their
                    expeditions began. But all men of learning knew that, five hundred years before
                    the Christian era, Hanno, a Carthaginian, had sailed round Africa under the
                    direction of the senate of Carthage. The efforts of the King of Portugal were to
                    repeat the voyage made by Hanno. In 1441, Gonzales and Tristam sailed as far as
                    Sierra Leone. They brought back some blacks as slaves, and this was the
                    beginning of the slave trade. </p>
                <p>In 1446 the Portuguese took possession of the Azores, the most western points of
                    the Old World. Step by step they advanced southward, and became familiar with
                    the African coast. Bold navigators were eager to find the East, and at last
                    success came. Under the king's orders, in August, 1477, three caravels sailed
                    from the <pb n="27"/> Tagus, under Bartolomeo Diaz, for southern discovery. Diaz
                    was himself brave enough to be willing to go on to the Red Sea, after he made
                    the great discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, but his crews mutinied, after he
                    had gone much farther than his predecessors, and compelled him to return. He
                    passed the southern cape of Africa and went forty miles farther. He called it
                    the Cape of Torments, "Cabo Tormentoso," so terrible were the storms he met
                    there. But when King John heard his report he gave it that name of good omen
                    which it has borne ever since, the name of the "Cape of Good Hope." </p>
                <p>In the midst of such endeavors to reach the East Indies by the long voyage down
                    the coast of Africa and across an unknown ocean, Columbus was urging all people
                    who cared, to try the route directly west. If the world was round, as the sun
                    and moon were, and as so many men of learning believed, India or the Indies must
                    be to the west of Portugal. The value of direct trade with the Indies would be
                    enormous. Europe had already acquired a taste for the spices of India and had
                    confidence in the drugs of India. The silks and <pb n="28"/> other articles of
                    clothing made in India, and the carpets of India, were well known and prized.
                    Marco Polo and others had given an impression that there was much gold in India;
                    and the pearls and precious stones of India excited the imagination of all who
                    read his travels. </p>
                <p>The immense value of such a commerce may be estimated from one fact. When, a
                    generation after this time, one ship only of all the squadron of Magellan
                    returned to Cadiz, after the first voyage round the world, she was loaded with
                    spices from the Moluccas. These spices were sold by the Spanish government for
                    so large a sum of money that the king was remunerated for the whole cost of the
                    expedition, and even made a very large profit from a transaction which had cost
                    a great deal in its outfit. </p>
                <p>Columbus was able, therefore, to offer mercantile adventurers the promise of
                    great profit in case of success; and at this time kings were willing to take
                    their share of such profits as might accrue. </p>
                <p>The letter of Toscanelli, the Italian geographer, which has been spoken of, was
                    addressed to <pb n="29"/> Alphonso V, the King of Portugal. To him and his
                    successor, John the Second, Columbus explained the probability of success, and
                    each of them, as it would seem, had confidence in it. But King John made the
                    great mistake of intrusting Columbus's plan to another person for experiment. He
                    was selfish enough, and mean enough, to fit out a ship privately and intrust its
                    command to another seaman, bidding him sail west in search of the Indies, while
                    he pretended that he was on a voyage to the Cape de Verde Islands. He was, in
                    fact, to follow the route indicated by Columbus. The vessel sailed. But,
                    fortunately for the fame of Columbus, she met a terrible storm, and her
                    officers, in terror, turned from the unknown ocean and returned to Lisbon.
                    Columbus himself tells this story. It was in disgust with the bad faith the king
                    showed in this transaction that he left Lisbon to offer his great project to the
                    King and Queen of Spain. </p>
                <p>In a similar way, a generation afterward, Magellan, who was in the service of the
                    King of Portugal, was disgusted by insults which he received at his court, and
                    exiled himself to Spain. <pb n="30"/> He offered to the Spanish king his plan
                    for sailing round the world and it was accepted. He sailed in a Spanish fleet,
                    and to his discoveries Spain owes the possession of the Philippine Islands.
                    Twice, therefore, did kings of Portugal lose for themselves, their children and
                    their kingdom, the fame and the recompense which belong to such great
                    discoveries. </p>
                <p>The wife of Columbus had died and he was without a home. He left Lisbon with his
                    only son, Diego, in or near the end of the year 1484.</p>

                <head> CHAPTER II.<lb/>
                    <lb/> HIS PLANS FOR DISCOVERY.<lb/>
                    <lb/> COLUMBUS LEAVES LISBON, AND VISITS GENOA &mdash; VISITS GREAT SPANISH
                    DUKES &mdash; FOR SIX YEARS IS AT THE COURT OF FERDINAND AND ISABELLA
                    &mdash; THE COUNCIL OF SALAMANCA &mdash; HIS PETITION IS AT LAST GRANTED
                    &mdash; SQUADRON MADE READY. </head>


                <p>It has been supposed that when Columbus left Lisbon he was oppressed by debts. At
                    a subsequent period, when King John wanted to recall him, he offered to protect
                    him against any creditors. But on the other hand, it is thought that at this
                    time he visited Genoa, and made some provision for the comfort of his father,
                    who was now an old man. Christopher Columbus, himself, according to the usual
                    opinion regarding his birth, was now almost fifty years old. </p>
                <p>It is probable that at this time he urged on his countrymen, the Genoese, the
                    importance of his great plan; and tried to interest them to make the great
                    endeavor, for the purpose of reaching <pb n="32"/> the Indies by a western
                    route. As it proved, the discovery of the route by the Cape of Good Hope was,
                    commercially, a great injury to Genoa and the other maritime cities of Italy.
                    Before this time, the eastern trade of Europe came by the ports of the eastern
                    Mediterranean, and the Italian cities. Columbus's offer to Genoa was therefore
                    one which, if her statesmen could have foreseen the future, they would have
                    considered eagerly. </p>
                <p>But Genoa was greatly depressed at this period. In her wars with the Turks she
                    had been, on the whole, not successful. She had lost Caffa, her station in the
                    Crimea, and her possessions in the Archipelago were threatened. The government
                    did not accept Columbus's proposals, and he was obliged to return with them to
                    Spain. He went first to distinguished noblemen, in the South of Spain, who were
                    of liberal and adventurous disposition. One was the Duke of Medina Celi, and one
                    the Duke of Medina Sidonia. Each of these grandees entertained him at their
                    courts, and heard his proposals. </p>
                <p>The Duke of Medina Celi was so much interested in them, that at one time he
                    proposed to 
                    give Columbus the direction of four vessels which he had in the harbor of Cadiz.
                    But, of a sudden, he changed his mind. The enterprise was so vast, he said, that
                    it should be under the direction of the crown. And, without losing confidence in
                    it, he gave to Columbus an introduction to the king and queen, in which he
                    cordially recommended him to their patronage.</p>
                <p>This king and queen were King Ferdinand of Aragon, and Queen Isabella of Castile.
                    The marriage of these two had united Spain. Their affection for each other made
                    the union real, and the energy, courage and wisdom of both made their reign
                    successful and glorious. Of all its glories the greatest, as it has proved, was
                    connected with the life and discoveries of the sailor who was now to approach
                    them. He had been <pb n="34"/> disloyally treated by Portugal, he had been
                    dismissed by Genoa. He had not succeeded with the great dukes. Now he was to
                    press his adventure upon a king and queen who were engaged in a difficult war
                    with the Moors, who still held a considerable part of the peninsula of Spain. </p>
                <p>The king and queen were residing at Cordova, a rich and beautiful city, which
                    they had taken from the Moors. Under their rule Cordova had been the most
                    important seat of learning in Europe. Here Columbus tarried at the house of
                    Alonso de Quintinilla, who became an ardent convert to his theory, and
                    introduced him to important friends. By their agency, arrangements were made, in
                    which Columbus should present his views to the king. The time was not such as he
                    could have wished. All Cordova was alive with the preparation for a great
                    campaign against the enemy. But King Ferdinand made arrangements to hear
                    Columbus; it does not appear that, at the first hearing, Isabella was present at
                    the interview. But Ferdinand, although in the midst of his military cares, was
                    interested <pb n="35"/> in the proposals made by Columbus. He liked the man. He
                    was pleased by the modesty and dignity with which he brought forward his
                    proposals. Columbus spoke, as he tells us, as one specially appointed by God
                    Himself to carry out this discovery. The king did not, however, at once adopt
                    the scheme, but gave out that a council of men of learning should be called
                    together to consider it. </p>
                <p>Columbus himself says that he entered the service of the sovereigns January 26,
                    1486. The council to which he was referred was held in the university city of
                    Salamanca, in that year. It gave to him a full opportunity to explain his
                    theory. It consisted of a fair representation of the learning of the time. But
                    most of the men who met had formed their opinions on the subjects involved, and
                    were too old to change them. A part of them were priests of the church, in the
                    habit of looking to sacred Scripture as their only authority, when the pope had
                    given no instruction in detail. Of these some took literally expressions in the
                    Old Testament, which they supposed to be fatal to the plans of Columbus. Such
                    was the <pb n="36"/> phrase in the 104th Psalm, that God stretches out the
                    heavens like a curtain. The expression in the book of Hebrews, that the heavens
                    are extended as a tent, was also quoted, in the same view. </p>
                <p>Quotations from the early Fathers of the church were more fatal to the new plan
                    than those from the Scripture. </p>
                <p>On the other hand there were men who cordially supported Columbus's wishes, and
                    there were more when the congress parted than when it met. Its sessions occupied
                    a considerable part of the summer, but it was not for years that it rendered any
                    decision. </p>
                <p>The king, queen and court, meanwhile, were occupied in war with the Moors.
                    Columbus was once and again summoned to attend the court, and more than once
                    money was advanced to him to enable him to do so. Once he began new negotiations
                    with King John, and from him he received a letter inviting him to return to
                    Portugal. He received a similar letter from King Henry VII of England inviting
                    him to his court. Nothing was determined on in Spain. To this day, the <pb
                        n="37"/> people of that country are thought to have a habit of postponement
                    to tomorrow of that which perplexes them. In 1489, according to Ortiz de Zuniga,
                    Columbus fought in battle in the king's army. </p>
                <p>When, however, in the winter of 1490, it was announced that the army was to take
                    the field again, never to leave its camp till Grenada had fallen, Columbus felt
                    that he must make one last endeavor. He insisted that he must have an answer
                    regarding his plans of discovery. The confessor of the queen, Fernando da
                    Talavera, was commanded to obtain the definite answer of the men of learning.
                    Alas! it was fatal to Columbus's hopes. They said that it was not right that
                    great princes should undertake such enterprises on grounds as weak as those
                    which he relied upon. </p>
                <p>The sovereigns themselves, however, were more favorable; so was a minority of the
                    council of Salamanca. And the confessor was instructed to tell him that their
                    expenses in the war forbade them from sending him out as a discoverer, but that,
                    when that was well over, they had hopes <pb n="38"/> that they might commission
                    him. This was the end of five years of solicitation, in which he had put his
                    trust in princes. Columbus regarded the answer, as well he might, as only a
                    courtly measure of refusal. And he retired in disgust from the court at Seville. </p>
                <p>He determined to lay his plans before the King of France. He was traveling with
                    this purpose, with his son, Diego, now a boy of ten or twelve years of age, when
                    he arrived at night at the hospitable convent of Saint Mary of Rabida, which has
                    been made celebrated by that incident. It is about three miles south of what was
                    then the seaport of Palos, one of the active ports of commercial Spain. The
                    convent stands on level ground high above the sea; but a steep road runs down to
                    the shore of the ocean. Some of its windows and corridors look out upon the
                    ocean on the west and south, and the inmates still show the room in which
                    Columbus used to write, and the inkstand which served his purposes while he
                    lived there. It is maintained as a monument of history by the Spanish
                    government. </p>
                <p>At the door of this convent he asked for bread <pb n="39"/> and water for his
                    boy. The prior of the convent was named Juan Perez de Marchena. He was attracted
                    by the appearance of Columbus, still more by his conversation, and invited him
                    to remain as their guest. </p>
                <p>When he learned that his new friend was about to offer to France the advantages
                    of a discovery so great as that proposed, he begged him to make one effort more
                    at home. He sent for some friends, Fernandos, a physician at Palos, and for the
                    brothers Pinzon, who now appear for the first time in a story where their part
                    is distinguished. Together they all persuaded Columbus to send one messenger
                    more to wait upon their sovereigns. The man sent was Rodriguez, a pilot of Lepe,
                    who found access to the queen because Juan Perez, the prior, had formerly been
                    her confessor. She had confidence in him, as she had, indeed, in Columbus. And
                    in fourteen days the friendly pilot came back from Santa Fe with a kind letter
                    from the queen to her friend, bidding him return at once to court. Perez de
                    Marchena saddled his mule at once and before midnight was on his way to see his
                    royal mistress. <pb n="40"/>
                </p>
                <p>Santa Fe was half camp, half city. It had been built in what is called the Vega,
                    the great fruitful plain which extends for many miles to the westward of
                    Grenada. The court and army were here as they pressed their attack on that city.
                    Perez de Marchena had ready access to Queen Isabella, and pressed his suit well.
                    He was supported by one of her favorites, the Marquesa de Moya. In reply to
                    their solicitations, she asked that Columbus should return to her, and ordered
                    that twenty thousand maravedis should be sent to him for his traveling expenses. </p>
                <p>This sum was immediately sent by Perez to his friend. Columbus bought a mule,
                    exchanged his worn clothes for better ones, and started, as he was bidden, for
                    the camp. </p>
                <p>He arrived there just after the great victory, by which the king and queen had
                    obtained their wish &mdash; had taken the noble city of Grenada and ended
                    Moorish rule in Spain. King, queen, court and army were preparing to enter the
                    Alhambra in triumph. Whoever tries to imagine the scene, in which the great
                    procession entered through the gates, so long sealed, or of the moment when <pb
                        n="41"/> the royal banner of Spain was first flying out upon the Tower of
                    the Vela, must remember that Columbus, elate, at last, with hopes for his own
                    great discovery, saw the triumph and joined in the display. </p>
                <p>But his success was not immediate, even now. Fernando de Talavera, who had had
                    the direction of the wise council of Salamanca, was now Archbishop of Grenada,
                    whose see had been conferred on him after the victory. He was not the friend of
                    Columbus. And when, at what seemed the final interview with king and queen, he
                    heard Columbus claim the right to one-tenth of all the profits of the
                    enterprise, he protested against such lavish recompense of an adventurer. He was
                    now the confessor of Isabella, as Juan Perez, the friendly prior, had been
                    before. Columbus, however, was proud and firm. He would not yield to the terms
                    prepared by the archbishop. He preferred to break off the negotiation, and again
                    retired from court. He determined, as he had before, to lay his plans before the
                    King of France. </p>
                <p>Spain would have lost the honor and the reward of the great discovery, as
                    Portugal and Genoa had <pb n="42"/> lost them, but for Luis de St. Angel, and
                    the queen herself. St. Angel had been the friend of Columbus. He was an
                    important officer, the treasurer of the church revenues of Aragon. He now
                    insisted upon an audience from the queen. It would seem that Ferdinand, though
                    King of Aragon, was not present. St. Angel spoke eloquently. The friendly
                    Marchioness of Moya spoke eagerly and persuasively. Isabella was at last fired
                    with zeal. Columbus should go, and the enterprise should be hers. </p>
                <p>It is here that the incident belongs, represented in the statue by Mr. Mead, and
                    that of Miss Hosmer. The sum required for the discovery of a world was only
                    three thousand crowns. Two vessels were all that Columbus asked for, with the
                    pay of their crews. But where were three thousand crowns? The treasury was
                    empty, and the king was now averse to any action. It was at this moment that
                    Isabella said, "The enterprise is mine, for the Crown of Castile. I pledge my
                    jewels for the funds." </p>
                <p>The funds were in fact advanced by St. Angel, from the ecclesiastical revenues
                    under his control. <pb n="43"/> They were repaid from the gold brought in the
                    first voyage. But, always afterward, Isabella regarded the Indies as a Castilian
                    possession. The most important officers in its administration, indeed most of
                    the emigrants, were always from Castile. </p>
                <p>Columbus, meanwhile, was on his way back to Palos, on his mule, alone. But at a
                    bridge, still pointed out, a royal courier overtook him, bidding him return. The
                    spot has been made the scene of more than one picture, which represents the
                    crisis, in which the despair of one moment changed to the glad hope which was to
                    lead to certainty. </p>
                <p>He returned to Isabella for the last time, before that great return in which he
                    came as a conqueror, to display to her the riches of the New World. The king
                    yielded a slow and doubtful assent. Isabella took the enterprise in her own
                    hands. She and Columbus agreed at once, and articles were drawn up which gave
                    him the place of admiral for life on all lands he might discover; gave him
                    one-tenth of all pearls, precious stones, gold, silver, spices and other
                    merchandise to be obtained in his admiralty, and gave him the right <pb n="44"/>
                    to nominate three candidates from whom the governor of each province should be
                    selected by the crown. He was to be the judge of all disputes arising from such
                    traffic as was proposed; and he was to have one-eighth part of the profit, and
                    bear one-eighth part of the cost of it. </p>
                <p>With this glad news he returned at once to Palos. The Pinzons, who had been such
                    loyal friends, were to take part in the enterprise. He carried with him a royal
                    order, commanding the people of Palos to fit out two caravels within ten days,
                    and to place them and their crews at the disposal of Columbus. The third vessel
                    proposed was to be fitted out by him and his friends. The crews were to be paid
                    four months' wages in advance, and Columbus was to have full command, to do what
                    he chose, if he did not interfere with the Portuguese discoveries. </p>
                <p>On the 23rd of May, Columbus went to the church of San Giorgio in Palos, with his
                    friend, the prior of St. Mary's convent, and other important people, and the
                    royal order was read with great solemnity: </p>
                <p>But it excited at first only indignation or 
                    <pb n="46"/> dismay. The expedition was most unpopular. Sailors refused to
                    enlist, and the authorities, who had already offended the crown, so that they
                    had to furnish these vessels, as it were, as a fine, refused to do what they
                    were bidden. Other orders from Court were necessary. But it seems to have been
                    the courage and determination of the Pinzons which carried the preparations
                    through. After weeks had been lost, Martin Alonso Pinzon and his brothers said
                    they would go in person on the expedition. They were well-known merchants and
                    seamen, and were much respected. Sailors were impressed, by the royal authority,
                    and the needful stores were taken in the same way. It seems now strange that so
                    much difficulty should have surrounded an expedition in itself so small. But the
                    plan met then all the superstition, terror and other prejudice of the time. </p>
                <p>All that Columbus asked or needed was three small vessels and their stores and
                    crews. The largest ships engaged were little larger than the large yachts, whose
                    races every summer delight the people of America. The Gallega and the 
                    Pinta were the two largest. They were called caravels, a name then given to the
                    smallest three-masted vessels. Columbus once uses it for a vessel of forty tons;
                    but it generally applied in Portuguese or Spanish use to a vessel, ranging one
                    hundred and twenty to one hundred and forty Spanish "toneles." This word
                    represents a capacity about one-tenth larger than that expressed by our English
                    "ton."</p>

                <p>The reader should remember that most of the commerce of the time was the coasting
                    commerce of the Mediterranean, and that it was not well that the ships should
                    draw much water. The fleet of Columbus, as it sailed, consisted of the Gallega
                    (the Galician), of which he changed the name to the Santa Maria, and of the
                    Pinta and the Nina. Of <pb n="48"/> these the first two were of a tonnage which
                    we should rate as about one hundred and thirty tons. The Nina was much smaller,
                    not more than fifty tons. One writer says that they were all without full decks,
                    that is, that such decks as they had did not extend from stem to stern. But the
                    other authorities speak as if the Nina only was an open vessel, and the two
                    larger were decked. Columbus himself took command of the Santa Maria, Martin
                    Alonso Pinzon of the Pinta, and his brothers, Francis Martin and Vicente Yanez,
                    of the Nina. The whole company in all three ships numbered one hundred and
                    twenty men. </p>
                <p>Mr. Harrisse shows that the expense to the crown amounted to 1,140,000 maravedis.
                    This, as he counts it, is about sixty-four thousand dollars of our money. To
                    this Columbus was to add one-eighth of the cost. His friends, the Pinzons, seem
                    to have advanced this, and to have been afterwards repaid. Las Casas and Herrera
                    both say that the sum thus added was much more than one-eighth of the cost and
                    amounted to half a million maravedis.</p>

                <p>At last all was ready. That is to say, the fleet was so far ready that Columbus
                    was ready to start. The vessels were small, as we think of vessels, but he was
                    not dissatisfied. He says in the beginning of his journal, "I armed three
                    vessels very fit for such an enterprise." He had left Grenada as late as the
                    twelfth of May. He had crossed Spain to Palos,<ref n="2" target="HalLife.2"
                    >[*]</ref> and in less than three months had fitted out the ships and was ready
                    for sea. </p>
                <p>The harbor of Palos is now ruined. Mud and gravel, brought down by the River
                    Tinto, have <pb n="50"/> filled up the bay, so that even small boats cannot
                    approach the shore. The traveler finds, however, the island of Saltes, quite
                    outside the bay, much as Columbus left it. It is a small spit of sand, covered
                    with shells and with a few seashore herbs. His own account of the great voyage
                    begins with the words: </p>
                <p>"Friday, August 3, 1492. Set sail from the bar of Saltes at 8 o'clock, and
                    proceeded with a strong breeze till sunset sixty miles, or fifteen leagues
                    south, afterward southwest and south by west, which is in the direction of the
                    Canaries." </p>
                <p>It appears, therefore, that the great voyage, the most important and successful
                    ever made, began on Friday, the day which is said to be so much disliked by
                    sailors. Columbus never alludes to this superstition. </p>
                <p>He had always meant to sail first for the Canaries, which were the most western
                    land then known in the latitude of his voyage. From Lisbon to the famous city of
                    "Quisay," or "Quinsay," in Asia, Toscanelli, his learned correspondent, supposed
                    the distance to be less than one thousand leagues westward. From the Canary
                    islands, <pb n="51"/> on that supposition, the distance would be ten degrees
                    less. The distance to Cipango, or Japan, would be much less. </p>
                <p>As it proved, the squadron had to make some stay at the Canaries. The rudder of
                    the Pinta was disabled, and she proved leaky. It was suspected that the owners,
                    from whom she had been forcibly taken, had intentionally disabled her, or that
                    possibly the crew had injured her. But Columbus says in his journal that Martin
                    Alonso Pinzon, captain of the Pinta, was a man of capacity and courage, and that
                    this quieted his apprehensions. From the ninth of August to the second of
                    September, nearly four weeks were spent by the Pinta and her crew at the Grand
                    Canary island, and she was repaired. She proved afterwards a serviceable vessel,
                    the fastest of the fleet. At the Canaries they heard stories of lands seen to
                    the westward, to which Columbus refers in his journal. On the sixth of September
                    they sailed from Gomera and on the eighth they lost sight of land. Nor did they
                    see land again for thirty-three days. Such was the length of the great voyage.
                    All the time, most naturally, they were <pb n="52"/> wishing for signs, not of
                    land perhaps, but which might show whether this great ocean were really
                    different from other seas. On the whole the voyage was not a dangerous one. </p>
                <p>According to the Admiral's reckoning &mdash; and in his own journal Columbus
                    always calls himself the Admiral &mdash; its length was one thousand and
                    eighty-nine leagues. This was not far from right, the real distance being, in a
                    direct line, three thousand one hundred and forty nautical miles, or three
                    thousand six hundred and twenty statute miles.<ref n="3" target="HalLife.3"
                    >[*]</ref> It would not be considered a very long voyage for small vessels now.
                    In general the course was west. Sometimes, for special reasons, they sailed
                    south of west. If they had sailed precisely west they would have struck the
                    shore of the United States a little north of the spot where St. Augustine now
                    is, about the northern line of Florida. </p>
                <p>Had the coast of Asia been, indeed, as near as Toscanelli and Columbus supposed,
                    this latitude of the Canary islands would have been quite near <pb n="53"/> the
                    mouth of the Yang-tse-Kiang river, in China, which was what Columbus was
                    seeking. For nearly a generation afterwards he and his followers supposed that
                    the coast of that region was what they had found. </p>
                <p>It was on Saturday, the eighth of September, that they lost sight of Teneriffe.
                    On the eleventh they saw a large piece of the mast of a ship afloat. On the
                    fourteenth they saw a "tropic-bird," which the sailors thought was never seen
                    more than twenty-five leagues from land; but it must be remembered, that,
                    outside of the Mediterranean, few of the sailors had ever been farther
                    themselves. On the sixteenth they began to meet "large patches of weeds, very
                    green, which appeared to have been recently washed away from land." This was
                    their first knowledge of the "Sargasso sea," a curious tract in mid-Atlantic
                    which is always green with floating seaweeds. "The continent we shall find
                    farther on," wrote the confident Admiral. </p>
                <p>An observation of the sun on the seventeenth proved what had been suspected
                    before, that the needles of the compasses were not pointing <pb n="54"/>
                    precisely to the north. The variation of the needle, since that time, has been a
                    recognized fact. But this observation at so critical a time first disclosed it.
                    The crew were naturally alarmed. Here was evidence that, in the great ocean,
                    common laws were not to be relied upon. But they had great respect for
                    Columbus's knowledge of such subjects. He told them that it was not the north
                    which had changed, nor the needle, which was true to the north, but the polar
                    star revolved, like other stars, and for the time they were satisfied. </p>
                <p>The same day they saw weeds which he was sure were land weeds. From them he took
                    a living crab, whose unintentional voyage eastward was a great encouragement to
                    the bolder adventurer westward. Columbus kept the crab, saying that such were
                    never found eighty leagues from land. In fact this poor crab was at least nine
                    hundred and seventy leagues from the Bahamas, as this same journal proves. On
                    the eighteenth the Pinta ran ahead of the other vessels, Martin Alonso was so
                    sure that he should reach land that night. But it was not to come so soon. </p>
                <p>Columbus every day announced to his crew a <pb n="55"/> less distance as the
                    result of the day than they had really sailed. For he was afraid of their
                    distrust, and did not dare let them know how far they were from home. The
                    private journal, therefore, has such entries as this, "Sailed more than
                    fifty-five leagues, wrote down only forty-eight." That is, he wrote on the daily
                    log, which was open to inspection, a distance some leagues less than they had
                    really made. </p>
                <p>On the twentieth pelicans are spoken of, on the twenty-first "such abundance of
                    weeds that the ocean seemed covered with them," "the sea smooth as a river, and
                    the finest air in the world. Saw a whale, an indication of land, as they always
                    keep near the coast." To later times, this note, also, shows how ignorant
                    Columbus then was of mid-ocean. </p>
                <p>On the twenty-second, to the Admiral's relief, there was a head wind; for the
                    crew began to think that with perpetual east winds they would never return to
                    Spain. They had been in what are known as the trade winds. On the twenty-third
                    the smoother water gave place to a rough sea, and he writes that this "was
                    favorable to me, as it <pb n="56"/> happened formerly to Moses when he led the
                    Jews from Egypt." </p>
                <p>The next day, thanks to the headwinds, their progress was less. On the
                    twenty-fifth, Pinzon, of the Pinta, felt sure that they were near the outer
                    islands of Asia as they appeared on the Toscanelli map, and at sunset called out
                    with joy that he saw land, claiming a reward for such news. The crews of both
                    vessels sang "Glory to God in the highest," and the crew of the little Nina were
                    sure that the bank was land. On this occasion they changed from a western course
                    to the southwest. But alas! the land was a fog-bank and the reward never came to
                    Martin Pinzon. On the twenty-sixth, again "the sea was like a river." This was
                    Wednesday. In three days they sailed sixty-nine leagues. Saturday was calm. They
                    saw a bird called "Rabihorcado," which never alights at sea, nor goes twenty
                    leagues from land," wrote the confident Columbus; "Nothing is wanting but the
                    singing of the nightingale," he says. </p>
                <p>Sunday, the thirtieth, brought "tropic-birds" again, "a very clear sign of land."
                    Monday the journal shows them seven hundred and seven <pb n="57"/> leagues from
                    Ferro. Tuesday a white gull was the only visitor. Wednesday they had pardelas
                    and great quantities of seaweed. Columbus began to be sure that they had passed
                    "the islands" and were nearing the continent of Asia. Thursday they had a flock
                    of pardelas, two pelicans, a rabihorcado and a gull. Friday, the fifth of
                    October, brought pardelas and flying-fishes. </p>
                <p>We have copied these simple intimations from the journal to show how constantly
                    Columbus supposed that he was near the coast of Asia. On the sixth of October
                    Pinzon asked that the course might be changed to the southwest. But Columbus
                    held on. On the seventh the Nina was ahead, and fired a gun and hoisted her flag
                    in token that she saw land. But again they were disappointed. Columbus gave
                    directions to keep close order at sunrise and sunset. The next day he did change
                    the course to west southwest, following flights of birds from the north which
                    went in that direction. On the eighth "the sea was like the river at Seville,"
                    the weeds were very few and they took land birds on board the ships. On the
                    ninth they sailed southwest five leagues, and <pb n="58"/> then with a change of
                    wind went west by north. All night they heard the birds of passage passing. </p>
                <p>On the tenth of October the men made remonstrance, which has been exaggerated in
                    history into a revolt. It is said, in books of authority, that Columbus begged
                    them to sail west only three days more. But in the private journal of the tenth
                    he says simply: "The seamen complained of the length of the voyage. They did not
                    wish to go any farther. The Admiral did his best to renew their courage, and
                    reminded them of the profits which would come to them. He added, boldly, that no
                    complaints would change his purpose, that he had set out to go to the Indies,
                    and that with the Lord's assistance he should keep on until he came there." This
                    is the only passage in the journal which has any resemblance to the account of
                    the mutiny. </p>
                <p>If it happened, as Oviedo says, three days before the discovery, it would have
                    been on the eighth of October. On that day the entry is, "Steered west
                    southwest, and sailed day and night eleven or twelve leagues &mdash; at
                    times, during the night, fifteen miles an hour &mdash; if the log can be <pb
                        n="59"/> relied upon. Found the sea like the river at Seville, thanks to
                    God. The air was as soft as that of Seville in April, and so fragrant that it
                    was delicious to breathe it. The weeds appeared very fresh. Many land birds, one
                    of which they took, flying towards the southwest, also grajaos, ducks and a
                    pelican were seen." </p>
                <p>This is not the account of a mutiny. And the discovery of Columbus's own journal
                    makes that certain, which was probable before, that the romantic account of the
                    despair of the crews was embroidered on the narrative after the event, and by
                    people who wanted to improve the story. It was, perhaps, borrowed from a story
                    of Diaz's voyage. We have followed the daily record to show how constantly they
                    supposed, on the other hand, that they were always nearing land. </p>
                <p>With the eleventh of October, came certainty. The eleventh is sometimes spoken of
                    as the day of discovery, and sometimes the twelfth, when they landed on the
                    first island of the new world. </p>
                <p>The whole original record of the discovery is this: "Oct. 11, course to west and
                    southwest. Heavier sea than they had known, pardelas and <pb n="60"/> a green
                    branch near the caravel of the Admiral. From the Pinta they see a branch of a
                    tree, a stake and a smaller stake, which they draw in, and which appears to have
                    been cut with iron, and a piece of cane. Besides these, there is a land shrub
                    and a little bit of board. The crew of the Nina saw other signs of land and a
                    branch covered with thorns and flowers. With these tokens every-one breathes
                    again and is delighted. They sail twenty-seven leagues on this course. </p>
                <p>"The Admiral orders that they shall resume a westerly course at sunset. They make
                    twelve miles each hour; up till two hours after midnight they made ninety miles. </p>
                <p>"The Pinta, the best sailer of the three, was ahead. She makes signals, already
                    agreed upon, that she has discovered land. A sailor named Rodrigo de Triana was
                    the first to see this land. For the Admiral being on the castle of the poop of
                    the ship at ten at night really saw a light, but it was so shut in by darkness
                    that he did not like to say that it was a sign of land. Still he called up Pedro
                    Gutierrez, the king's chamberlain, and said to him that there seemed <pb n="61"
                    /> to be a light, and asked him to look. He did so and saw it. He said the same
                    to Rodrigo Sanchez of Segovia, who had been sent by the king and queen as
                    inspector in the fleet, but he saw nothing, being indeed in a place where he
                    could see nothing. </p>
                <p>"After the Admiral spoke of it, the light was seen once or twice. It was like a
                    wax candle, raised and lowered, which would appear to few to be a sign of land.
                    But the Admiral was certain that it was a sign of land. Therefore when they said
                    the "Salve," which all the sailors are used to say and sing in their fashion,
                    the Admiral ordered them to look out well from the forecastle, and he would give
                    at once a silk jacket to the man who first saw land, besides the other rewards
                    which the sovereigns had ordered, which were 10,000 maravedis, to be paid as an
                    annuity forever to the man who saw it first. </p>
                <p>"At two hours after midnight land appeared, from which they were about two
                    leagues off." </p>
                <p>This is the one account of the discovery written at the time. It is worth copying
                    and reading at full in its little details, for it contrasts curiously <pb n="62"
                    /> with the embellished accounts which appear in the next generation. Thus the
                    historian Oviedo says, in a dramatic way: </p>
                <p>"One of the ship boys on the largest ship, a native of Lepe, cried `Fire!'
                    `Land!' Immediately a servant of Columbus replied, `The Admiral had said that
                    already.' Soon after, Columbus said, `I said so some time ago, and that I saw
                    that fire on the land.' " And so indeed it happened that Thursday, at two hours
                    after midnight, the Admiral called a gentleman named Escobedos, officer of the
                    wardrobe of the king, and told him that he saw fire. And at the break of day, at
                    the time Columbus had predicted the day before, they saw from the largest ship
                    the island which the Indians call Guanahani to the north of them. </p>
                <p>"And the first man to see the land, when day came, was Rodrigo of Triana, on the
                    eleventh day of October, 1492{.}" Nothing is more certain than that this was
                    really on the twelfth. </p>
                <p>The reward for first seeing land was eventually awarded to Columbus, and it was
                    regularly paid him through his life. It was the annual 
                    payment of 10,000 maravedis. A maravedi was then a little less than six cents of
                    our currency. The annuity was, therefore, about six hundred dollars a year. </p>
                <p>The worth of a maravedi varied, from time to time, so that the calculations of
                    the value of any number of maravedis are very confusing. Before the coin went
                    out of use it was worth only half a cent.</p>

                <head> CHAPTER IV.<lb/>
                    <lb/> THE LANDING ON THE TWELFTH OF OCTOBER &mdash; THE NATIVES AND THEIR
                    NEIGHBORS &mdash; SEARCH FOR GOLD &mdash; CUBA DISCOVERED &mdash;
                    COLUMBUS COASTS ALONG ITS SHORES. </head>

                <p>It was on Friday, the twelfth of October, that they saw this island, which was an
                    island of the Lucayos group, called, says Las Casas, "in the tongue of the
                    Indians, Guanahani." Soon they saw people naked, and the Admiral went ashore in
                    the armed boat, with Martin Alonzo Pinzon and, Vicente Yanez, his brother, who
                    was captain of the Nina. The Admiral unfurled the Royal Standard, and the
                    captain's two standards of the Greek Cross, which the Admiral raised on all the
                    ships as a sign, with an <hi rend="italic">F</hi>. and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Y</hi>.; over each letter a crown; one on one side of the &cross; and the
                    other on the other. When they were ashore they saw very green trees and much
                    water, and fruits of different kinds. </p>
                <p>"The Admiral called the two captains and the others who went ashore, and Rodrigo
                    Descovedo, <pb n="65"/> Notary of the whole fleet, and Rodrigo Sanchez of
                    Segovia, and he said that they must give him their faith and witness how he took
                    possession before all others, as in fact he did take possession of the said
                    island for the king and the queen, his lord and lady. . . . Soon many people of
                    the island assembled. These which follow are the very words of the Admiral, in
                    his book of his first navigation and discovery of these Indies." </p>
                <p>October 11-12. "So that they may feel great friendship for us, and because I knew
                    that they were a people who would be better delivered and converted to our Holy
                    Faith by love than by force, I gave to some of them red caps and glass bells
                    which they put round their necks, and many other things of little value, in
                    which they took much pleasure, and they remained so friendly to us that it was
                    wonderful. </p>
                <p>"Afterwards they came swimming to the ship's boats where we were. And they
                    brought us parrots and cotton-thread in skeins, and javelins and many other
                    things. And they bartered them with us for other things, which we gave them,
                    such as little glass beads and little bells. In <pb n="66"/> short, they took
                    everything, and gave of what they had with good will. But it seemed to me that
                    they were a people very destitute of everything. </p>
                <p>"They all went as naked as their mothers bore them, and the women as well,
                    although I only saw one who was really young. And all the men I saw were young,
                    for I saw none more than thirty years of age; very well made, with very handsome
                    persons, and very good faces; their hair thick like the hairs of horses' tails,
                    and cut short. They bring their hair above their eyebrows, except a little
                    behind, which they wear long, and never cut. Some of them paint themselves
                    blackish (and they are of the color of the inhabitants of the Canaries, neither
                    black nor white), and some paint themselves white, and some red, and some with
                    whatever they can get. And some of them paint their faces, and some all their
                    bodies, and some only the eyes, and some only the nose. </p>
                <p>"They do not bear arms nor do they know them, for I showed them swords and they
                    took them by the edge, and they cut themselves through ignorance. They have no
                    iron at all; <pb n="67"/> their javelins are rods without iron, and some of them
                    have a fish's tooth at the end, and some of them other things. They are all of
                    good stature, and good graceful appearance, well made. I saw some who had scars
                    of wounds in their bodies, and I made signs to them [to ask] what that was, and
                    they showed me how people came there from other islands which lay around, and
                    tried to take them captive and they defended themselves. And I believed, and I
                    [still] believe, that they came there from the mainland to take them for
                    captives. </p>
                <p>"They would be good servants, and of good disposition, for I see that they repeat
                    very quickly everything which is said to them. And I believe that they could
                    easily be made Christians, for it seems to me that they have no belief. I, if it
                    please our Lord, will take six of them to your Highnesses at the time of my
                    departure, so that they may learn to talk. No wild creature of any sort have I
                    seen, except parrots, in this island." </p>
                <p>All these are the words of the Admiral, says Las Casas. The journal of the next
                    day is in these words: <pb n="68"/>
                </p>
                <p>Saturday, October 13. "As soon as the day broke, many of these men came to the
                    beach, all young, as I have said, and all of good stature, a very handsome race.
                    Their hair is not woolly, but straight and coarse, like horse hair, and all with
                    much wider foreheads and heads than any other people I have seen up to this
                    time. And their eyes are very fine and not small, and they are not black at all,
                    but of the color of the Canary Islanders. And nothing else could be expected,
                    since it is on one line of latitude with the Island of Ferro, in the Canaries. </p>
                <p>"They came to the ship with almadias,<ref n="4" target="HalLife.4">[*]</ref>
                    which are made of the trunk of a tree, like a long boat, and all of one piece
                    &mdash; and made in a very wonderful manner in the fashion of the country
                    &mdash; and large enough for some of them to hold forty or forty-five men.
                    And others are smaller, down to such as hold one man alone. They row with a
                    shovel like a baker's, and it goes wonderfully well. And if it overturns,
                    immediately they all go to swimming and they right it, and bale it with
                    calabashes which they carry. <pb n="69"/>
                </p>
                <p>"They brought skeins of spun cotton, and parrots, and javelins, and other little
                    things which it would be wearisome to write down, and they gave everything for
                    whatever was given to them. </p>
                <p>"And I strove attentively to learn whether there were gold. And I saw that some
                    of them had a little piece of gold hung in a hole which they have in their
                    noses. And by signs I was able to understand that going to the south, or going
                    round the island to the southward, there was a king there who had great vessels
                    of it, and had very much of it. I tried to persuade them to go there; and
                    afterward I saw that they did not understand about going.<ref n="5"

                </p>
                <p>"I determined to wait till the next afternoon, and then to start for the
                    southwest, for many of them told me that there was land to the south and
                    southwest and northwest, and that those from the northwest came often to fight
                    with them, and so to go on to the southwest to seek gold and precious stones. </p>
                <p>"This island is very large and very flat and with very green trees, and many
                    waters, and a very large lake in the midst, without any mountain. And all of it
                    is green, so that it is a pleasure to see it. And these people are so gentle,
                    and desirous to have our articles and thinking that nothing can be given them
                    unless they give something and do not keep it back. They take what they can, and
                    at once jump [into the water] and swim [away]. But all that they have they give
                    for whatever is given them. For they barter even for pieces of porringus, and of
                    broken glass cups, so that I saw sixteen skeins of cotton given for three
                    Portuguese <hi rend="italic">centis</hi>, that is a <hi rend="italic"
                    >blanca</hi> of Castile, and there was more than twenty-five pounds of spun
                    cotton in them. This I shall forbid, and not let anyone take [it]; but I shall
                        <pb n="71"/> have it all taken for your Highnesses, if there is any quantity
                    of it. </p>
                <p>"It grows here in this island, but for a short time I could not believe it at
                    all. And there is found here also the gold which they wear hanging to their
                    noses; but so as not to lose time I mean to go to see whether I can reach the
                    island of Cipango. </p>
                <p>"Now as it was night they all went ashore with their <hi rend="italic"
                    >almadias</hi>." </p>
                <p>Sunday, October 14. "At daybreak I had the ship's boat and the boats of the
                    caravels made ready, and I sailed along the island, toward the north-northeast,
                    to see the other port, * * * * what there was [there], and also to see the
                    towns, and I soon saw two or three, and the people, who all were coming to the
                    shore, calling us and giving thanks to God. Some brought us water, others things
                    to eat. Others, when they saw that I did not care to go ashore, threw themselves
                    into the sea and came swimming, and we understood that they asked us if we had
                    come from heaven. And an old man came into the boat, and others called all [the
                    rest] men and women, with a loud <pb n="72"/> voice: `Come and see the men who
                    have come from heaven; bring them food and drink.' </p>
                <p>"There came many of them and many women, each one with something, giving thanks
                    to God, casting themselves on the ground, and raising their heads toward heaven.
                    And afterwards they called us with shouts to come ashore. </p>
                <p>"But I feared [to do so], for I saw a great reef of rocks which encircles all
                    that island. And in it there is bottom and harbor for as many ships as there are
                    in all Christendom, and its entrance very narrow. It is true that there are some
                    shallows inside this ring, but the sea is no rougher than in a well. </p>
                <p>"And I was moved to see all this, this morning, so that I might be able to give
                    an account of it all to your Highnesses, and also [to find out] where I might
                    make a fortress. And I saw a piece of land formed like an island, although it is
                    not one, in which there were six houses, which could be cut off in two days so
                    as to become an island; although I do not see that it is necessary, as this
                    people is very ignorant of arms, as your Highnesses will see from seven whom I
                    had taken, to carry them off <pb n="73"/> to learn our speech and to bring them
                    back again. But your Highnesses, when you direct, can take them all to Castile,
                    or keep them captives in this same island, for with fifty men you can keep them
                    all subjected, and make them do whatever you like. </p>
                <p>"And close to the said islet are groves of trees, the most beautiful I have seen,
                    and as green and full of leaves as those of Castile in the months of April and
                    May, and much water. </p>
                <p>"I looked at all that harbor and then I returned to the ship and set sail, and I
                    saw so many islands that I could not decide to which I should go first. And
                    those men whom I had taken said to me by signs that there were so very many that
                    they were without number, and they repeated by name more than a hundred. At last
                    I set sail for the largest one, and there I determined to go. And so I am doing,
                    and it will be five leagues from the island of San Salvador, and farther from
                    some of the rest, nearer to others. They all are very flat, without mountains
                    and very fertile, and all inhabited. And they make war upon each other although
                    they are very simple, and [they are] very beautifully formed." <pb n="74"/>
                </p>
                <p>Monday, October 15, Columbus, on arriving at the island for which he had set
                    sail, went on to a cape, near which he anchored at about sunset. He gave the
                    island the name of Santa Maria de la Concepcion.<ref n="6" target="HalLife.6"
                        >[*]</ref>
                </p>
                <p>"At about sunset I anchored near the said cape to know if there were gold there,
                    for the men whom I had taken at the Island of San Salvador told me that there
                    they wore very large rings of gold on their legs and arms. I think that all they
                    said was for a trick, in order to make their escape. However, I did not wish to
                    pass by any island without taking possession of it.</p>

                <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * </p>
                <p>"And I anchored, and was there till today, Tuesday, when at the break of day I
                    went ashore with the armed boats, and landed. </p>
                <p>"They [the inhabitants], who were many, as naked and in the same condition as
                    those of San Salvador, let us land on the island, and gave us what we asked of
                    them. </p>
                <p>* * * "I set out for the ship. And there was a large almadia which had come to
                    board <pb n="75"/> the caravel Nina, and one of the men from we Island of San
                    Salvador threw himself into the sea, took this boat, and made off; and the night
                    before, at midnight, another jumped out. And the almadia went back so fast that
                    there never was a boat which could come up with her, although we had a
                    considerable advantage. It reached the shore, and they left the almadia, and
                    some of my company landed after them, and they all fled like hens. </p>
                <p>"And the almadia, which they had left, we took to the caravel Nina, to which from
                    another headland there was coming another little almadia, with a man who came to
                    barter a skein of cotton. And some of the sailors threw themselves into the sea,
                    because he did not wish to enter the caravel, and took him. And I, who was on
                    the stern of the ship, and saw it all, sent for him and gave him a red cap and
                    some little green glass beads which I put on his arm, and two small bells which
                    I put at his ears, and I had his almadia returned, * * * and sent him ashore. </p>
                <p>And I set sail at once to go to the other large island which I saw at the west,
                    and commanded <pb n="76"/> the other almadia to be set adrift, which the caravel
                    Nina was towing astern. And then I saw on land, when the man landed, to whom I
                    had given the above mentioned things (and I had not consented to take the skein
                    of cotton, though he wished to give it to me), all the others went to him and
                    thought it a great wonder, and it seemed to them that we were good people, and
                    that the other man, who had fled, had done us some harm, and that therefore we
                    were carrying him off. And this was why I treated the other man as I did,
                    commanding him to be released, and gave him the said things, so that they might
                    have this opinion of us, and so that another time, when your Highnesses send
                    here again, they may be well disposed. And all that I gave him was not worth
                    four maravedis." </p>
                <p>Columbus had set sail at ten o'clock for a "large island" he mentions, which he
                    called Fernandina, where, from the tales of the Indian captives, he expected to
                    find gold. Half way between this island and Santa Maria, he met with "a man
                    alone in an almadia which was passing" [from one island to the other], "and he
                    was <pb n="77"/> carrying a little of their bread, as big as one's fist, and a
                    calabash of water and a piece of red earth made into dust, and then kneaded, and
                    some dry leaves, which must be a thing much valued among them, since at San
                    Salvador they brought them to me as a present.<ref n="7" target="HalLife.7"
                    >[*]</ref> And he had a little basket of their sort, in which he had a string of
                    little glass bells and two <hi rend="italic">blancas</hi>, by which I knew that
                    he came from the Island of San Salvador. * * * He came to the ship; I took him
                    on board, for so he asked, and made him put his almadia in the ship, and keep
                    all he was carrying. And I commanded to give him bread and honey to eat, and
                    something to drink. </p>
                <p>"And thus I will take him over to Fernandina, and I will give him all his
                    property so that he may give good accounts of us, so that, if it please our
                    Lord, when your Highnesses send there, those who come may receive honor, and
                    they may give us of all they have." </p>
                <p>Columbus continued sailing for the island he named Fernandina, now called Inagua
                    Chica. There was a calm all day and he did not arrive in <pb n="78"/> time to
                    anchor safely before dark. He therefore waited till morning, and anchored near a
                    town. Here the man had gone, who had been picked up the day before, and he had
                    given such good accounts that all night long the ship had been boarded by
                    almadias, bringing supplies. Columbus directed some trifle to be given to each
                    of the islanders, and that they should be given "honey of sugar" to eat. He sent
                    the ship's boat ashore for water and the inhabitants not only pointed it out but
                    helped to put the water-casks on board. </p>
                <p>"This people," he says, "is like those of the aforesaid islands, and has the same
                    speech and the same customs, except that these seem to me a somewhat more
                    domestic race, and more intelligent. * * * And I saw also in this island cotton
                    cloths made like mantles. * * * </p>
                <p>"It is a very green island and flat and very fertile, and I have no doubt that
                    all the year through they sow panizo (panic-grass) and harvest it, and so with
                    everything else. And I saw many trees, of very different form from ours, and
                    many of them which had branches of many sorts, and all on one trunk. And one
                    branch is of one sort and 
                    <pb n="80"/> one of another, and so different that it is the greatest wonder in
                    the world. * * * One branch has its leaves like canes, and another like the
                    lentisk; and so on one tree five or six of these kinds; and all so different.
                    Nor are they grafted, for it might be said that grafting does it, but they grow
                    on the mountains, nor do these people care for them. * * * </p>
                <p>"Here the fishes are so different from ours that it is wonderful. There are some
                    like cocks of the finest colors in the world, blue, yellow, red and of all
                    colors, and others painted in a thousand ways. And the colors are so fine that
                    there is no man who does not wonder at them and take great pleasure in seeing
                    them. Also, there are whales. As for wild creatures on shore, I saw none of any
                    sort, except parrots and lizards; a boy told me that he saw a great snake.
                    Neither sheep nor goats nor any other animal did I see; although I have been
                    here a very short time, that is, half a day, but if there had been any I could
                    not have failed to see some of them." * * * </p>
                <p>Wednesday, October 17. He left the town at noon and prepared to sail round the
                    island. He <pb n="81"/> had meant to go by the south and southeast. But as
                    Martin Alonzo Pinzon, captain of the Pinta, had heard, from one of the Indians
                    he had on board, that it would be quicker to start by the northwest, and as the
                    wind was favorable for this course, Columbus took it. He found a fine harbor two
                    leagues further on, where he found some friendly Indians, and sent a party
                    ashore for water. "During this time," he says, "I went [to look at] these trees,
                    which were the most beautiful things to see which have been seen; there was as
                    much verdure in the same degree as in the month of May in Andalusia, and all the
                    trees were as different from ours as the day from the night. And so [were] the
                    fruits, and the herbs, and the stones and everything. The truth is that some
                    trees had a resemblance to others which there are in Castile, but there was a
                    very great difference. And other trees of other sorts were such that there is no
                    one who could * * * liken them to others of Castile. * * * </p>
                <p>"The others who went for water told me how they had been in their houses, and
                    that they were very well swept and clean, and their beds and <pb n="82"/>
                    furniture [made] of things which are like nets of cotton.<ref n="8"
                        target="HalLife.8">[*]</ref> Their houses are all like pavilions, and very
                    high and good chimneys.<ref n="9" target="HalLife.9">[*]</ref>
                </p>
                <p>"But I did not see, among many towns which I saw, any of more than twelve or
                    fifteen houses. * * * And there they had dogs. * * * And there they found one
                    man who had on his nose a piece of gold which was like half a castellano, on
                    which there were cut letters.<ref n="10" target="HalLife.10">[+]</ref> I blamed
                    them for not bargaining for it, and giving as much as was asked, to see what it
                    was, and whose coin it was; and they answered me that they did not dare to
                    barter it." </p>
                <p>He continued towards the northwest, then turned his course to the east-southeast,
                    east and southeast. The weather being thick and heavy, and "threatening
                    immediate rain. So all these days since I have been in these Indies it has
                    rained little or much." </p>
                <p>Friday, October 19. Columbus, who had not <pb n="83"/> landed the day before, now
                    sent two caravels, one to the east and southeast and the other to the
                    south-southeast, while he himself, with the Santa Maria, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >ship</hi>, as he calls it, went to the southeast. He ordered the caravels
                    to keep their courses till noon, and then join him. This they did, at an island
                    to the east, which he named Isabella, the Indians whom he had with him calling
                    it Saomete. It has been supposed to be the island now called Inagua Grande. </p>
                <p>"All this coast," says the Admiral, "and the part of the island which I saw, is
                    all nearly flat, and the island the most beautiful thing I ever saw, for if the
                    others are very beautiful this one is more so." He anchored at a cape which was
                    so beautiful that he named it <hi rend="italic">Cabo Fermoso</hi>, the Beautiful
                    Cape, "so green and so beautiful," he says, "like all the other things and lands
                    of these islands, that I do not know where to go first, nor can I weary my eyes
                    with seeing such beautiful verdure and so different from ours. And I believe
                    that there are in them many herbs and many trees, which are of great value in
                    Spain for dyes [or tinctures] and for medicines of spicery. <pb n="84"/> But I
                    do not know them, which I greatly regret. And as I came here to this cape there
                    came such a good and sweet odor of flowers or trees from the land that it was
                    the sweetest thing in the world." </p>
                <p>He heard that there was a king in the interior who wore clothes and much gold,
                    and though, as he says, the Indians had so little gold that whatever small
                    quantity of it the king wore it would appear large to them, he decided to visit
                    him the next day. He did not do so, however, as he found the water too shallow
                    in his immediate neighborhood, and then had not enough wind to go on, except at
                    night. </p>
                <p>Sunday morning, October 21, he anchored, apparently more to the west, and after
                    having dined, landed. He found but one house, from which the inhabitants were
                    absent; he directed that nothing in it should be touched. He speaks again of the
                    great beauty of the island, even greater than that of the others he had seen.
                    "The singing of the birds," he says, "seems as if a man would never seek to
                    leave this place, and the flocks of parrots which darken the sun, and fowls and
                    birds of so many kinds and so different <pb n="85"/> from ours that it is
                    wonderful. And then there are trees of a thousand sorts, and all with fruit of
                    their kinds. And all have such an odor that it is wonderful, so that I am the
                    most afflicted man in the world not to know them." </p>
                <p>They killed a serpent in one of the lakes upon this island, which Las Casas says
                    is the Guana, or what we call the Iguana. </p>
                <p>In seeking for good water, the Spaniards found a town, from which the inhabitants
                    were going to fly. But some of them rallied, and one of them approached the
                    visitors. Columbus gave him some little bells and glass beads, with which he was
                    much pleased. The Admiral asked him for water, and they brought it gladly to the
                    shore in calabashes. </p>
                <p>He still wished to see the king of whom the Indians had spoken, but meant
                    afterward to go to "another very great island, which I believe must be Cipango,
                    which they call Colba." This is probably a mistake in the manuscript for Cuba,
                    which is what is meant. It continues, "and to that other island which they call
                    Bosio" (probably Bohio) "and the others which are on the way, I <pb n="86"/>
                    will see these in passing. * * * But still, I am determined to go to the
                    mainland and to the city of Quisay and to give your Highnesses' letters to the
                    Grand Khan, and seek a reply and come back with it." </p>
                <p>He remained at this island during the twenty-second and twenty-third of October,
                    waiting first for the king, who did not appear, and then for a favorable wind.
                    "To sail round these islands," he says, "one needs many sorts of wind, and it
                    does not blow as men would like." At midnight, between the twenty-third and
                    twenty-fourth, he weighed anchor in order to start for Cuba. </p>
                <p>"I have heard these people say that it was very large and of great traffic," he
                    says, "and that there were in it gold and spices, and great ships and merchants.
                    And they showed me that I should go to it by the west-southwest, and I think so.
                    For I think that if I may trust the signs which all the Indians of these islands
                    have made me, and those whom I am carrying in the ships, for by the tongue I do
                    not understand them, it (Cuba) is the Island of Cipango,<ref n="11"
                        target="HalLife.11">[*]</ref> of which wonderful things <pb n="87"/> are
                    told, and on the globes which I have seen and in the painted maps, it is in this
                    district." </p>
                <p>The next day they saw seven or eight islands, which are supposed to be the
                    eastern and southern keys of the Grand Bank of Bahama. He anchored to the south
                    of them on the twenty-sixth of October, and on the next day sailed once more for
                    Cuba. </p>
                <p>On Sunday, October 28, he arrived there, in what is now called the Puerto de
                    Nipe; he named it the Puerto de San Salvador. Here, as he went on, he was again
                    charmed by the beautiful country. He found palms "of another sort," says Las
                    Casas, "from those of Guinea, and from ours." He found the island the "most
                    beautiful which eyes have seen, full of very good ports and deep rivers," and
                    that apparently the sea is never rough there, as the grass grows down to the
                    water's edge. This greenness to the sea's edge is still observed there. "Up till
                    that time," says Las Casas, ,he had not experienced in all these islands that
                    the sea was rough." He had occasion to learn about it later. He mentions also
                    that the island is mountainous.</p>

                    <p> To this first found land, called by the natives Guanahani, Columbus gave the
                        name of San Salvador. There is, however, great doubt whether this is the
                        island known by that name on the maps. Of late years the impression has
                        generally been that the island thus discovered is that now known as
                        Watling's island. In 1860 Admiral Fox, of the United States navy, visited
                        all these islands, and studied the whole question anew, visiting the islands
                        himself and working backwards to the account of Columbus's subsequent
                        voyage, so as to fix the spot from which that voyage began. Admiral Fox
                        decides that the island of discovery was neither San Salvador nor Watling's
                        island, but the Samana island of the same group. The subject is so curious
                        that we copy his results at more length in the appendix.</p>

                <head> CHAPTER V.<lb/>
                    <lb/> LANDING ON CUBA &mdash; THE CIGAR AND TOBACCO &mdash; CIPANGO AND
                    THE GREAT KHAN &mdash; FROM CUBA TO HAYTI &mdash; ITS SHORES AND
                    HARBORS. </head>

                <p>When Columbus landed, at some distance farther along the coast, he found the best
                    houses he had yet seen, very large, like pavilions, and very neat within; not in
                    streets but set about here and there. They were all built of palm branches. Here
                    were dogs which never barked (supposed to be the almiqui), wild birds tamed in
                    the houses and "wonderful arrangements of nets,<ref n="12" target="HalLife.12"
                        >[*]</ref> and fish-hooks and fishing apparatus. There were also carved
                    masks and other images. Not a thing was touched." The inhabitants had fled. </p>
                <p>He went on to the northwest, and saw a cape which he named Cabo de Palmas. The
                    Indians on board the Pinta said that beyond this cape was a river and that at
                    four days' journey from this was what they called "Cuba." Now they had been 
                    <pb n="90"/> coasting along the Island of Cuba for two or three days. But Martin
                    Pinzon, the captain of the Pinta, understood this Cuba to be a city, and that
                    this land was the mainland, running far to the north. Columbus until he died
                    believed that it was the mainland. </p>
                <p>Martin Pinzon also understood that the king of that land was at war with the
                    Grand Khan, whom they called Cami. The Admiral determined to go to the river the
                    Indians mentioned, and to send to the king the letter of the sovereigns. He
                    meant to send with it a sailor who had been to Guinea, and some of the Guanahani
                    Indians. He was encouraged, probably, by the name of Carni, in thinking that he
                    was really near the Grand Khan. </p>
                <p>He did not, however, send off these messengers at once, as the wind and the
                    nature of the coast proved unfit for his going up the river the Indians had
                    spoken of. He went back to the town where he had been two days before. </p>
                <p>Once more he found that the people had fled, but "after a good while a man
                    appeared," and the Admiral sent ashore one of the Indians he had with him. This
                    man shouted to the Indians on <pb n="91"/> shore that they must not be afraid,
                    as these were good people, and did harm to no man, nor did they belong to the
                    Grand Khan, but they gave, of what they had, in many islands where they had
                    been. He now jumped into the sea and swam ashore, and two of the inhabitants
                    took him in their arms and brought him to a house where they asked him
                    questions. When he had reassured them, they began to come out to the ships in
                    their canoes, with "spun cotton and others of their little things." But the
                    Admiral commanded that nothing should be taken from them, so that they might
                    know that he was seeking nothing but gold, or, as they called it, <hi
                        rend="italic">nucay</hi>. </p>
                <p>He saw no gold here, but one of them had a piece of wrought silver hanging to his
                    nose. They made signs, that before three days many merchants would come from the
                    inland country to trade with the Spaniards, and that they would bring news from
                    the king, who, according to their signs, was four days' journey away. "And it is
                    certain" says the Admiral, "that this is the mainland, and that I am before
                    Zayto and Quinsay, a hundred leagues more or less from both of them, and this
                        <pb n="92"/> is clearly shown by the tide, which comes in a different manner
                    from that in which it has done up to this time; and yesterday when I went to the
                    northwest I found that it was cold." </p>
                <p>Always supposing that he was near Japan, which they called Cipango, Columbus
                    continued to sail along the northern coast of Cuba and explored about half that
                    shore. He then returned to the east, governed by the assurances of the natives
                    that on an island named Babegue he would find men who used hammers with which to
                    beat gold into ingots. This gold, as he understood them, was collected on the
                    shore at night, while the people lighted up the darkness with candles. </p>
                <p>At the point where ne{sic} turned back, he had hauled his ships up on the shore
                    to repair them. From this point, on the second of November, he sent two officers
                    inland, one of whom was a Jew, who knew Chaldee, Hebrew and a little Arabic, in
                    the hope that they should find some one who could speak these languages. With
                    them went one of the Guanahani Indians, and one from the neighborhood. <pb
                        n="93"/>
                </p>
                <p>They returned on the night between the fifth and sixth of November. Twelve
                    leagues off they had found a village of about fifty large houses, made in the
                    form of tents. This village had about a thousand inhabitants, according to the
                    explorers. They had received the ambassadors with cordial kindness, believing
                    that they had descended from heaven. </p>
                <p>They even took them in their arms and thus carried them to the finest house of
                    all. They gave them seats, and then sat round them on the ground in a circle.
                    They kissed their feet and hands, and touched them, to make sure whether they
                    were really men of flesh and bone. </p>
                <p>It was on this expedition that the first observation was made of that gift of
                    America to the world, which has worked its way so deep and far into general use.
                    They met men and women who "carried live coals, so as to draw into their mouths
                    the smoke of burning herbs." This was the account of the first observers. But
                    Las Casas says that the dry herbs were wrapped in another leaf as dry." He says
                    that "they lighted one end of the little stick thus formed, and sucked <pb
                        n="94"/> in or absorbed the smoke by the other, with which," he says, "they
                    put their flesh to sleep, and it nearly intoxicates them, and thus they say that
                    they feel no fatigue. These mosquetes, as we should call them, they call
                    tobacos. I knew Spaniards on this Island of Hispaniola who were accustomed to
                    take them, who, on being reproved for it as a vice, replied that it was not in
                    their power (in their hand) to leave off taking them. I do not know what savour
                    or profit they found in them." This is clearly a cigar. </p>
                <p>The third or fourth of November, then, 1892, with the addition of nine days to
                    change the style from old to new, may be taken by lovers of tobacco as the
                    fourth centennial of the day when Europeans first learned the use of the cigar. </p>
                <p>On the eleventh of November the repairs were completed. </p>
                <p>He says that the Sunday before, November 11 it had seemed to him that it would be
                    good to take some persons, from those of that river, to carry to the sovereigns,
                    so that "they might learn our tongue, so as to know what there is in the
                    country, and so that when they come back they may be <pb n="95"/> tongues to the
                    Christians, and receive our customs and the things of the faith. Because I saw
                    and know," says the Admiral, "that this people has no religion (secta) nor are
                    they idolaters, but very mild and without knowing what evil is, nor how to kill
                    others, nor how to take them, and without arms, and so timorous that from one of
                    our men ten of them fly, although they do sport with them, and ready to believe
                    and knowing that there is a God in heaven, and sure that we have come from
                    heaven; and very ready at any prayer which we tell them to repeat, and they make
                    the sign of the cross. </p>
                <p>"So your Highnesses should determine to make them Christians, for I believe that
                    if they begin, in a short time they will have accomplished converting to our
                    holy faith a multitude of towns." "Without doubt there are in these lands the
                    greatest quantities of gold, for not without cause do these Indians whom I am
                    bringing say that there are places in these isles where they dig out gold and
                    wear it on their necks, in their ears and on their arms and legs, and the
                    bracelets are very thick.</p>
               
                <pb n="97"/>

                <p>"And also there are stones and precious pearls, and unnumbered spices. And in
                    this Rio de Mares, from which I departed last night, without doubt there is the
                    greatest quantity of mastic, and there might be more if more were desired. For
                    the trees, if planted, take root, and there are many of them and very great and
                    they have the leaf like a lentisk, and their fruit, except that the trees and
                    the fruit are larger, is such as Pliny describes, and I have seen in the Island
                    of Chios in the Archipelago. </p>
                <p>"And I had many of these trees tapped to see if they would send out resin, so as
                    to draw it out. And as it rained all the time I was at the said river, I could
                    not get any of it, except a very little which I am bringing to your Highnesses.
                    And besides, it may be that it is not the, time to tap them, for I believe that
                    this should be done at the time when the trees begin to leave out from the
                    winter and seek to send out their flowers, and now they have the fruit nearly
                    ripe. </p>
                <p>"And also here there might be had a great store of cotton, and I believe that it
                    might be sold very well here without taking it to Spain, in the great cities of
                    the Great Khan, which will <pb n="98"/> doubtless be discovered, and many others
                    of other lords, who will then have to serve your Highnesses. And here will be
                    given them other things from Spain, from the lands of the East, since these are
                    ours in the West. </p>
                <p>"And here there is also aloes everywhere, although this is not a thing to make
                    great account of, but the mastic should be well considered, because it is not
                    found except in the said island of Chios, and I believe that they get from it
                    quite 50,000 ducats if I remember aright. And this is the best harbor which I
                    have seen thus far &mdash; deep and easy of access, so that this would be a
                    good place for a large town." </p>
                <p>The notes in Columbus's journals are of the more interest and value, because they
                    show his impressions at the moment when he wrote. However mistaken those
                    impressions, he never corrects them afterwards. Although, while he was in Cuba,
                    he never found the Grand Khan, he never recalls the hopes which he has
                    expressed. </p>
                <p>He had discovered the island on its northern side by sailing southwest from the
                    Lucayos or Bahamas. From the eleventh of November until <pb n="99"/> the sixth
                    of December he was occupied in coasting along the northern shore, eventually
                    returning eastward, when he crossed the channel which parts Cuba from Hayti. </p>
                <p>The first course was east, a quarter southeast, and on the sixteenth, they
                    entered Port-au-Prince, and took possession, raising a cross there. At
                    Port-au-Prince, to his surprise, he found on a point of rock two large logs,
                    mortised into each other in the shape of a cross, so "that you would have said a
                    carpenter could not have proportioned them better." </p>
                <p>On the nineteenth the course was north-northeast; on the twenty-first they took a
                    course south, a quarter southwest, seeking in these changes the island of
                    "Babeque," which the Indians had spoken of as rich with gold. On the day last
                    named Pinzon left the Admiral in the Pinta, and they did not meet again for more
                    than a month. </p>
                <p>Columbus touched at various points on Cuba and the neighboring islands. He
                    sought, without success, for pearls, and always pressed his inquiries for gold.
                    He was determined to find the island of Bohio, greatly to the terror of the poor
                    Indians, <pb n="100"/> whom he had on board: they said that its natives had but
                    one eye, in the middle of their foreheads, and that they were well armed and ate
                    their prisoners. </p>
                <p>He landed in the bay of Moa, and then, keeping near the coast, sailed towards the
                    Capo del Pico, now called Cape Vacz. At Puerto Santo he was detained some days
                    by bad weather. On the fourth of December he continued his eastward voyage, and
                    on the next day saw far off the mountains of Hayti, which was the Bohio he
                    sought for.</p>

                <p>On the sixth of December they crossed from the eastern cape of Cuba to the
                    northwestern point of the island, which we call Hayti or San Domingo. He says he
                    gave it this name because "the plains appeared to him almost exactly like those
                    of Castile, but yet more beautiful." </p>
                <p>He coasted eastward along the northern side of the island, hoping that it might
                    be the continent, and always inquiring for gold when he landed; but the Indians,
                    as before, referred him to yet another land, still further south, which they
                    still called Bohio. It was not surrounded by water, they said. The word
                    "caniba," which is <pb n="102"/> the origin of our word "cannibal," and refers
                    to the fierce <hi rend="italic">Caribs</hi>, came often into their talk. The
                    sound of the syllable can made Columbus more sure that he was now approaching
                    the dominions of the <hi rend="italic">Grand Khan</hi> of eastern Asia, of whom
                    Marco Polo had informed Europe so fully. </p>
                <p>On the twelfth of the month, after a landing in which a cross had been erected,
                    three sailors went inland, pursuing the Indians. They captured a young woman
                    whom they brought to the fleet. She wore a large ring of gold in her nose. She
                    was able to understand the other Indians whom they had on board. Columbus
                    dressed her, gave her some imitation pearls, rings and other finery, and then
                    put her on shore with three Indians and three of his own men. </p>
                <p>The men returned the next day without going to the Indian village. Columbus then
                    sent out nine men, with an Indian, who found a town of a thousand huts about
                    four and a half leagues from the ship. They thought the population was three
                    thousand. The village in Cuba is spoken of as having twenty people to a house.
                    Here the houses were smaller or the count of the numbers <pb n="103"/>
                    extravagant. The people approached the explorers carefully, and with tokens of
                    respect. Soon they gained confidence and brought out food for them: fish, and
                    bread made from roots, "which tasted exactly as if it were made of chestnuts." </p>
                <p>In the midst of this festival, the woman, who had been sent back from the ship so
                    graciously, appeared borne on the shoulders of men who were led by her husband. </p>
                <p>The Spaniards thought these natives of St. Domingo much whiter than those of the
                    other islands. Columbus says that two of the women, if dressed in Castilian
                    costume, would be counted to be Spaniards. He says that the heat of the country
                    is intense, and that if these people lived in a cooler region they would be of
                    lighter color. </p>
                <p>On the fourteenth of December he continued his voyage eastward, and on the
                    fifteenth landed on the little island north of Hayti, which he called Tortuga,
                    or Turtle island. At midnight on the sixteenth he sailed, and landed on
                    Hispaniola again. Five hundred Indians met him, accompanied by their king, a
                    fine young man of about twenty years of age. He had around him several <pb
                        n="104"/> counselors, one of whom appeared to be his tutor. To the steady
                    questions where gold could be found, the reply as steady was made that it was in
                    "the Island of Babeque." This island, they said, was only two days off, and they
                    pointed out the route. The interview ended in an offer by the king to the
                    Admiral of all that he had. The explorers never found this mysterious Babeque,
                    unless, as Bishop Las Casas guessed, Babeque and Jamaica be the same. </p>
                <p>The king visited Columbus on his ship in the evening, and Columbus entertained
                    him with European food. With so cordial a beginning of intimacy, it was natural
                    that the visitors should spend two or three days with these people. The king
                    would not believe that any sovereigns of Castile could be more powerful than the
                    men he saw. He and those around him all believed that they came direct from
                    heaven. </p>
                <p>Columbus was always asking for gold. He gave strict orders that it should always
                    be paid for, when it was taken. To the islanders it was merely a matter of
                    ornament, and they gladly exchanged it for the glass beads, the rings or the <pb
                        n="105"/> bells, which seemed to them more ornamental. One of the caciques
                    or chiefs, evidently a man of distinction and authority, had little bits of gold
                    which he exchanged for pieces of glass. It proved that he had clipped them off
                    from a larger piece, and he went back into his cabin, cut that to pieces, and
                    then exchanged all those in trade for the white man's commodities. Well pleased
                    with his bargain, he then told the Spaniards that he would go and get much more
                    and would come and trade with them again. </p>
                <p>On the eighteenth of December, the wind not serving well, they waited the return
                    of the chief whom they had first seen. In the afternoon he appeared, seated in a
                    palanquin, which was carried by four men, and escorted by more than two hundred
                    of his people. He was accompanied by a counselor and preceptor who did not leave
                    him. He came on board the ship when Columbus was at table. He would not permit
                    him to leave his place, and readily took a seat at his side, when it was
                    offered. Columbus offered him European food and drink; he tasted of each, and
                    then gave what was offered to his attendants. The <pb n="106"/> ceremonious
                    Spaniards found a remarkable dignity in his air and gestures. After the repast,
                    one of his servants brought a handsome belt, elegantly wrought, which he
                    presented to Columbus, with two small pieces of gold, also delicately wrought. </p>
                <p>Columbus observed that this cacique looked with interest on the hangings of his
                    ship-bed, and made a present of them to him, in return for his offering, with
                    some amber beads from his own neck, some red shoes and a flask of orange flower
                    water. </p>
                <p>On the nineteenth, after these agreeable hospitalities, the squadron sailed
                    again, and on the twentieth arrived at a harbor which Columbus pronounced the
                    finest he had ever seen. The reception he met here and the impressions he formed
                    of Hispaniola determined him to make a colony on that island. It may be said
                    that on this determination the course of his after life turned. This harbor is
                    now known as the Bay of Azul. </p>
                <p>The men, whom he sent on shore, found a large village not far from the shore,
                    where they were <pb n="107"/> most cordially received. The natives begged the
                    Europeans to stay with them, and as it proved, Columbus accepted the invitation
                    for a part of his crew. On the first day three different chiefs came to visit
                    him, in a friendly way, with their retinues. The next day more than a hundred
                    and twenty canoes visited the ship, bringing with them such presents as the
                    people thought would be acceptable. Among these were bread from the cassava
                    root, fish, water in earthen jars, and the seeds of spices. These spices they
                    would stir in with water to make a drink which they thought healthful. </p>
                <p>On the same day Columbus sent an embassy of six men to a large town in the
                    interior. The chief by giving his hand "to the secretary" pledged himself for
                    their safe return. </p>
                <p>The twenty-third was Sunday. It was spent as the day before had been, in mutual
                    civilities. The natives would offer their presents, and say "take, take," in
                    their own language. Five chiefs were among the visitors of the day. From their
                    accounts Columbus was satisfied that there was much gold in the island, as
                    indeed, to the misery and destruction of its inhabitants, there proved to <pb
                        n="108"/> be. He thought it was larger than England. But he was mistaken. In
                    his journal of the next day he mentions Civao, a land to the west, where they
                    told him that there was gold, and again he thought he was approaching Cipango,
                    or Japan. </p>
                <p>The next day he left these hospitable people, raising anchor in the morning, and
                    with a light land wind continued towards the west. At eleven in the evening
                    Columbus retired to rest. While he slept, on Christmas Day, there occurred an
                    accident which changed all plans for the expedition so far as any had been
                    formed, and from which there followed the establishment of the ill-fated first
                    colony. The evening was calm when Columbus himself retired to sleep, and the
                    master of the vessel followed his example, entrusting the helm to one of the
                    boys. Every person on the ship, excepting this boy, was asleep, and he seems to
                    have been awake to little purpose. </p>
                <p>The young steersman let the ship drift upon a ridge of rock, although, as
                    Columbus says, indignantly, there were breakers abundant to show the danger. So
                    soon as she struck, the boy cried out, and Columbus was the first to wake. He
                        <pb n="109"/> says, by way of apology for himself, that for thirty-six hours
                    he had not slept until now. The master of the ship followed him. But it was too
                    late. The tide, such as there was, was ebbing, and the Santa Maria was
                    hopelessly aground. Columbus ordered the masts cut away, but this did not
                    relieve her. </p>
                <p>He sent out his boat with directions to carry aft an anchor and cable, but its
                    crew escaped to the Nina with their tale of disaster. The Nina's people would
                    not receive them, reproached them as traitors, and in their own vessel came to
                    the scene of danger. Columbus was obliged to transfer to her the crew of the
                    Santa Maria. </p>
                <p>So soon as it was day, their friendly ally, Guacanagari, came on board. With
                    tears in his eyes, he made the kindest and most judicious offers of assistance.
                    He saw Columbus's dejection, and tried to relieve him by expressions of his
                    sympathy. He set aside on shore two large houses to receive the stores that were
                    on the Santa Maria, and appointed as many large canoes as could be used to
                    remove these stores to the land. He assured Columbus that not a bit of <pb
                        n="110"/> the cargo or stores should be lost, and this loyal promise was
                    fulfilled to the letter. </p>
                <p>The weather continued favorable. The sea was so light that everything on board
                    the Santa Maria was removed safely. Then it was that Columbus, tempted by the
                    beauty of the place, by the friendship of the natives, and by the evident wishes
                    of his men, determined to leave a colony, which should be supported by the
                    stores of the Santa Maria, until the rest of the party could go back to Spain
                    and bring or send reinforcements. The king was well pleased with this
                    suggestion, and promised all assistance for the plan. A vault was dug and built,
                    in which the stores could be placed, and on this a house was built for the home
                    of the colonists, so far as they cared to live within doors. </p>
                <p>The chief sent a canoe in search of Martin Pinzon and the Pinta, to tell them of
                    the disaster. But the messengers returned without finding them. At the camp,
                    which was to be a city, all was industriously pressed, with the assistance of
                    the friendly natives. Columbus, having no vessel but the little Nina left,
                    determined to return to Europe <pb n="111"/> with the news of his discovery, and
                    to leave nearly forty men ashore. </p>
                <p>It would appear that the men, themselves, were eager to stay. The luxury of the
                    climate and the friendly overtures of the people delighted them, They had no
                    need to build substantial houses. So far as houses were needed, those of the
                    natives were sufficient. All the preparations which Columbus thought necessary
                    were made in the week between the twenty-sixth of December and the second of
                    January. On that day he expected to sail eastward, but unfavorable winds
                    prevented. </p>
                <p>He landed his men again, and by the exhibition of a pretended battle with
                    European arms, he showed the natives the military force of their new neighbors.
                    He fired a shot from an arquebuse against the wreck of the Santa Maria, so that
                    the Indians might see the power of his artillery. The Indian chief expressed his
                    regret at the approaching departure, and the Spaniards thought that one of his
                    courtiers said that the chief had ordered him to make a statue of pure gold as
                    large as the Admiral. <pb n="112"/>
                </p>
                <p>Columbus explained to the friendly chief that with such arms as the sovereigns of
                    Castile commanded they could readily destroy the dreaded Caribs. And he thought
                    he had made such an impression that the islanders would be the firm friends of
                    the colonists. </p>
                <p>"I have bidden them build a solid tower and defense, over a vault. Not that I
                    think this necessary against the natives, for I am satisfied that with a handful
                    of people I could conquer the whole island, were it necessary, although it is,
                    as far as I can judge, larger than Portugal, and twice as thickly peopled." In
                    this cheerful estimate of the people Columbus was wholly wrong, as the sad
                    events proved before the year had gone by. </p>
                <p>He left thirty-nine men to be the garrison of this fort; and the colony which was
                    to discover the mine of gold. In command he placed Diego da Arana, Pedro
                    Gutierres and Rodrigo de Segovia. To us, who have more experience of colonies
                    and colonists than he had had, it does not seem to promise well that Rodrigo was
                    "the king's chamberlain and an officer of the first lord of the household." Of
                    these three, Diego da <pb n="113"/> Arana was to be the governor, and the other
                    two his lieutenants. The rest were all sailors, but among them there were
                    Columbus's secretary, an alguazil, or person commissioned in the civil service
                    at home, an "arquebusier," who was also a good engineer, a tailor, a ship
                    carpenter, a cooper and a physician. So the little colony had its share of
                    artificers and men of practical skill. They all staid willingly, delighted with
                    the prospects of their new home. </p>
                <p>On the third of January Columbus sailed for Europe in the little Nina. With her
                    own crew and the addition she received from the Santa Maria, she must have been
                    badly crowded. Fortunately for all parties, on Sunday, the third day of the
                    voyage, while they were still in sight of land, the Pinta came in sight. Martin
                    Pinzon came on board the Nina and offered excuses for his absence. Columbus was
                    not really satisfied with them, but he affected to be, as this was no moment for
                    a quarrel. He believed that Pinzon had left him, that, in the Pinta, he might be
                    alone when he discovered the rich gold-bearing island of Babeque or Baneque.
                    Although the <pb n="114"/> determination was made to return, another week was
                    spent in slow coasting, or in waiting for wind. It brought frequent
                    opportunities for meeting the natives, in one of which they showed a desire to
                    take some of their visitors captive. This would only have been a return for a
                    capture made by Pinzon of several of their number, whom Columbus, on his meeting
                    Pinzon, had freed. In this encounter two of the Indians were wounded, one by a
                    sword, one by an arrow. It would seem that he did not show them the power of
                    firearms. </p>
                <p>This was in the Bay of Samana, which Columbus called "The Bay of Arrows," from
                    the skirmish or quarrel which took place there. They then sailed sixty-four
                    miles cast, a quarter northeast, and thought they saw the land of the Caribs,
                    which he was seeking. But here, at length, his authority over his crew failed.
                    The men were eager to go home; &mdash; did not, perhaps, like the idea of
                    fight with the man-eating Caribs. There was a good western wind, and on the
                    evening of the sixteenth of January Columbus gave way and they bore away for
                    home. <pb n="115"/>
                </p>
                <p>Columbus had satisfied himself in this week that there were many islands east of
                    him which he had not hit upon, and that to the easternmost of these, from the
                    Canaries, the distance would prove not more than four hundred leagues. In this
                    supposition he was wholly wrong, though a chain of islands does extend to the
                    southeast. </p>
                <p>He seems to have observed the singular regularity by which the trade winds bore
                    him steadily westward as he came over. He had no wish to visit the Canary
                    Islands again, and with more wisdom than could have been expected, from his
                    slight knowledge of the Atlantic winds, he bore north. Until the fourteenth of
                    February the voyage was prosperous and uneventful. One day the captive Indians
                    amused the sailors by swimming. There is frequent mention of the green growth of
                    the Sargasso sea. But on the fourteenth all this changed. The simple journal
                    thus describes the terrible tempest which endangered the two vessels, and
                    seemed, at the moment, to cut off the hope of their return to Europe. </p>
                <p>"Monday, February 14. &mdash; This night the wind increased still more; the
                    waves were terrible. <pb n="116"/> Coming from two opposite directions, they
                    crossed each other, and stopped the progress of the vessel, which could neither
                    proceed nor get out from among them; and as they began continually to break over
                    the ship, the Admiral caused the main-sail to be lowered. She proceeded thus
                    during three hours, and made twenty miles. The sea became heavier and heavier,
                    and the wind more and more violent. Seeing the danger imminent, he allowed
                    himself to drift in whatever direction the wind took him, because he could do
                    nothing else. Then the Pinta, of which Martin Alonzo Pinzon was the commander,
                    began to drift also; but she disappeared very soon, although all through the
                    night the Admiral made signals with lights to her, and she answered as long as
                    she could, till she was prevented, probably by the force of the tempest, and by
                    her deviation from the course which the Admiral followed." Columbus did not see
                    the Pinta again until she arrived at Palos. He was himself driven fifty-four
                    miles towards the northeast. </p>
                <p>The journal continues. "After sunrise the strength of the wind increased, and the
                    sea <pb n="117"/> became still more terrible. The Admiral all this time kept his
                    mainsail lowered, so that the vessel might rise from among the waves which
                    washed over it, and which threatened to sink it. The Admiral followed, at first,
                    the direction of east-northeast, and afterwards due northeast. He sailed about
                    six hours in this direction, and thus made seven leagues and a half. He gave
                    orders that every sailor should draw lots as to who should make a pilgrimage to
                    Santa Maria of Guadeloupe, to carry her a five-pound wax candle. And each one
                    took a vow that he to whom the lot fell should make the pilgrimage. </p>
                <p>"For this purpose, he gave orders to take as many dry peas as there were persons
                    in the ship, and to cut, with a knife, a cross upon one of them, and to put them
                    all into a cap, and to shake them up well. The first who put his hand in was the
                    Admiral. He drew out the dry pea marked with the cross; so it was upon him that
                    the lot fell, and he regarded himself, after that, as a pilgrim, obliged to
                    carry into effect the vow which he had thus taken. They drew lots a second time,
                    to select a person to go as pilgrim to Our Lady of <pb n="118"/> Lorette, which
                    is within the boundaries of Ancona, making a part of the States of the Church:
                    it is a place where the Holy Virgin has worked and continues to work many and
                    great miracles. The lot having fallen this time upon a sailor of the harbor of
                    Santa Maria, named Pedro de Villa, the Admiral promised to give him all the
                    money necessary for the expenses. He decided that a third pilgrim should be sent
                    to watch one night at Santa Clara of Moguer, and to have a mass said there. For
                    this purpose, they again shook up the dry peas, not forgetting that one which
                    was marked with the cross, and the lot fell once again to the Admiral himself.
                    He then took, as did all his crew, the vow that, on the first shore which they
                    might reach, they would go in their shirts, in a procession, to make a prayer in
                    some church in invocation of Our Lady." </p>
                <p>"Besides the general vows, or those taken by all in common, each man made his own
                    special vow, because nobody expected to escape. The storm which they experienced
                    was so terrible, that all regarded themselves as lost; what increased the danger
                    was the circumstance that the vessel <pb n="119"/> lacked ballast, because the
                    consumption of food, water and wine had greatly diminished her load. The hope of
                    the continuance of weather as fine as that which they had experienced in all the
                    islands, was the reason why the Admiral had not provided his vessel with the
                    proper amount of ballast. Moreover, his plan had been to ballast it in the
                    Women's Island, whither he had from the first determined to go. The remedy which
                    the Admiral employed was to fill with sea water, as soon as possible, all the
                    empty barrels which had previously held either wine or fresh water. In this way
                    the difficulty was remedied. </p>
                <p>"The Admiral tells here the reasons for fearing that our Saviour would allow him
                    to become the victim of this tempest, and other reasons which made him hope that
                    God would come to his assistance, and cause him to arrive safe and sound, so
                    that intelligence such as that which he was conveying to the king and queen
                    would not perish with him. The strong desire which he had to be the bearer of
                    intelligence so important, and to prove the truth of all which he had said, and
                    that all which he had tried to discover had really been <pb n="120"/>
                    discovered, seemed to contribute precisely to inspire him with the greatest fear
                    that he could not succeed. He confessed, himself, that every mosquito that
                    passed before his eyes was enough to annoy and trouble him. He attributed this
                    to his little faith, and his lack of confidence in Divine Providence. On the
                    other hand, he was re-animated by the favors which God had shown him in granting
                    to him so great a triumph as that which he had achieved, in all his discoveries,
                    in fulfilling all his wishes, and in granting that, after having experienced in
                    Castile so many rebuffs and disappointments, all his hopes should at last be
                    more than surpassed. In one word, as the sovereign master of the universe, had,
                    in the outset, distinguished him in granting all his requests, before he had
                    carried out his expedition for God's greatest glory, and before it had
                    succeeded, he was compelled to believe now that God would preserve him to
                    complete the work which he had begun." Such is Las Casas's abridgment of
                    Columbus's words. </p>
                <p>"For which reasons he said he ought to have had no fear of the tempest that was
                    raging. But <pb n="121"/> his weakness and anguish did not leave him a moment's
                    calm. He also said that his greatest grief was the thought of leaving his two
                    boys orphans. They were at Cordova, at their studies. What would become of them
                    in a strange land, without father or mother? for the king and queen, being
                    ignorant of the services he had rendered them in this voyage, and of the good
                    news which he was bringing to them, would not be bound by any consideration to
                    serve as their protectors. </p>
                <p>"Full of this thought, he sought, even in the storm, some means of apprising
                    their highnesses of the victory which the Lord had granted him, in permitting
                    him to discover in the Indies all which he had sought in his voyage, and to let
                    them know that these coasts were free from storms, which is proved, he said, by
                    the growth of herbage and trees even to the edge of the sea. With this purpose,
                    that, if he perished in this tempest, the king and queen might have some news of
                    his voyage, he took a parchment and wrote on it all that he could of his
                    discoveries, and urgently begged that whoever found it would carry it to the
                    king and queen. He rolled up this parchment in a piece of waxed <pb n="122"/>
                    linen, closed this parcel tightly, and tied it up securely; he had brought to
                    him a large wooden barrel, within which he placed it, without anybody's knowing
                    what it was. Everybody thought the proceeding was some act of devotion. He then
                    caused it to be thrown into the sea."<ref n="13" target="HalLife.13">[*]</ref>
                </p>
                <p>The sudden and heavy showers, and the squalls which followed some time
                    afterwards, changed the wind, which turned to the west. They had the wind thus
                    abaft, and he sailed thus during five hours with the foresail only, having
                    always the troubled sea, and made at once two leagues and a half towards the
                    northeast. He had lowered the main topmast lest a wave might carry it away. </p>
                <p>With a heavy wind astern, so that the sea frequently broke over the little Nina,
                    she made eastward rapidly, and at daybreak on the fifteenth they saw land. The
                    Admiral knew that he had made the Azores, he had been steadily directing the
                    course that way; some of the seamen thought <pb n="123"/> they were at Madeira,
                    and some hopeful ones thought they saw the rock of Cintra in Portugal. Columbus
                    did not land till the eighteenth, when he sent some men on shore, upon the
                    island of Santa Maria. His news of discovery was at first received with
                    enthusiasm. </p>
                <p>But there followed a period of disagreeable negotiation with Castaneda, the
                    governor of the Azores. Pretending great courtesy and hospitality, but really
                    acting upon the orders of the king of Portugal, he did his best to disable
                    Columbus and even seized some of his crew and kept them prisoners for some days.
                    When Columbus once had them on board again, he gave up his plans for taking
                    ballast and water on these inhospitable islands, and sailed for Europe. </p>
                <p>He had again a stormy passage. Again they were in imminent danger. "But God was
                    good enough to save him. He caused the crew to draw lots to send to Notre Dame
                    de la Cintra, at the island of Huelva, a pilgrim who should come there in his
                    shirt. The lot fell upon himself. All the crew, including the Admiral, vowed to
                    fast on bread and water on the first Saturday <pb n="124"/> which should come
                    after the arrival of the vessel. He had proceeded sixty miles before the sails
                    were torn; then they went under masts and shrouds on account of the unusual
                    strength of the wind, and the roughness of the sea, which pressed them almost on
                    all sides. They saw indications of the nearness of the land; they were in fact,
                    very near Lisbon." </p>
                <p>At Lisbon, after a reception which was at first cordial, the Portuguese officers
                    showed an inhospitality like that of Castaneda at the Azores. But the king
                    himself showed more dignity and courtesy. He received the storm-tossed Admiral
                    with distinction, and permitted him to refit his shattered vessel with all he
                    needed. Columbus took this occasion to write to his own sovereigns. </p>
                <p>On the thirteenth he sailed again, and on the fifteenth entered the bay and
                    harbor of Palos, which he had left six months and a half before. He had sailed
                    on Friday. He had discovered America on Friday. And on Friday he safely returned
                    to his home. </p>
                <p>His journal of the voyage ends with these words: "I see by this voyage that God
                    has wonderfully <pb n="125"/> proved what I say, as anybody may convince
                    himself, by reading this narrative, by the signal wonders which he has worked
                    during the course of my voyage, and in favor of myself, who have been for so
                    long a time at the court of your Highnesses in opposition and contrary to the
                    opinions of so many distinguished personages of your household, who all opposed
                    me, treating my project as a dream, and my undertaking as a chimera. And I hope
                    still, nevertheless, in our Lord, this voyage will bring the greatest honor to
                    Christianity, although it has been performed with so much ease."</p>

                <head> CHAPTER VII.<lb/>
                    <lb/> COLUMBUS IS CALLED TO MEET THE KING AND QUEEN &mdash; HIS MAGNIFICENT
                    RECEPTION &mdash; NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE POPE AND WITH THE KING OF PORTUGAL
                    &mdash; SECOND EXPEDITION ORDERED &mdash; FONSECA &mdash; THE
                    PREPARATIONS AT CADIZ. </head>

                <p>The letter which Columbus sent from Lisbon to the king and queen was everywhere
                    published. It excited the enthusiasm first of Spain and then of the world. This
                    letter found in the earlier editions is now one of the most choice curiosities
                    of libraries. Well it may be, for it is the first public announcement of the
                    greatest event of modern history. </p>
                <p>Ferdinand and Isabella directed him to wait upon them at once at court. It
                    happened that they were then residing at Barcelona, on the eastern coast of
                    Spain, so that the journey required to fulfill their wishes carried him quite
                    across the kingdom. It was a journey of triumph. The people came together in
                    throngs to meet this peaceful conqueror <pb n="127"/> who brought with him such
                    amazing illustrations of his discovery. </p>
                <p>The letter bearing instructions for him to proceed to Barcelona was addressed "To
                    Don Christopher Columbus, our Admiral of the Ocean Sea, Viceroy and Governor of
                    the islands discovered in the Indies." So far was he now raised above the rank
                    of a poor adventurer, who had for seven years attended the court in its
                    movements, seeking an opportunity to explain his proposals. </p>
                <p>As he approached Barcelona he was met by a large company of people, including
                    many persons of rank. A little procession was formed of the party of the
                    Admiral. Six Indians of the islands who had survived the voyage, led the way.
                    They were painted according to their custom in various colors, and ornamented
                    with the fatal gold of their countries, which had given to the discovery such
                    interest in the eyes of those who looked on. </p>
                <p>Columbus had brought ten Indians away with him, but one had died on the voyage
                    and he had left three sick at Palos. Those whom he brought to Barcelona, were
                    baptized in presence of the king and queen. <pb n="128"/>
                </p>
                <p>After the Indians, were brought many curious objects which had come from the
                    islands, such as stuffed birds and beasts and living paroquets, which perhaps
                    spoke in the language of their own country, and rare plants, so different from
                    those of Spain. Ornaments of gold were displayed, which would give the people
                    some idea of the wealth of the islands. Last of all came Columbus, elegantly
                    mounted and surrounded by a brilliant cavalcade of young Spaniards. The crowd of
                    wondering people pressed around them. Balconies and windows were crowded with
                    women looking on. Even the roofs were crowded with spectators. </p>
                <p>The king and queen awaited Columbus in a large hall, where they were seated on a
                    rich dais covered with gold brocade. It was in the palace known as the "Casa de
                    la Deputacion" which the kings of Aragon made their residence when they were in
                    Barcelona. A body of the most distinguished lords and ladies of Spain were in
                    attendance. As Columbus entered the hall the king and queen arose. He fell on
                    his knee that he might kiss their hands but they bade him rise and then sit and
                    give an account of his voyage. <pb n="129"/>
                </p>
                <p>Columbus spoke with dignity and simplicity which commanded respect, while all
                    listened with sympathy. He showed some of the treasures he had brought, and
                    spoke with certainty of the discoveries which had been made, as only precursors
                    of those yet to come. When his short narrative was ended, all the company knelt
                    and united in chanting the "Te Deum," "We Praise Thee, O God." Las Casas,
                    describing the joy and hope of that occasion says, "it seems as if they had a
                    foretaste of the joys of paradise." </p>
                <p>It would seem as if those whose duty it is to prepare fit celebrations of the
                    periods of the great discovery, could hardly do better than to produce on the
                    twenty-fourth of April, 1893, a reproduction of the solemn pageant in which, in
                    Barcelona, four centuries before, the Spanish court commemorated the great
                    discovery. </p>
                <p>From this time, for several weeks, a series of pageants and festivities
                    surrounded him. At no other period of his life were such honors paid to him. It
                    was at one of the banquets, at which he was present, that the incident of the
                    egg, so often told in connection with the great discovery, took <pb n="130"/>
                    place. A flippant courtier &mdash; of that large class of people who stay at
                    home when great deeds are done, and afterwards depreciate the doers of them
                    &mdash; had the impertinence to ask Columbus, if the adventure so much
                    praised was not, after all, a very simple matter. He probably said "a short
                    voyage of four or five weeks; was it anything more?" Columbus replied by giving
                    him an egg which was on the table, and asking him if he could stand it on one
                    end. He said he could not, and the other guests said that they could not.
                    Columbus tapped it on the table so as to break the end of the shell, and the egg
                    stood erect. "It is easy enough," he said, "when any one has shown you how." </p>
                <p>It is well to remember, that if after years showed that the ruler of Spain
                    wearied in his gratitude, Columbus was, at the time, welcomed with the
                    enthusiasm which he deserved. From the very grains of gold brought home in this
                    first triumph, the queen, Isabella, had the golden illumination wrought of a
                    most beautiful missal-book. </p>
                <p>Distinguished artists decorated the book, and the portraits of sovereigns then on
                    the throne <pb n="131"/> appear as the representations of King David, King
                    Solomon, the Queen of Sheba and other royal personages. This book she gave
                    afterwards to her grandson, Charles V, of whom it has been said that perhaps no
                    man in modern times has done the world more harm. </p>
                <p>This precious book, bearing on its gilded leaves the first fruits of America, is
                    now preserved in the Royal Library at Madrid. </p>
                <p>The time was not occupied merely in shows and banquets. There was no difficulty
                    now, about funds for a second expedition. Directions were given that it might be
                    set forward as quickly as possible, and on an imposing scale. For it was feared
                    at court that King John of Portugal, the successful rival of Spain, thus far, in
                    maritime adventure, might anticipate further discovery. The sovereigns at once
                    sent an embassy to the pope, not simply to announce the discovery, but to obtain
                    from him a decree confirming similar discoveries in the same direction. There
                    was at least one precedent for such action. A former pope had granted to
                    Portugal all the lands it might discover in Africa, south of Cape Bojador, 
                    <pb n="134"/> and the Spanish crown had assented by treaty to this arrangement.
                    Ferdinand and Isabella could now refer to this precedent, in asking for a grant
                    to them of their discoveries on the western side of the Atlantic. The pope now
                    reigning was Alexander II. He had not long filled the papal chair. He was an
                    ambitious and prudent sovereign &mdash; a native of Spain &mdash; and,
                    although he would gladly have pleased the king of Portugal, he was quite
                    unwilling to displease the Spanish sovereigns. The Roman court received with
                    respect the request made to them. The pope expressed his joy at the hopes thrown
                    out for the conversion of the heathen, which the Spanish sovereigns had
                    expressed, as Columbus had always done. And so prompt were the Spanish requests,
                    and so ready the pope's answer, that as early as May 3, 1493, a papal bull was
                    issued to meet the wishes of Spain. </p>
                <p>This bull determined for Spain and for Portugal, that all discoveries made west
                    of a meridian line one hundred leagues west of the Azores should belong to
                    Spain. All discoveries east of that line should belong to Portugal. No <pb
                        n="135"/> reference was made to other maritime powers, and it does not seem
                    to have been supposed that other states had any rights in such matters. The line
                    thus arranged for the two nations was changed by their own agreement, in 1494,
                    for a north and south line three hundred and fifty leagues west of the Cape de
                    Verde Islands. The difference between the two lines was not supposed to be
                    important. </p>
                <p>The decision thus made was long respected. Under a mistaken impression as to the
                    longitude of the Philippine Islands in the East Indies, Spain has held those
                    islands, under this line of division, ever since their discovery by Magellan.
                    She considered herself entitled to all the islands and lands between the
                    meridian thus drawn in the Atlantic and the similar meridian one hundred and
                    eighty degrees away, on exactly the other side of the world. </p>
                <p>Under the same line of division, Portugal held, for three centuries and more,
                    Brazil, which projects so far eastward into the Atlantic as to cross this line
                    of division. </p>
                <p>Fearful, all the time, that neither the pope's decree, nor any diplomacy would
                    prevent the <pb n="136"/> king of Portugal from attempting to seize lands at the
                    west, the Spanish court pressed with eagerness arrangements for a second
                    expedition. It was to be on a large and generous scale and to take out a
                    thousand men. For this was the first plan, though the number afterwards was
                    increased to fifteen hundred. To give efficiency to all the measures of
                    colonization, what we should call a new department of administration was formed,
                    and at the head of it was placed Juan Rodriguez de Fonseca. </p>
                <p>Fonseca held this high and responsible position for thirty years. He early
                    conceived a great dislike of Columbus, who, in some transactions before this
                    expedition sailed, appealed to the sovereigns to set aside a decision of
                    Fonseca's, and succeeded. For all the period while he managed the Indian affairs
                    of Spain, Fonseca kept his own interests in sight more closely than those of
                    Spain or of the colonists; and not Columbus only, but every other official of
                    Spain in the West Indies, had reason to regret the appointment. </p>
                <p>The king of Portugal and the sovereigns of Spain began complicated and suspicious
                    negotiations <pb n="137"/> with each other regarding the new discoveries.
                    Eventually, as has been said, they acceded to the pope's proposal and decree.
                    But, at first, distrusting each other, and concealing their real purposes, in
                    the worst style of the diplomacy of that time, they attempted treaties for the
                    adjustment between themselves of the right to lands not yet discovered by
                    either. Of these negotiations, the important result was that which has been
                    named, &mdash; the change of the meridian of division from that proposed by
                    the pope. It is curious now to see that the king of Portugal proposed a line of
                    division, which would run east and west, so that Spain should have the new
                    territories north of the latitude of the Grand Canary, and Portugal all to the
                    south. </p>
                <p>In the midst of negotiation, the king and queen and Columbus knew that whoever
                    was first on the ground of discovery would have the great advantage. There was a
                    rumor in Spain that Portugal had already sent out vessels to the west.
                    Everything was pressed with alacrity at Cadiz. The expedition was to be under
                    Columbus's absolute command. Seamen of reputation were engaged <pb n="138"/> to
                    serve under him. Seventeen vessels were to take out a colony. Horses as well as
                    cattle and other domestic animals were provided. Seeds and plants of different
                    kinds were sent out, and to this first colonization by Spain, America owes the
                    sugar-cane, and perhaps some other of her tropical productions. </p>
                <p>Columbus remained in Barcelona until the twenty-third of May. But before that
                    time, the important orders for the expedition had been given. He then went to
                    Cadiz himself, and gave his personal attention to the preparations. Applications
                    were eagerly pressed, from all quarters, for permission to go. Young men of high
                    family were eager to try the great adventure. It was necessary to enlarge the
                    number from that at first proposed. The increase of expense, ordered as the
                    plans enlarged, did not please Fonseca. To quarrels between him and Columbus at
                    this time have been referred the persecutions which Columbus afterwards
                    suffered. In this case the king sustained Columbus in all his requisitions, and
                    Fonseca was obliged to answer them. <pb n="139"/>
                </p>
                <p>So rapidly were all these preparations made, that, in a little more than a year
                    from the sailing of the first expedition, the second, on a scale so much larger,
                    was ready for sea.</p>

                <head> CHAPTER VIII.<lb/>
                    <lb/> THE SECOND EXPEDITION SAILS FROM CADIZ AT CANARY ISLANDS &mdash;
                    DISCOVERY OF DOMINICA AND GUADELOUPE &mdash; SKIRMISHES WITH THE CARIBS
                    &mdash; PORTO RICO DISCOVERED &mdash; HISPANIOLA &mdash; THE FATE OF
                    THE COLONY AT LA NAVIDAD. </head>

                <p>There is not in history a sharper contrast, or one more dramatic, than that
                    between the first voyage of Columbus and the second. In the first voyage, three
                    little ships left the port of Palos, most of the men of their crews unwilling,
                    after infinite difficulty in preparation, and in the midst of the fears of all
                    who stayed behind. </p>
                <p>In the second voyage, a magnificent fleet, equipped with all that the royal
                    service could command, crowded with eager adventurers who are excited by
                    expectations of romance and of success, goes on the very same adventure. </p>
                <p>In the first voyage, Columbus has but just turned the corner after the struggles
                    and failures of eight years. He is a penniless adventurer who 
                    <pb n="142"/> staked all his reputation on a scheme in which he has hardly any
                    support. In the second case, Columbus is the governor-general, for aught he
                    knows, of half the world, of all the countries he is to discover; and he knows
                    enough, and all men around him know enough, to see that his domain may be a
                    principality indeed. </p>
                <p>Success brings with it its disadvantages. The world has learned since, if it did
                    not know it then, that one hundred and fifty sailors, used to the hard work and
                    deprivations of a seafaring life, would be a much more efficient force for
                    purposes of discovery, than a thousand and more courtiers who have left the
                    presence of the king and queen in the hope of personal advancement or of
                    romantic adventure. Those dainty people, who would have been soldiers if there
                    were no gunpowder, are not men to found states; and the men who have lived in
                    the ante-chambers of courts are not people who co-operate sympathetically with
                    an experienced man of affairs like Columbus. </p>
                <p>From this time forward this is to be but a sad history, and the sadness, nay, the
                    cruelty of the story, results largely from the composition of the <pb n="143"/>
                    body of men whom Columbus took with him on this occasion. It is no longer
                    coopers and blacksmiths and boatswains and sailmakers who surround him. These
                    were officers of court, whose titles even cannot be translated into modern
                    language, so artificial were their habits and so conventional the duties to
                    which they had been accustomed. Such men it was, who made poor Columbus endless
                    trouble. Such men it was, who, at the last, dragged him down from his noble
                    position, so that he died unhonored, dispirited and poor. To the same
                    misfortune, probably, do we owe it that, for a history of this voyage, we have
                    no longer authority so charming as the simple, gossipy journal which Columbus
                    kept through the first voyage, of which the greater part has happily been
                    preserved. It may be that he was too much pressed by his varied duties to keep
                    up such a journal. For it is alas! an unfortunate condition of human life, that
                    men are most apt to write journals when they have nothing to tell, and that in
                    the midst of high activity, the record of that activity is not made by the
                    actor. In the present case, a certain Doctor Chanca, a native of Seville, had
                        <pb n="144"/> been taken on board Columbus's ship, perhaps with the wish
                    that he should be the historian of the expedition. It may be that in the fact
                    that his journal was sent home is the reason why the Admiral's, if he kept one,
                    has never been preserved. Doctor Chanca's narrative is our principal
                    contemporary account of the voyage. From later authorities much can be added to
                    it, but all of them put together are not, for the purposes of history, equal to
                    the simple contemporaneous statement which we could have had, had Columbus's own
                    journal been preserved. </p>
                <p>The great fleet sailed from Cadiz on the twenty-fifth day of September, in the
                    year 1493, rather more than thirteen months after the sailing of the little
                    fleet from Palos of the year before. They touched at the Grand Canary as before,
                    but at this time their vessels were in good condition and there was no
                    dissatisfaction among the crews. From this time the voyage across the ocean was
                    short. On the third day of November, 11 the Sunday after All Saints Day had
                    dawned, a pilot on the ship cried out to the captain that he saw land. So great
                    was the joy among the people, <pb n="145"/> that it was marvellous to hear the
                    shouts of pleasure on all hands. And for this there was much reason because the
                    people were so much fatigued by the hard life and by the water which they drank
                    that they all hoped for land with much desire." </p>
                <p>The reader will see that this is the ejaculation of a tired landsman; one might
                    say, of a tired scholar, who was glad that even the short voyage was at an end.
                    Some of the pilots supposed that the distance which they had run was eight
                    hundred leagues from Ferro; others thought it was seven hundred and eighty. As
                    the light increased, there were two islands in sight the first was mountainous,
                    being the island of "Dominica," which still retains that name, of the Sunday
                    when it was discovered; the other, the island of Maria Galante, is more level,
                    but like the first, as it is described by Dr. Chanca, it was well wooded. The
                    island received its name from the ship that Columbus commanded. In all, they
                    discovered six islands on this day. </p>
                <p>Finding no harbor which satisfied him in Dominica, Columbus landed on the island
                    of Maria 
                    <pb n="147"/> Galante, and took possession of it in the name of the king and
                    queen. Dr. Chanca expresses the amazement which everyone had felt on the other
                    voyage, at the immense variety of trees, of fruits and of flowers, which to this
                    hour is the joy of the traveller in the West Indies. </p>
                <p>"In this island was such thickness of forest that it was wonderful, and such a
                    variety of trees, unknown to anyone, that it was terrible, some with fruit, some
                    with flowers, so that everything was green. * * * There were wild fruits of
                    different sorts, which some not very wise men tried, and, on merely tasting
                    them, touching them with their tongues, their faces swelled and they had such
                    great burning and pain that they seemed to rage (or to have hydrophobia). They
                    were cured with cold things." This fruit is supposed to have been the
                    manchireel, which is known to produce such effects. </p>
                <p>They found no inhabitants on this island and went on to another, now called
                    Guadeloupe. It received this name from its resemblance to a province of the same
                    name in Spain. They drew near a mountain upon it which "seemed to be <pb n="148"
                    /> trying to reach the sky," upon which was a beautiful waterfall, so white with
                    foam that at a distance some of the sailors thought it was not water, but white
                    rocks. The Admiral sent a light caravel to coast along and find harbor. This
                    vessel discovered some houses, and the captain went ashore and found the
                    inhabitants in them. They fled at once, and he entered the houses. There he
                    found that they had taken nothing away. There was much cotton, "spun and to be
                    spun," and other goods of theirs, and he took a little of everything, among
                    other things, two parrots, larger and different from what had been seen before.
                    He also took four or five bones of the legs and arms of men. This last discovery
                    made the Spaniards suppose that these islands were those of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Caribs</hi>, inhabited by the cannibals of whom they had heard in the first
                    voyage. </p>
                <p>They went on along the coast, passing by some little villages, from which the
                    inhabitants fled, "as soon as they saw the sails." The Admiral decided to send
                    ashore to make investigations, and next morning "certain captains" landed. At
                    dinnertime some of them returned, bringing with them <pb n="149"/> a boy of
                    fourteen, who said that he was one of the captives of the people of the island.
                    The others divided, and one party "took a little boy and brought him on board."
                    Another party took a number of women, some of them natives of the island, and
                    others captives, who came of their own accord. One captain, Diego Marquez, with
                    his men, went off from the others and lost his way with his party. After four
                    days he came out on the coast, and by following that, he succeeded in coming to
                    the fleet. Their friends supposed them to have been killed and eaten by the
                    Caribs, as, since some of them were pilots and able to set their course by the
                    pole-star, it seemed impossible that they should lose themselves. </p>
                <p>During the first day Columbus spent here, many men and women came to the water's
                    edge, "looking at the fleet and wondering at such a new thing; and when any boat
                    came ashore to talk with them, saying, `tayno, tayno,' which means <hi
                        rend="italic">good</hi>. But they were all ready to run when they seemed in
                    danger, so that of the men only two could be taken by force or free-will. There
                    were taken more than twenty women of <pb n="150"/> the captives, and of their
                    free-will came other women, born in other islands, who were stolen away and
                    taken by force. Certain captive boys came to us. In this harbor we were eight
                    days on account of the loss of the said captain." </p>
                <p>They found great quantities of human bones on shore, and skulls hanging like pots
                    or cups about the houses. They saw few men. The women said that this was because
                    ten canoes had gone on a robbing or kidnapping expedition to other islands.
                    "This people," says Doctor Chanca, "appeared to us more polite than those who
                    live in the other islands we have seen, though they all have straw houses." But
                    he goes on to say that these houses are better made and provided, and that more
                    of both men's and women's work appeared in them. They had not only plenty of
                    spun and unspun cotton, but many cotton mantles, "so well woven that they yield
                    in nothing (or owe nothing) to those of our country." </p>
                <p>When the women, who had been found captives, were asked who the people of the
                    island were, they replied that they were Caribs. When they heard that we
                    abhorred such people for their <pb n="151"/> evil use of eating men's flesh,
                    they rejoiced much." But even in the captivity which all shared, they showed
                    fear of their old masters. </p>
                <p>"The customs of this people, the Caribs," says Dr. Chanca, "are beastly;" and it
                    would be difficult not to agree with him, in spite of the "politeness" and
                    comparative civilization he has spoken of. </p>
                <p>They occupied three islands, and lived in harmony with each other, but made war
                    in their canoes on all the other islands in the neighborhood. They used arrows
                    in warfare, but had no iron. Some of them used arrow-heads of tortoise shell,
                    others sharply toothed fish-bones, which could do a good deal of damage among
                    unarmed men. "But for people of our nation, they are not arms to be feared
                    much." </p>
                <p>These Caribs carried off both men and women on their robbing expeditions. They
                    slaughtered and ate the men, and kept the women as slaves; they were, in short,
                    incredibly cruel. Three of the captive boys ran away and joined the Spaniards. </p>
                <p>They had twice sent out expeditions after the lost captain, Diego Marquez, and
                    another party <pb n="152"/> had returned without news of him, on the very day on
                    which he and his men came in. They brought with them ten captives, boys and
                    women. They were received with great joy. "He and those that were with him,
                    arrived so <hi rend="italic">destroyed by the mountain</hi>, that it was pitiful
                    to see them. When they were asked how they had lost themselves, they said that
                    it was the thickness of the trees, so great that they could not see the sky, and
                    that some of them, who were mariners, had climbed up the trees to look at the
                    star (the Pole-star) and that they never could see it." </p>
                <p>One of the accounts of this voyage<ref n="14" target="HalLife.14">[*]</ref>
                    relates that the captive women, who had taken refuge with the Spaniards, were
                    persuaded by them to entice some of the Caribs to the beach. "But these men,
                    when they had seen our people, all struck by terror, or the consciousness of
                    their evil deeds, looking at each other, suddenly drew together, and very
                    lightly, like a flight of birds, fled away to the valleys of the woods. Our men
                    then, not having succeeded in taking any cannibals, retired to the ships and
                    broke the Indians' canoes." <pb n="153"/>
                </p>
                <p>They left Guadeloupe on Sunday, the tenth of November. They passed several
                    islands, but stopped at none of them, as they were in haste to arrive at the
                    settlement of La Navidad in Hispaniola, made on the first voyage. They did,
                    however, make some stay at an island which seemed well populated. This was that
                    of San Martin. The Admiral sent a boat ashore to ask what people lived on the
                    island, and to ask his way, although, as he afterwards found, his own
                    calculations were so correct that he did not need any help. The boat's crew took
                    some captives, and as it was going back to the ships, a canoe came up in which
                    were four men, two women and a boy. They were so astonished at seeing the fleet,
                    that they remained, wondering what it could be, "two Lombard-shot from the
                    ship," and did not see the boat till it was close to them. They now tried to get
                    off, but were so pressed by the boat that they could not. "The Caribs, as soon
                    as they saw that flight did not profit them, with much boldness laid hands on
                    their bows, the women as well as the men. And I say with much boldness, because
                    they were no more than four men and two women, <pb n="154"/> and ours more than
                    twenty-five, of whom they wounded two. To one they gave two arrow-shots in the
                    breast, and to the other one in the ribs. And if we had not had shields and
                    tablachutas, and had not come up quickly with the boat and overturned their
                    canoe, they would have shot the most of our men with their arrows. And after
                    their canoe was overturned, they remained in the water swimming, and at times
                    getting foothold, for there were some shallow places there. And our men had much
                    ado to take them, for they still kept on shooting as they could. And with all
                    this, not one of them could be taken, except one badly wounded with a
                    lance-thrust, who died, whom thus wounded they carried to the ships." </p>
                <p>Another account of this fight says that the canoe was commanded by one of the
                    women, who seemed to be a queen, who had a son "of cruel look, robust, with a
                    lion's face, who followed her." This account represents the queen's son to have
                    been wounded, as well as the man who died. "The Caribs differed from the other
                    Indians in having long hair; the others wore theirs braided <pb n="155"/> and a
                    hundred thousand differences made in their heads, with crosses and other
                    paintings of different sorts, each one as he desires, which they do with sharp
                    canes." The Indians, both the Caribs and the others, were beardless, unless by a
                    great exception. The Caribs, who had been taken prisoners here, had their eyes
                    and eyebrows blackened, "which, it seems to me, they do as an ornament, and with
                    that they appear more frightful." They heard from these prisoners of much gold
                    at an island called <hi rend="italic">Cayre</hi>. </p>
                <p>They left San Martin on the same day, and passed the island of Santa Cruz, and
                    the next day (November 15) they saw a great number of islands, which the Admiral
                    named Santa Ursula and the Eleven Thousand Virgins. This seemed "a country fit
                    for metals," but the fleet made no stay there. They did stop for two days at an
                    island called <hi rend="italic">Burenquen</hi>. The Admiral named it San Juan
                    Bautista (Saint John Baptist). It is what we now call Porto Rico. He was not
                    able to communicate with any of the inhabitants, as they lived in such fear of
                    the Caribs that they all fled. All these islands were new to the Admiral <pb
                        n="156"/> and all "very beautiful and of very good land, but this one seemed
                    better than all of them." </p>
                <p>On Friday, the twenty-second of November, they landed at the island of Hispaniola
                    or Hayti which they so much desired. None of the party who had made the first
                    voyage were acquainted with this part of the island; but they conjectured what
                    it was, from what the Indian captive women told them. </p>
                <p>The part of the island where they arrived was called Hayti, another part Xamana,
                    and the third Bohio. "It is a very singular country," says Dr. Chanca, "where
                    there are numberless great rivers and great mountain ridges and great level
                    valleys. I think the grass never dries in the whole year. I do not think that
                    there is any winter in this (island) nor in the others, for at Christmas are
                    found many birds' nests, some with birds, and some with eggs." The only
                    four-footed animals found in these islands were what Dr. Chanca calls dogs of
                    various colors, and one animal like a young rabbit, which climbed trees. Many
                    persons ate these last and said they were very good. There were many small
                    snakes, and few lizards, because the Indians <pb n="157"/> were so fond of
                    eating them. "They made as much of a feast of them as we would do of pheasants." </p>
                <p>"There are in this island and the others numberless birds, of those of our
                    country, and many others which never were seen there. Of our domestic birds,
                    none have ever been seen here, except that in Zuruquia there were some ducks in
                    the houses, most of them white as snow, and others black." </p>
                <p>They coasted along this island for several days, to the place where the Admiral
                    had left his settlement. While passing the region of Xamana, they set ashore one
                    of the Indians whom they had carried off on the first voyage. They "gave him
                    some little things which the Admiral had commanded him to give away." Another
                    account adds that of the ten Indian men who had been carried off on the first
                    voyage, seven had already died on account of the change of air and food. Two of
                    the three whom the Admiral was bringing back, swam ashore at night. "The Admiral
                    cared for this but little, thinking that he should have enough interpreters
                    among those <pb n="158"/> whom he had left in the island, and whom he hoped to
                    find there again." It seems certain that one Indian remained faithful to the
                    Spaniards; he was named Diego Colon, after the Admiral's brother. </p>
                <p>On the day that the captive Indian was set ashore, a Biscayan sailor died, who
                    had been wounded by the Caribs in the fight between the boat's crew and the
                    canoe. A boat's crew was sent ashore to bury him, and as they came to land there
                    came out "many Indians, of whom some wore gold at the neck and at the ears. They
                    sought to come with the christians to the ships, and they did not like to bring
                    them, because they had not had permission from the Admiral." The Indians then
                    sent two of their number in a little canoe to one of the caravels, where they
                    were received kindly, and sent to speak with the Admiral." </p>
                <p>"They said, through an interpreter, that a certain king sent them to know what
                    people we were, and to ask that we might be kind enough to land, as they had
                    much gold and would give it to him, and of what they had to eat. The Admiral <pb
                        n="159"/> commanded silken shirts and caps and other little things to be
                    given them, and told them that as he was going where Guacanagari was, he could
                    not stop, that another time he would be able to see him. And with that, they
                    (the Indians) went away." </p>
                <p>They stopped two days at a harbor which they called Monte Christi, to see if it
                    were a suitable place for a town, for the Admiral did not feel altogether
                    satisfied with the place where the settlement of La Navidad had been made on the
                    first voyage. This Monte Christi was near "a great river of very good water"
                    (the Santiago). But it is all an inundated region, and very unfit to live in. </p>
                <p>"As they were going along, viewing the river and land, some of our men found, in
                    a place close by the river, two dead men, one with: a cord (lazo) around his
                    neck, and the other with one around his foot. This was the first day. On the
                    next day following, they found two other dead men farther on than these others.
                    One of these was in such a position that it could be known that he had a
                    plentiful beard. Some of our men suspected <pb n="160"/> more ill than good, and
                    with reason, as the Indians are all beardless, as I have said." </p>
                <p>This port was not far from the port where the Spanish settlement had been made on
                    the first voyage, so that there was great reason for these anxieties. They set
                    sail once more for the settlement, and arrived opposite the harbor of La Navidad
                    on the twenty-seventh of November. As they were approaching the harbor, a canoe
                    came towards them, with five or six Indians on board, but, as the Admiral kept
                    on his course without waiting for them, they went back. </p>
                <p>The Spaniards arrived outside the port of La Navidad so late that they did not
                    dare to enter it that night. "The Admiral commanded two Lombards to be fired, to
                    see if the christians replied, who had been left with the said Guacanagari,
                    (this was the friendly cacique Guacanagari of the first voyage), for they too
                    had Lombards," "They never replied, nor did fires nor signs of houses appear in
                    that place, at which the people were much discouraged, and they had the
                    suspicion that was natural in such a case." </p>
                <p>"Being thus all very sad, when four or five <pb n="161"/> hours of the night had
                    passed, there came the same canoe which they had seen the evening before. The
                    Indians in it asked for the Admiral and the captain of one of the caravels of
                    the first voyage. They were taken to the Admiral's ship, but would not come on
                    board until they had "spoken with him and seen him." They asked for a light, and
                    as soon as they knew him, they entered the ship. They came from Guacanagari, and
                    one of them was his cousin. </p>
                <p>They brought with them golden masks, one for the Admiral and another for one of
                    the captains who had been with him on the first voyage, probably Vicente Yanez
                    Pinzon. Such masks were much valued among the Indians, and are thought to have
                    been meant to put upon idols, so that they were given to the Spaniards as tokens
                    of great respect. The Indian party remained on board for three hours, conversing
                    with the Admiral and apparently very glad to see him again. When they were asked
                    about the colonists of La Navidad, they said that they were all well, but that
                    some of them had died from sickness, and that others had been killed in quarrels
                    among themselves. Their <pb n="162"/> own cacique, Guacanagari, had been
                    attacked by two other chiefs, Caonab&oacute; and Mayreni. They had burned
                    his village, and he had been wounded in the leg, so that he could not come to
                    meet the Spaniards that night. As the Indians went away, however, they promised
                    that they would bring him to visit them the next day. So the explorers remained
                    "consoled for that night." </p>
                <p>Next day, however, events were less reassuring. None of last night's party came
                    back and nothing was seen of the cacique. The Spaniards, however, thought that
                    the Indians might have been accidentally overturned in their canoe, as it was a
                    small one, and as wine had been given them several times during their visit. </p>
                <p>While he was still waiting for them, the Admiral sent some of his men to the
                    place where La Navidad had stood. They found that the strong fort with a
                    palisade was burned down and demolished. They also found some cloaks and other
                    clothes which had been carried off by the Indians, who seemed uneasy, and at
                    first would not come near the party. </p>
                <p>"This did not appear well" to the Spaniards, <pb n="163"/> as the Admiral had
                    told them how many canoes had come out to visit him in that very place on the
                    other voyage. They tried to make friends, however, threw out to them some bells,
                    beads and other presents, and finally a relation of the cacique and three others
                    ventured to the boat, and were taken on board ship. </p>
                <p>These men frankly admitted that the "christians" were all dead. The Spaniards had
                    been told so the night before by their Indian interpreter, but they had refused
                    to believe him. They were now told that the King of Canoaboa<ref n="15"
                        target="HalLife.15">[*]</ref> and the King Mayreni had killed them and
                    burned the village. </p>
                <p>They said, as the others had done, that Guacanagari was wounded in the thigh and
                    they, like the others, said they would go and summon him. The Spaniards made
                    them some presents, and they, too, disappeared. </p>
                <p>Early the next morning the Admiral himself, with a party, including Dr. Chanca,
                    went ashore. </p>
                <p>"And we went where the town used to be, which we saw all burnt, and the clothes
                    of <pb n="164"/> the christians were found on the grass there. At that time we
                    saw no dead body. There were among us many different opinions, some suspecting
                    that Guacanagari himself was (concerned) in the betrayal or death of the
                    christians, and to others it did not appear so, as his town was burnt, so that
                    the thing was very doubtful." </p>
                <p>The Admiral directed the whole place to be searched for gold, as he had left
                    orders that if any quantity of it were found, it should be buried. While this
                    search was being made, he and a few others went to look for a suitable place for
                    a new settlement. They arrived at a village of seven or eight houses, which the
                    inhabitants deserted at once. Here they found many things belonging to the
                    christians, such as stockings, pieces of cloth, and "a very pretty mantle which
                    had not been unfolded since it was brought from Castile." These, the Spaniards
                    thought, could not have been obtained by barter. There was also one of the
                    anchors of the ship which had gone ashore on the first voyage. </p>
                <p>When they returned to the site of La Navidad they found many Indians, who had <pb
                        n="165"/> become bold enough to come to barter gold. They had shown the
                    place where the bodies of eleven Spaniards lay "covered already by the grass
                    which had grown over them." They all "with one voice" said that Canoaboa and
                    Mayreni had killed them. But as, at the same time, they complained that some of
                    the christians had taken three Indian wives, and some four, it seemed likely
                    that a just resentment on the part of the islanders had had something to do with
                    their death. </p>
                <p>The next day the Admiral sent out a caravel to seek for a suitable place for a
                    town, and he himself went out to look for one in a different direction. He found
                    a secure harbor and a good place for a settlement, But he thought it too far
                    from the place where he expected to find a gold mine. On his return, he found
                    the caravel he had sent out. As it was coasting along the island, a canoe had
                    come out to it, with two Indians on board, one of whom was a brother of
                    Guacanagari. This man begged the party to come and visit the cacique. The
                    "principal men" accordingly went on shore, and found him <pb n="166"/> in bed,
                    apparently suffering from his wounded thigh, which he showed them in bandages.
                    They judged from appearances that he was telling them the truth. </p>
                <p>He said to them, "by signs as best be could," that since he was thus wounded,
                    they were to invite the Admiral to come to visit him. As they were going away,
                    he gave each of them a golden jewel, as each "appeared to him to deserve it."
                    "This gold," says Dr. Chanca, "is made in very delicate sheets, like our gold
                    leaf, because they use it for making masks and to plate upon bitumen. They also
                    wear it on the head and for earrings and nose-rings, and therefore they beat it
                    very thin as they only wear it for its beauty and not for its value." </p>
                <p>The Admiral decided to go to the cacique on the next day. He was visited early in
                    the day by his brother, who hurried on the visit. </p>
                <p>The Admiral went on shore and all the best people (gente de pro) with him,
                    handsomely dressed, as would be suitable in a capital city." They carried
                    presents. with them, as they had already received gold from him. <pb n="167"/>
                </p>
                <p>"When we arrived, we found him lying in his bed, according to their custom,
                    hanging in the air, the bed being made of cotton like a net. He did not rise,
                    but from the bed made a semblance of courtesy, as best he knew how. He showed
                    much feeling, with tears in his eyes, at the death of the christians, and began
                    to talk of it, showing, as best he could, how some died of sickness, and how
                    others had gone to Canoaboa to seek for the gold mine, and that they had been
                    killed there, and how the others had been killed in their town." </p>
                <p>He presented to the Admiral some gold and precious stones. One of the accounts
                    says that there were eight hundred beads of a stone called ciba, one hundred of
                    gold, a golden coronet, and three small calabashes filled with gold dust.
                    Columbus, in return, made him a present. </p>
                <p>"I and a navy surgeon were there," says Dr. Chanca. "The Admiral now said that we
                    were learned in the infirmities of men, and asked if he would show us the wound.
                    He replied that it pleased him to do so. I said that it would be necessary, if
                    he could, for him to go out of the <pb n="168"/> house, since with the
                    multitudes of people it was dark, and we could not see well. He did it
                    immediately, as I believe, more from timidity than from choice. The surgeon came
                    to him and began to take off the bandage. Then he said to the Admiral that the
                    injury was caused by <hi rend="italic">ciba</hi>, that is, by a stone. When it
                    was unbandaged we managed to examine it. It is certain that he was no more
                    injured in that leg than in the other, although he pretended that it was very
                    painful." </p>
                <p>The Spaniards did not know what to believe. But it seemed certain that an attack
                    of some enemy upon these Indians had taken place, and the Admiral determined to
                    continue upon good terms with them. Nor did he change this policy toward
                    Guacanagari. How far that chief had tried to prevent the massacre will never be
                    known. The detail of the story was never fully drawn from the natives. The
                    Spaniards had been cruel and licentious in their dealing with the Indians. They
                    had quarrelled among themselves, and the indignant natives, in revenge, had
                    destroyed them all.</p>

                <p>Columbus had hoped, with reason, to send back a part of the vessels which made up
                    his large squadron, with gold collected in the year by the colonists at La
                    Navidad. In truth, when, in 1501, the system of gold-washing-had been developed,
                    the colony yielded twelve hundred pounds of gold in one year. The search for
                    gold, from the beginning, broke up all intelligent plans for geographical
                    discovery or for colonization. In this case, it was almost too clear that there
                    was nothing but bad news to send back to Spain. Columbus went forward, however,
                    as well as he <pb n="170"/> could, with the establishment of a new colony, and
                    with the search for gold. </p>
                <p>He sent out expeditions of discovery to open relations with the natives, and to
                    find the best places for washing and mining for gold. Melchior Meldonado
                    commanded three hundred men, in the first of these expeditions. They came to a
                    good harbor at the mouth of a river, where they saw a fine house, which they
                    supposed might be the home of Guacanagari. They met an armed party of one
                    hundred Indians; but these men put away their weapons when signals of peace were
                    made, and brought presents in token of good-will. </p>
                <p>The house to which they went was round, with a hemispherical roof or dome. It was
                    thirty-two paces in diameter, divided by wicker work into different rooms.
                    Smaller houses, for persons of rank lower than the chiefs, surrounded it. The
                    natives told the explorers that Guacanagari himself had retired to the hills. </p>
                <p>On receiving the report of these explorers Columbus sent out Ojeda with a hundred
                    men, and Corvalan with a similar party in different 
                    <pb n="172"/> directions. These officers, in their report, described the
                    operation of gold-washing, much as it is known to explorers in mining regions
                    to-day. The natives made a deep ditch into which the gold bearing sand should
                    settle. For more important work they had flat baskets in which they shook the
                    sand and parted it from the gold. With the left hand they dipped up sand,
                    handled this skilfully or "dextrously" with the right hand, so that in a few
                    minutes they could give grains of gold to the gratified explorers. Ojeda brought
                    home to Columbus one nugget which weighed nine ounces. </p>
                <p>They also brought tidings of the King of Canoaboa, of whom they had heard before,
                    and he is called by the name of Caunebo himself.[*] He was afterwards carried,
                    as a prisoner or as a hostage, on the way to Spain; but died on the passage. [*]
                    The name is spelled in many different ways. </p>
                <p>Columbus was able to dispatch the returning ships, with the encouraging reports
                    brought in by Meldonado and Ojeda, but with very little gold. But he was obliged
                    to ask for fresh <pb n="173"/> supplies of food for the colony &mdash; even
                    in the midst of the plenty which he described; for he had found already what all
                    such leaders find, the difficulty of training men to use food to which they were
                    not accustomed. He sent also his Carib prisoners, begging that they might be
                    trained to a knowledge of the christian religion and of the Spanish language. He
                    saw, already, how much he should need interpreters. The fleet sailed on the
                    second of February, and its reports were, on the whole, favorably received. </p>
                <p>Columbus chose for the new city an elevation, ten leagues east of Monte Christi,
                    and at first gave to his colony the name of Martha. It is the Isabella of the
                    subsequent history. </p>
                <p>The colonists were delighted with the fertility of the soil under the tropical
                    climate. Andalusia itself had not prepared them for it. They planted seeds of
                    peas, beans, lettuces, cabbages and other vegetables, and declared that they
                    grew more in eight days than they would have grown in twenty at home. They had
                    fresh vegetables in sixteen days after they planted them; but for melons, <pb
                        n="174"/> pumpkins and other fruits of that sort, they are generous enough
                    to allow thirty days. </p>
                <p>They had carried out roots and suckers of the sugar-cane. In fifteen days the
                    shoots were a cubit high. A farmer who had planted wheat in the beginning of
                    February had ripe grain in the beginning of April; so that they were sure of, at
                    least, two crops in a year. </p>
                <p>But the fertility of the soil was the only favorable token which the island first
                    exhibited. The climate was enervating and sickly. The labor on the new city was
                    hard and discouraging. Columbus found that his colonists were badly fitted for
                    their duty, or not fitted for it at all. Court gentlemen did not want to work.
                    Priests expected to be put on better diet than any other people. Columbus
                    &mdash; though he lost his own popularity &mdash; insisted on putting
                    all on equal fare, in sharing the supplies he had brought from Spain. It did not
                    require a long time to prove that the selection of the site of the colony was
                    unfortunate. Columbus himself gave way to the general disease. While he was ill,
                    a mutiny broke out which he had to suppress by strong measures. <pb n="175"/>
                </p>
                <p>Bornal Diaz, who ranked as comptroller of the expedition, and Fermin Cedo, an
                    assayer, made a plot for seizing the remaining ships and sailing for Europe.
                    News of the mutiny was brought to Columbus. He found a document in the writing
                    of Diaz, drawn as a memorial, accusing Columbus himself of grave crimes. He
                    confined Diaz on board a ship to be sent to Spain with the memorial. He punished
                    the mutineers of lower rank. He took the guns and naval munitions from four of
                    the vessels, and entrusted them all to a person in whom he had absolute
                    confidence. </p>
                <p>On the report of the exploring parties, four names were given to as many
                    divisions of the island. Junna was the most western, Attibunia the most eastern,
                    Jachen the northern and Naiba the southern. Columbus himself, seeing the
                    fortifications of the city well begun, undertook, in March, an exploration, of
                    the island, with a force of five hundred men. </p>
                <p>It was in the course of this exploration that one of the natives brought in a
                    gold-bearing stone which weighed an ounce. He was satisfied with a little bell
                    in exchange. He was surprised at the <pb n="176"/> wonder expressed by the
                    Spaniards, and showing a stone as large as a pomegranate, he said that he had
                    nuggets of gold as large as this at his home. Other Indians brought in
                    gold-bearing stones which weighed more than an ounce. At their homes, also, but
                    not in sight, alas, was a block of gold as large as an infant's head. </p>
                <p>Columbus himself thought it best to take as many men as he could into the
                    mountain region. He left the new city under the care of his brother, Diego, and
                    with all the force of healthy men which he could muster, making a little army of
                    nearly five hundred men, he marched away from the sickly seaboard into the
                    interior. The simple natives were astonished by the display of cavalry and other
                    men in armor. After a few days of a delightful march, in the beauty of spring in
                    that country, he entered upon the long sought Cibao. He relinquished his first
                    idea of founding another city here, but did build a fortress called St. Thomas,
                    in joking reference to Cedo and others, who had asserted that these regions
                    produced no gold. While building this fortress, as it was proudly <pb n="177"/>
                    called, he sent a young cavalier named Luxan for further exploration. </p>
                <p>Luxan returned with stories even greater than they had heard of before, but with
                    no gold, "because he had no orders to do so." He had found ripe grapes. And at
                    last they had found a region called <hi rend="italic">Cipangi, cipan</hi>
                    signifying stone. This name recalled the memory of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cipango</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Japan</hi>. With tidings as encouraging as
                    this, Columbus returned to his city. He appointed his brother and Pedro
                    Margarita governors of the city, and left with three ships for the further
                    exploration of Cuba, which he had left only partly examined in his first voyage.
                    He believed that it was the mainland of Asia. And as has been said, such was his
                    belief till he died, and that of his countrymen. Cuba was not known to be an
                    island for many years afterwards. He was now again in the career which pleased
                    him, and for which he was fitted. He was always ill at ease in administering a
                    colony, or ruling the men who were engaged in it. He was happy and contented
                    when he was discovering. He had been eager to follow the southern coast of Cuba,
                    as he had <pb n="178"/> followed the north in his first voyage. And now he had
                    his opportunity. Having commissioned his brother Diego and Margarita and
                    appointed also a council of four other gentlemen, he sailed to explore new
                    coasts, on the twenty-fourth of April. </p>
                <p>He was soon tempted from his western course that he might examine Jamaica, of
                    which he saw the distant lines on the south. "This island," says the account of
                    the time, "is larger than Sicily. It has only one mountain, which rises from the
                    coast on every side, little by little, until you come to the middle of the
                    island and the ascent is so gradual that, whether you rise or descend, you
                    hardly know whether you are rising or descending." Columbus found the island
                    well peopled, and from what he saw of the natives, thought them more ingenious,
                    and better artificers, than any Indians he had seen before. But when he proposed
                    to land, they generally showed themselves prepared to resist him. He therefore
                    deferred a full examination of the island to his return, and, with the first
                    favorable wind, pressed on toward the southern coast of Cuba. He insisted on
                    calling <pb n="179"/> this the "Golden Chersonesus" of the East. This name had
                    been given by the old geographers to the peninsula now known as Malacca. </p>
                <p>Crossing the narrow channel between Jamaica and Cuba, he began coasting that
                    island westward. If the reader will examine the map, he will find many small
                    keys and islands south of Cuba, which, before any survey had been made,
                    seriously retarded his westward course. In every case he was obliged to make a
                    separate examination to be sure where the real coast of the island was, all the
                    time believing it was the continent of Asia. One of the narratives says, with a
                    pardonable exaggeration, that in all this voyage he thus discovered seven
                    hundred islands. His own estimate was that he sailed two hundred and twenty-two
                    leagues westward in the exploration which now engaged him. </p>
                <p>The month of May and the beginning of June were occupied with such explorations.
                    The natives proved friendly, as the natives of the northern side of Cuba had
                    proved two years before. They had, in general, heard of the visit of the
                    Spaniards ; but their wonder and admiration <pb n="180"/> seem to have been none
                    the less now that they saw the reality. </p>
                <p>On one occasion the hopes of all the party, that they should find themselves at
                    the court of the Grand Khan, were greatly quickened. A Spaniard had gone into a
                    forest alone, hunting. Suddenly he saw a man clothed in white, or thought he
                    did, whom he supposed to be a friar of the order of Saint Mary de Mercedes, who
                    was with the expedition. But, almost immediately, ten other friars dressed in
                    the same costume, appeared, and then as many as thirty. The Spaniard was
                    frightened at the multiplication of their number, it hardly appears why, as they
                    were all men of peace, or should have been, whatever their number. He called out
                    to his companions, and bade them escape. But the men in white called out to him,
                    and waved their hands, as if to assure him that there was no danger. He did not
                    trust them, however, but rushed back to the shore and the ship, as fast as he
                    could, to report what he had seen to the Admiral. </p>
                <p>Here, at last, was reason for hope that they had <pb n="181"/> found one of the
                    Asiatic missions of the Church. Columbus at once landed a party, instructing
                    them to go forty miles inland, if necessary, to find people. But this party
                    found neither path nor roadway, although the country was rich and fertile.
                    Another party brought back rich bunches of grapes, and other native fruits. But
                    neither party saw any friars of the order of Saint Mary. And it is now supposed
                    that the Spaniard saw a peaceful flock of white cranes. The traveller Humboldt
                    describes one occasion, in which the town of Angostura was put to alarm by the
                    appearance of a flock of cranes known as <hi rend="italic">soldados</hi>, or
                    "soldiers," which were, as people supposed, a band of Indians. </p>
                <p>In his interviews with the natives at one point and another, upon the coast,
                    Columbus was delighted with their simplicity, their hospitality, and their
                    kindly dealing with each other. On one occasion, when the Mass was celebrated, a
                    large number of them were present, and joined in the service, as well as they
                    could, with respect and devotion. An old man as much as eighty years old, as the
                    Spaniards thought, brought to the <pb n="182"/> Admiral a basket full of fruit,
                    as a present. Then he said, by an interpreter: </p>
                <p>"We have heard how you have enveloped, by your power, all these countries, and
                    how much afraid of you the people have been. But I have to exhort you, and to
                    tell you that there are two ways when men leave this body. One is dark and
                    dismal; it is for those who have injured the race of men. The other is
                    delightful and pleasant; it is for those who, while alive, have loved peace and
                    the repose of mankind. If, then, you remember that you are mortal, and what
                    these retributions are, you will do no harm to any one." </p>
                <p>Columbus told him in reply that he had known of the two roads after death, and
                    that he was well pleased to find that the natives of these lands knew of them;
                    for he had not expected this. He said that the king and queen of Spain had sent
                    him with the express mission of bringing these tidings to them. In particular,
                    that he was charged with the duty of punishing the Caribs and all other men of
                    impure life, and of rewarding and honoring all pure and innocent men. This
                    statement so delighted the old prophet that he was eager to <pb n="183"/>
                    accompany Columbus on a mission so noble, and it was only by the urgent entreaty
                    of his wife and children that he stayed with them. He found it hard to believe
                    that Columbus was inferior in rank or command to any other sovereign. </p>
                <p>The beauty of the island and the hospitality of the natives, however, were not
                    enough to dispose the crews to continue this exploration further. They were all
                    convinced that they were on the coast of Asia. Columbus did not mean that
                    afterwards any one should accuse him of abandoning the discovery of that coast
                    too soon. Calling to their attention the distance they had sailed, he sent round
                    a written declaration for the signature of every person on the ships. Every man
                    and boy put his name to it. It expressed their certainty that they were on the
                    cape which made the end of the eastern Indies, and that any one who chose could
                    proceed thence westward to Spain by land. This extraordinary declaration was
                    attested officially by a notary, and still exists. </p>
                <p>It was executed in a bay at the extreme southwestern corner of Cuba. It has been
                    remarked by Munoz, that at that moment, in that place, a <pb n="184"/> ship boy
                    at the masthead could have looked over the group of low islands and seen the
                    open sea, which would have shown that Cuba was an island. </p>
                <p>The facts, which were controlling, were these, that the vessels were leaky and
                    the crews sick and discontented. On the thirteenth of June, Columbus stood to
                    the southeast. He discovered the island now known as the Island of Pines. He
                    called it Evangelista. He anchored here and took in water. In an interview, not
                    unlike that described, in which the old Cuban expressed his desire to return
                    with Columbus, it is said that an Evangelistan chief made the same offer, but
                    was withheld by the remonstrances, of his wife and children. A similar incident
                    is reported in the visit to Jamaica, which soon followed. Columbus made a
                    careful examination of that island. Then he crossed to Hispaniola, where, from
                    the Indians, he received such accounts from the new town of Isabella as assured
                    him that all was well there. </p>
                <p>With his own indomitable zeal, he determined now to go to the Carib islands and
                    administer to them the vengeance he had ready. But his own frame was not strong
                    enough for his will. He <pb n="185"/> sank exhausted, in a sort of lethargy. The
                    officers of his ship, supposing he was dying, put about the vessels and the
                    little squadron arrived, none too soon as it proved, at Isabella. </p>
                <p>He was as resolute as ever in his determination to crush the Caribs, and prevent
                    their incursions upon those innocent islanders to whom he had made so many
                    promises of protection. But he fell ill, and for a short time at least was
                    wholly unconscious. The officers in command took occasion of his illness, and of
                    their right to manage the vessels, to turn back to the city of Isabella. He
                    arrived there "as one half dead," and his explorations and discoveries for this
                    voyage were thus brought to an end. To his great delight he found there his
                    brother Bartholomew, whom he had not seen for eight years. Bartholomew had
                    accompanied Diaz in the famous voyage in which he discovered the Cape of Good
                    Hope. Returning to Europe in 1488 he had gone to England, with a message from
                    Christopher Columbus, asking King Henry the Seventh to interest himself in the
                    great adventure he proposed. <pb n="186"/>
                </p>
                <p>The authorities differ as to the reception which Henry gave to this great
                    proposal. Up to the present time, no notice has been found of his visit in the
                    English archives. The earliest notice of America, in the papers preserved there,
                    is a note of a present of ten pounds "to hym that found the new land," who was
                    Cabot, after his first voyage. Bartholomew Columbus was in England on the tenth
                    of February, 1488; how much later is not known. Returning from England he staid
                    in France, in the service of <hi rend="italic">Madama de Bourbon</hi>. This was
                    either Anne of Beaujeu, or the widow of the Admiral Louis de Bourbon.
                    Bartholomew was living in Paris when he heard of his brother's great discovery. </p>
                <p>He had now been appointed by the Spanish sovereigns to command a fleet of three
                    vessels, which had been sent out to provision the new colony. He had sailed from
                    Cadiz on the thirtieth of April, 1494, and he arrived at Isabella on St. John's
                    Day of the same year. </p>
                <p>Columbus welcomed him with delight, and immediately made him his first-lieutenant
                    in command of the colony. There needed a strong <pb n="187"/> hand for the
                    management of the colony, for the quarrels which had existed before Columbus
                    went on his Cuban voyage had not diminished in his absence. Pedro Margarita and
                    Father Boil are spoken of as those who had made the most trouble. They had come
                    determined to make a fortune rapidly, and they did not propose to give up such a
                    hope to the slow processes of ordinary colonization. Columbus knew very well
                    that those who had returned to Spain had carried with them complaints as to his
                    own course. He would have been glad on some accounts to return, himself, at
                    once; but he did not think that the natives of the islands were sufficiently
                    under the power of the new colony to be left in safety. </p>
                <p>First of all he sent back four caravels, which had recently arrived from Europe,
                    with five hundred Indians whom he had taken as slaves. He consigned them to Juan
                    de Fonseca's care. He was eager himself to say that he sent them out that they
                    might be converted, to Christianity, and that they might learn the Spanish
                    language and be of use as interpreters. But, at the same time, he pointed out
                    how easy it would be to make a source <pb n="188"/> of revenue to the Crown from
                    such involuntary emigration. To Isabella's credit it is to be said, that she
                    protested against the whole thing immediately; and so far as appears, no further
                    shipments were made in exactly the same way. But these poor wretches were not
                    sent back to the islands, as she perhaps thought they were. Fonseca did not
                    hesitate to sell them, or apprentice them, to use our modern phrase, and it is
                    said by Bernaldez that they all died. His bitter phrase is that Fonseca took no
                    more care of them than if they had been wild animals. </p>
                <p>Columbus did not recover his health, so as to take a very active part in affairs
                    for five months after his arrival at San Domingo. He was well aware that the
                    Indians were vigorously organized, with the intention of driving his people from
                    the island, or treating the colony as they had treated the colony of Navidad. He
                    called the chief of the Cipangi, named Guarionexius, for consultation. The
                    interpreter Didacus, who had served them so faithfully, married the king's
                    sister, and it was hoped that this would be a bond of amity between the two
                    nations. <pb n="189"/>
                </p>
                <p>Columbus sent Ojeda into the gold mountains with fifty armed men to make an
                    alliance with Canabao. Canabao met this party with a good deal of perplexity. He
                    undoubtedly knew that he had given the Spaniards good reason for doubting him.
                    It is said that he had put to death twenty Spaniards by treasonable means, but
                    it is to be remembered that this is the statement of his enemies. He, however,
                    came to Columbus with a large body of his people, all armed. When he was asked
                    why he brought so large a force with him, he said that so great a king as he,
                    could not go anywhere without a fitting military escort. But Ojeda did not
                    hesitate to take him prisoner and carry him into Isabella, bound. As has been
                    said, he was eventually sent to Spain, but he died on the passage. </p>
                <p>Columbus made another fortress, or tower, on the border of King Guarionexius's
                    country, between his kingdom and Cipango. He gave to this post the name of the
                    "Tower of the Conception," and meant it to be a rallying point for the miners
                    and others, in case of any uprising of the natives against them. This proved to
                    be an important <pb n="190"/> centre for mining operations. From this place,
                    what we should call a nugget of gold, which one of the chiefs brought in, was
                    sent to Spain. It weighed twenty ounces. A good deal of interest attached also
                    to the discovery of amber, one mass of which weighed three hundred pounds. Such
                    discoveries renewed the interest and hope which had been excited in Spain by the
                    first accounts of Hispaniola. </p>
                <p>Columbus satisfied himself that he left the island really subdued; and in this
                    impression he was not mistaken. Certain that his presence in Spain was needed,
                    if he would maintain his own character against the attacks of the disaffected
                    Spaniards who had gone before him, he set sail on the Nina on the tenth of
                    March, taking with him as a consort a caravel which had been built at Isabella.
                    He did not arrive in Cadiz till the eleventh of June, having been absent from
                    Spain two years and nine months. </p>
                <p>His return to Spain at this time gave Isabella another opportunity to show the
                    firmness of her character, and the determination to which alone belongs success.
                        <pb n="191"/>
                </p>
                <p>The excitement and popularity which attended the return from the first voyage had
                    come to an end. Spain was in the period of reaction. The disappointment which
                    naturally follows undue expectations and extravagant prophecies, was, in this
                    instance, confirmed by the return of discontented adventurers. Four hundred
                    years have accustomed the world to this reflex flow of disappointed colonists,
                    unable or unwilling to work, who come back from a new land to say that its
                    resources have been exaggerated. In this case, where everything was measured by
                    the standard of gold, it was certainly true that the supply of gold received
                    from the islands was very small as compared with the expenses of the expedition
                    which had been sent out. </p>
                <p>Five hundred Indians, who came to be taught the language, entering Spain as
                    slaves, were but a poor return for the expenses in which the nation, not to say
                    individuals, had been involved. The people of Spain, therefore, so far as they
                    could show their feeling, were prejudiced against Columbus and those who
                    surrounded him. They heard with incredulity the accounts of Cuba which <pb
                        n="192"/> he gave, and were quite indifferent to the geographical theories
                    by which he wanted to prove that it was a part of Asia. He believed that the
                    rich mines, which he had really found in Hispaniola, were the same as those of
                    Ophir. But after five years of waiting, the Spanish public cared but little for
                    such conjectures. </p>
                <p>As he arrived in Cadiz, he found three vessels, under Nino, about to sail with
                    supplies. These were much needed, for the relief of the preceding year, sent out
                    in four vessels, had been lost by shipwreck. Columbus was able to add a letter
                    of his own to the governor of Isabella, begging him to conform to the wishes
                    expressed by the king and queen in the dispatches taken by Nino. He recommended
                    diligence in exploring the new mines, and that a seaport should be founded in
                    their neighborhood. At the same time he received a gracious letter from the king
                    and queen, congratulating him on his return, and asking him to court as soon as
                    he should recover from his fatigue. </p>
                <p>Columbus was encouraged by the tone of this letter. He had chosen to act as if he
                    were in <pb n="193"/> disgrace, and dressed himself in humble garb, as if he
                    were a Franciscan monk, wearing his beard as the brethren of those orders do.
                    Perhaps this was in fulfillment of one of those vows which, as we know, he
                    frequently made in periods of despondency. </p>
                <p>He went to Burgos, where Ferdinand and Isabella were residing, and on the way
                    made such a display of treasure as he had done on the celebrated march to
                    Barcelona. Canabao, the fierce cacique of Hispaniola, had died on the voyage,
                    but his brother and nephew still lived, and he took them to the king and queen,
                    glittering on state occasions with golden ornaments. One chain of gold which the
                    brother wore, is said to have been worth more than three thousand dollars of our
                    time. In the procession Columbus carried various masks and other images, made by
                    the Indians in fantastic shapes, which attracted the curiosity which in all
                    nations surrounds the idols of a foreign creed. </p>
                <p>The sovereigns received him cordially. No reference was made to the complaints of
                    the adventurers who had returned. However the <pb n="194"/> sovereigns may have
                    been impressed by these, they were still confident in Columbus and in his
                    merits, and do not seem to have wished to receive the partial accounts of his
                    accusers. On his part, he pressed the importance of a new expedition, in order
                    that they might annex to their dominions the eastern part of Asia. He wanted for
                    this purpose eight ships. He was willing to leave two in the island of
                    Hispaniola, and he hoped that he might have six for a voyage of discovery. The
                    sovereigns assented readily to his proposal, and at the time probably intended
                    to carry out his wishes. </p>
                <p>But Spain had something else to do than to annex Asia or to discover America; and
                    the fulfillment of the promises made so cordially in 1496, was destined to await
                    the exigencies of European war and diplomacy. In fact, he did not sail upon the
                    third expedition for nearly two years after his arrival in Cadiz. </p>
                <p>In the autumn of 1496, an order was given for a sum amounting to nearly a hundred
                    thousand dollars of our time, for the equipment of the promised squadron. At the
                    same time Columbus <pb n="195"/> was relieved from the necessity by which he was
                    bound in his original contract, to furnish at least one-eighth of the money
                    necessary in any of these expeditions. This burden was becoming too heavy for
                    him to bear. It was agreed, however, that in the event of any profit resulting
                    to the crown, he should be entitled to one-eighth of it for three ensuing years.
                    This concession must be considered as an evidence that he was still in favor. At
                    the end of three years both parties were to fall back upon the original
                    contract. </p>
                <p>But these noble promises, which must have been so encouraging to him, could not
                    be fulfilled, as it proved. For the exigencies of war, the particular money
                    which was to be advanced to Columbus was used for the repair of a fortress upon
                    the frontier. Instead of this, Columbus was to receive his money from the gold
                    brought by Nino on his return. Alas, it proved that a report that he had
                    returned with so much gold, meant that he had Indian prisoners, from the sale of
                    whom he expected to realize this money. And poor Columbus was virtually
                    consigned to building and fitting out <pb n="196"/> his ship from the result of
                    a slave-trade, which was condemned by Isabella, and which he knew was wretchedly
                    unprofitable. </p>
                <p>A difficulty almost equally great resulted from the unpopularity of the
                    expedition. People did not volunteer eagerly, as they had done, the minds of men
                    being poisoned by the reports of emigrants, who had gone out in high hope, and
                    had returned disappointed. It even became necessary to commute the sentences of
                    criminals who had been sentenced to banishment, so that they might be
                    transported into the new settlements, where they were to work without pay. Even
                    these expedients did not much hasten the progress of the expedition. </p>
                <p>Fonseca, the steady enemy of Columbus, was placed in command again at this time.
                    The queen was overwhelmed with affliction by the death of Prince Juan; and it
                    seemed to Columbus and his friends that every petty difficulty was placed in the
                    way of preparation. When at length six vessels were fitted for sea, it was only
                    after the wear and tear of constant opposition from officials in command; and
                    the expedition, <pb n="197"/> as it proved, was not what Columbus had hoped for,
                    for his purposes. </p>
                <p>On the thirtieth of May, however, in 1498, he was able to sail. As this was the
                    period when the Catholic church celebrates the mystery of the Trinity, he
                    determined and promised that the first land which he discovered should receive
                    that sacred name. He was well convinced of the existence of a continent farther
                    south than the islands among which he had cruised, and intended to strike that
                    continent, as in fact he did, in the outset of his voyage.</p>

                <p>For the narrative of the third voyage, we are fortunate in having once more a
                    contemporary account by Columbus himself. The more important part of his
                    expedition was partly over when he was able to write a careful letter to the
                    king and queen, which is still preserved. It is lighted up by bursts of the
                    religious enthusiasm which governed him from the beginning. All the more does it
                    show the character of the man, and it impresses upon us, what is never to be
                    forgotten, the mixture in his motive of the enthusiasm of a discoverer, the
                    eager religious feeling which might have quickened a crusader, and the <pb
                        n="199"/> prospects of what we should call business adventure, by which he
                    tries to conciliate persons whose views are less exalted than his own. </p>
                <p>In addressing the king and queen, who are called "very high and very powerful
                    princes," he reminds them that his undertaking to discover the West Indies began
                    in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, which appointed him as a messenger for
                    this enterprise. He asks them to remember that he has always addressed them as
                    with that intention. </p>
                <p>He reminds them of the seven or eight years in which he was urging his cause and
                    that it was not enough that he should have showed the religious side of it, that
                    he was obliged to argue for the temporal view as well. But their decision, for
                    which he praises them indirectly, was made, he says, in the face of the ridicule
                    of all, excepting the two priests, Marcheza and the Archbishop of Segovia. "And
                    everything will pass away excepting the word of God, who spoke so clearly of
                    these lands by the voice of Isaiah in so many places, affirming that His name
                    should be divulged to the nations from Spain." He goes on in a review of the <pb
                        n="200"/> earlier voyages, and after this preface gives his account of the
                    voyage of 1498. </p>
                <p>They sailed from Santa Lucca the thirtieth of May, and went down to Madeira to
                    avoid the hostile squadron of the French who were awaiting him at Cape St.
                    Vincent. In the history by Herrara, of another generation, this squadron is said
                    to be Portuguese. From Maderia, they passed to the Canary Islands, from which,
                    with one ship and two caravels, he makes his voyage, sending the other three
                    vessels to Hispaniola. After making the Cape de Verde Islands, he sailed
                    southwest. He had very hot weather for eight days, and in the hope of finding
                    cooler weather changed his course to the westward. </p>
                <p>On the thirty-first of July, they made land, which proved to be the cape now
                    known as Galeota, the southeastern cape of the island of Trinidad. The country
                    was as green at this season as the orchards of Valencia in March. Passing five
                    leagues farther on, he lands to refit his vessels and take on board wood and
                    water. The next day a large canoe from the east, with twenty-four men, well
                    armed, appeared. <pb n="201"/>
                </p>
                <p>The Admiral wished to communicate with them, but they refused, although he showed
                    them basins and other things which he thought would attract them. Failing in
                    this effort, he directed some of the boys of the crew to dance and play a
                    tambourine on the poop of the ship. But this conciliatory measure had as little
                    success as the other. The natives strung their bows, took up their shields and
                    began to shoot the dancers. Columbus stopped the entertainment, therefore, and
                    ordered some balls shot at them, upon which they left him. With the other vessel
                    they opened more friendly communication, but when the pilot went to Columbus and
                    asked leave to land with them, they went off, nor were any of them or theirs
                    seen again. </p>
                <p>On his arrival at Punta de Icacocos, at the southern point of Trinidad, he
                    observes the very strong currents which are always noticed by voyagers, running
                    with as much fury as the Guadalquiver in time of flood. In the night a terrible
                    wave came from the south, "a hill as high as a ship," so that even in writing of
                    it he feels fear. But no misfortune came from it. <pb n="202"/>
                </p>
                <p>Sailing the next day, he found the water comparatively fresh. He is, in fact, in
                    the current produced by the great river Orinoco, which affects, in a remarkable
                    way, all the tide-flow of those seas. Sailing north, he passes different points
                    of the Island of Trinidad, and makes out the Punta de la Pena and the mainland.
                    He still observes the freshness of the water and the severity of the currents. </p>
                <p>As he sails farther westward, he observes fleets, and he sends his people ashore.
                    They find no inhabitants at first, but eventually meet people who tell him the
                    enemy of this country is Paria. Of these he took on board four. The king sent
                    him an invitation to land, and numbers of the people came in canoes, many of
                    whom wore gold and pearls. These pearls came to them from the north. Columbus
                    did not venture to land here because the provisions of his vessels were already
                    failing him. </p>
                <p>He describes the people, as of much the same color as those who have been
                    observed before, and were ready for intercourse, and of good appearance. Two
                    prominent persons came to <pb n="203"/> meet them, whom he thought to be father
                    and son. The house to which the Spaniards were led was large, with many seats.
                    An entertainment was brought forward, in which there were many sorts of fruits,
                    and wine of many kinds. It was not made from grapes, however, and he supposed it
                    must be made of different sorts of fruits. </p>
                <p>A part of the entertainment was of maize, "which is a sort of corn which grows
                    here, with a spike like a spindle." The Indians and their guests parted with
                    regret that they could not understand each other's conversation. All this passed
                    in the house of the elder Indian. The younger then took them to his house, where
                    a similar collation was served, and they then returned to the ship, Columbus
                    being in haste to press on, both on account of his want of supplies and the
                    failure of his own health. He says he was still suffering from diseases which he
                    had contracted on the last voyage, and with blindness. "That then his eyes did
                    not give him as much pain, nor were they bloodshot as much as they are now." </p>
                <p>He describes the people whom they at first <pb n="204"/> visited as of fine
                    stature, easy bearing, with long straight hair, and wearing worked handkerchiefs
                    on their heads. At a little distance it seemed as if these were made of silk,
                    like the gauze veil with which the Spaniards were familiar, from Moorish usage. </p>
                <p>"Others," he says, "wore larger handkerchiefs round their waists, like the panete
                    of the Spaniards." By this phrase he means a full garment hanging over the
                    knees, either trousers or pettioats. These people were whiter in color than the
                    Indians he had seen before. They all wore something at the neck and arms, with
                    many pieces of gold at the neck. The canoes were much larger than he had seen,
                    better in build and lighter; they had a cabin in the middle for the princes and
                    their women. </p>
                <p>He made many inquiries for gold, but was told he must go farther on, but he was
                    advised not to go there, because his men would be in danger of being eaten. At
                    first, Columbus supposed that this meant that the inhabitants of the
                    gold-bearing countries were cannibals, but he satisfied himself afterwards that
                    the natives meant that they would <pb n="205"/> be eaten by beasts. With regard
                    to pearls, also, he got some information that he should find them when he had
                    gone farther west and farther north. </p>
                <p>After these agreeable courtesies, the little fleet raised its anchors and sailed
                    west. Columbus sent one caravel to investigate the river. Finding that he should
                    not succeed in that direction, and that he had no available way either north or
                    south, he leaves by the same entrance by which he had entered. The water is
                    still very fresh, and he is satisfied, correctly as we know, that these currents
                    were caused by the entrance of the great river of water. </p>
                <p>On the thirteenth of August he leaves the island by what he calls the northern
                    mouth of the river [Boca Grande], and begins to strike salt water again. </p>
                <p>At this part of Columbus's letter there is a very curious discussion of
                    temperature, which shows that this careful observer, even at that time, made out
                    the difference between what are called isothermal curves and the curves of
                    latitude. He observes that he cannot make any estimate of what his temperature
                    will be on the <pb n="206"/> American coast from what he has observed on the
                    coast of Africa. </p>
                <p>He begins now to doubt whether the world is spherical, and is disposed to believe
                    that it is shaped like a pear, and he tries to make a theory of the difference
                    of temperature from this suggestion. We hardly need to follow this now. We know
                    he was entirely wrong in his conjecture. "Pliny and others," he says, "thought
                    the world spherical, because on their part of it it was a hemisphere." They were
                    ignorant of the section over which he was sailing, which he considers to be that
                    of a pear cut in the wrong way. His demonstration is, that in similar latitudes
                    to the eastward it is very hot and the people are black, while at Trinidad or on
                    the mainland it is comfortable and the people are a fine race of men, whiter
                    than any others whom he has seen in the Indies. The sun in the constellation of
                    the Virgin is over their heads, and all this comes from their being higher up,
                    nearer the air than they would have been had they been on the African coast. </p>
                <p>With this curious speculation he unites some inferences from Scripture, and goes
                    back to the <pb n="207"/> account in the Book of Genesis and concludes that the
                    earthly Paradise was in the distant east. He says, however, that if he could go
                    on, on the equinoctial line, the air would grow more temperate, with greater
                    changes in the stars and in the water. He does not think it possible that anyone
                    can go to the extreme height of the mountain where the earthly Paradise is to be
                    found, for no one is to be permitted to enter there but by the will of God, but
                    he believes that in this voyage he is approaching it. </p>
                <p>Any reader who is interested in this curious speculation of Columbus should refer
                    to the "Divina Comedia" of Dante, where Dante himself held a somewhat similar
                    view, and describes his entrance into the terrestrial paradise under the
                    guidance of Beatrice. It is a rather curious fact, which discoverers of the last
                    three centuries have established, that the point, on this world, which is
                    opposite the city of Jerusalem, where all these enthusiasts supposed the
                    terrestrial Paradise would be found, is in truth in the Pacific Ocean not far
                    from Pitcairn's Island, in the very region where so many voyagers have thought
                    that they <pb n="208"/> found the climate and soil which to the terrestrial
                    Paradise belong. </p>
                <p>Columbus expresses his dissent from the recent theory, which was that of Dante,
                    supposing that the earthly Paradise was at the top of a sharp mountain. On the
                    other hand, he supposes that this mountain rises gently, but yet that no person
                    can go to the top. </p>
                <p>This is his curious "excursion," made, perhaps, because Columbus had the time to
                    write it. </p>
                <p>The journal now recurs to more earthly affairs. Passing out from the mouth of the
                    "Dragon," he found the sea running westward and the wind gentle. He notices that
                    the waters are swept westward as the trade winds are. In this way he accounts
                    for there being so many islands in that part of the earth, the mainland having
                    been eaten away by the constant flow of the waves. He thinks their very shape
                    indicates this, they being narrow from north to south and longer from east to
                    west. Although some of the islands differ in this, special reasons maybe given
                    for the difference. He brings in many of the old authorities to show, what we
                    now know to be entirely false, that there <pb n="209"/> is much more land than
                    water on the surface of the globe. </p>
                <p>All this curious speculation as to the make-up of the world encourages him to beg
                    their Highnesses to go on with the noble work which they have begun. He explains
                    to them that he plants the cross on every cape and proclaims the sovereignty of
                    their Majesties and of the Christian religion. He prays that this may continue.
                    The only objection to it is the expense, but Columbus begs their Highnesses to
                    remember how much more money is spent for the mere formalities of the elegancies
                    of the court. He begs them to consider the credit attaching to plans of
                    discovery and quickens their ambition by reference to the efforts of the princes
                    of Portugal. </p>
                <p>This letter closes by the expression of his determination to go on with his three
                    ships for further discoveries. </p>
                <p>This letter was written from San Domingo on the eighth of October. He had already
                    made the great discovery of the mainland of South America, though he did not yet
                    know that he had touched the continent. He had intentionally gone <pb n="210"/>
                    farther south than before, and had therefore struck the island of Trinidad, to
                    which, as he had promised, he gave the name which it still bears. A sailor first
                    saw the summits of three mountains, and gave the cry of land. As the ships
                    approached, it was seen that these three mountains were united at the base.
                    Columbus was delighted by the omen, as he regarded it, which thus connected his
                    discovery with the vow which he had made on Trinity Sunday. </p>
                <p>As the reader has seen, he first passed between this great island and the
                    mainland. The open gulf there described is now known as the Gulf of Paria. The
                    observation which he made as to the freshness of the water caused by the flow of
                    the Orinoco, has been made by all navigators since. It may be said that he was
                    then really in the mouth of the Orinoco. </p>
                <p>Young readers, at least, will be specially interested to remember that it was in
                    this region that Robinson Crusoe's island was placed by Defoe; and if they will
                    carefully read his life they will find discussions there of the flow of the
                    "great River Orinoco." Crossing this gulf, Columbus had <pb n="211"/> touched
                    upon the coast of Paria, and thus became the first discoverer of South America.
                    It is determined, by careful geographers, that the discovery of the continent of
                    North America, had been made before this time by the Cabots, sailing under the
                    orders of England. </p>
                <p>Columbus was greatly encouraged by the discovery of fine pearls among the natives
                    of Paria. Here he found one more proof that he was on the eastern coast of Asia,
                    from which coast pearls had been brought by the caravans on which, till now,
                    Europe had depended for its Asiatic supplies. He gave the name "Gulf of Pearls"
                    to the estuary which makes the mouth of the River Paria. </p>
                <p>He would gladly have spent more time in exploring this region; but the sea-stores
                    of his vessel were exhausted, he was suffering from a difficulty with his eyes,
                    caused by overwatching, and was also a cripple from gout. He resisted the
                    temptation, therefore, to make further explorations on the coast of Paria, and
                    passed westward and northwestward. He made many discoveries of islands in the
                    Caribbean Sea as he <pb n="212"/> went northwest, and he arrived at the colony
                    of San Domingo, on the thirtieth of August. He had hoped for rest after his
                    difficult voyage; but he found the island in confusion which seemed hopeless. </p>
                <p>His brother Bartholomew, from all the accounts we have, would seem to have
                    administered its affairs with justice and decision; but the problem he had in
                    hand was one which could not be solved so as to satisfy all the critics. Close
                    around him he had a body of adventurers, almost all of whom were nothing but
                    adventurers. With the help of these adventurers, he had to repress Indian
                    hostilities, and to keep in order the natives who had been insulted and injured
                    in every conceivable way by the settlers. </p>
                <p>He was expected to send home gold to Spain with every vessel; he knew perfectly
                    well that Spain was clamoring with indignation because he did not succeed in
                    doing so. But on the island itself he had to meet, from day to day, conspiracies
                    of Spaniards and what are called insurrections of natives. These insurrections
                    consisted simply in their assertion of such rights <pb n="213"/> as they had to
                    the beautiful land which the Spaniards were taking away from them. </p>
                <p>At the moment when Columbus landed, there was an instant of tranquility. But the
                    natives, whom he remembered only six years ago as so happy and cheerful and
                    hospitable, had fled as far as they could. They showed in every way their
                    distrust of those who were trying to become their masters. On the other hand,
                    soldiers and emigrants were eager to leave the island if they could. They were
                    near starvation, or if they did not starve they were using food to which they
                    were not accustomed. The eagerness with which, in 1493, men had wished to rush
                    to this land of promise, was succeeded by an equal eagerness, in 1498, to go
                    home from it. </p>
                <p>As soon as he arrived, Columbus issued a proclamation, approving of the measures
                    of his brother in his absence, and denouncing the rebels with whom Bartholomew
                    had been contending. He found the difficulties which surrounded him were of the
                    most serious character. He had not force enough to take up arms against the
                    rebels of different names. He offered pardon to them <pb n="214"/> in the name
                    of the sovereigns, and that they refused. </p>
                <p>Columbus was obliged, in order to maintain any show of authority, to propose to
                    the sovereigns that they should arbitrate between his brother and Roldan, who
                    was the chief of the rebel party. He called to the minds of Ferdinand and
                    Isabella his own eager desire to return to San Domingo sooner, and ascribed the
                    difficulties which had arisen, in large measure, to his long delay. He said he
                    should send home the more worthless men by every ship. </p>
                <p>He asked that preachers might be sent out to convert the Indians and to reform
                    the dissolute Spaniards. He asked for officers of revenue, and for a learned
                    judge. He begged at the same time that, for two years longer, the colony might
                    be permitted to employ the Indians as slaves, but he promised they would only
                    use such as they captured in war and insurrections. </p>
                <p>By the same vessel the rebels sent out letters charging Columbus and his brother
                    with the grossest oppression and injustice. All these letters came to court by
                    one messenger. Columbus was <pb n="215"/> then left to manage as best he could,
                    in the months which must pass, before he could receive an answer. </p>
                <p>He was not wholly without success. That is to say, no actual battles took place
                    between the parties before the answer returned. But when it returned, it proved
                    to be written by his worst enemy, Fonseca. It was a genuine Spanish answer to a
                    letter which required immediate decision. That is to say, Columbus was simply
                    told that the whole matter must be left in suspense till the sovereigns could
                    make such an investigation as they wished. The hope, therefore, of some help
                    from home was wholly disappointed. </p>
                <p>Roldan, the chief of the rebels, was encouraged by this news to take higher
                    ground than even he had ventured on before. He now proposed that he should send
                    fifteen of his company to Spain, also that those who remained should not only be
                    pardoned, but should have lands granted them; third, that a public proclamation
                    should be made that all charges against him had been false; and fourth, that he
                    should <pb n="216"/> hold the office of chief judge, which he had held before
                    the rebellion. </p>
                <p>Columbus was obliged to accede to terms as insolent as these, and the rebels even
                    added a stipulation, that if he should fail in fulfilling either of these
                    articles, they might compel him to comply, by force or any other means. Thus was
                    he hampered in the very position where, by the king's orders, and indeed, one
                    would say, by the right of discovery, he was the supreme master. </p>
                <p>For himself, he determined to return with Bartholomew to Spain, and he made some
                    preparations to do so. But at this time he learned, from the western part of the
                    island, that four strange ships had arrived there. He could not feel that it was
                    safe to leave the colony in such a condition of latent rebellion as he knew it
                    to be in; he wrote again to the sovereigns, and said directly that his
                    capitulation with the rebels had been extorted by force, and that he did not
                    consider that the sovereigns, or that he himself, were bound by it. He pressed
                    some of the requests which he had made before, and asked that his son <pb
                        n="217"/> Diego, who was no longer a boy, might be sent out to him. </p>
                <p>It proved that the ships which had arrived at the west of the island were under
                    the command of Ojeda, who will be remembered as a bold cavalier in the
                    adventures of the second voyage. Acting under a general permission which had
                    been given for private adventurers, Ojeda had brought out this squadron, and,
                    when Columbus communicated with him, was engaged in cutting dye-woods and
                    shipping slaves. </p>
                <p>Columbus sent Roldan, who had been the head of the rebels, to inquire on what
                    ground he was there. Ojeda produced a license signed by Fonseca, authorizing him
                    to sail on a voyage of discovery. It proved that Columbus's letters describing
                    the pearls of Paria had awakened curiosity and enthusiasm, and, while the crown
                    had passed them by so coldly, Ojeda and a body of adventurers had obtained a
                    license and had fitted out four ships for adventure. The special interest of
                    this voyage for us, is that it is supposed that Vespucci, a Florentine merchant,
                    made at this time his first expedition to America. <pb n="218"/>
                </p>
                <p>Vespucci was not a professional seaman, but he was interested in geography, and
                    had made many voyages before this time. So soon as it was announced that Ojeda
                    was on the coast, the rebels of San Domingo selected him as a new leader. He
                    announced to Columbus, rather coolly, that he could probably redress the
                    grievances which these men had. He undoubtedly knew that he had the protection
                    of Fonseca at home. Fortunately for Columbus, Roldan did not mean to give up his
                    place as "leader of the opposition;" and it may be said that the difficulty
                    between the two was a certain advantage to Columbus in maintaining his
                    authority. </p>
                <p>Meanwhile, all wishes on his part to continue his discoveries were futile, while
                    he was engaged in the almost hopeless duty of reconciling various adventurers
                    and conciliating people who had no interests but their own. In Spain, his
                    enemies were doing everything in their power to undermine his reputation. His
                    statements were read more and more coldly, and at last, on the twenty-first and
                    twenty-sixth of May, 1499, letters were <pb n="219"/> written to him instructing
                    him to deliver into the hands of Bobadilla, a new commandant, all the fortresses
                    any ships, houses and other royal property which he held, and to give faith and
                    obedience to any instructions given by Bobadilla. That is to say, Bobadilla was
                    sent out as a commander who was to take precedence of every one on the spot. He
                    was an officer of the royal household, probably a favorite at court, and was
                    selected for the difficult task of reconciling all difficulties, and bringing
                    the new colony into loyal allegiance to the crown. He sailed for San Domingo in
                    the middle of July, 1500, and arrived on the twenty-third of August. </p>
                <p>On his arrival, he found that Columbus and his brother Bartholomew were both
                    absent from the city, being in fact engaged in efforts to set what may be called
                    the provinces in order. The young Diego Columbus was commander in their absence.
                    The morning after he arrived, Bobadilla attended mass, and then, with the people
                    assembled around the door of the church, he directed that his commission should
                    be read. He was to investigate the rebellion, he was to <pb n="220"/> seize the
                    persons of delinquents and punish them with rigor, and he was to command the
                    Admiral to assist him in these duties. </p>
                <p>He then bade Diego surrender to him certain prisoners, and ordered that their
                    accusers should appear before him. To this Diego replied that his brother held
                    superior powers to any which Bobadilla could possess; he asked for a copy of the
                    commission, which was declined, until Columbus himself should arrive. Bobadilla
                    then took the oath of office, and produced, for the first time, the order which
                    has been described above, ordering Columbus to deliver up all the royal
                    property. He won the popular favor by reading an order which directed him to pay
                    all arrears of wages due to all persons in the royal service. </p>
                <p>But when he came before the fortress, he found that the commander declined to
                    surrender it. He said he held the fortress for the king by the command of the
                    Admiral, and would not deliver it until he should arrive. Bobadilla, however,
                    "assailed the portal;" that is to say, he broke open the gate. No one offered
                    any opposition, and the commander and his first-lieutenant were taken <pb
                        n="221"/> prisoners. He went farther, taking up his residence in Columbus's
                    house, and seizing his papers. So soon as Columbus received account of
                    Bobadilla's arrival, he wrote to him in careful terms, welcoming him to the
                    island. He cautioned him against precipitate measures, told him that he himself
                    was on the point of going to Spain, and that he would soon leave him in command,
                    with everything explained. Bobadilla gave no answer to these letters; and when
                    Columbus received from the sovereigns the letter of the twenty-sixth of May, he
                    made no longer any hesitation, but reported in person at the city of San
                    Domingo. </p>
                <p>He traveled without guards or retinue, but Bobadilla had made hostile
                    preparations, as if Columbus meant to come with military force. Columbus
                    preferred to show his own loyalty to the crown and to remove suspicion. But no
                    sooner did he arrive in the city than Bobadilla gave orders that he should be
                    put in irons and confined in the fortress. Up to this moment, Bobadilla had been
                    sustained by the popular favor of those around him; but the indignity, of
                    placing <pb n="222"/> chains upon Columbus, seems to have made a change in the
                    fickle impressions of the little town. </p>
                <p>Columbus, himself, behaved with magnanimity, and made no complaint. Bobadilla
                    asked him to bid his brother return to San Domingo, and he complied. He begged
                    his brother to submit to the authority of the sovereigns, and Bartholomew
                    immediately did so. On his arrival in San Domingo he was also put in irons, as
                    his brother Diego had been, and was confined on board a caravel. As soon as a
                    set of charges could be made up to send to Spain with Columbus, the vessels,
                    with the prisoners, set sail. </p>
                <p>The master of the caravel, Martin, was profoundly grieved by the severe treatment
                    to which the great navigator was subjected. He would gladly have taken off his
                    irons, but Columbus would not consent. "I was commanded by the king and queen,"
                    he said, "to submit to whatever Bobadilla should order in their name. He has put
                    these chains on me by their authority. I will wear them until the king and queen
                    bid me take them off. I will preserve them afterwards as relics and memorials of
                    the reward of my services." His 
                    <pb n="224"/> son, Fernando, who tells this story, says that he did so, that
                    they were always hanging in his cabinet, and that he asked that they might be
                    buried with him when he died. </p>
                <p>From this expression of Fernando Columbus, there has arisen, what Mr. Harrisse
                    calls, a "pure legend," that the chains were placed in the coffin of Columbus.
                    Mr. Harrisse shows good reason for thinking that this was not so. "Although
                    disposed to believe that, in a moment of just indignation, Columbus expressed
                    the wish that these tokens of the ingratitude of which he had been the victim
                    should be buried, with him, I do not believe that they were ever placed in his
                    coffin." </p>
                <p>It will thus be seen that the third voyage added to the knowledge of the
                    civilized world the information which Columbus had gained regarding Paria and
                    the island of Trinidad. For other purposes of discovery, it was fruitless.</p>

                <head> CHAPTER XI.<lb/>
                    <lb/> SPAIN, 1500, 1501.<lb/>
                    <lb/> A CORDIAL RECEPTION IN SPAIN &mdash; COLUMBUS FAVORABLY RECEIVED AT
                    COURT &mdash; NEW INTEREST IN GEOGRAPHICAL DISCOVERY &mdash; HIS PLANS
                    FOR THE REDEMPTION OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE &mdash; PREPARATIONS FOR A FOURTH
                    EXPEDITION. </head>

                <p>Columbus was right in insisting on wearing his chains. They became rather an
                    ornament than a disgrace. So soon as it was announced in Spain that the great
                    discoverer had been so treated by Bobadilla, a wave of popular indignation swept
                    through the people and reached the court. Ferdinand and Isabella, themselves,
                    had never intended to give such powers to their favorite, that he should
                    disgrace a man so much his superior. </p>
                <p>They instantly sent orders to Cadiz that Columbus should be received with all
                    honor. So soon as he arrived he had been able to send, to Dona Juana de la
                    Torre, a lady high in favor at court, a private letter, in which he made a proud
                    defense <pb n="226"/> of himself. This letter is still preserved, and it is of
                    the first interest, as showing his own character, and as showing what were the
                    real hardships which he had undergone. </p>
                <p>The Lady Juana read this letter to Isabella. Her own indignation, which probably
                    had been kindled by the general news that Columbus had been chained, rose to the
                    highest. She received him, therefore, when he arrived at court, with all the
                    more cordiality. Ferdinand was either obliged to pretend to join with her in her
                    indignation, or he had really felt distressed by the behavior of his
                    subordinate. </p>
                <p>They did not wait for any documents from Bobadilla. As has been said, they wrote
                    cordially to Columbus; they also ordered that two thousand ducats should be paid
                    him for his expenses, and they bade him appear at Grenada at court. He did
                    appear there on the seventeenth of December, attended by an honorable retinue,
                    and in the proper costume of a gentleman in favor with the king and queen. </p>
                <p>When the queen met him she was moved to tears, and Columbus, finding himself so
                    kindly <pb n="227"/> received, threw himself upon his knees. For some time he
                    could not express himself except by tears and sobs. His sovereigns raised him
                    from the ground and encouraged him by gracious words. </p>
                <p>So soon as he recovered his self-possession he made such an address as he had
                    occasion to make more than once in his life, and showed the eloquence which is
                    possible to a man of affairs. He could well boast of his loyalty to the Spanish
                    crown; and he might well say that, whether he were or were not experienced in
                    government, he had been surrounded by such difficulties in administration as
                    hardly any other man had had to go through. But really, it was hardly necessary
                    that he should vindicate himself. </p>
                <p>The stupidity of his enemies, had injured their cause more than any carelessness
                    of Columbus could have done. The sovereigns expressed their indignation at
                    Bobadilla's proceedings, and, indeed, declared at once that he should be
                    dismissed from command. They never took any public notice of the charges which
                    he had sent home; on the other hand, they received Columbus with dignity and <pb
                        n="228"/> favor, and assured him that he should be reinstated in all his
                    privileges. </p>
                <p>The time at which he arrived was, in a certain sense, favorable for his future
                    plans, so far as he had formed any. On the other hand, the condition of affairs
                    was wholly changed from what it was when he began his great discoveries, and the
                    changes were in some degree unfavorable. Vasco da Gama had succeeded in the
                    great enterprise by which he had doubled the Cape of Good Hope, had arrived at
                    the Indies by the route of the Indian ocean, and his squadron had successfully
                    returned. </p>
                <p>This great adventure, with the commercial and other results which would certainly
                    follow it, had quickened the mind of all Europe, as the discovery by Columbus
                    had quickened it eight years before. So far, any plan for the discoveries over
                    which Columbus was always brooding, would be favorably received. But, on the
                    other hand, in eight years since the first voyage, a large body of skillful
                    adventurers had entered upon the career which then no one chose to share with
                    him. The Pinzon brothers were among these; Ojeda, already known to the reader,
                    was another; and Vespucci, as the <pb n="229"/> reader knows, an intelligent and
                    wise student, had engaged himself in such discoveries. </p>
                <p>The rumors of the voyages of the Cabots, much farther north than those made by
                    Columbus, had gone through all Europe. In a word, Columbus was now only one of
                    several skilful pilots and voyagers, and his plans were to be considered side by
                    side with those which were coming forward almost every day, for new discoveries,
                    either by the eastern route, of which Vasco da Gama had shown the
                    practicability, or by the western route, which Columbus himself had first
                    essayed. </p>
                <p>It is to be remembered, as well, that Columbus was now an old man, and, whatever
                    were his successes as a discoverer, he had not succeeded as a commander. There
                    might have been reasons for his failure; but failure is failure, and men do not
                    accord to an unsuccessful leader the honors which they are ready to give to a
                    successful discoverer. When, therefore, he offered his new plans at court, he
                    should have been well aware that they could not be received, as if he were the
                    only one who could make suggestions. Probably he was aware of this. He was also
                    obliged, whether he would <pb n="230"/> or would not, to give up the idea that
                    he was to be the commander of the regions which he discovered. </p>
                <p>It had been easy enough to grant him this command before there was so much as an
                    inch of land known, over which it would make him the master. But now that it was
                    known that large islands, and probably a part of the continent of Asia, were to
                    be submitted to his sway if he had it, there was every reason why the sovereigns
                    should be unwilling to maintain for him the broad rights which they had been
                    willing to give when a scratch of the pen was all that was needful to give them. </p>
                <p>Bobadilla was recalled; so far well. But neither Ferdinand nor Isabella chose to
                    place Columbus again in his command. They did choose Don Nicola Ovando, a
                    younger man, to take the place of Bobadilla, to send him home, and to take the
                    charge of the colony. </p>
                <p>From the colony itself, the worst accounts were received. If Columbus and his
                    brother had failed, Bobadilla had failed more disgracefully. Indeed, he had
                    begun by the policy of King Log, as an <pb n="231"/> improvement on the policy
                    of King Stork. He had favored all rebels, he had pardoned them, he had even paid
                    them for the time which they had spent in rebellion; and the natural result was
                    utter disorder and license. </p>
                <p>It does not appear that he was a bad man; he was a man wholly unused to command;
                    he was an imprudent man, and was weak. He had compromised the crown by the easy
                    terms on which he had rented and sold estates; he had been obliged, in order to
                    maintain the revenue, to work the natives with more severity than ever. He knew
                    very well that the system, under which he was working could not last long. One
                    of his maxims was, "Do the best with your time," and he was constantly
                    sacrificing future advantages for such present results as he could achieve. </p>
                <p>The Indians, who had been treated badly enough before, were worse treated now.
                    And during his short administration, if it may be called an administration,
                    &mdash; during the time when he was nominally at the head of affairs
                    &mdash; he was reducing the island to lower and lower depths. He did succeed
                    in obtaining a large product of <pb n="232"/> gold, but the abuses of his
                    government were not atoned for by such remittances. Worst of all, the wrongs of
                    the natives touched the sensitiveness of Isabella, and she was eager that his
                    successor should be appointed, and should sail, to put an end to these
                    calamities. </p>
                <p>The preparations which were made for Ovando's expedition, for the recall of
                    Bobadilla, and for a reform, if it were possible, in the administration of the
                    colony, all set back any preparations for a new expedition of discovery on the
                    part of Columbus. He was not forgotten; his accounts were to be examined and any
                    deficiencies made up to him; he was to receive the arrears of his revenue; he
                    was permitted to have an agent who should see that he received his share in
                    future. To this agency he appointed Alonzo Sanchez de Carvajal, and the
                    sovereigns gave orders that this agent should be treated with respect. </p>
                <p>Other preparations were made, so that Ovando might arrive with a strong
                    reinforcement for the colony. He sailed with thirty ships, the size of these
                    vessels ranging from one hundred and fifty Spanish toneles to one bark of
                    twenty-five. It <pb n="233"/> will be remembered that the Spanish tonele is
                    larger by about ten per cent than our English ton. Twenty-five hundred persons
                    embarked as colonists in the vessels, and, for the first time, men took their
                    families with them. </p>
                <p>Everything was done to give dignity to the appointment of Ovando, and it was
                    hoped that by sending out families of respectable character, who were to be
                    distributed in four towns, there might be a better basis given to the
                    settlement. This measure had been insisted upon by Columbus. </p>
                <p>This fleet put to sea on the thirteenth of February, 1502. It met, at the very
                    outset, a terrible storm, and one hundred and twenty of the passengers were lost
                    by the foundering of a ship. The impression was at first given in Spain that the
                    whole fleet had been lost; but this proved to be a mistake. The others assembled
                    at the Canaries, and arrived in San Domingo on the fifteenth of April. </p>
                <p>Columbus himself never lost confidence in his own star. He was sure that he was
                    divinely sent, and that his mission was to open the way to the Indies, for the
                    religious advancement of mankind. <pb n="234"/> If Vasco de Gama had discovered
                    a shorter way than men knew before, Christopher Columbus should discover one
                    shorter still, and this discovery should tend to the glory of God. It seemed to
                    him that the simplest way in which he could make men understand this, was to
                    show that the Holy Sepulchre might, now and thus, be recovered from the infidel. </p>
                <p>Far from urging geographical curiosity as an object, he proposed rather the
                    recovery of the Holy Sepulchre. That is, there was to be a new and last crusade,
                    and the money for this enterprise was to be furnished from the gold of the
                    farthest East. He was close at the door of this farthest East; and as has been
                    said, he believed that Cuba was the Ophir of Solomon, and he supposed, that a
                    very little farther voyaging would open all the treasures which Marco Polo had
                    described, and would bring the territory, which had made the Great Khan so rich,
                    into the possession of the king of Spain. </p>
                <p>He showed to Ferdinand and Isabella that, if they would once more let him go
                    forward, on the adventure which had been checked untimely by <pb n="235"/> the
                    cruelty of Bobadilla, this time they would have wealth which would place them at
                    the head of the Christian sovereigns of the world. </p>
                <p>While he was inactive at Seville, and the great squadron was being prepared which
                    Ovando was to command, he wrote what is known as the "Book of Prophecies," in
                    which he attempted to convince the Catholic kings of the necessity of carrying
                    forward the enterprise which he proposed. He urged haste, because he believed
                    the world was only to last a hundred and fifty-five years longer; and, with so
                    much before them to be done, it was necessary that they should begin. </p>
                <p>He remembered an old vow that he had undertaken, that, within seven years of the
                    time of his discovery, he would furnish fifty thousand foot soldiers and five
                    thousand horsemen for the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre. He now arranged in
                    order prophecies from the Holy Scripture, passages from the writings of the
                    Fathers, and whatever else suggested itself, mystical and hopeful, as to the
                    success of an enterprise by which the new world could be used for the conversion
                        <pb n="236"/> of the Gentiles and for the improvement of the Christianity of
                    the old world. </p>
                <p>He had the assistance of a Carthusian monk, who seems to have been skilled in
                    literary work, and the two arranged these passages in order, illustrated them
                    with poetry, and collected them into a manuscript volume which was sent to the
                    sovereigns. </p>
                <p>Columbus accompanied the Book of Prophecies with one of his own long letters,
                    written with the utmost fervor. In this letter he begins, as Peter the Hermit
                    might do, by urging the sovereigns to set on foot a crusade. If they are tempted
                    to consider his advice extravagant, he asks them how his first scheme of
                    discovery was treated. He shows that, as heaven had chosen him to discover the
                    new world, heaven has also chosen him to discover the Holy Sepulchre. God
                    himself had opened his eyes that he might make the great discovery, which has
                    reflected such honor upon them and theirs. </p>
                <p>"If his hopes had been answered," says a Catholic writer, the modern question of
                    holy places, which is the Gordian knot of the religious politics <pb n="237"/>
                    of the future, would have been solved long ago by the gold of the new world, or
                    would have been cut by the sword of its discoverer. We should not have seen
                    nations which are separated from the Roman communion, both Protestant and
                    Pantheistic governments, coming audaciously into contest for privileges, which,
                    by the rights of old possession, by the rights of martyrdom and chivalry, belong
                    to the Holy Catholic Church, the Apostolic Church, the Roman Church, and after
                    her to France, her oldest daughter." </p>
                <p>Columbus now supposed that the share of the western wealth which would belong to
                    him would be sufficient for him to equip and arm a hundred thousand infantry and
                    ten thousand horsemen. </p>
                <p>At the moment when the Christian hero made this pious calculation he had not
                    enough of this revenue with which to buy a cloak," This is the remark of the
                    enthusiastic biographer from whom we have already quoted. </p>
                <p>It is not literally true, but it is true that Columbus was living in the most
                    modest way at the time when he was pressing his ambitious schemes upon the
                    court. At the same time, he wrote a <pb n="238"/> poem with which he undertook
                    to press the same great enterprise upon his readers. It was called "The End of
                    Man," "Memorare novissima tua, et non peccabis in eternum." </p>
                <p>In his letter to the king and queen he says, "Animated as by a heavenly fire, I
                    came to your Highnesses; all who heard of my enterprise mocked it; all the
                    sciences I had acquired profited me as nothing; seven years did I pass in your
                    royal court, disputing the case with persons of great authority and learned in
                    all the arts, and in the end they decided that all was vain. In your Highnesses
                    alone remained faith and constancy. Who will doubt that this light was from the
                    Holy Scriptures, illumining you, as well as myself, with rays of marvellous
                    brightness." </p>
                <p>It is probable that the king and queen were, to a certain extent, influenced by
                    his enthusiasm. It is certain that they knew that something was due to their
                    reputation and to his success. By whatever motive led, they encouraged him with
                    hopes that he might be sent forward again, this time, not as commander of a
                    colony, but as a discoverer. Discovery was indeed the business which he <pb
                        n="239"/> understood, and to which alone he should ever have been
                    commissioned. </p>
                <p>It is to be remembered that the language of crusaders was not then a matter of
                    antiquity, and was not used as if it alluded to bygone affairs. It was but a few
                    years since the Saracens had been driven out of Spain, and all men regarded them
                    as being the enemies of Christianity and of Europe, who could not be neglected.
                    More than this, Spain was beginning to receive very large and important revenues
                    from the islands. </p>
                <p>It is said that the annual revenues from Hispaniola already amounted to twelve
                    millions of our dollars. It was not unnatural that the king and queen, willing
                    to throw off the disgrace which they had incurred from Bobadilla's cruelty,
                    should not only send Ovando to replace him, but should, though in an humble
                    fashion, give to Columbus an opportunity to show that his plans were not
                    chimerical.</p>

                    &mdash; COLUMBUS RETURNS TO SAN DOMINGO, AND TO SPAIN. </head>

                <p>It seems a pity now that, after his third voyage, Columbus did not remain in
                    Spain and enjoy, as an old man could, the honors which he had earned and the
                    respect which now waited upon him. Had this been so, the world would have been
                    spared the mortification which attends the thought that the old man to whom it
                    owes so much suffered almost everything in one last effort, failed in that
                    effort, and died with the mortification of failure. But it is to be remembered
                    that Columbus was <pb n="241"/> not a man to cultivate the love of leisure. He
                    had no love of leisure to cultivate. His life had been an active one. He had
                    attempted the solution of a certain problem which he had not solved, and every
                    day of leisure, even every occasion of effort and every word of flattery, must
                    have quickened in him new wishes to take the prize which seemed so near, and to
                    achieve the possibility which had thus far eluded him. </p>
                <p>From time to time, therefore, he had addressed new memorials to the sovereigns
                    proposing a new expedition; and at last, by an instruction which is dated on the
                    fourteenth of March, in the year 1502, a fourth voyage was set on foot at the
                    charge of the king and queen, &mdash; an instruction not to stop at
                    Hispaniola, but, for the saving of time, to pass by that island. This is a
                    graceful way of intimating to him that he is not to mix himself up with the
                    rights and wrongs of the new settlement. </p>
                <p>The letter goes on to say, that the sovereigns have communicated with the King of
                    Portugal, and that they have explained to him that Columbus is pressing his
                    discoveries at the west. and <pb n="242"/> will not interfere with those of the
                    Portugese{sic} in the east. He is instructed to regard the Portugese{sic}
                    explorers as his friends, and to make no quarrel with them. He is instructed to
                    take with him his sons, Fernando and Diego. This is probably at his request. </p>
                <p>The prime object of the instruction is still to strike the mainland of the
                    Indies. All the instructions are, "You will make a direct voyage, if the weather
                    does not prevent you, for discovering the islands and the mainland of the Indies
                    in that part which belongs to us." He is to take possession of these islands and
                    of this mainland, and to inform the sovereigns in regard to his discoveries, and
                    the experience of former voyages has taught them that great care must be taken
                    to avoid private speculation in "gold, silver, pearls, precious stones, spices
                    and other things of different quality." For this purpose special instructions
                    are given. </p>
                <p>Of this voyage we have Columbus's own official account. </p>
                <p>There were four vessels, three of which were rated as caravels. The fourth was
                    very small. <pb n="243"/> The chief vessel was commanded by Diego Tristan; the
                    second, the Santiago, by Francisco de Porras; the third, the Viscaina
                    (Biscayan), by Bartholomew de Fiesco; and the little Gallician by Pedro de
                    Torreros. None of these vessels, as the reader will see, was ever to return to
                    Spain. From de Porras and his brother, Columbus and the expedition were to
                    receive disastrous blows. </p>
                <p>It must be observed that he is once more in his proper position of a discoverer.
                    He has no government or other charge of colonies entrusted to him. His brother
                    Bartholomew and his youngest son Fernando, sail with him. </p>
                <p>The little squadron sailed from the bay of Cadiz on the eleventh of May, 1502.
                    They touched at Sicilla, &mdash; a little port on the coast of Morocco,
                    &mdash; to relieve its people, a Portuguese garrison, who had been besieged
                    by the Moors. But finding them out of danger, Columbus went at once to the Grand
                    Canary island, and had a favorable passage. </p>
                <p>From the Grand Canary to the island which he calls "the first island of the
                    Indies," and <pb n="244"/> which he named Martinino, his voyage was only
                    seventeen days long. This island was either the St. Lucia or the Martinique of
                    today. Hence he passed to Dominica, and thence crossed to San Domingo, to make
                    repairs, as he said. For, as has been said, he had been especially ordered not
                    to interfere in the affairs of the settlement. </p>
                <p>He did not disobey his orders. He says distinctly that he intended to pass along
                    the southern shore of San Domingo, and thence take a departure for the
                    continent. But he says, that his principal vessel sailed very ill &mdash;
                    could not carry much canvas, and delayed the rest of the squadron. This weakness
                    must have increased after the voyage across the ocean. For this reason he hoped
                    to exchange it for another ship at San Domingo. </p>
                <p>But he did not enter the harbor. He sent a letter to Ovando, now the governor,
                    and asked his permission. He added, to the request he made, a statement that a
                    tempest was at hand which he did not like to meet in the offing. Ovando,
                    however, refused any permission to enter. He was, in fact, just dispatching a
                    fleet to Spain, with <pb n="245"/> Bobadilla, Columbus's old enemy, whom Ovando
                    had replaced in his turn. </p>
                <p>Columbus, in an eager wish to be of use, by a returning messenger begged Ovando
                    to delay this fleet till the gale had passed. But the seamen ridiculed him and
                    his gale, and begged Ovando to send the fleet home. </p>
                <p>He did so. Bobadilla and his fleet put to sea. In ten days a West India hurricane
                    struck them. The ship on which Columbus's enemies, Bobadilla and Roldan, sailed,
                    was sunk with them and the gold accumulated for years. Of the whole fleet, only
                    one vessel, called the weakest of all, reached Spain. This ship carried four
                    thousand pieces of gold, which were the property of the Admiral. Columbus's own
                    little squadron, meanwhile &mdash; thanks probably to the seamanship of
                    himself and his brother &mdash; weathered the storm, and he found refuge in
                    the harbor which he had himself named "the beautiful," El Hermoso, in the
                    western part of San Domingo. </p>
                <p>Another storm delayed him at a port which he called Port Brasil. The word Brasil
                    was the name which the Spaniards gave to the red log-wood, so <pb n="246"/>
                    valuable in dyeing, and various places received that name, where this wood was
                    found. The name is derived from "Brasas," &mdash; coals, &mdash; in
                    allusion, probably, to the bright red color of the dye. </p>
                <p>Sailing from this place, on Saturday, the sixteenth of June, they made sight of
                    the island of Jamaica, but he pressed on without making any examination of the
                    country, for four days sailing west and south-west. He then changed his course,
                    and sailed for two days to the northwest and again two days to the north. </p>
                <p>On Sunday, the twenty fourth of July, they saw land. This was the key now known
                    as Cuyago, and they were at last close upon the mainland. After exploring this
                    island they sailed again on Wednesday, the twenty-seventh, southwest and quarter
                    southwest about ninety miles, and again they saw land, which is supposed to be
                    the island of Guanaja or Bonacca, near the coast of Honduras. </p>
                <p>The Indians on this island had some gold and some pearls. They had seen whites
                    before. Columbus calls them men of good stature. Sailing from this island, he
                    struck the mainland near Truxillo, about ten leagues from the island of <pb
                        n="247"/> Guanaja. He soon found the harbor, which we still know as the
                    harbor of Truxillo, and from this point Columbus began a careful investigation
                    of the coast. </p>
                <p>He observed, what all navigators have since observed, the lack of harbors. He
                    passed along as far as the river now known as the Tinto, where he took
                    possession in the name of the sovereigns, calling this river the River of
                    Possession. He found the natives savage, and the country of little account for
                    his purposes. Still passing southward, he passed what we call the Mosquito
                    Coast, to which he found the natives gave the name of Cariay. </p>
                <p>These people were well disposed and willing to treat with them. They had some
                    cotton, they had some gold. They wore very little clothing, and they painted
                    their bodies, as most of the natives of the islands had done. He saw what he
                    thought to be pigs and large mountain cats. </p>
                <p>Still passing southward, running into such bays or other harbors as they found,
                    he entered the "Admiral's Bay," in a country which had the name of Cerabaro, or
                    Zerabora. Here an Indian brought <pb n="248"/> a plate of gold and some other
                    pieces of gold, and Columbus was, encouraged in his hopes of finding more. </p>
                <p>The natives told him that if he would keep on he would find another bay which
                    they called Arburarno, which is supposed to be the Laguna Chiriqui. They said
                    the people, of that country, lived in the mountains. Here Columbus noticed the
                    fact, &mdash; one which has given to philologists one of their central
                    difficulties for four hundred years since, &mdash; that as he passed from
                    one point to another of the American shores, the Indians did not understand each
                    other's language. "Every ten or twenty leagues they did not understand each
                    other." In entering the river Veragua, the Indians appeared armed with lances
                    and arrows, some of them having gold also. Here, also, the people did not live
                    upon the shore, but two or three leagues back in the interior, and they only
                    came to the sea by their canoes upon the rivers. </p>
                <p>The next province was then called Cobraba, but Columbus made no landing for want
                    of a proper harbor. All his courses since he struck <pb n="249"/> the continent
                    had been in a southeasterly direction. That an expedition for westward discovery
                    should be sailing eastward, seemed in itself a contradiction. What irritated the
                    crews still more was, that the wind seemed always against them. </p>
                <p>From the second to the ninth of November, 1502, the little fleet lay at anchor in
                    the spacious harbor, which he called Puerto Bello, "the beautiful harbor." It is
                    still known by that name. A considerable Spanish city grew up there, which
                    became well known to the world in the last century by the attack upon it by the
                    English in the years 1739 and 1742. </p>
                <p>The formation of the coast compelled them to pass eastward as they went on. But
                    the currents of the Gulf flow in the opposite direction. Here there were steady
                    winds from the east and the northeast. The ships were pierced by the teredo,
                    which eats through thick timbers, and is so destructive that the seamen of later
                    times have learned to sheath the hulls of their vessels with copper. </p>
                <p>The seamen thought that they were under the malign influence of some adverse
                    spell. And after a month Columbus gave way to their <pb n="250"/> remonstrances,
                    and abandoned his search for a channel to India. He was the more ready to do
                    this because he was satisfied that the land by which he lay was connected with
                    the coast which other Spaniards had already discovered. He therefore sailed
                    westward again, retracing his course to explore the gold mines of Veragua. </p>
                <p>But the winds could change as quickly as his purposes, and now for nearly a
                    fortnight they had to fight a tropical tempest. At one moment they met with a
                    water-spout, which seemed to advance to them directly. The sailors, despairing
                    of human help, shouted passages from St. John, and to their efficacy ascribed
                    their escape. It was not until the seventeenth that they found themselves safely
                    in harbor. He gave to the whole coast the name of "the coast of contrasts," to
                    preserve the memory of his disappointments. </p>
                <p>The natives proved friendly, as he had found them before; but they told him that
                    he would find no more gold upon the coast; that the mines were in the country of
                    the Veragua. It was, on the tenth day of January that, after some delay,
                    Columbus entered again the river of that name. <pb n="251"/>
                </p>
                <p>The people told him where he should find the mines, and were all ready to send
                    guides with his own people to point them out. He gave to this river, the name of
                    the River of Belen, and to the port in which he anchored he gave the name of
                    Santa Maria de Belen, or Bethlehem. </p>
                <p>His men discovered the mines, so called, at a distance of eight leagues from the
                    port. The country between was difficult, being mountainous and crossed by many
                    streams. They were obliged to pass the river of Veragua thirty-nine times. The
                    Indians themselves were dexterous in taking out gold. Columbus added to their
                    number seventy-five men. </p>
                <p>In one day's work, they obtained "two or three castellianos" without much
                    difficulty. A castelliano was a gold coin of the time, and the meaning of the
                    text is probably that each man obtained this amount. It was one of the
                    "placers," such as have since proved so productive in different parts of the
                    world. </p>
                <p>Columbus satisfied himself that there was a much larger population inland. He
                    learned from the Indians that the cacique, as he always calls <pb n="252"/> the
                    chief of these tribes, was a most important monarch in that region. His houses
                    were larger than others, built handsomely of wood, covered with palm leaves. </p>
                <p>The product of all the gold collected thus far is stated precisely in the
                    official register. There were two hundred and twenty pieces of gold, large and
                    small. Altogether they weighed seventy-two ounces, seven-eighths of an ounce and
                    one grain. Besides these were twelve pieces, great and small, of an inferior
                    grade of gold, which weighed fourteen ounces, three-eighths of an ounce, and six
                    tomienes, a tomiene weighing one-third part of our drachm. In round numbers
                    then, we will say that the result in gold of this cruising would be now worth
                    $1,500. </p>
                <p>Columbus collected gold in this way, to make his expedition popular at home, and
                    he had, indeed, mortgaged the voyage, so to speak, by pledging the pecuniary
                    results, as a fund to bear the expense of a new crusade. But, for himself, the
                    prime desire was always discovery. </p>
                <p>Eventually the Spaniards spent two months in that region, pressing their
                    explorations in search <pb n="253"/> of gold. And so promising did the tokens
                    seem to him, that he determined to leave his brother, to secure the country and
                    work the mines, while he should return to Spain, with the gold he had collected,
                    and obtain reinforcements and supplies. But all these fond hopes. were
                    disappointed. </p>
                <p>The natives, under a leader named Quibian, rallied in large numbers, probably
                    intending to drive the colonists away. It was only by the boldest measures that
                    their plans were met. When Columbus supposed that he had suppressed their
                    enterprise, he took leave of his brother, as he had intended, leaving him but
                    one of the four vessels. </p>
                <p>Fortunately, as it proved, the wind did not serve. He sent back a boat to
                    communicate with the settlement, but it fell into the hands of the savages.
                    Doubtful as to the issue, a seaman, named Ledesma, volunteered to swim through
                    the surf, and communicate with the settlement. The brave fellow succeeded. By
                    passing through the surf again, he brought back the news that the little colony
                    was closely besieged by the savages. <pb n="254"/>
                </p>
                <p>It seemed clear that the settlement must be abandoned, that Columbus's brother
                    and his people must be taken back to Spain. This course was adopted. With
                    infinite difficulty, the guns and stores which had been left with the colony
                    were embarked on the vessels of the Admiral. The caravel which had been left for
                    the colony could not be taken from the river. She was completely dismantled, and
                    was left as the only memorial of this unfortunate colony. </p>
                <p>At Puerto Bello he was obliged to leave another vessel, for she had been riddled
                    by the teredo. The two which he had were in wretched condition. "They were as
                    full of holes as a honey-comb." On the southern coast of Cuba, Columbus was
                    obliged to supply them with cassava bread. The leaks increased. The ships' pumps
                    were insufficient, and the men bailed out the water with buckets and kettles. On
                    the twentieth of June, they were thankful to put into a harbor, called Puerto
                    Bueno, on the coast of Jamaica, where, as it proved, they eventually left their
                    worthless vessels, and where they were in exile from the world of civilization
                    for twelve months. <pb n="255"/>
                </p>
                <p>Nothing in history is more pathetic than the memory that such a waste of a year,
                    in the closing life of such a man as Columbus, should have been permitted by the
                    jealousy, the cruelty, or the selfish ambition of inferior men. </p>
                <p>He was not far from the colony at San Domingo. As the reader will see, he was
                    able to send a message to his countrymen there. But those countrymen left him to
                    take his chances against a strong tribe of savages. Indeed, they would not have
                    been sorry to know that he was dead. </p>
                <p>At first, however, he and his men welcomed the refuge of the harbor. It was the
                    port which he had called Santa Gloria, on his first visit there. He was at once
                    surrounded by Indians, ready to barter with them and bring them provisions. The
                    poor Spaniards were hungry enough to be glad of this relief. </p>
                <p>Mendez, a spirited sailor, had the oversight of this trade, and in one
                    negotiation, at some distance from the vessels, he bought a good canoe of a
                    friendly chief. For this he gave a brass basin, one of his two shirts, and a
                    short jacket. On this canoe turned their after fortunes. Columbus <pb n="256"/>
                    refitted her, put on a false keel, furnished her with a mast and sail. </p>
                <p>With six Indians, whom the chief had lent him, Diego Mendez, accompanied by only
                    one Spanish companion, set sail in this little craft for San Domingo. Columbus
                    sent by them a letter to the sovereigns, which gives the account of the voyage
                    which the reader has been following. </p>
                <p>When Mendez was a hundred miles advanced on his journey, he met a band of hostile
                    savages. They had affected friendship until they had the adventurers in their
                    power, when they seized them all. But while the savages were quarreling about
                    the spoils, Mendez succeeded in escaping to his canoe, and returned alone to his
                    master after fifteen days. </p>
                <p>It was determined that the voyage should be renewed. But this time, another canoe
                    was sent with that under the command of Mendez. He sailed again, storing his
                    boats with cassava bread and calabashes of water. Bartholomew Columbus, with his
                    armed band, marched along the coast, as the two canoes sailed along the shore.
                        <pb n="257"/>
                </p>
                <p>Waiting then for a clear day, Mendez struck northward, on the passage, which was
                    long for such frail craft, to San Domingo. It was eight months before Columbus
                    heard of them. Of those eight months, the history is of dismal waiting, mutiny
                    and civil war. It is pathetic, indeed, that a little body of men, who had been,
                    once and again, saved from death in the most remarkable way, could not live on a
                    fertile island, in a beautiful climate, without quarrelling with each other. </p>
                <p>Two officers of Columbus, Porras and his brother, led the sedition. They told the
                    rest of the crew that the Admiral's hope of relief from Mendez was a mere
                    delusion. They said that he was an exile from Spain, and that he did not dare
                    return to Hispaniola. In such ways they sought to rouse his people against him
                    and his brother. As for Columbus, he was sick on board his vessel, while the two
                    brothers Porras were working against him among his men. </p>
                <p>On the second of January, 1504, Francesco de Porras broke into the cabin. He
                    complained bitterly that they were kept to die in that desolate place, and
                    accused the Admiral as if it <pb n="258"/> were his fault. He told Columbus,
                    that they had determined to go back to Spain; and then, lifting his voice, he
                    shouted, "I am for Castile; who will follow me?" The mutinous crew instantly
                    replied that they would do so. Voices were heard which threatened Columbus's
                    life. </p>
                <p>His brother, the Adelantado, persuaded Columbus to retire from the crowd and
                    himself assumed the whole weight of the assault. The loyal part of the crew,
                    however, persuaded him to put down his weapon, and on the other hand, entreated
                    Porras and his companions to depart. It was clear enough that they had the
                    power, and they tried to carry out their plans. </p>
                <p>They embarked in ten canoes, and thus the Admiral was abandoned by forty-eight of
                    his men. They followed, to the eastward, the route which Mendez had taken. In
                    their lawless way they robbed the Indians of their provisions and of anything
                    else that they needed. As Mendez had done, they waited at the eastern extremity
                    of Jamaica for calm weather. They knew they could not manage the canoes, and
                    they had several Indians to help them. <pb n="259"/>
                </p>
                <p>When the sea was smooth they started; but they had hardly gone four leagues from
                    the land, when the waves began to rise under a contrary wind. Immediately they
                    turned for shore, the canoes were overfreighted, and as the sea rose, frequently
                    shipped water. </p>
                <p>The frightened Spaniards threw overboard everything they could spare, retaining
                    their arms only, and a part of their provisions. They even compelled the Indians
                    to leap into the sea to lighten the boats, but, though they were skillful
                    swimmers, they could not pretend to make land by swimming. They kept to the
                    canoes, therefore, and would occasionally seize them to recover breath. The
                    cruel Spaniards cut off their hands and stabbed them with their swords. Thus
                    eighteen of their Indian comrades died, and they had none left, but such as were
                    of most help in managing the canoes. Once on land, they doubted whether to make
                    another effort or to return to Columbus. </p>
                <p>Eventually they waited a month, for another opportunity to go to Hispaniola; but
                    this failed as before, and losing all patience, they returned <pb n="260"/>
                    westward, to the commander whom they had insulted, living on the island "by fair
                    means or foul," according as they found the natives friendly or unfriendly. </p>
                <p>Columbus, meanwhile, with his half the crew, was waiting. He had established as
                    good order as he could between his men and the natives, but he was obliged to
                    keep a strict watch over such European food as he still had, knowing how
                    necessary it was for the sick men in his number. On the other hand, the Indians,
                    wholly unused to regular work, found it difficult to supply the food which so
                    many men demanded. </p>
                <p>The supplies fell off from day to day; the natives no longer pressed down to the
                    harbor; the trinkets, with which food had been bought, had lost their charm; the
                    Spaniards began to fear that they should starve on the shore of an island which,
                    when Columbus discovered it, appeared to be the abode of plenty. It was at this
                    juncture, when the natives were becoming more and more unfriendly, that Columbus
                    justified himself by the tyrant's plea of necessity, and made use of his
                    astronomical science, to <pb n="261"/> obtain a supernatural power over his
                    unfriendly allies. </p>
                <p>He sent his interpreter to summon the principal caciques to a conference. For
                    this conference he appointed a day when he knew that a total eclipse of the moon
                    would take place. The chiefs met as they were requested. He told them that he
                    and his followers worshipped a God who lived in the heavens; that that God
                    favored such as did well, but punished all who displeased him. </p>
                <p>He asked them to remember how this God had protected Mendez and his companions in
                    their voyage, because they went obedient to the orders which had been given them
                    by their chief. He asked them to remember that the same God had punished Porras
                    and his companions with all sorts of affliction, because they were rebels. He
                    said that now this great God was angry with the Indians, because they refused to
                    furnish food to his faithful worshippers; that he proposed to chastise them with
                    famine and pestilence. </p>
                <p>He said that, lest they should disbelieve the warning which he gave, a sign would
                    be given, in the heavens that night, of the anger of the great <pb n="262"/>
                    God. They would see that the moon would change its color and would lose its
                    light. They might take this as a token of the punishment which awaited them. </p>
                <p>The Indians had not that confidence in Columbus which they once had. Some derided
                    what he said, some were alarmed, all waited with anxiety and curiosity. When the
                    night came they saw a dark shadow begin to steal over the moon. As the eclipse
                    went forward, their fears increased. At last the mysterious darkness covered the
                    face of the sky and of the world, when they knew that they had a right to expect
                    the glory of the full moon. </p>
                <p>There were then no bounds to their terror. They, seized on all the provisions
                    that they had, they rushed to the ships, they threw themselves at the feet of
                    Columbus and begged him to intercede with his God, to withhold the calamity
                    which he had threatened. Columbus would not receive them; he shut himself up in
                    his cabin and remained there while the eclipse increased, hearing from within,
                    as the narrator says, the howls and prayers of the savages. <pb n="263"/>
                </p>
                <p>It was not until he knew the eclipse was about to diminish, that he condescended
                    to come forth, and told them that he had interceded with God, who would pardon
                    them if they would fulfil their promises. In token of pardon, the darkness would
                    be withdrawn from the moon. </p>
                <p>The Indians saw the fulfilment of the promise, as they had seen the fulfilment of
                    the threat. The moon reappeared in its brilliancy. They thanked the Admiral
                    eagerly for his intercession, and repaired to their homes. From this time
                    forward, having proved that he knew on earth what was passing in the heavens,
                    they propitiated him with their gifts. The supplies came in regularly, and from
                    this time there was no longer any want of provisions. </p>
                <p>But no tales of eclipses would keep the Spaniards quiet. Another conspiracy was
                    formed, as the eight remaining months of exile passed by, among the survivors.
                    They meant to seize the remaining canoes, and with them make their way to
                    Hispaniola. But, at the very point of the outbreak of the new mutiny, a sail was
                    seen standing toward the harbor. <pb n="264"/>
                </p>
                <p>The Spaniards could see that the vessel was small. She kept the offing, but sent
                    a boat on shore. As the boat drew near, those who waited so eagerly recognized
                    Escobar, who had been condemned to death, in Isabella, when Columbus was in
                    administration, and was pardoned by his successor Bobadilla. To see this man
                    approaching for their relief was not hopeful, though he were called a Christian,
                    and was a countryman of their own. </p>
                <p>Escobar drew up to the ships, on which the Spaniards still lived, and gave them a
                    letter from Ovando, the new governor of Hispaniola, with some bacon and a barrel
                    of wine, which were sent as presents to the Admiral. He told Columbus, in a
                    private interview, that the governor had sent him to express his concern at his
                    misfortune, and his regret that he had not a vessel of sufficient size to bring
                    off all the people, but that he would send one as soon as possible. He assured
                    him that his concerns in Hispaniola were attended to faithfully in his absence;
                    he asked him to write to the governor in reply, as he wished to return at once.
                        <pb n="265"/>
                </p>
                <p>This was but scant comfort for men who had been eight months waiting to be
                    relieved. But Escobar was master of the position. Columbus wrote a reply at once
                    to Ovando, pointed out that the difficulties of his situation had been increased
                    by the rebellion of the brothers Porras. He, however, expressed his reliance on
                    his promise, and said he would remain patiently on his ships until relief came.
                    Escobar took the letter, returned to his vessel, and she made sail at once,
                    leaving the starving Spaniards in dismay, to the same fate which hung over them
                    before. </p>
                <p>Columbus tried to reassure them. He professed himself satisfied with the
                    communications from Ovando, and told them that vessels large enough for them
                    would soon arrive. He said that they could see that he believed this, because he
                    had not himself taken passage with Escobar, preferring to share their lot with
                    them. He had sent back the little vessel at once, so that no time might be lost
                    in sending the necessary ships. </p>
                <p>With these assurances he cheered their hearts. In truth, however, he was very
                    indignant at <pb n="266"/> Ovando's cool behavior. That he should have left them
                    for months in danger and uncertainty, with a mere tantalizing message and a
                    scanty present of food &mdash; all this naturally made the great leader
                    indignant. He believed that Ovando hoped that he might perish on the island. </p>
                <p>He supposed that Ovando thought that this would be favorable for his own
                    political prospects, and he believed that Escobar was sent merely as a spy. This
                    same impression is given by Las Casas, the historian, who was then at San
                    Domingo. He says that Escobar was chosen simply because of his enmity to
                    Columbus, and that he was ordered not to land, nor to hold conversation with any
                    of the crew, nor to receive letters from any except the Admiral. </p>
                <p>After Escobar's departure, Columbus sent an embassy on shore to communicate with
                    the rebel party, who were living on the island. He offered to them free pardon,
                    kind treatment, and a passage with him in the ships which he expected from
                    Ovando, and, as a token of good will, he sent them a part of the bacon which
                    Escobar had brought them. <pb n="267"/>
                </p>
                <p>Francesco de Porras met these ambassadors, and replied that they had no wish to
                    return to the ships, but preferred living at large. They offered to engage that
                    they would be peaceable, if the Admiral would promise them solemnly, that, in
                    case two vessels arrived, they should have one to depart in; that if only one
                    vessel arrived they should have half of it, and that the Admiral would now share
                    with them the stores and articles of traffic, which he had left in the ship. But
                    these demands Columbus refused to accept. </p>
                <p>Porras had spoken for the rebels, but they were not so well satisfied with the
                    answer. The incident gave occasion for what was almost an outbreak among them.
                    Porras attempted to hold them in hand, by assuring them that there had been no
                    real arrival of Escobar. He told them that there had been no vessel in port;
                    that what had been seen was a mere phantasm conjured up by Columbus, who was
                    deeply versed in necromancy. </p>
                <p>He reminded them that the vessel arrived just in the edge of the evening; that it
                    communicated with Columbus only, and then disappeared <pb n="268"/> in the
                    night. Had it been a real vessel would he not have embarked, with his brother
                    and his son? Was it not clear that it was only a phantom, which appeared for a
                    moment and then vanished? </p>
                <p>Not satisfied, however, with his control over his men, he marched them to a point
                    near the ships, hoping to plunder the stores and to take the Admiral prisoner.
                    Columbus, however, had notice of the approach of this marauding party, and his
                    brother and fifty followers, of whose loyalty he was sure, armed themselves and
                    marched to meet them. The Adelantado again sent ambassadors, the same whom he
                    had sent before with the offer of pardon, but Porras and his companions would
                    not permit them to approach. </p>
                <p>They determined to offer battle to the fifty loyal men, thinking to attack and
                    kill the Adelantado himself. They rushed upon him and his party, but at the
                    first shock four or five of them were killed. </p>
                <p>The Adelantado, with his own hand, killed Sanchez, one of the most powerful men
                    among the rebels. Porras attacked him in turn, and with his sword cut his
                    buckler and wounded his hand. <pb n="269"/> The sword, however, was wedged in
                    the shield, and before Porras could withdraw it, the Adelantado closed upon him
                    and made him prisoner. When the rebels saw this result of the conflict, they
                    fled in confusion. </p>
                <p>The Indians, meanwhile, amazed at this conflict among men who had descended from
                    heaven, gazed with wonder at the battle. When it was over, they approached the
                    field, and looked with amazement on the dead bodies of the beings whom they had
                    thought immortal. It is said, however, that at the mere sound of a groan from
                    one of the wounded they fled in dismay. </p>
                <p>The Adelantado returned in triumph to the ships. He brought with him his
                    prisoners. Only two of his party had been wounded, himself and his steward. The
                    next day the remaining fugitives sent in a petition to the Admiral, confessing
                    their misdeeds and asking for pardon. </p>
                <p>He saw that their union was broken; he granted their prayer, on the single
                    condition that Francesco de Porras should remain a prisoner. He did not receive
                    them on board the ships, but put them under the command of a loyal officer, to
                    whom he <pb n="270"/> gave a sufficient number of articles for trade, to
                    purchase food of the natives. </p>
                <p>This battle, for it was such, was the last critical incident in the long exile of
                    the Spaniards, for, after a year of hope and fear, two vessels were seen
                    standing into the harbor. One of them was a ship equipped, at Columbus's own
                    expense, by the faithful Mendez; the other had been fitted out afterwards by
                    Ovando, but had sailed in company with the first vessel of relief. </p>
                <p>It would seem that the little public of Isabella had been made indignant by
                    Ovando's neglect, and that he had been compelled, by public opinion to send
                    another vessel as a companion to that sent by Mendez. Mendez himself, having
                    seen the ships depart, went to Spain in the interest of the Admiral. </p>
                <p>With the arrival at Puerto Bueno, in Jamaica, of the two relief vessels,
                    Columbus's chief sufferings and anxiety were over. The responsibility, at least,
                    was in other hands. But the passage to San Domingo consumed six tedious weeks.
                    When he arrived, however, it was to meet one of his triumphs. He could hardly
                    have expected it. <pb n="271"/>
                </p>
                <p>But his sufferings, and the sense of wrong that he had suffered, had, in truth,
                    awakened the regard of the people of the colony. Ovando took him as a guest to
                    his house. The people received him with distinction. </p>
                <p>He found little to gratify him, however. Ovando, had ruled the poor natives with
                    a rod of iron, and they were wretched. Columbus's own affairs had been
                    neglected, and he could gain no relief from the governor. He spent only a month
                    on the island, trying, as best he could, to bring some order into the
                    administration of his own property; and then, on the twelfth of September, 1504,
                    sailed for Spain. </p>
                <p>Scarcely had the ship left harbor when she was dismasted in a squall. He was
                    obliged to cross to another ship, under command of his brother, the Adelantado.
                    She also was unfortunate. Her mainmast was sprung in a storm, and she could not
                    go on until the mast was shortened. </p>
                <p>In another gale the foremast was sprung, and it was only on the seventh of
                    November that the shattered and storm-pursued vessel arrived at San Lucar.
                    Columbus himself had been suffering, <pb n="272"/> through the voyage, from gout
                    and his other maladies. The voyage was, indeed, a harsh experience for a sick
                    man, almost seventy years old. </p>
                <p>He went at once to Seville, to find such rest as he might, for body and mind.</p>

                    CHARACTER. </head>

                <p>Columbus had been absent from Spain two years and six months. He returned broken
                    in health, and the remaining two years of his life are only the sad history of
                    his effort to relieve his name from dishonor and to leave to his sons a fair
                    opportunity to carry forward his work in the world. </p>
                <p>Isabella, alas, died on the twenty-sixth day of November, only a short time after
                    his arrival. Ferdinand, at the least, was cold and hard toward him, and
                    Ferdinand was now engaged in many affairs other than those of discovery. He was
                    satisfied that Columbus did not know how to bring gold home from the colonies,
                    and the <pb n="274"/> promises of the last voyage, that they should strike the
                    East, had not been fulfilled. </p>
                <p>Isabella had testified her kindly memory of Columbus, even while he was in exile
                    at Jamaica, by making him one of the body-guard of her oldest son, an honorary
                    appointment which carried with it a handsome annual salary. After the return to
                    Spain of Diego Mendez, the loyal friend who had cared for his interests so well
                    in San Domingo, she had raised him to noble rank. </p>
                <p>It is clear, therefore, that among her last thoughts came in the wish to do
                    justice to him whom she had served so well. She had well done he{sic} duty which
                    had been given her to do. She had never forgotten the new world to which it was
                    her good fortune to send the discoverer, and in her death that discoverer lost
                    his best friend. </p>
                <p>On his arrival in Seville, where one might say he had a right to rest himself and
                    do nothing else, Columbus engaged at once in efforts to see that the seamen who
                    had accompanied him in this last adventure should be properly paid. Many of
                    these men had been disloyal to him and unfaithful to <pb n="275"/> their
                    sovereign, but Columbus, with his own magnanimity, represented eagerly at court
                    that they had endured great peril, that they brought great news, and that the
                    king ought to repay them all that they had earned. </p>
                <p>He says, in a letter to his son written at this period, "I have not a roof over
                    my head in Castile. I have no place to eat nor to sleep excepting a tavern, and
                    there I am often too poor to pay my scot." This passage has been quoted as if he
                    were living as a beggar at this time, and the world has been asked to believe
                    that a man who had a tenth of the revenue of the Indies due to him in some
                    fashion, was actually living from hand to mouth from day to day. But this is a
                    mere absurdity of exaggeration. </p>
                <p>Undoubtedly, he was frequently pressed for ready money. He says to his son, in
                    another letter, "I only live by borrowing." Still he had good credit with the
                    Genoese bankers established in Andalusia. In writing to his son he begs him to
                    economize, but at the same time he acknowledges the receipt of bills of exchange
                    and considerable sums of money. <pb n="276"/>
                </p>
                <p>In the month of December, there is a single transaction in Hispaniola which
                    amounts to five thousand dollars of our money. We must not, therefore, take
                    literally his statement that he was too poor to pay for a night's lodging. On
                    the other hand, it is observed in the correspondence that, on the fifteenth of
                    April, 1505, the king ordered that everything which belonged to Columbus on
                    account of his ten per cent should be carried to the royal treasury as a
                    security for certain debts contracted by the Admiral. </p>
                <p>The king had also given an order to the royal agent in Hispaniola that everything
                    which he owned there should be sold. All these details have been carefully
                    brought together by Mr. Harrisse, who says truly that we cannot understand the
                    last order. </p>
                <p>When at last the official proceedings relating to the affairs in Jamaica arrived
                    in Europe, Columbus made an effort to go to court. A litter was provided for
                    him, and all the preparations for his journey made. But he was obliged once more
                    by his weakness to give up this plan, and he could only write letters pressing
                    his claim. Of <pb n="277"/> such letters the misfortune is, that the longer they
                    are, and the more of the detail they give, the less likely are they to be read.
                    Columbus could only write at night; in the daytime he could not use his hands. </p>
                <p>He took care to show Ferdinand that his interests had not been properly attended
                    to in the islands. He said that Ovando had been careless as to the king's
                    service, and he was not unwilling to let it be understood that his own
                    administration had been based on a more intelligent policy than that of either
                    of the men who followed him. </p>
                <p>But he was now an old man. He was unable to go to court in person. He had not
                    succeeded in that which he had sailed for &mdash; a strait opening to the
                    Southern Sea. He had discovered new gold mines on the continent, but he had
                    brought home but little treasure. His answers from the court seemed to him
                    formal and unsatisfactory. At court, the stories of the Porras brothers were
                    told on the one side, while Diego Mendez and Carvajal represented Columbus. </p>
                <p>In this period of the fading life of Columbus, we have eleven letters addressed
                    by him to his <pb n="278"/> son. These show that he was in Seville as late as
                    February, 1505. From the authority of Las Casas, we know that he left that part
                    of Spain to go to Segovia in the next May, and from that place he followed the
                    court to Salamanca and Valladolid, although he was so weak and ill. </p>
                <p>He was received, as he had always been, with professions of kindness; but nothing
                    followed important enough to show that there was anything genuine in this
                    cordiality. After a few days Columbus begged that some action might be taken to
                    indemnify him for his losses, and to confirm the promises which had been made to
                    him before. The king replied that he was willing to refer all points which had
                    been discussed between them to an arbitration. Columbus assented, and proposed
                    the Archbishop Diego de Deza as an arbiter. </p>
                <p>The reader must remember that it was he who had assisted Columbus in early days
                    when the inquiry was made at Salamanca. The king assented to the arbitration,
                    but proposed that it should include questions which Columbus would <pb n="279"/>
                    not consider as doubtful. One of these was his restoration to his office of
                    viceroy. </p>
                <p>Now on the subject of his dignities Columbus was tenacious. He regarded
                    everything else as unimportant in comparison. He would not admit that there was
                    any question that he was the viceroy of the Indies, and all this discussion
                    ended in the postponement of all consideration of his claims till, after his
                    death, it was too late for them to be considered. </p>
                <p>All the documents, when read with the interest which we take in his character and
                    fortunes, are indeed pathetic; but they did not seem so to the king, if indeed
                    they ever met his eye. </p>
                <p>In despair of obtaining justice for himself, Columbus asked that his son Diego
                    might be sent to Hispaniola in his place. The king would promise nothing, but
                    seems to have attempted to make Columbus exchange the privileges which he
                    enjoyed by the royal promise for a seignory in a little town in the kingdom of
                    Leon, which is named not improperly "The Counts' Carrion." </p>
                <p>It is interesting to see that one of the persons whom he employed, in pressing
                    his claim at the <pb n="280"/> court and in the management of his affairs, was
                    Vespucci, the Florentine merchant, who in early life had been known as Alberigo,
                    but had now taken the name of Americo. </p>
                <p>The king was still engaged in the affairs of the islands. He appointed bishops to
                    take charge of the churches in the colonies, but Columbus was not so much as
                    consulted as to the persons who should be sent. When Philip arrived from
                    Flanders, with his wife Juana, who was the heir of Isabella's fortunes and
                    crown, Columbus wished to pay his court to them, but was too weak to do so in
                    person. </p>
                <p>There is a manly letter, written with dignity and pathos, in which he presses his
                    claims upon them. He commissioned his brother, the Adelantado, to take this
                    letter, and with it he went to wait upon the young couple. They received him
                    most cordially, and gave flattering hopes that they would attend favorably to
                    the suit. But this was too late for Columbus himself. Immediately after he had
                    sent his brother away, his illness increased in violence. </p>
                <p>The time for petitions and for answers to petitions had come to an end. His
                    health <pb n="281"/> failed steadily, and in the month of May he knew that he
                    was approaching his death. The king and the court had gone to Villafranca de
                    Valcacar. </p>
                <p>On the nineteenth of May Columbus executed his will, which had been prepared at
                    Segovia a year before. In this will he directs his son and his successors,
                    acting as administrators, always to maintain "in the city of Genoa, some person
                    of our line, who shall have a house and a wife in that place, who shall receive
                    a sufficient income to live honorably, as being one of our relatives, having
                    foot and root in the said city, as a native; since he will be able to receive
                    from this city aid in favor of the things of his service; because from that city
                    I came forth and in that city I was born." This clause became the subject of
                    much litigation as the century went on. </p>
                <p>Another clause which was much contested was his direction to his son Diego to
                    take care of Beatriz Enriquez, the mother of Fernando. Diego is instructed to
                    provide for her an honorable subsistence "as being a person to whom I have great
                    obligation. What I do in this matter is to relieve <pb n="282"/> my conscience,
                    for this weighs much upon my mind. The reason of this cannot be written here." </p>
                <p>The history of the litigation which followed upon this will and upon other
                    documents which bear upon the fortunes of Columbus is curious, but scarcely
                    interesting. The present representative of Columbus is Don Cristobal Colon de la
                    Cerda, Duke of Veragua and of La Vega, a grandee of Spain of the first class,
                    Marquis of Jamaica, Admiral and Seneschal Major of the Indies, who lives at
                    Madrid. </p>
                <p>Two days after the authentication of the will he died, on the twenty first of
                    May, 1506, which was the day of Ascension. His last words were those of his
                    Saviour, expressed in the language of the Latin Testament, <hi rend="italic">"In
                        manus tuas, Pater, commendo spiritum meum</hi>," &mdash; "Father, into
                    thy hands I commend my spirit." The absence of the court from Valladolid took
                    with it, perhaps, the historians and annalists. For this or for some other
                    reason, there is no mention whatever of Columbus's funeral in any of the
                    documents of the time. <pb n="283"/>
                </p>
                <p>The body was laid in the convent of San Francisco at Valladolid. Such at least is
                    the supposition of Navarrete, who has collected the original documents relating
                    to Columbus. He supposes that the funeral services were conducted in the church
                    of the parish of Santa Maria de la Antigua. From the church of Saint Francis,
                    not many months after, the body was removed to Seville. A new chapel had lately
                    been built there, called Santa Maria de las Cuevas. In this chapel was the body
                    of Columbus entombed. In a curious discussion of the subject, which has occupied
                    much more space than it is worth, it is supposed that this was in the year 1513,
                    but Mr. Harrisse has proved that this date is not accurate. </p>
                <p>For at least twenty-eight years, the body was permitted to remain under the
                    vaults of this chapel. Then a petition was sent to Charles V, for leave to carry
                    the coffin and the body to San Domingo, that it might be buried in the larger
                    chapel of the cathedral of that city. To this the emperor consented, in a decree
                    signed June 2, 1537. It is not known how soon the removal to <pb n="284"/> San
                    Domingo was really made, but it took place before many years. </p>
                <p>Mr. Harrisse quotes from a manuscript authority to show, that when William Penn
                    besieged the city of San Domingo in 1655, all the bodies buried under the
                    cathedral were withdrawn from view, lest the heretics should profane them, and
                    that "the old Admiral's" body was treated like the rest. </p>
                <p>Mr. Harrisse calls to mind the fact that the earthquake of the nineteenth of May,
                    1673, demolished the cathedral in part, and the tombs which it contained. He
                    says, "the ruin of the colony, the climate, weather, and carelessness all
                    contributed to the loss from sight and the forgetfulness of the bones of
                    Columbus, mingled with the dust of his descendants"; and Mr. Harrisse does not
                    believe that any vestige of them was ever found afterwards, in San Domingo or
                    anywhere else. This remark, from the person who has given such large attention
                    to the subject, is interesting. For it is generally stated and believed that the
                    bones were afterwards removed to Havana in the island of Cuba. The opinion of
                        <pb n="285"/> Mr. Harrisse, as it has been quoted, is entitled to very great
                    respect and authority. </p>
                <p>A very curious question has arisen in later times as to the actual place where
                    the remains now are. On this question there is great discussion among
                    historians, and many reports, official and unofficial, have been published with
                    regard to it. </p>
                <p>In the year 1867, the proposal was made to the Holy Father at Rome, that Columbus
                    should receive the honors known in the Roman Catholic Church as the honors of
                    beatification. In 1877, De Lorgues, the enthusiastic biographer of Columbus,
                    represents that the inquiry had gone so far that these honors had been
                    determined on. One who reads his book would be led to suppose that Columbus had
                    already been recognized as on the way to be made a saint of the Church. But, in
                    truth, though some such inquiry was set on foot, he never received the formal
                    honors of beatification.<lb/> &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; </p>
                <p>We have one account by a contemporary of the appearance of Columbus.<ref n="16"
                        target="HalLife.16">[*]</ref> We are told that he <pb n="286"/> was a robust
                    man, quite tall, of florid complexion, with a long face."</p>


                <p>In the next generation, Oviedo says Columbus was "of good aspect, and above the
                    middle stature. His limbs were strong, his eyes quick, and all the parts of his
                    body well proportioned. His hair was decidedly reddish, and the complexion of
                    his face quite florid and marked with spots of red." </p>
                <p>Bishop Las Casas knew the admiral personally, and describes him in these terms:
                    "He was above the middle stature, his face was long and striking, his nose was
                    aquiline, his eyes clear blue, his complexion light, tending towards a distinct
                    florid expression, his beard and hair blonde in his youth, but they were
                    blanched at an early age by care. </p>
                <p>Las Casas says in another place, he was rude in bearing, and careless as to his
                    language. He was, however, gracious when he chose to be, but he was angry when
                    he was annoyed." </p>
                <p>Mr. Harrisse, who has collected these particulars from the different writers,
                    says that this physical type may be frequently met now in the <pb n="287"/> city
                    and neighborhood of Genoa. He adds, "as for the portraits, whether painted,
                    engraved, or in sculpture, which appear in collections, in private places, or as
                    prints, there is not one which is authentic. They are all purely imaginary." </p>
                <p>For the purpose of the illustration of this volume, we have used that which is
                    best known, and for many reasons most interesting. It is preserved in the city
                    of Florence, but neither the name of the artist nor the date of the picture is
                    known. It is generally spoken of as the "Florentine portrait." The engraving
                    follows an excellent copy, made by the order of Thomas Jefferson, and now in the
                    possession of the Massachusetts Historical Society. We are indebted to the
                    government of this society for permission to use it.<ref n="17"

                </p>
                <p>A picture ascribed to Titian, and engraved and circulated by the geographer,
                    Jomard, resembles closely the portraits of Philip III. The costume is one which
                    Columbus never wore. </p>
                <p>In his youth Columbus was affiliated with a <pb n="288"/> religious brotherhood,
                    that of Saint Catherine, in Genoa. In after times, on many occasions when it
                    would have been supposed that he would be richly clothed, he appeared in a grave
                    dress which recalled the recollections of the frock of the religious order of
                    Saint Francis. According to Diego Columbus, he died, "dressed in the frock of
                    this order, to which he had always been attached."<lb/> &mdash; &mdash;
                    &mdash; &mdash; </p>
                <p>The reader who has carefully followed the fortunes of the great discoverer
                    understands from the history the character of the man. He would not have
                    succeeded in his long suit at the court of Ferdinand and Isabella, had he not
                    been a person of single purpose and iron will. </p>
                <p>From the moment when he was in command of the first expedition, that expedition
                    went prosperously to its great success, in precisely the way which he had
                    foreseen and determined. True, he did not discover Asia, as he had hoped, but
                    this was because America was in the way. He showed in that voyage all the
                    attributes of a great discoverer; he deserved the honors which were paid to him
                    on his return. <pb n="289"/>
                </p>
                <p>As has been said, however, this does not mean that he was a great organizer of
                    cities, or that he was the right person to put in charge of a newly founded
                    colony. It has happened more than once in the history of nations that a great
                    general, who can conquer armies and can obtain peace, has not succeeded in
                    establishing a colony or in governing a city. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, it is fair to say that Columbus never had a chance to show
                    what he would have been in the direction of his colonies had they been really
                    left in his charge. This is true, that his heart was always on discovery; all
                    the time that he spent in the wretched detail of the arrangement of a new-built
                    town was time which really seemed to him wasted. </p>
                <p>The great problem was always before him, how he should connect his discoveries
                    with the knowledge which Europe had before of the coast of Asia. Always it
                    seemed to him that the dominions of the Great Khan were within his reach. Always
                    he was eager for that happy moment when he should find himself in personal
                    communication with that great monarch, who had been <pb n="290"/> so long the
                    monarch of the East &mdash; who, as he thought, would prove to be the
                    monarch of the West. </p>
                <p>Columbus died with the idea that he had come close to Asia. Even a generation
                    after his death, the companions of Cortes gave to the peninsula of California
                    that name because it was the name given in romance to the farthest island of the
                    eastern Indies. </p>
                <p>Columbus met with many reverses, and died, one might almost say, a broken-hearted
                    man. But history has been just to him, and has placed him in the foremost rank
                    of the men who have set the world forward. And, outside of the technical study
                    of history, those who like to trace the laws on which human progress advances
                    have been proud and glad to see that here is a noble example of the triumph of
                    faith. </p>
                <p>The life of Columbus is an illustration constantly brought forward of the success
                    which God gives to those who, having conceived of a great idea, bravely
                    determine to carry it through. </p>
                <p>His singleness of purpose, his unselfishness, his determination to succeed, have
                    been cited for <pb n="291"/> four centuries, and will be cited for centuries
                    more, among the noblest illustrations which history has given, of success
                    wrought out by the courage of one man.</p>

                <p>[The following passages, from Admiral Fox's report, give his reasons for
                    believing that Samana, or Atwood's Key, is the island where Columbus first
                    touched land. The interest which attaches to this subject at the moment of the
                    centennial, when many voyages will be made by persons following Columbus,
                    induces me to copy Admiral Fox's reasonings in detail. I believe his conclusion
                    to be correct.] </p>
                <p>This method of applying Columbus's words in detail to refute each of the alleged
                    tracks, and the study that I gave to the subject in the winter of 1878-79 in the
                    Bahamas, which has been familiar cruising ground to me, has resulted in the
                    selection of Samana or Atwood's Key for the first landing place. </p>
                <p>It is a little island 8.8 miles east and west; 1.6 extreme breadth, and averaging
                    1.2 north and south. It has 8.6 square miles. The east end is in latitude
                    23&deg; 5' N.; longitude 73&deg; 37' west of Greenwich. The reef on
                    which it lies is 15 by 2&frac12; miles. </p>
                <p>On the southeast this reef stretches half a mile from the land, on the east four
                    miles, on the west two, along the north shore one-quarter to one-half <pb
                        n="294"/> mile, and on the southwest scarcely one-quarter. Turk is smaller
                    than Samana, and Cat very much larger. </p>
                <p>The selection of two so unlike in size show that dimension has not been
                    considered essential in choosing an island for the first landfall.<ref n="18"

                </p>
                <p>When Columbus discovered Guanahani, the journal called it a "little island."
                    After landing he speaks of it as "bien grande," "very large," which some
                    translate, tolerably, or pretty large. November 20, 1492 (Navarette, first
                    edition, p. 61), the journal refers to Isabella, a larger island than Guanahani,
                    as "little island," and the fifth of January following (p. 125) San Salvador is
                    again called "little island." </p>
                <p>The Bahamas have an area of about 37,000 <pb n="295"/> square miles, six per cent
                    of which may be land, enumerated as 36 islands, 687 keys, and 2,414 rocks. The
                    submarine bank upon which these rest underlies Florida also. But this peninsula
                    is wave-formed upon living corals, whose growth and gradual stretch toward the
                    south has been made known by Agassiz. </p>
                <p>I had an unsuccessful search for a similar story of the Bahamas, to learn whether
                    there were any probable changes within so recent a period as four hundred years. </p>
                <p>The common mind can see that all the rock there is coral, none of which is in
                    position. The surface, the caves, the chinks, and the numerous pot-holes are
                    compact limestone, often quite crystalline, while beneath it is oolitic, either
                    friable or hard enough to be used for buildings. The hills are sand-blown, not
                    upheaved. On a majority of the maps of the sixteenth century there were islands
                    on Mouchoir, and on Silver Banks, where now are rocks "awash;" and the Dutch and
                    the Severn Shoals, which lay to the east, have disappeared. </p>
                <p>It is difficult to resist the impression that the shoal banks, and the reefs of
                    the Bahamas, were formerly covered with land; and that for a geological age
                    waste has been going on, and, perhaps, <pb n="296"/> subsidence. The coral polyp
                    seems to be doing only desultory work, and that mostly on the northeast or
                    Atlantic side of the islands; everywhere else it has abandoned the field to the
                    erosive action of the waves. </p>
                <p>Columbus said that Guanahani had abundance of water and a very large lagoon in
                    the middle of it. He used the word <hi rend="italic">laguna</hi> &mdash;
                    lagoon, not <hi rend="italic">lago</hi> &mdash; lake. His arrival in the
                    Bahamas was at the height of the rainy season. Govenor{sic} Rawson's Report on
                    the Bahamas, 1864, page 92, Appendix 4, gives the annual rainfall at Nassau for
                    ten years, 1855 &mdash; '64, as sixty-four inches. From May 1, to November 1
                    is the wet season, during which 44.7 inches fall; the other six months 19.3
                    only. The most is in October, 8.5 inches. </p>
                <p>Andros, the largest island, 1,600 square miles, is the only one that has a stream
                    of water. The subdivision of the land into so many islands and keys, the absence
                    of mountains, the showery characteristic of the rainfall, the porosity of the
                    rock, and the great heat reflected from the white coral, are the chief causes
                    for the want of running water. During the rainy season the "abundance of water"
                    collects in the low places, making ponds and lagoons, that afterward are soaked
                    up by the rock and evaporated by the sun. <pb n="297"/>
                </p>
                <p>Turk and Watling have lagoons of a more permanent condition, because they are
                    maintained from the ocean by permeation. The lagoon which Columbus found at
                    Guanahani had certainly undrinkable water, or he would have gotten some for his
                    vessels, instead of putting it off until he reached the third island. </p>
                <p>There is nothing in the journal to indicate that the lagoon at Guanahani was
                    aught but the flooding of the low grounds by excessive rains; and even if it was
                    one communicating with the ocean, its absence now may be referred to the effect
                    of those agencies which are working incessantly to reshape the soft structure of
                    the Bahamas. </p>
                <p>Samana has a range of hills on the southwest side about one hundred feet high,
                    and on the northeast another, lower. Between them, and also along the north
                    shore, the land is low, and during the season of rains there is a row of ponds
                    parallel to the shore. On the south side a conspicuous white bluff looks to the
                    southward and eastward. </p>
                <p>The two keys, lying respectively half a mile and three miles east of the island,
                    and possibly the outer breaker, which is four miles, all might have been
                    connected with each other, and with the island, four hundred years ago. In that
                        <pb n="298"/> event the most convenient place for Columbus to anchor in the
                    strong northeast trade-wind, was where I have put an anchor on the sub-sketch of
                    Samana. </p>
                <p>[In a subsequent passage Admiral Fox says: &mdash; ] </p>
                <p>There is a common belief that the first landing place is settled by one or
                    another of the authors cited here. Nevertheless, I trust to have shown,
                    paragraph by paragraph, wherein their several tracks are contrary to the
                    journal, inconsistent with the true cartography of the neighborhood, and to the
                    discredit, measurably, both of Columbus and of Las Casas. The obscurity and the
                    carelessness which appear in part of the diary through the Bahamas offer no
                    obstacle to this demonstration, provided that they do not extend to the "log,"
                    or nautical part. </p>
                <p>Columbus went to sea when he was fourteen years of age, and served there almost
                    continuously for twenty-three years. The strain of a sea-faring life, from so
                    tender an age, is not conducive to literary exactness. Still, for the very
                    reason of this sea experience, the "log" should be correct. </p>
                <p>This is composed of the courses steered, distances sailed over, bearings of
                    islands from one another, trend of shores, etc. The recording of these is <pb
                        n="299"/> the daily business of seamen, and here the entries were by
                    Columbus himself, chiefly to enable him, on his return to Spain, to construct
                    that nautical map, which is promised in the prologue of the first voyage. </p>
                <p>In crossing the Atlantic the Admiral understated to the crew each day's run, so
                    that they should not know how far they had gone into an unknown ocean. Las Casas
                    was aware of this counterfeit "log," but his abridgment is from that one which
                    Columbus kept for his own use. </p>
                <p>If the complicated courses and distances in this were originally wrong, or if the
                    copy of them is false, it is obvious that they cannot be "plotted " upon a
                    correct chart. Conversely, if they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> made to conform to
                    a succession of islands among which he is known to have sailed, it is evident
                    that this is a genuine transcript of the authentic "log" of Columbus, and,
                    reciprocally, that we have the true track, the beginning of which is the
                    eventful landfall of October 12, 1492. </p>
                <p>The student or critical reader, and the seaman, will have to determine whether
                    the writer has established this conformity. The public, probably, desires to
                    have the question settled, but it will hardly take any interest in a discussion
                    that has <pb n="300"/> no practical bearing, and which, for its elucidation,
                    leans so much upon the jargon or the sea. </p>
                <p>It is not flattering to the English or Spanish speaking peoples that the four
                    hundredth anniversary of this great event draws nigh, and is likely to catch us
                    still floundering, touching the first landing place.</p>


                <p>SUMMARY.</p>

                <p>First. There is no objection to Samana in respect to size, position or shape.
                    That it is a little island, lying east and west, is in its favor. The erosion at
                    the east end, by which islets have been formed, recalls the assertion of
                    Columbus that there it could be cut off in two days and made into an island. </p>
                <p>The Nassau vessels still find a snug anchorage here during the northeast trades.
                    These blew half a gale of wind at the time of the landfall; yet Navarette,
                    Varnhagen, and Captain Becher anchored the squadron on the windward sides of the
                    coral reefs of their respective islands, a "lee shore." </p>
                <p>The absence of permanent lagoons at Samana I have tried to explain. </p>
                <p>Second. The course from Samana to Crooked is to the southwest, which is the
                    direction that the Admiral said be should steer "tomorrow <pb n="301"/>
                    evening." The distance given by him corresponds with the chart. </p>
                <p>Third. The second island, Santa Maria, is described as having two sides which
                    made a right angle, and the length of each is given. This points directly to
                    Crooked and Acklin. Both form one island, so fitted to the words of the journal
                    as cannot be done with any other land of the Bahamas. </p>
                <p>Fourth. The course and distance from Crooked to Long Island is that which the
                    Admiral gives from Santa Maria to Fernandina. </p>
                <p>Fifth. Long Island, the third, is accurately described. The trend of the shores,
                    "north-northwest and south-southeast;" the "marvelous port" and the "coast which
                    runs east [and] west," can nowhere be found except at the southeast part of Long
                    Island. </p>
                <p>Sixth. The journal is obscure in regard to the fourth island. The best way to
                    find it is to "plot" the courses <hi rend="italic">forward</hi> from the third
                    island and the courses and distances <hi rend="italic">backward</hi> from the
                    fifth. These lead to Fortune for the fourth. </p>
                <p>Seventh. The Ragged Islands are the fifth. These he named <hi rend="italic">las
                        islas de Arena</hi> &mdash; Sand Islands. </p>
                <p>They lie west-southwest from the fourth, and this is the course the Admiral
                    adhered to. He <pb n="302"/> did not "log" all the run made between these
                    islands; in consequence the "log" falls short of the true distance, as it ought
                    to. These "seven or eight islands, all extending from north to south," and
                    having shoal water "six leagues to the south" of them, are seen on the chart at
                    a glance. </p>
                <p>Eighth. The course and distance from these to Port Padre, in Cuba, is reasonable.
                    The westerly current, the depth of water at the entrance of Padre, and the
                    general description, are free of difficulties. The true distance is greater than
                    the "logged," because Columbus again omits part of his run. It would be awkward
                    if the true distances from the fourth to the fifth islands, and from the latter
                    to Padre, had fallen short of the "log," since it would make the unexplainable
                    situation which occurs in Irving's course and distance from Mucaras Reef to Boca
                    de Caravela. </p>
                <p>From end to end of the Samana track there are but three discrepancies. At the
                    third island, two leagues ought to be two miles. At the fourth island twelve
                    leagues ought to be twelve miles. The bearing between the third and fourth
                    islands is not quite as the chart has it, nor does it agree with the courses he
                    steered. These three are <pb n="303"/> fairly explained, and I think that no
                    others can be mustered to disturb the concord between this track and the
                    journal.<lb/> &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; </p>
                <p>Rev. Mr. Cronan, in his recent voyage, discovered a cave at Watling's island,
                    where were many skeletons of the natives. It is thought that a study of the
                    bones in these skeletons will give some new ethnological information as to the
                    race which Columbus found, which is now, thanks to Spanish cruelty, entirely
                    extinct.</p>

                    <p> I am indebted to T. J. McLain, Esq., United States consul at Nassau, for the
                        following information given to him by the captains of this port, who visit
                        Samana or Atwood's Key. The sub-sketch on this chart is substantially
                        correct: Good water is only obtained by sinking wells. The two keys to the
                        east are covered with guano; white boobies hold the larger one, and black
                        boobies the other; neither intermingles.</p>
                    <p>The island is now uninhabited, but arrow heads and stone hatchets are
                        sometimes found; and in places there are piles of stones supposed to have
                        been made by the aborigines. Most of the growth is scrubby, with a few
                        scattered trees.</p>
                    <p>The Nassau vessels enter an opening through the reef on the south side of the
                        island and find a very comfortable little harbor with from two to two and a
                        half fathoms of water. From here they send their boats on shore to "strip"
                        guano, and cut satin, dye woods and bark.</p>

                <p>The letter to the Lady Juana, which gives Columbus's own statement of the
                    indignities put upon him in San Domingo, is written in his most crabbed Spanish.
                    He never wrote the Spanish language accurately, and the letter, as printed from
                    his own manuscript, is even curious in its infelicities. It is so striking an
                    illustration of the character of the man that we print here an abstract of it,
                    with some passages translated directly from his own language. </p>
                <p>Columbus writes, towards the end of the year 1500, to the former nurse of Don
                    Juan, an account of the treatment he has received. "If my complaint of the world
                    is new, its method of abuse is very old," he says. "God has made me a messenger
                    of the new heaven and the new earth which is spoken of in the Apocalypse by the
                    mouth of St. John, after having been spoken of by Isaiah, and he showed me the
                    place where it was." Everybody was incredulous, but the queen alone gave the
                    spirit of intelligence and zeal to the undertaking. Then the people talked of
                    obstacles and expense. Columbus says "seven years passed in talk, and nine <pb
                        n="305"/> in executing some noted acts which are worthy of remembrance," but
                    he returned reviled by all. </p>
                <p>"If I had stolen the Indies and had given them to the Moors I could not have had
                    greater enmity shown to me in Spain." Columbus would have liked then to give up
                    the business if he could have come before the queen. However he persisted, and
                    he says he "undertook a new voyage to the new heaven and the new earth which
                    before had been hidden, and if it is not appreciated in Spain as much as the
                    other countries of India it is not surprising, because it is all owing to my
                    industry." He "had believed that the voyage to Paria would reconcile all because
                    of the pearls and gold in the islands of Espanola." He says, "I caused those of
                    our people whom I had left there to come together and fish for pearls, and
                    arranged that I should return and take from them what had been collected, as I
                    understood, in measure a <hi rend="italic">fanega</hi> (about a bushel). If I
                    have not written this to their Highnesses it is because I wished also to have as
                    much of gold. But that fled before me, as all other things; I would not have
                    lost them and with them my honor, if I could have busied myself with my own
                    affairs. </p>
                <p>"When I went to San Domingo I found almost half of the colony uprising, and they
                    made war <pb n="306"/> upon me as a Moor, and the Indians on the other side were
                    no less cruel. </p>
                <p>"Hojida came and he tried to make order, and he said that their Highnesses had
                    sent him with promises of gifts and grants and money. He made up a large
                    company, for in all Espanola there were few men who were not vagabonds, and no
                    one lived there who had wife or children." Hojida retired with threats. </p>
                <p>"Then Vincente Ganez came with four ships. There were outbreaks and suspicions
                    but no damage." He reported that six other ships under a brother of the Alcalde
                    would arrive, and also the death of the queen, but these were rumors without
                    foundation. </p>
                <p>"Adrian (Mogica) attempted to go away as before, but our Lord did not permit him
                    to carry out his bad plan." Here Columbus regrets that he was obliged to use
                    force or ill-treat Adrian, but says he would have done the same had his brother
                    wished to kill him or wrest from him the government which the king and queen had
                    given him to guard. </p>
                <p>"For six months I was ready to leave to take to their Highnesses the good news of
                    the gold and to stop governing a dissolute people who feared neither king nor
                    queen, full of meanness and <pb n="307"/> malice. I would have been able to pay
                    all the people with six hundred thousand <hi rend="italic">maravedis</hi> and
                    for that there were more than four millions of tithes without counting the third
                    part of the gold." </p>
                <p>Columbus says that be begged before his departure that they would send some one
                    at his expense to take command, and yet again a subject with letters, for he
                    says bitterly that he has such a singular reputation that if he "were building
                    churches and hospitals they would say they were cells for stolen goods." </p>
                <p>Then Bobadilla came to Santo Domingo while Columbus was at LaVega and the
                    Adelantado at Jaragua. "The second day of his arrival he declared himself
                    governor, created magistrates, made offices, published grants for gold and
                    tithes, and everything else for a term of twenty years." He said he had come to
                    pay the people, and declared he would send Columbus home in irons. Columbus was
                    away. Letters with favors were sent to others, but none to him. Columbus
                    resorted to methods to gain time so that their Highnesses could understand the
                    state of things. But he was constantly maligned and persecuted by those who were
                    jealous of him. He says: </p>
                <p>"I think that you will remember that when the tempest threw me into the port of
                    Lisbon, after <pb n="308"/> having lost my sails, I was accused of having the
                    intention to give India to that country. Afterwards their Highnesses knew to the
                    contrary. Although I know but little, I cannot conceive that any one would
                    suppose me so stupid as not to know that though India might belong to me, yet I
                    could not keep it without the help of a prince." </p>
                <p>Columbus complains that he has been judged as a governor who has been sent to a
                    peaceful, well-regulated province. He says, "I ought to be judged as a captain
                    sent from Spain to the Indies to conquer a warlike people, whose custom and
                    religion are all opposed to ours, where the people live in the mountains without
                    regular houses for themselves, and where, by the will of God, I have placed
                    under the rule of the king and queen another world, and by which Spain, which
                    calls itself poor, is today the richest empire. I ought to be judged as a
                    captain who for many years bears arms incessantly. </p>
                <p>"I know well that the errors that I have committed have not been with bad
                    intentions, and I think that their Highnesses will believe what I say; but I
                    know and see that they use pity for those who work against them." </p>
                <p>"If, nevertheless, their Highnesses order that another shall judge me, which I
                    hope will not be, <pb n="309"/> and this ought to be on an examination made in
                    India, I humbly beg of them to send there two conscientious and respectable
                    people, at my expense, which may know easily that one finds five marcs of gold
                    in four hours. However that may be, it is very necessary that they should go
                    there."<lb/> &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; </p>

                <p>It would have been so natural to give the name of Columbus to the new world which
                    he gave to Castile and Leon, that much wonder has been expressed that America
                    was not called Columbia, and many efforts have been made to give to the
                    continent this name. The District of Columbia was so named at a time when
                    American writers of poetry, were determined that "Columbia" should be the name
                    of the continent. The ship Columbia, from which the great river of the West
                    takes that name, had received this name under the same circumstances about the
                    same time. The city of Columbia, which is the capital of South Carolina, was
                    named with the same wish to do justice to the great navigator. </p>
                <p>Side by side with the discussion as to the name, and sometimes making a part of
                    it, is the question <pb n="310"/> whether Columbus himself was really the first
                    discoverer of the mainland. The reader has seen that he first saw the mainland
                    of South America in the beginning of August, 1498. It was on the fifth, sixth or
                    seventh day, according to Mr. Harrisse's accurate study of the letters. Was this
                    the first discovery by a European of the mainland? </p>
                <p>It is known that Ojeda, with whom the reader is familiar, also saw this coast.
                    With him, as passenger on his vessel, was Alberico Vespucci, and at one time it
                    was supposed that Vespucci had made some claim to be the discoverer of the
                    continent, on account of this voyage. But in truth Ojeda himself says that
                    before he sailed he had seen the map of the Gulf of Paria which Columbus had
                    sent home to the sovereigns after he made that discovery. It also seems to be
                    proved that Alberico Vespucci, as he was then called, never made for himself any
                    claim to the great discovery. </p>
                <p>Another question, of a certain interest to people proud of English maritime
                    science, is the question whether the Cabots did not see the mainland before
                    Columbus. It is admitted on all hands that they did not make their first voyage
                    till they knew of Columbus's first discoveries; but it is supposed that in the
                    first or second voyage of the Cabots, <pb n="311"/> they saw the mainland of
                    North America. The dates of the Cabots' voyages are unfortunately badly
                    entangled. One of them is as early as 1494, but this is generally rejected. It
                    is more probable that the king's letters patent, authorizing John Cabot and his
                    three sons to go, with five vessels, under the English flag, for the discovery
                    of islands and countries yet unknown," was dated the fifth of March, 1496.
                    Whether, however, they sailed in that year or in the next year is a question.
                    The first record of a discovery is in the account-book of the privy purse of
                    Henry VII, in the words, "August 10th, 1497. To him who discovered the new
                    island, ten pounds." This is clearly not a claim on which the discovery of the
                    mainland can be based. </p>
                <p>A manuscript known as the Cotton Manuscript says that John Cabot had sailed, but
                    had not returned, at the moment when the manuscript was written. This period was
                    "the thirteenth year of Henry VII." The thirteenth year of Henry began on the
                    twenty-second of August, 1497, and ended in 1498. On the third of February,
                    1498, Henry VII granted permission to Cabot to take six English ships "to the
                    lands and islands recently found by the said Cabot, in the name of the king and
                    by his orders." Strictly speaking, this would <pb n="312"/> mean that the
                    mainland had then been discovered; but it is impossible to establish the claim
                    of England on these terms. </p>
                <p>What is, however, more to the point, is a letter from Pasqualigo, a Venetian
                    merchant, who says, writing to Venice, on the twenty-third of August, 1497, that
                    Cabot had discovered the mainland at seven hundred leagues to the west, and had
                    sailed along it for a coast of three hundred leagues. He says the voyage was
                    three months in length. It was made, then, between May and August, 1497. The
                    evidence of this letter seems to show that the mainland of North America was
                    really first discovered by Cabot. The discussion, however, does not in the least
                    detract from the merit due to Columbus for the great discovery. Whether he saw
                    an island or whether he saw the mainland, was a mere matter of what has been
                    called landfall by the seamen. It is admitted on all hands that he was the
                    leader in all these enterprises, and that it was on his success in the first
                    voyage that all such enterprises followed.</p>
