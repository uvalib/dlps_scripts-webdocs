                <p>The Rector asked the President to give his customary report.</p>

                <p>The Commission on the Future of the University is continuing its work, begun last
                    spring. The committees of the Commission, with suggestions from <name>Dr.
                        Garson</name> and from the Faculty Senate, are revising their reports and
                    plan to complete them in November. The final report will come to the Board of
                    Visitors at the February meeting. </p>

                <p>The President said the results of the Commission's work will have an impact on
                    the University for many years to come: the University will become stronger in
                    the sciences; become a more global university; and the already strong student
                    experience will be strengthened. </p>

                <p>Noting that <name>Mr. Sandridge</name> had given a report earlier on the new
                    security measures being undertaken as a result of the massacre at Virginia Tech
                    in the spring, the President summarized the University's efforts as being a
                    systematic and rational approach. Important steps have been taken already, but
                    it will be a work-in-progress in the months ahead.</p>

                <p>The Virginia Tech Review Panel's report is being compared with the University's
                    initiatives, and identified gaps in the University's plan are being addressed.
                    The President said the Board will be kept abreast of these efforts. </p>

                <p>The President then spoke briefly about the budget reductions mandated by the
                    Commonwealth. The Governor, he said, <pb n="7409"/> has reduced the University's
                    planning target number of 7&#x0025; to 6.25&#x0025; for the actual amount of the
                    cut. With other cuts, the University's actual and final cut will be
                    &#x0024;9,557,710. </p>

                <p>The Governor is still open to considering a bond issue. </p>

                <p>The President said work is underway to honor the workers, enslaved and free, who
                    built the original buildings of the University. Extensive research is necessary
                    to find the names and roles of the workers, and stipends will be awarded to
                    students, graduate and undergraduate, to conduct supervised investigations of
                    the original construction work at the University. </p>

                    <p>WHEREAS,the University's current endowment spending policy, approved by the
                        Board of Visitors in <date value="2005-03">March 2005</date>, calls for a
                        percentage increase in the annual distribution from the endowment, unless
                        such increase causes the distribution to fall outside a range defined as 3.5
                        percent on the low end and 5.5 percent on the high end of the market value
                        of the Pooled Endowment Fund; and </p>

                    <p>WHEREAS,the policy specifies that if the distribution falls outside of this
                        range, the Finance Committee may recommend either raising or lowering the
                        rate of increase; and </p>

                    <p>RESOLVED that for fiscal year <dateRange from="2007" to="2008"
                            >2007-2008</dateRange>, the endowment spending rate for all shares will
                        be adjusted to 4.5 percent of the market value at <date value="2007-06-30"
                            >June 30, 2007</date>; and </p>

                        President and Provost to determine and carry out plans for expending these
                        funds in ways that meet strategic school and institutional priorities and
