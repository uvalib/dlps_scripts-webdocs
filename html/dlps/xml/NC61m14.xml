                <p> Charles writes about a railroad trip with his regiment beginning in Parkersburg
                    and ending in Green Spring Run. He is poetic in his description, in passing
                    through Grafton he describes "the silver beams of morning...scattering darkness
                    away." The trip continues through Oakland and Cumberland, in the latter the
                    regiment was "warmly welcomed" by the townspeople. The journey is physically
                    uncomfortable but the scenery is beautiful. He asks Addie if she has been
                    sleighing yet, asks after her family, and details a new type of powder
                    explosive. He discusses some military news, gives her his newest address and
                    requests a long letter the next time. </p>

                    <salute>My dear friend;- </salute>

                </opener>

                <p> Lest you toss all knowledge<lb/> of our whereabouts, I again send you a few<lb/>
                    lines. We are well and in good spirits, but<lb/> as yet uncertain as to where we
                    shall be<lb/> sent. We are now under <name type="person">Brig. Gen.
                    Kelley's</name><lb/> command and he was to come to us <orig reg="yesterday"
                        >yester-<lb/> day</orig>, but owing to illne&longs;s he did not
                    come,<lb/> consequently we are now awaiting orders.<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> I must give you a brief account of our<lb/> ride from <name type="place"
                        >Parkersburg</name>, where I wrote to you on<lb/> the 9<hi rend="super"
                    >th</hi>. We left that place at 5 O'clock P.M.<lb/> in low freight cars. There
                    are three seats<lb/> in each car running lengthwise of the car.<lb/> Two cars
                    were allowed to a company. Of the<lb/> country through which we came that
                    night<lb/> I know but little save that is very rough,<lb/> amounting even to the
                    mountainous. You can<lb/> judge of that when I say that we pa&longs;sed<lb/>
                    through thirteen tunnels in twenty-seven<lb/> miles. We pa&longs;sed
                        through <name type="place">Clarksburg</name> about<lb/> half past three in
                    the morning. Here is where<lb/> we left the R. R. when we came into Va.<lb/>
                </p>

                <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0418"/>

                <p> Just (there isn't that a beautiful letter?)<ref target="n1" n="1">1</ref> before
                    day light<lb/> we pa&longs;sed through <name type="place">Grafton</name>, and
                    just as the silver beams<lb/> of morning were scattering darkne&longs;s
                    away, we were<lb/> instantaneously plunged into total darkne&longs;s; an
                        interva<hi rend="super">l</hi><lb/> of several minutes, and as suddenly we
                    emerged into<lb/> almost broad daylight. We had pa&longs;sed through a<lb/>
                    tunnel seven eighths of a mile in length.<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> We stopped at <name type="place">Oakland</name> in Maryland and cooked<lb/> our
                    breakfast, dinner and supper. <orig reg="about">About</orig> ten A.M. we<lb/>
                    again started on, and arrived at <name type="place">Cumberland, Md.</name><lb/>
                    just at dark. Here we were warmly welcomed<lb/> by hundreds of Ladies and
                    gentlemen, we <orig reg="remained">re-<lb/> mained</orig> here about half an
                    hour, and then we<lb/> were dragged on by our tirele&longs;s Iron horse
                        to <name type="place">Green<lb/> Spring Run</name> where we now are.<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> Now dear <name type="person">Addie</name>, imagine yourself a soldier<lb/> jolted
                    along for hundreds of miles in a cold <orig reg="uncomfortable">uncom-<lb/>
                        fortable</orig> freight car, night and day, and then when<lb/> you stopped
                    be obliged to lie wherever you could<lb/>
                    <sic corr="perchance">perechance</sic> in a cold corner of a car, or
                    perhaps<lb/> "<hi rend="underline">en bivouack</hi>" by the side of a fire which
                    you must<lb/> often replenish, or freeze. Suppose for a moment<lb/> you were
                    there situated and you have some idea<lb/> of our way of living. We are now
                    without tents<lb/> but expecting new ones every day.<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> But you remember the old adage "there<lb/> is no great lo&longs;s without
                    some small gain."<lb/>
                </p>

                <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0419"/>

                <p> Although we <hi rend="super">will</hi> have probably le&longs;s pleasure here
                    than<lb/> if we had <orig reg="stayed">staid</orig> at <name type="place"
                        >Charleston</name>, yet I have had an old<lb/> wish realized, that of
                    visiting the valley of the<lb/> upper Potomac. From <name type="place"
                    >Oakland</name> we descended into the<lb/> valley. From this point the scenery
                    was delightful<lb/> still I think I <unclear>seen</unclear> that more beautiful,
                    but none<lb/> so grand and wild. Hillsides were covered with<lb/> rocks on one
                    side, while on the other they were<lb/> covered with fertile fields. Here were
                        abrupt <orig reg="precipices">preci-<lb/> pices</orig> hundreds of feet high
                    and here luxuriant valleys.<lb/> I would give much to see this region of country
                    in<lb/> the height of Summer.<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> You would laugh if you could see us, <name type="person">Hal</name><lb/>
                    &amp; I sitting under a <orig reg="straw-stack.">straw-stack</orig> He
                    engaged in<lb/> writing a letter to his friend the "Democrat," and<lb/> I one to
                    my friend "the Lovely."<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> Well. <name type="person">Hal</name> has finished his letter &amp; is
                    now<lb/> waiting for me. I don't care: he can wait for me<lb/> or go to the
                    other boys. Am I not independent?<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> I would like to see you now. I suppose you<lb/> have sleighing now, do you not?
                    Please take<lb/> one ride for me, will you not, and be happy and<lb/> joyous as
                    you can. I know you remember me<lb/> for I seem to feel your presence every day
                    and<lb/> night. I never felt happier in my life than since<lb/> I knew you loved
                    me well enough to style <orig reg="yourself">your<lb/> self</orig> my sister; am
                    I worthy of being called a brother?<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> Hal is now writing another letter while I am done.<ref target="n2" n="2">2</ref>
                </p>

                <p> Is <name type="person">Laurie</name> well? and your mother and Father?<lb/> How
                    is Oil-dom generally? By the bye, I learn of a<lb/> new use for Mecca Oil.
                        A <name type="person">Mr. Trowbridge</name> of<lb/>
                    <name type="place">Meadville Pa</name> has applied for a patent for a new<lb/>
                    bomb-shell. A quantity of <orig reg="rock oil">Rock Oil</orig> is put into<lb/>
                    the shell with the <orig reg="powder">Powder</orig> so when the shell
                    explodes<lb/> the oil ignites and fires whatever it touches.<lb/> Novel is it
                    not?<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> What do you think of the movements of <name type="person">Gen.<lb/>
                    McClellan</name>? Is his policy one of those brilliant actions<lb/> which
                    characterized the first <name type="person">Napoleon</name>?<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> And <name type="person">Gen. Halleck</name> too? What do you think<lb/> of his
                    grand withdrawl of troops from central <orig reg="Missouri">Mo</orig>?<lb/>
                    Perhaps though, as <name type="person">Price's</name> plan is to remove the
                    field<lb/> to <name type="place">Kansas</name>. <name type="person">Halleck</name>
                    wishes to lure him back<lb/> to <name type="place">Mi&longs;souri</name>, and
                    severely whip him but he is not<lb/>
                    <name type="person">Fremont</name>. I suppose from henceforth you will<lb/>
                    anxiously look for tidings from the army of the<lb/>
                    <name type="place">Potomac</name>, instead of that of <unclear>Westim</unclear>
                    Va. Very natural<lb/> though. I hope <name type="person">Gen. McClellan</name>
                    will begin to draw<lb/> in the lines which he has so successfully extended<lb/>
                    around the Rebels, soon, and if he does you may<lb/> look for exciting news from
                        the <name type="place">Potomac</name>.<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> But I fear this is getting uninteresting to you, if<lb/> indeed you can read it
                    all. But perhaps you<lb/> will excuse me, and if as Paddy says " <hi
                        rend="underline">If you can't<lb/>
                        <orig reg="read">rade</orig> this <orig reg="please">pleze</orig> sent it
                        back.</hi>" <lb/>
                </p>

                <p> You will write soon, will you not? and<lb/> direct your letters to me in leave
                        of <name type="person">Capt. Arper</name>,<lb/> 7<hi rend="super">th</hi>

                <p> When you write, please write me a <hi rend="underline">good long</hi><lb/> letter
                    and remember you are writing to one<lb/> who loves you dearly, and would if
                    necessary die for<lb/> you.<lb/>
                </p>
