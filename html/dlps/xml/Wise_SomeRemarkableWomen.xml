<p><hi rend="small-caps">As</hi> a traveler on reaching the summit of a hill <lb/>
casts an inquiring eye upon the landscape <lb/>
which lies beyond, so does every <reg orig="serious-|minded">serious-minded</reg> <lb/>
young lady when she reaches the <reg orig="con-|fines">confines</reg> <lb/>
of coming womanhood occasionally cast away <lb/>
a measure of the lightsome thoughtlessness of her <lb/>
early girlhood, and strive to look with curious eye <lb/>
upon her future life. It matters not that every <lb/>
thing before her is shrouded in mist, that the only <lb/>
thing certain in the part she is to take in the grand <lb/>
drama of her earthly existence is its uncertainty. Yet <lb/>
the impulses of her aspiring young soul force to her <lb/>
quivering lips the question, What is to be <hi rend="italic">my</hi> lot <lb/>
in life?</p>
<p>To this very natural and by no means unfitting <reg orig="in-|quiry">inquiry</reg> <lb/>
there comes no voice nor sound from behind the <lb/>
all-enshrouding, impenetrable mist. Then, if her <lb/>
<pb n="6" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0012"/>
nature be timid and anxious, she may direct her <lb/>
thoughts to what she knows of those who move within <lb/>
and about her present social circle. She calls up images <lb/>
of some women who, by taking ill-advised steps, have <lb/>
spoiled their lives; of others who, bereft of parents <lb/>
and near relatives, have been thrown unprepared <lb/>
upon their own resources, and have found their lives <lb/>
to be a toilsome struggle for bread; of still others <lb/>
who, though outwardly prosperous and living in <lb/>
gayety and fashion, she knows are empty-hearted and <lb/>
miserable. These unhappy women float before her <lb/>
vision like figures of evil omen, and she shudders <lb/>
lest it should be her destiny to share a fate more or <lb/>
less similar to theirs.</p>
<p>To affirm that there is nothing in the <reg orig="uncertain-|ties">uncertainties</reg> <lb/>
of life to awaken serious thoughtfulness in young <lb/>
women, would be to make a false and misleading <lb/>
statement. It would be equally wide from the truth <lb/>
to teach that their unavoidable perils are such as to <lb/>
justify brooding and painful anxiety. In this age, <lb/>
the respect paid to woman and the opportunities <lb/>
offered her for free self-development, leave little <lb/>
room for her to dread any grave dangers except <lb/>
such as she may call into existence by her own <reg orig="self-|will">self-will</reg>, <lb/>
and by her own obstinate refusal to be guided <lb/>
by the wisdom of her parents and the precepts of <lb/>
<pb n="7" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0013"/>
Him who is the only infallible Teacher. In the <lb/>
tenderness of his unfathomable love, he is ever <reg orig="whis-|pering">whispering</reg> <lb/>
in her heart, would she but listen for his <lb/>
voice, and saying to her when she is longing for <lb/>
direction, "Wilt thou not from this time cry unto <lb/>

me, My Father, thou art the guide of my youth?" <lb/>
Self-surrendered to his guidance, she has nothing <lb/>
to fear. His watchful providence will guard her <lb/>
interests. His peace will make her life worth <reg orig="liv-|ing">living</reg>, <lb/>
be its outward condition what it may. But if <lb/>
she will be her own counselor, will walk in the <lb/>
light of her own imagined wisdom, and will be <reg orig="gov-|erned">governed</reg> <lb/>
by her own blind impulses, she will surely <lb/>
find the roses of her own fancies to be begirt with <lb/>
thorns that will pierce not her hands only, but also <lb/>
her heart, with deadly wounds. Therefore, so far <lb/>
as her happiness and general well-being are <reg orig="con-|cerned">concerned</reg>, <lb/>
her destiny is largely in her own hands.</p>
<p>The character sketches in this volume are <reg orig="illus-|trations">illustrations</reg> <lb/>
of these truths. The women portrayed <lb/>
moved amidst very varied circumstances. Some, <lb/>
like Miss Adams and the Bront&eacute; sisters, were largely <lb/>
left to depend for their support and enjoyments on <lb/>
their own resources; others, like Sister Dora, Miss <lb/>
Havergal, and the Grimke sisters, were reared in nests <lb/>
lined with eider-down. But all attained their crowns <lb/>
<pb n="8" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0014"/>
of fame, and wrote their names on human hearts, by <lb/>
persistent self-culture; and those of them who soared <lb/>
to the topmost heights of moral and spiritual <reg orig="excel-|lence">excellence</reg> <lb/>
and usefulness, did so by first sitting as lowly <lb/>
pupils at the feet of the great Teacher. Like the <lb/>
"virtuous woman" whose price Solomon declared <lb/>
to be "far above rubies," they were all courageous <lb/>
in beating down obstacles, brave in enduring trial, <lb/>
diligent in their studies, and labors, self-denying in <lb/>
their abstinence from hurtful pleasures, and <reg orig="persist-|ent">persistent</reg> <lb/>
in their duties. They all teach the same great <lb/>
lessons of life to the young women of to-day; namely, <lb/>
that to be happy and useful they must not look upon <lb/>
themselves as dolls, to be dressed, admired, petted, <lb/>
and kept in idleness by parents and husbands, but <lb/>
as human beings, whose destiny hinges on the high <lb/>
or low purposes for which they live&mdash;on habits of <lb/>
self-reliance, intellectual toil, industrious employment <lb/>
of their natural gifts, benevolent labors for others, <lb/>
and spiritual self-culture. To encourage women to <lb/>
accept these highest and noblest views of life, it is <lb/>
written that "favor is deceitful and beauty is vain; <lb/>
but a woman that feareth the Lord she shall be <lb/>
praised."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the month of February, 1820, the vicarage <lb/>
of Haworth, in Yorkshire, England, received <lb/>
within its walls the family of the Rev. <reg orig="Pat-|rick">Patrick</reg> <lb/>
Bront&eacute;, the newly appointed vicar of <lb/>
Haworth parish. The vicar was a tall, <reg orig="hand-|some">handsome</reg>, <lb/>
blue-eyed Irishman, the son of an Irish <lb/>
peasant. His early boyhood had been spent <reg orig="toil-|ing">toiling</reg> <lb/>
on his father's scanty holding; but by dint <lb/>
of uncommon energy he had managed to prepare <lb/>
himself for Cambridge University, where he took <lb/>
his degree when about thirty years of age. Five <lb/>
years later he had married Maria Branwell, an <lb/>
educated, gentle young lady, reared at sunny <reg orig="Pen-|zance">Penzance</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0016"/>
in Cornwall, but poorly fitted because of <lb/>
her consumptive tendency to do hard battle with <lb/>
the difficulties inseparable from the circumstances <lb/>
of a vicar forced to be content with a stinted <lb/>
salary. Seven years of marriage had brought <lb/>
them six children, with whom they entered into <lb/>
possession of Haworth vicarage.</p>
<p>There is not much either in the house or its <lb/>
surroundings to cheer the spirits of this drooping <lb/>
mother. The long, straggling village of Haworth <lb/>
has no rural attractions. It stands on the slope of <lb/>
a low, bleak, treeless hill. Its rude, comfortless <lb/>
houses, and unattractive mills are built of blackish <lb/>
gray stone. Close to the vicarage garden is the <lb/>
village grave-yard, studded thick with tombstones, <lb/>
and overcrowded with the remains of the village <lb/>
dead. On one side lies the sleepy, monotonous <lb/>
village; on the other a broad expanse of equally <lb/>
monotonous moors. The parsonage itself is an <reg orig="ob-|long">oblong</reg>, <lb/>
two-storied structure, built of gray stone. <lb/>
Within we find two parlors of moderate dimensions, <lb/>
separated by a narrow hall, one of which is the <lb/>
vicar's study, the other the family sitting-room. <lb/>
Both are floored with flag-stones. Behind these <lb/>
are a store-room and two kitchens. The upper floor <lb/>
is divided into a like number of bedrooms, one of <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0017"/>
which is but a good-sized closet. Into this <reg orig="cheer-|less">cheerless</reg> <lb/>
abode this feeble mother, with her six little <lb/>

children, is ushered by the stately vicar, who shows <lb/>
scant sympathy with either the little lady's <reg orig="feeble-|ness">feebleness</reg>, <lb/>
or with her very natural shrinkings from the <lb/>
naked discomforts of the unattractive dwelling.</p>
<p>Our interest in this family centers not in the <lb/>
cold, selfish vicar, nor in his gentle wife, who died <lb/>
of cancer seventeen months after her arrival at <lb/>
Haworth; nor in the two elder girls, who died in <lb/>
their youth; nor in the graceless Branwell, the <lb/>
one boy of the family; but in the three younger <lb/>
daughters. These were the <hi rend="italic">petite,</hi> pale-faced, <reg orig="im-|petuous">impetuous</reg> <lb/>
Charlotte, little, prattling Emily, and baby <lb/>
Anne, who are destined to be subsequently known <lb/>
to fame as Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell.</p>
<p>These six children were left mostly to their own <lb/>
resources during the last year of their mother's <lb/>
life, and the year following her death, Maria, the <lb/>
eldest, though only little more than eight years old, <lb/>
acted the part of a little mother to her brother <lb/>
and sisters. The vicar spent his time mostly in <lb/>
the seclusion of his study, leaving his motherless <lb/>
children to their own devices. His only servant <lb/>
was without qualifications to teach or guide them. <lb/>
He permitted no communication between his <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="12" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0018"/>
and his humble parishioners. Hence these <lb/>
little ones lived and amused themselves without <lb/>
guidance or care, reading the newspapers, inventing <lb/>
childish plays, and strolling over the moors, "<reg orig="know-|ing">knowing</reg> <lb/>
and caring absolutely for no creature outside <lb/>
the walls of their own home." Never had little <lb/>
civilized children less training than they at this <lb/>
period of their lives. Nevertheless, despite this <lb/>
sad lack of affectionate care, they seem to have <lb/>
dearly loved each other, and to have been happy in <lb/>
the wild freedom permitted them.</p>
<p>Twelve months after their mother's death, their <lb/>
maternal aunt, Miss Branwell, came from Cornwall <lb/>
to preside over Mr. Bront&eacute;'s household. This lady <lb/>
was an antiquated maiden, somewhat strict in her <lb/>
ideas of family discipline, sincerely intending to <lb/>
do her best to train her departed sister's little <reg orig="wild-|lings">wildlings</reg> <lb/>
in the ways of virtue. But her discipline <lb/>
lacked the subtle power of loving gentleness; and <lb/>
though beneficial in many respects, was not <reg orig="favor-|able">favorable</reg> <lb/>
to the development of the best sides of the <lb/>
strong characters they possessed. It failed to bring <lb/>
out their restricted affections. It made the self-willed <lb/>
Charlotte and dogged Emily more self-centered and <lb/>
self-restrained than ever. Little Anne, whose <reg orig="na-|ture">nature</reg> <lb/>
was sweet, gentle, and submissive, suffered <lb/>
<pb n="13" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0019"/>
least from Miss Branwell's well-meant but mistaken <lb/>
methods of asserting her authority.</p>
<p>Her entrance into the vicarage was nevertheless <lb/>
a blessing to them, in that it led to the curtailment <lb/>
of their gypsy-like freedom, to their acquisition of <lb/>
various housewifely arts, and to some regularity in <lb/>
their study of lessons, which she made them recite <lb/>
to their father, who, however, rarely favored them <lb/>

with his presence. And when he did talk with <lb/>
them at the tea-table, his conversations, instead of <lb/>
being suited to their age and peculiarities of <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg>, <lb/>
were about politics, political men, scenes of <lb/>
horror taken from Irish history, and weird Irish <lb/>
traditions. To these precocious children such topics <lb/>
were stimulants to their wild, morbid tendencies, <lb/>
and, instead of filling their imaginations with <reg orig="pic-|tures">pictures</reg> <lb/>
of the beautiful, and their hearts with tender <lb/>
and healthful sentiments, peopled the former with <lb/>
images of ungentle, unnatural, fierce, adventurous <lb/>
beings, and begot in the latter morbid, unhealthy <lb/>
feelings. To little Emily those uncanny Irish stories <lb/>
were probably the germs of her powerful but <lb/>
morbidly passionate story, "Wuthering Heights." <lb/>
Had Parson Bront&eacute; possessed genuine paternal <lb/>
affection, it would have taught him a wiser method <lb/>
of entertaining his much isolated children.</p>
<pb n="14" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0020"/>
<p>In 1824, in consequence of their suffering from <lb/>
mcasles and whooping-cough, the vicar thought it <lb/>
prudent to send four of his little girls to a cheap <lb/>
boarding-school for clergymen's daughters. This <lb/>
change, though well intended, wrought no good to <lb/>
the Bront&eacute; children. The school proved to be a <lb/>
house of suffering, disease, and death. Scant, <reg orig="ill-|cooked">ill-cooked</reg> <lb/>
food; a damp, unwholesome building; lack <lb/>
of proper matronly care; and, finally, a <reg orig="death-|breathing">death-breathing</reg> <lb/>
epidemic fever, caused Maria and <reg orig="Eliz-|abeth">Elizabeth</reg>, <lb/>
the two oldest of the girls, to die; and, in <lb/>
the Winter of 1825, compelled the return of <reg orig="Char-|lotte">Charlotte</reg> <lb/>
and little Emily to their motherless home, now <lb/>
more gloomy than before, owing to the untimely <lb/>
deaths of the motherly Maria and the patient <reg orig="Eliz-|abeth">Elizabeth</reg>. <lb/>
In her "Jane Eyre" Charlotte subsequently <lb/>
drew a tragic picture of the horrors of that <reg orig="charnel-|house">charnel-house</reg> <lb/>
for children, misnamed a school.</p>
<p>Charlotte, Emily, Anne, and the only boy, <reg orig="Bran-|well">Branwell</reg>, <lb/>
with their father, aunt, and Tabby, the servant, <lb/>
now constituted the Bront&eacute; family. The life within <lb/>
that vicarage was active, yet wearisome through lack <lb/>
of variety. The selfish vicar, when not called out to <lb/>
do official duty, spent most of his time in his study. <lb/>
His part in the family life now consisted in hearing <lb/>
Branwell recite his lessons, and, when at the <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="15" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0021"/>
and evening meals, telling the news of the day. <lb/>
Miss Branwell continued to teach housewifery to <lb/>
the three girls, and to give them such religious and <lb/>
other instruction as her narrow mental resources <lb/>
permitted. The little maidens, Emily and Anne <lb/>
especially, found their recreation in long wanderings <lb/>
over the lonely moors which stretched far away <lb/>
from the church-yard toward the distant hills. In <lb/>
the evenings, in place of more juvenile and <reg orig="suit-|able">suitable</reg> <lb/>
reading, these neglected children perused the <lb/>
tory newspapers of the day, <hi rend="italic">Blackwood's Magazine,</hi> <lb/>
Southey's romances, and Sir Walter Scott's poems. <lb/>
They also invented plays, and made heroes for <lb/>
themselves out of what they read in the newspapers <lb/>
concerning the leading men of the day. They were <lb/>
still strongly attached to each other. They were not <lb/>
unhappy, yet their lives were unnaturally narrowed <lb/>
by their isolation from the outer world, of which <lb/>
they knew next to nothing, except what they <lb/>
learned from the newspapers and from their brother, <lb/>
who was, alas! already beginning to know it through <lb/>
the idle youths who lounged about the parlors of the <lb/>
Black Bull Inn, which stood hard by the church.</p>
<p>In 1831 Charlotte was sent away to school, <lb/>
where she remained about eighteen months. What <lb/>
she learned there, she taught, after her return home, <lb/>
<pb n="16" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0022"/>
to Emily and Anne. She found them apt scholars. <lb/>
Emily was especially quick in learning to draw. All <lb/>
of them were much in the habit of writing stories <lb/>
and poems, for which they had a natural aptitude. <lb/>
In 1833 their lives were touched and favorably <reg orig="in-|fluenced">influenced</reg> <lb/>
by the visit of a young lady, named Ellen <lb/>
Nussey, with whom Charlotte had formed an <reg orig="inti-|mate">intimate</reg> <lb/>
and lasting friendship at school.</p>
<p>Emily dreaded the presence of strangers. Her <lb/>
isolation from general society and her habit of <reg orig="wan-|dering">wandering</reg> <lb/>
on the treeless moors, had bred in her mind <lb/>
not merely a dread, but a hatred, of strange faces. <lb/>
Nevertheless, the gentle manners and affectionate <lb/>
spirit of Miss Nussey won Emily's regard, and the <lb/>
two became fast friends. This fact suggested to the <lb/>
thoughtful Charlotte that, as Emily's sympathies <lb/>
had been won by the presence of one congenial mind, <lb/>
they might possibly be broadened by such contact <lb/>
with other girls of her age as would be occasioned by <lb/>
the necessary associations of boarding-school life. <lb/>
Hence, when she was herself invited to teach in the <lb/>
school in which she had been whilom a pupil, she <lb/>
persuaded Emily to enter it as a student.</p>
<p>Emily was now, 1835, sixteen years old, and <reg orig="am-|bitious">ambitious</reg> <lb/>
to acquire sufficient education to earn her <lb/>
own living. But she dreaded the constraint of <lb/>
<pb n="17" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0023"/>
school as intensely as she loved the unrestricted <lb/>
freedom of her home-life. To her, the moor, with <lb/>
its heather-bells, its birds, its timid hares, its <reg orig="moor-|land">moorland</reg> <lb/>
sheep, its tiny water-courses, its green hollows, <lb/>
and its unrestricted field of vision, was her ideal <lb/>
Eden. How, then, could she endure the <reg orig="circum-|scribed">circumscribed</reg> <lb/>
range of a boarding-school grounds, with its <lb/>
compulsory association, day and night, with <reg orig="compan-|ions">companions</reg> <lb/>
for whose friendship she felt not only no desire, <lb/>
but a positive antipathy? Yet the reserved girl, <lb/>
desirous of acting a noble part in life, made up her <lb/>
mind to overcome her prejudices if she could. And <lb/>
so she became a student in the school wherein <reg orig="Char-|lotte">Charlotte</reg> <lb/>
was beginning to test her skill as a teacher.</p>
<p>As the captured bird, long accustomed to the <lb/>
freedom of the skies, pines and forgets to sing when <lb/>
imprisoned in a cage, so did Emily Bront&eacute; pine and <lb/>
droop at school. Her will was bent on being <reg orig="con-|tented">contented</reg> <lb/>
there; but despite her purpose, her face grew <lb/>
pale, her figure shrunk, her strength declined, and <lb/>
the watchful Charlotte, seeing that her <reg orig="uncomplain-|ing">uncomplaining</reg> <lb/>
sister would soon die if she remained, counseled <lb/>
the mistress of the school to send her home. <reg orig="Em-|ily">Emily</reg> <lb/>
then left, and the gentle, submissive Anne took <lb/>
her place. Her old life at Haworth soon proved <lb/>
an effectual tonic for Emily's homesickness, and <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0024"/>
the breath of the moors speedily restored the health <lb/>
which three months of school life had well-nigh <lb/>
destroyed.</p>
<p>When, in the Autumn of 1836, Charlotte <reg orig="re-|sumed">resumed</reg> <lb/>
her duties at the opening of a new <reg orig="school-|term">school-term</reg>, <lb/>
and Anne returned to her studies, Emily <reg orig="sur-|prised">surprised</reg> <lb/>
all the family by accepting the post of teacher <lb/>
in a school of forty pupils, near Halifax. The <reg orig="du-|ties">duties</reg> <lb/>
imposed upon her there kept her busy from six <lb/>
in the morning until eleven at night. No wonder <lb/>
that at the end of six months she found her "health <lb/>
broken down, shattered by long-resisted <reg orig="homesick-|ness">homesickness</reg>;" <lb/>
and that she was obliged to return home <lb/>
once more, to renew her vigor and recover her <lb/>
spirits, by breathing the free air of her beloved moors.</p>
<p>From the time of her return from Halifax until <lb/>
she went to Brussels with Charlotte in 1842, Emily <lb/>
spent her time at home, toiling at her household <lb/>
duties. Charlotte and Anne were at school-teaching, <lb/>
during much of that period. Branwell&mdash;the <reg orig="hand-|some">handsome</reg>, <lb/>
gifted, impulsive, unprincipled Branwell&mdash;was <lb/>
also often away, sometimes doing duty as usher in a <lb/>
school, or as private tutor in a family, or as railway <lb/>
station-master or clerk; but always a rolling stone, <lb/>
shifting from one thing to another, adhering only to <lb/>
his habits of dissipation. When these three were <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0025"/>
away, Haworth vicarage was a place of housewifely <lb/>
toil for the gifted Emily. Yet so long as she could <lb/>
enjoy the freedom of her Eden, the solitary moors, <lb/>
accompanied by her fierce but faithful dog, she was <lb/>
cheerful and content, if not exuberantly happy. <lb/>
When her sisters were at home at their vacation <lb/>
times, her cup of enjoyment, despite the extra <reg orig="house-|hold">household</reg> <lb/>
labor made necessary by the lameness of old <lb/>
Tabby, was overflowingly full. No literary <reg orig="ambi-|tion">ambition</reg> <lb/>
seems to have been as yet awakened in Emily <lb/>
or Anne. But Charlotte was not wholly without <lb/>
the instinct of authorship, when she and Branwell <lb/>
sent some of their poetic compositions to Southey, <lb/>
to Coleridge, and to Wordsworth, hoping for <reg orig="encour-|agement">encouragement</reg> <lb/>
which they did not receive.</p>
<p>Wearied by the hated work of governessing <lb/>
under the direction of exacting superiors, the three <lb/>
girls resolved at last to establish a school of their <lb/>
own at Haworth. It had once been the dream of <lb/>
their young lives to earn money to pay their brother's <lb/>
expenses as a student at the Royal Academy. That <lb/>
hope gradually expired in the grief of their <reg orig="discov-|ery">discovery</reg> <lb/>
that he was so far enslaved by dissipated habits <lb/>
that he could not be safely sent into the <reg orig="tempta-|tions">temptations</reg> <lb/>
of London life. But, though that dream was thus <lb/>
rudely dissolved, the necessity for self-support still <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0026"/>
pressed upon them. Their father was growing old. <lb/>
His vigor was declining. He had to employ a curate. <lb/>
His death must be viewed as a possible fact lying <lb/>
somewhere in the near future. They must therefore <lb/>
give their attention to the means of self-support. <lb/>
To live by authorship was something not yet <reg orig="ad-|mitted">admitted</reg> <lb/>
into their thoughts. What better project <lb/>
could they entertain, therefore, than to establish a <lb/>
school at the old vicarage? After much talking <lb/>
and consultation, they resolved to make the attempt.</p>
<p>But their lack of sufficient accomplishments now <lb/>
stared them in the face. They were well-informed, <lb/>
mature in thought and feeling, highly gifted; but <lb/>
their pronunciation of French was far from pure; <lb/>
their knowledge of German was superficial; their <lb/>
musical acquirements were not such as teachers <lb/>
needed to possess. Hence, ambitious Charlotte <reg orig="pro-|posed">proposed</reg> <lb/>
that, their Aunt Branwell consenting to assist <lb/>
them with a portion of her savings, she and Emily <lb/>
should spend six months in an educational <reg orig="estab-|lishment">establishment</reg> <lb/>
at Brussels, and then that all three sisters <lb/>
should open an academy in some more attractive <lb/>
spot than Haworth. "A school taught by three <lb/>
clergyman's daughters educated on the Continent," <lb/>
said Charlotte, laughing merrily at her own conceit, <lb/>
"can not fail to attract pupils!"</p>
<pb n="21" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0027"/>
<p>After overcoming many obstacles, this scheme <lb/>
was matured. To the hopeful, ambitious, daring <lb/>
Charlotte, there was life and inspiration in it; to <lb/>
the reserved, shrinking, home-loving Emily, it was <lb/>
torture to think of going among strangers. <reg orig="Never-|theless">Nevertheless</reg>, <lb/>
the brave girl yielded her reluctant consent, <lb/>
and in February, 1842, the two sisters, conducted by <lb/>
their eccentric father, left Haworth, and were duly <lb/>
installed among the Belgian girls who were pupils <lb/>
of Madame H&eacute;ger's Pensionnat in the Rue <reg orig="d'Isa-|belle">d'Isabelle</reg>, <lb/>
Brussels.</p>
<p>To the genial demoiselles in Madame H&eacute;ger's <lb/>
school, these two young English women must have <lb/>
appeared strange and uncouth creatures. Charlotte <lb/>
was twenty-six years old, Emily twenty-four. Neither <lb/>
was handsome. Both were shy and reserved; stiff <lb/>
and prim in their manners, their mode of dressing <lb/>
was so lacking in grace and fashion, and their <reg orig="York-|shire">Yorkshire</reg> <lb/>
French so bungling, as to be matter of <reg orig="sur-|prise">surprise</reg> <lb/>
and jest. Emily carried her reserve so far as <lb/>
to resist the efforts of the more kindly disposed girls <lb/>
to draw her into conversation. She would have no <lb/>
companion but her sister. Her body was in <reg orig="Brus-|sels">Brussels</reg>, <lb/>
but her heart was in Yorkshire. Charlotte's <lb/>
reserve was less extreme, and she formed one or two <lb/>
friendships among the Belgian girls.</p>
<pb n="22" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0028"/>
<p>Both sisters devoted themselves to earnest, <reg orig="con-|scientious">conscientious</reg> <lb/>
study, and both made rapid progress, <lb/>
though their dispositions, as seen by their teacher, <lb/>
were in singular contrast. Monsieur H&eacute;ger, though <lb/>
kind at heart, was choleric, despotic, and exacting <lb/>
as a teacher. Charlotte deferred to him with meek <lb/>
submissiveness; but Emily disputed with him, and <lb/>
resented his self-assertion with fiery words. <reg orig="Never-|theless">Nevertheless</reg>, <lb/>
his judgment taught him that, while <reg orig="Char-|lotte">Charlotte</reg> <lb/>
possessed the more docile nature, Emily was <lb/>
the superior genius. Speaking of the wealth of her <lb/>
imagination, the keenness of her reasoning powers, <lb/>
the strength of her imperial will, and the vigor of <lb/>
her style, he said: "She ought to have been a man!" <lb/>
He was probably right in his opinion of her <reg orig="supe-|rior">superior</reg> <lb/>
genius; albeit she did not live long enough, as <lb/>
we shall see, fully to demonstrate his judgment <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
the world.</p>
<p>Six months of study wrought large results in <lb/>
both of these remarkable women. So apparent was <lb/>
this to Madame H&eacute;ger that she proposed their <reg orig="con-|tinuance">continuance</reg> <lb/>
at the school the following term without <lb/>
other payment than for Emily to teach music to the <lb/>
younger pupils, and for Charlotte to serve as her <lb/>
teacher of English. Emily's homesick heart <reg orig="pro-|tested">protested</reg> <lb/>
against this proposal, though her judgment <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0029"/>
approved it. Charlotte's ardent desire for higher <lb/>
learning inclined her to accept it with enthusiasm. <lb/>
Instruction and association had kindled her creative <lb/>
power into life. Her imagination was unconsciously <lb/>
storing up images for subsequent use, and her fancy <lb/>
busy giving shape to characters and scenes which were <lb/>
destined to be wrought into "Villette," the <reg orig="master-|piece">masterpiece</reg> <lb/>
of her literary work. Her inclination to remain <lb/>
finally triumphed over Emily's homesick desires to <lb/>
return, and they entered into an agreement with <lb/>
Madame H&eacute;ger to that effect. But they had scarcely <lb/>
begun their appointed work when they were <reg orig="sum-|moned">summoned</reg> <lb/>
back to Haworth by the mortal illness of <lb/>
their aunt. On their arrival home they found <lb/>
her dead!</p>
<p>The death of their aunt made it necessary that <lb/>
one of the three sisters should henceforth remain at <lb/>
home with their father. Which should it be? Anne <lb/>
had a good position as governess in a private <reg orig="fam-|ily">family</reg>; <lb/>
Charlotte had one offer from the head of a <lb/>
young ladies' school, and another from her old <lb/>
teacher at Brussels. The former was the more <reg orig="profit-|able">profitable</reg>; <lb/>
but her heart longed for the intellectual <reg orig="activ-|ity">activity</reg>, <lb/>
the opportunity to learn, and the society of the <lb/>
light-hearted girls to be enjoyed at the latter. As <lb/>
for Emily, she preferred Haworth, with its secluded <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0030"/>
life and its moorland surroundings to any other <lb/>
earthly spot. It was therefore determined that she <lb/>
should remain with her father, and her sisters go to <lb/>
their school duties.</p>
<p>Charlotte was not happy after her return to <lb/>
Brussels. "I returned to it," she wrote years after, <lb/>
"against my conscience, prompted by what then <lb/>
seemed an irresistible impulse. I was punished for <lb/>
my selfish folly by a total withdrawal for more than <lb/>
two years of happiness and peace of mind." <lb/>
Whence arose this state of mental unrest? Some <lb/>
attribute it, though without reason, to a love affair. <lb/>
Others see in it the throes of her awakening genius, <lb/>
the agitation of a mind quickened to a vague <reg orig="con-|sciousness">consciousness</reg> <lb/>
of power to accomplish some great work <lb/>
which she vainly struggled to define. The <reg orig="materi-|als">materials</reg> <lb/>
for "Villette," her masterpiece, say these critics, <lb/>
were then taking shape in her agitated soul. Hence <lb/>
these days of "storm and stress," says Mr. Reid. <lb/>
But why should the incoming of such chaotic images <lb/>
associated with a dawning consciousness of creative <lb/>
power cause disturbance in her <hi rend="italic">"conscience?"</hi> Her <lb/>
confession cited above proves her disturbance was <lb/>
not mainly intellectual, but moral. "I returned to <lb/>
Brussels," she says, "against my conscience."</p>
<p>What, then, was her unhappiness but the result <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0031"/>
of a conflict between her inclination and her sense <lb/>
of duty? What she had already gained at Brussels <lb/>
had unfitted her to find contentment in the <reg orig="monot-|onous">monotonous</reg> <lb/>
life of her Haworth home. It had also <lb/>
awakened aspirations, impulses, and cravings for <lb/>
that still higher intellectual development to be <reg orig="at-|tained">attained</reg> <lb/>
through further association with the teachers, <lb/>
Monsieur H&eacute;ger especially, of her now beloved <lb/>
Pensionnat. To this <hi rend="italic">inclination</hi> her conscience said, <lb/>
"It is your duty to your father and your younger <lb/>
sister to stay at Haworth." Her conscience may <lb/>
have been, probably was, super-sensitive. <reg orig="Never-|theless">Nevertheless</reg>, <lb/>
by subjecting it to the control of her <reg orig="incli-|nation">inclination</reg>, <lb/>
she caused it to wound her with its <reg orig="tor-|menting">tormenting</reg> <lb/>
sting.</p>
<p>This struggle, continued for nearly two years, <lb/>
necessarily curdled her feelings, and threw her into <lb/>
a morbid state of mind, which colored all her <lb/>
thoughts about herself with gloom. As her <reg orig="intel-|lect">intellect</reg> <lb/>
gained more and more power, and her <reg orig="observa-|tions">observations</reg> <lb/>
on human character and life took a wider <lb/>
range, she sought to penetrate the mists which hid <lb/>
her own future. For what end am I acquiring <lb/>
knowledge and gaining power? for what work am <lb/>
I fitted? where shall I find my fitting sphere of <lb/>
action? what is "my state in life?" were queries <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0032"/>
which seemed to have perplexed her sensitive <reg orig="na-|ture">nature</reg>. <lb/>
Moreover, the fact that in one of her most <lb/>
melancholy moods, she went into a Romish church, <lb/>
entered a confessional, and poured the story of her <lb/>
perplexities into the ears of an unknown priest, <lb/>
suggests that the problem of her relation to God <lb/>
had someting to do with her distressed state of <lb/>
mind. Her father's creed bore the stamp of <reg orig="Calvin-|ism">Calvinism</reg>, <lb/>
in which there is but little balm for wounded <lb/>
minds. The unhappy girl needed the consolations <lb/>
of a more Scriptural faith during those gloomy <lb/>
months. Had she been conscious of the Redeemer's <lb/>
love, presence, and guidance, she would assuredly <lb/>
not have lived two years without "happiness and <lb/>
peace of mind."</p>
<p>Her life at Brussels was brought to an end by <lb/>
a summons from her sister to return to Haworth, <lb/>
where home affairs were becoming too burdensome <lb/>
for Emily to bear alone. Tabby, their old <reg orig="serv-|ant">servant</reg>, <lb/>
was ill. All the house-work was on Emily's <lb/>
shoulders. The aged vicar was growing blind, and <lb/>
beginning to use strong drink more freely than had <lb/>
been his wont. Branwell, too, was sinking deeper <lb/>
and deeper in the mire of his loathsome vices. <lb/>
These ill-omened facts broke the silken bond which <lb/>
bound Charlotte to Brussels, and on the 2d of <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0033"/>
January, 1844, she folded "mine bonnie love"&mdash;her <lb/>
pet phrase for Emily&mdash;in her arms within the walls <lb/>
of the Haworth parsonage.</p>
<p>The three sisters now sought to realize their <lb/>
cherished dream of keeping a school of their own. <lb/>
As leaving their aged and almost blind father was <lb/>
now out of the question, their school must be kept <lb/>
in the gloomy old parsonage. They sent out <reg orig="cir-|culars">circulars</reg>. <lb/>
But what mother, having seen Haworth, <lb/>
would send her daughter thither? Not one. And <lb/>
so the old vision faded away like a rainbow, and <lb/>
was lost in a cloud of disappointment. Alas for <lb/>
these poor sisters three!</p>
<p>A still heavier trial awaited them. Anne had <lb/>
been governess in a family which also employed <lb/>
her brother as tutor to its boys. The bad young <lb/>
man had disgraced himself in that household. <lb/>
Ashamed of his misconduct, Anne left her pupils, <lb/>
and Branwell himself; being peremptorily dismissed, <lb/>
went home covered with dishonor. What those <lb/>
sisters endured during the two years following their <lb/>
shameless brother's return home, to be a daily shame <lb/>
and a burden on their stinted resources, can not be <lb/>
conceived, much less described. We have only <lb/>
space in this brief sketch to add that in 1848 this <lb/>
slave of dissipation died pitied by all, but regretted <lb/>
<pb n="28" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0034"/>
probably by none but the boon companions of his <lb/>
orgies at the Bull Inn.</p>
<p>In 1845 these much-tried sisters accidentally <lb/>
discovered that, unknown to one another, they had <lb/>
all been in the habit of writing verses. This <reg orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg> <lb/>
led them, after much consultation, to collect <lb/>
a sufficient number of their poems to make a small <lb/>
volume, and to send the manuscript to London. <lb/>
After considerable correspondence, they found a <reg orig="pub-|lisher">publisher</reg> <lb/>
willing to issue their book on commission. <lb/>
It came out as poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton <lb/>
Bell, names standing respectively for Charlotte, <lb/>
Emily, and Anne. Poor girls! Their book cost <lb/>
them thirty guineas of their little store of money; <lb/>
but, though some of the poems were not without <lb/>
merit, the volume met with very little praise and no <lb/>
sale. Thus their first attempt at authorship was a <lb/>
discouraging failure.</p>
<p>Yet, though discouraged and mortified, these <lb/>
noble women did not despair. They had the courage <lb/>
of strong character, the consciousness of <reg orig="unrecog-|nized">unrecognized</reg> <lb/>
literary power, a strong confidence of ultimate <lb/>
success as writers, and the pinching of pecuniary <lb/>
needs, present and prospective, to spur them to <lb/>
fresh endeavors. Accordingly, after much <reg orig="delibera-|tion">deliberation</reg>, <lb/>
they agreed that each should write a novel! <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0035"/>
Others, they said, had gained popularity and made <lb/>
money by novel-writing; why should not we?</p>
<p>Never before were three novels produced in the <lb/>
manner pursued by these sisters. In the evening, <lb/>
after the house-work of the day was finished, they <lb/>
gathered round a table, compared notes, discussed <lb/>
plots, characters, names, and even the chapters into <lb/>
which their books were to be divided. These points <lb/>
settled, each took her pen and proceeded in silence <lb/>
with her work, far into the night. Thus working <lb/>
through many evenings, Charlotte produced "The <lb/>
Professor;" Emily, "Wuthering Heights;" and <lb/>
Anne, "Agnes Grey." As soon as finished, the <reg orig="man-|uscripts">manuscripts</reg> <lb/>
were sent forth under the old names of <lb/>
Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, to seek a publisher.</p>
<p>Dreary, disconsolate months of almost hopeless <lb/>
waiting succeeded. Their home troubles were, <reg orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg>, <lb/>
sufficient to crush ordinary women. The <reg orig="par-|son">parson</reg> <lb/>
had become blind, and Charlotte had to take <lb/>
him to Manchester for treatment by an oculist. <lb/>
Branwell was still living out his dissipated and <lb/>
disgraced life at the vicarage. Emily's heart was <lb/>
saddened as the shadow of death drew nearer <lb/>
to that doomed brother. Anne's delicate health <lb/>
was sinking beneath the nightmare pressure of <lb/>
Branwell's shame. To these trials the weight of <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0036"/>
repeated literary disappointments were now added. <lb/>
Publisher after publisher returned their manuscripts, <lb/>
rejected. O, unfortunate children of genius!</p>
<p>Poor Charlotte received her rejected "Professor" <lb/>
on the day of the critical operation upon her father's <lb/>
eyes, during which she was required to be present. <lb/>
Yet such was her strength of will that, despite the <lb/>
fearful strain upon her nerves, she sat down in <lb/>
her lonely chamber that same night and began <lb/>
"Jane Eyre!"</p>
<p>It was well for her fame that she had this heroic <lb/>
measure of courage. Had she given way at that <lb/>
moment, the world would probably have never <lb/>
heard of the Bront&eacute; sisters. But her endurance <lb/>
saved them from oblivion. "Jane Eyre" was <reg orig="writ-|ten">written</reg>, <lb/>
and, says Mr. T. W. Reid, "on August 24, <lb/>
1847, the story is sent from Leeds to London; and <lb/>
before the year is out, all England is ringing with the <lb/>
praises of the novel and its author." Patient <reg orig="endur-|ance">endurance</reg> <lb/>
had brought her the crown her genius had won.</p>
<p>Emily and Anne were also encouraged, while <lb/>
"Jane Eyre" was in press, by the acceptance, though <lb/>
on wretched terms, of their manuscripts. "<reg orig="Wuther-|ing">Wuthering</reg> <lb/>
Heights" and "Agnes Grey" were, therefore, <lb/>
to see the light, and test the power of their fair <lb/>
authors to win such popularity as awaited their <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0037"/>
sister. The decision of the world, while giving the <lb/>
credit of genius to all three, placed the palm on <lb/>
Charlotte's brow. When Emily's tragic "<reg orig="Wuther-|ing">Wuthering</reg> <lb/>
Heights" appeared, says Miss Robinson, "the <lb/>
peals of triumph which acclaimed the success of <lb/>
'Jane Eyre' had no echo for the work of Ellis <lb/>
Bell." Two years later it attracted more attention, <lb/>
and won not unmixed admiration, nor enthusiastic <lb/>
praise, but recognition as a work of genius of <lb/>
marked originality, of painfully tragic power, but <lb/>
marred by many glaring faults. And when, still <lb/>
later, the story of Emily's strangely isolated life was <lb/>
given to the public, candid critics were compelled <lb/>
to accept it as a rare "curiosity in literature." But <lb/>
this recognition of its claims was never known to <lb/>
Emily. Before it was given she had become the <lb/>
bride of death. A severe cold, taken at the burial <lb/>
of her unhappy brother, whom she loved with all <lb/>
the strength of a pure, but undeserved, sisterly <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg>, <lb/>
produced inflammation of the lungs. He had <lb/>
been her special care during the last year of his <lb/>
wretched life. His death seemed, therefore, to rob <lb/>
her of her life-work. It left her a prey to gloomy <lb/>
spirits, as well as to disease. Beneath this twofold <lb/>
burden she sunk rapidly. In December, 1848, she <lb/>
found a resting-place in the family grave.</p>
<pb n="32" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0038"/>
<p>Anne's novel, "Agnes Grey," was too <reg orig="common-|place">common-place</reg> <lb/>
to be widely popular. Her next work, "The <lb/>
Tenant of Wildfell Hall," was also unfavorably <lb/>
received. It was, says Mr. Reid, "a dreary and <lb/>
repulsive picture of Branwell Bront&eacute;'s condition <lb/>
after his fall." Charlotte considered it "an entire <lb/>
mistake" as to its "choice of subject," inspired by <lb/>
"pure" yet "slightly morbid motives," and written <lb/>
from an impulse of mistaken duty. But public <lb/>
opinion soon became of small consequence to Anne's <lb/>
gentle spirit. In May, 1849, she, too, passed away, <lb/>
saying, as she died, to her weeping sister:</p>
<p>"Take courage, Charlotte, take courage!"</p>
<p>Emily had died, as Charlotte said, in "a time <lb/>
of promise." "Wuthering Heights" was the work <lb/>
of inexperienced, unfurnished, undeveloped genius, <lb/>
but showed great literary possibilities. Anne's <lb/>
genius was less promising of future achievements. <lb/>
Both had passed away in their prime, yet with the <lb/>
difference in the manner of their departure between <lb/>
faith in evangelical truth, and a vague trust in God, <lb/>
not as the father of the Lord Jesus Christ, but as <lb/>
God the Creator and Preserver of men. Hence, to <lb/>
cite Mr. Reid, "Emily's proud spirit refused to be <lb/>
conquered, and up to the last agony, she carried <lb/>
herself as one sternly indifferent to the weaknesses <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0039"/>
of the flesh, including that final weakness which <lb/>
must conquer all of us in the end. Anne found <lb/>
consolation, pure and deep, in her religious faith, <lb/>
and she died cheerfully, in the firm belief that she <lb/>
was entering into that fuller life which lay beyond <lb/>
the grave."</p>
<p>Bereft of her beloved sisters, compelled by filial <lb/>
obligation to make her home in the dreary <reg orig="parson-|age">parsonage</reg> <lb/>
with her uncompanionable father, and to live in <lb/>
the midst of people with none of whom could she <lb/>
form personal friendships, poor Charlotte's life was <lb/>
now sad and dreary. Yet she did not lose heart <lb/>
and hope, but did what her hand found to do. The <lb/>
key-note of her life is contained in this sentiment, <lb/>
found in a letter to her friend Ellen: "Submission, <lb/>
courage, exertion when practicable&mdash;these seem to <lb/>
be the weapons with which we must fight life's <lb/>
long battle."</p>
<p>Under the inspiration of this thought, she sought <lb/>
refuge from the monotony of her household duties <lb/>
in writing what some of her best critics esteem as <lb/>
"the brightest and healthiest of her works." She <lb/>
named it "Shirley." In that character she <reg orig="imper-|sonated">impersonated</reg> <lb/>
her beloved Emily, as she did her friend <lb/>
Ellen in that of Caroline Helston. Her work being <lb/>
inspired by the two strongest affections of her strong <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0040"/>
nature, and constructed with artistic skill improved <lb/>
by previous practice, the reader will not be surprised <lb/>
to learn that when "Shirley" appeared, as it did <lb/>
in the Autumn of 1849, it was greeted with a loud <lb/>
outcry of praise, both by the critics and the public. <lb/>
"Jane Eyre" had given her reputation as a writer <lb/>
of more than ordinary power. "Shirley" increased <lb/>
and established that reputation. When she visited <lb/>
London in 1850, her presence was courted by <reg orig="liter-|ary">literary</reg> <lb/>
men and women. Had she been at all disposed <lb/>
to seek notoriety, she might have been lionized. <lb/>
But her shrinking, reserved nature, her constrained <lb/>
manner, her precise and formal modes of speech, <lb/>
her unfashionable dress, and her somewhat <reg orig="insignifi-|cant">insignificant</reg> <lb/>
person, all unfitted her to shine as a queen in <lb/>
cultivated society. In such a nature as hers, this <lb/>
unfitness awakened no regret. Society had <reg orig="recog-|nized">recognized</reg> <lb/>
her genius. The sale of her books had relieved <lb/>
her from the fear of prospective want. Could she <lb/>
have been favored with good health and placed in <lb/>
a home of beauty and affection, despite the deep <lb/>
darkness of the past, she might have yet found her <lb/>
life, if not joyous, yet peaceful and happy.</p>
<p>But at present, at least, this condition was not <lb/>
within her reach. New trials yet awaited her. She <lb/>
had an offer of marriage from a pertinacious suitor <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0041"/>
whom she could respect, but to whom she could not <lb/>
give that affection which her pure mind thought <lb/>
necessary to a happy marriage. She finally refused <lb/>
him, but his earnestly pressed suit cost her no small <lb/>
measure of mental agitation. Besides this, she was <lb/>
oppressed with household cares, made weighty by the <lb/>
ill-health and querulousness of her exacting father. <lb/>
Next came the severe strain of great physical <reg orig="weak-|ness">weakness</reg>. <lb/>
Amid all this, her unconquered spirit <reg orig="grap-|pled">grappled</reg> <lb/>
with the task of writing yet another book, <lb/>
which an admiring critic, with some exaggeration, <lb/>
calls "a marvelous book, a masterpiece destined to <lb/>
hold its own among the ripest and finest fruits of <lb/>
English genius."</p>
<p>This work, which she named "Villette," cost <lb/>
her vastly more than the ordinary mental strain of <lb/>
continued writing under the pressure of nervous <lb/>
prostration and bodily weakness. It contains the <lb/>
bitter experiences of her own deeply shadowed life. <lb/>
It is in no mean sense an autobiography of her own <lb/>
inner life, disguised by names and circumstances <lb/>
invented to conceal her personality from the public, <lb/>
and from all, indeed, but the very few to whom she <lb/>
had revealed more or less of the secrets of her <reg orig="sin-|gular">singular</reg>, <lb/>
but remarkable, nature. To reproduce these <lb/>
sad experiences with the pen was to live much of <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0042"/>
her isolated, yet troubled, life over again. It was <lb/>
to drink daily for many weary months, and that for <lb/>
a second time, from a cup of anguish such as is <lb/>
rarely put to the lips of the children of sorrow. <lb/>
Yet she drank it bravely. And when "Villette" <lb/>
appeared, in 1853, it was received, not with the <reg orig="vul-|gar">vulgar</reg> <lb/>
acclamation awarded to a popular novel, but <lb/>
with the more serious praise due to a book which, <lb/>
though a novel in form, is yet "such a <reg orig="heart-|history">heart-history</reg>," <lb/>
says Reid, "as remains to this day without <lb/>
a rival in the school of English fiction to which it <lb/>
belongs.&hellip; From critics of every school and <lb/>
degree there came up a cry of wonder and <reg orig="admira-|tion">admiration</reg>, <lb/>
as men saw out of what simple characters and <lb/>
commonplace incidents genius had evoked this <lb/>
striking work of literary art."</p>
<p>But what is fame to a crushed heart? Charlotte <lb/>
Bront&eacute; was taught its utter emptiness by her cruel <lb/>
experience during this period of her greatest literary <lb/>
triumph. While "Villette" was in preparation, Mr. <lb/>
Arthur Nichols, her father's curate, became a suitor <lb/>
for her hand. Unsuspected by her, he had for <lb/>
some time so studied her character as to become <lb/>
strongly bound to her by a deep affection, based on <lb/>
profound respect. When he made a declaration of <lb/>
his regard Charlotte was taken by surprise, but soon <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0043"/>
felt that such a manly love as he offered her was <lb/>
the great need of her desolate heart. His devoted <lb/>
attentions awakened hopes so bright that at first <lb/>
she scarcely dared to cherish them. When she did, <lb/>
like a true daughter, she spoke of the curate's <reg orig="pro-|posal">proposal</reg> <lb/>
of marriage to her father. But that stern old <lb/>
man, whose cold heart and iron will had blasted the <lb/>
lives of his wife and children, flew into such a <reg orig="furi-|ous">furious</reg> <lb/>
passion that she was terrified. For a moment <lb/>
her new-born love for her suitor struggled with her <lb/>
strong sense of filial obligation. The latter <reg orig="con-|quered">conquered</reg>, <lb/>
and while her heart throbbed with agonized <lb/>
feeling, she heroically pledged her word to give Mr. <lb/>
Nichols a distinct refusal on the morrow.</p>
<p>The refusal was given. The curate resigned, <lb/>
and left Haworth with a grieved spirit; but <reg orig="Char-|lotte">Charlotte</reg>, <lb/>
while the voices of the public were ringing <lb/>
out the praises of her genius, began to sink beneath <lb/>
the obdurate refusal of her cruel father to consent <lb/>
to her marriage. A few months sufficed to show <lb/>
the fatal nature of the wound he had inflicted on <lb/>
the daughter who had sacrificed so much for his <lb/>
sake. Her health and strength evidently declined. <lb/>
The vicar, who loved her as much as his cold <lb/>
nature permitted him to love any one, and who had <lb/>
rejected Mr. Nichols only because he was not a man <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0044"/>
of wealth and note, finally relented. He bade <reg orig="Char-|lotte">Charlotte</reg> <lb/>
send for the curate. Mr. Nichols obeyed her <lb/>
summons, returned to Haworth, freely forgave the <lb/>
irate old vicar, and on June 29, 1854, Charlotte <lb/>
became his happy bride.</p>
<p>Their marriage, during its brief continuance, was <lb/>
a source of sweet content to this sorely tried woman, <lb/>
and of happiness to both. But it soon became a <lb/>
blighted flower. After a few months Charlotte's <lb/>
health began to decline, and on the 31st of March, <lb/>
1855, she passed from dreary Haworth into the <lb/>
beautiful land where the weary are at rest.</p>
<p>The news of her death was received by the <reg orig="read-|ing">reading</reg> <lb/>
public with deep regret. The publication of <lb/>
her memoir by Mrs. Gaskell, shortly after, was a <lb/>
revelation concerning her and her sisters which <lb/>
astonished all who had read their works, and it <lb/>
gave a fresh impetus to their sale. People wondered <lb/>
how women so unfavorably situated could write <lb/>
such books, and many were filled with admiration <lb/>
for the nobility of character they had displayed. <lb/>
Mrs. Gaskell's memoir also led to the publication <lb/>
of Charlotte's first novel, "The Professor," which <lb/>
had failed to find a publisher in the days of her <lb/>
obscurity. This book, without detracting from, added <lb/>
nothing to her celebrity, albeit it illustrated the <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0045"/>
hopeful spirit of her life during her stay at Brussels. <lb/>
The memoir was a fitting supplement to the novels, <lb/>
which can not be adequately interpreted without it <lb/>
or some other of the portraitures of these gifted <lb/>
sisters which have been since given to the world.</p>
<p>These sisters three, though far from perfect in <lb/>
their lives and characters, will always command a <lb/>
large measure of admiration, not for genius only, <lb/>
but for the courage which enabled them to battle, <lb/>
not without success, against conditions of life <reg orig="calcu-|lated">calculated</reg> <lb/>
in themselves to prevent the healthy <reg orig="develop-|ment">development</reg> <lb/>
of either their minds or hearts. Motherless <lb/>
almost from infancy, having a father who seems to <lb/>
have been strangely deficient in paternal sympathies, <lb/>
living isolated from society in a drearily situated <lb/>
home, left much to themselves, without sufficient <lb/>
suitable instruction during the years of childhood, <lb/>
unsupplied with reading that contained suitable food <lb/>
for thought, their religious conceptions formed after <lb/>
the pattern of that pitiless iron creed known as ultra <lb/>
Calvinism, and having no examples of evangelical <lb/>
piety before their eyes, is it any wonder that they <lb/>
were eccentric, more or less morbid, shy, reticent, <lb/>
ignorant of society and its ways, unconventional, <lb/>
and somewhat self-willed? Nay. They could, <reg orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg>, <lb/>
have scarcely been otherwise. The wonder <lb/>
<pb n="40" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0046"/>
is that, with all their disadvantages, they became <lb/>
true, brave, courageous, affectionate, dutiful women, <lb/>
large in heart and brain, and able to command and <lb/>
hold, if not the unqualified admiration, yet the <lb/>
respectful attention and affectionate regard of the <lb/>
reading world. Achieving all this under such <reg orig="un-|favorable">unfavorable</reg> <lb/>
opportunities, they inspire one with the <lb/>
belief that, had they been favored with only <reg orig="ordi-|nary">ordinary</reg> <lb/>
means of self-culture, ethical teaching, and <lb/>
spiritual training, they would have taken the <lb/>
highest rank as Christian women and as writers.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> Duyekinck's "Cyclopedia of American <reg orig="Liter-|ature">Literature</reg>" <lb/>
it is said that Hannah Adams "was <lb/>
probably the first woman in the country to <lb/>
devote herself to a literary life, and this, too, at <lb/>
a time when the temptations which such a career <lb/>
could offer to either sex were insignificant, either in <lb/>
view of fame or gain." And the writers of the <lb/>
"Introductory Notes" to her memoirs say, "Among <lb/>
those who have overcome great and peculiar <reg orig="diffi-|culties">difficulties</reg> <lb/>
in the pursuit of knowledge, she holds a <reg orig="dis-|tinguished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
place. She became a literary woman <lb/>
when literature was a rare accomplishment in this <lb/>
country."</p>
<pb n="42" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0048"/>
<p>These statements place Miss Adams before the <lb/>
reader as an exceptional woman, standing in a <reg orig="posi-|tion">position</reg> <lb/>
before the public which no American lady had <lb/>
previously ventured to occupy. Hence the reader <lb/>
very naturally inquires, what influences moved her <lb/>
to try her fortune as a writer. What were the <reg orig="qual-|ities">qualities</reg> <lb/>
and the circumstances which helped her to win <lb/>
success? A glance at the facts in her simple record <lb/>
will show that her own impulses, quickened by the <lb/>
necessities of her condition, gave inspiration to her <lb/>
pen, and that by the forces of her strong character <lb/>
she made her very unfavorable circumstances bend <lb/>
to her will. In no narrow sense, therefore, she was <lb/>
the architect of her own fortune&mdash;a self-made <lb/>
woman.</p>
<p>Miss Adams was a native of the pleasant town <lb/>
of Medfield, Massachusetts, where she was born in <lb/>
1756. Her father was in a false position; that is, <lb/>
in a pursuit for which both his health and tastes <lb/>
unfitted him. In his boyhood he had been through <lb/>
a course of preparation for the university, but when <lb/>
he was of age to enter, his parents, thinking him <lb/>
physically too delicate to leave home, obliged him <lb/>
to settle on their large farm. Either from lack of <lb/>
capacity or will, he did not greatly prosper as a <lb/>
farmer, and therefore, after his marriage, he rented <lb/>
<pb n="43" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0049"/>
his farm and opened a store, which he stocked not <lb/>
only with dry-goods and groceries, but also with a <lb/>
large assortment of books, better suited, perhaps, to <lb/>
the popular demand than to his own tastes.</p>
<p>Hannah's mother was a sensitive and delicate <lb/>
lady. It is not strange, therefore, that both father <lb/>
and mother being infirm, the daughter inherited <lb/>
from them a feeble constitution and a very excitable <lb/>
nervous system. The tenderness of her mother led <lb/>
her to permit Hannah to form habits of "<reg orig="debili-|tating">debilitating</reg> <lb/>
softness." The family being then in affluent <lb/>
circumstances, there appeared no probability that <lb/>
she would ever be obliged to depend for support <lb/>
upon her own exertions. Why, then, should she not <lb/>
be tenderly reared? What need of alarm because <lb/>
the child disliked childish amusements, or because <lb/>
she was not sufficiently strong regularly to attend <lb/>
the district school, or because she was so timid and <lb/>
shy that she shrunk from appearing in company? <lb/>
Would she not, despite all these hindrances to the <lb/>
acquisition of qualities necessary to combat with the <lb/>
difficulties of life, be a dove sheltered in the soft <lb/>
nest of a home made comfortable by wealth and <lb/>
happy by parental fondness?</p>
<p>So it seemed for a time. But when this delicate <lb/>
child was only ten Years old her mother died. Not <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0050"/>
long after, her aunt, who was a second mother to her, <lb/>
died also. A few years later her father, plundered <lb/>
by the men who managed his farm and unfortunate <lb/>
in his business transactions, became bankrupt. Then <lb/>
the once affluent farmer and store-keeper was <reg orig="re-|duced">reduced</reg> <lb/>
to the necessity of taking boarders to eke <lb/>

out a living. Thus the prospects of our sensitive, <lb/>
delicate young maiden were no longer bright, but <lb/>
wrapped in folds of darkness.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there was, though scarcely as yet <lb/>
perceptible, a silver lining to those frowning clouds. <lb/>
This lining consisted in the development of the <lb/>
maiden's intellectual powers and literary tastes. <lb/>
True, she had not learned much during her <reg orig="occa-|sional">occasional</reg> <lb/>
attendance at the district school, since in those <lb/>
early days, as Hannah's biographer remarks, the <lb/>
"village school-master much resembled Goldsmith's, <lb/>
of whom <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'The village all declared how much he knew;</l>
<l>'T was certain he could write, and cipher too.'"</l>
</lg></q>
But nature had given her an "ardent curiosity and <lb/>
a desire to acquire knowledge." Her first concept <lb/>
of heaven, she writes, "was of a place where we should <lb/>
find our thirst for knowledge fully gratified." She <lb/>
had of her own sweet will fed this appetite for <lb/>
knowledge by much reading of the books in her <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0051"/>
father's large library and on the shelves in his store. <lb/>
Her memory, too, was very tenacious. And though <lb/>
she preferred novels, romances, and poems to more <lb/>
solid reading, yet she had not wholly refrained from <lb/>
poring over the pages of historians and biographers. <lb/>
And when her father had among his boarders some <lb/>
educated gentlemen, who, drawn to her probably by <lb/>
the charms of her amiable character, offered to aid <lb/>
her studies, she gladly accepted their offer, and soon <lb/>
made such rapid progress in the rudiments of Latin, <lb/>
Greek, logic, and geography, that not many years <lb/>
after she actually fitted three young men for college! <lb/>
Of the extent of her early reading she writes, <lb/>
"Perhaps few of my sex have perused more books <lb/>
at the age of twenty than I had."</p>
<p>But it was now necessary that Hannah should <lb/>
do something toward her own support. Poverty <lb/>
had come to stand like an armed man at her father's <lb/>
door, and to compel her to be a bread-winner. <lb/>
Physically unfitted for laborious employment, she <lb/>
took to "weaving lace with bobbins on a cushion." <lb/>
When this fairly profitable work ceased to find <reg orig="pur-|chasers">purchasers</reg>, <lb/>
as it did after the reopening of our commerce <lb/>
with Europe at the close of the War of the <reg orig="Revolu-|tion">Revolution</reg>, <lb/>
she took to spinning, to weaving, and then to <lb/>
braiding straw. Do what she would, however, her <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0052"/>
pecuniary returns were barely sufficient to keep the <lb/>
wolf of want from her door. To add to her trials, <lb/>
her eyes were subject to inflammation and her <reg orig="gen-|eral">general</reg> <lb/>
health was feeble. "And yet," she cheerily <lb/>
said, "I had then enjoyments of which the rich have <lb/>
no idea. When I had any work brought in, that <lb/>
would enable me to earn a few shillings by which I <lb/>
might buy paper or any articles of stationery, I <lb/>
engaged in writing with an interest that beguiled <lb/>
the monotony of my life." There was pleasure in <lb/>
this opportunity to earn a little money, but it was <lb/>
only such pleasure as the starving man enjoys when <lb/>
a plateful of bread is given him with which to <reg orig="sat-|isfy">satisfy</reg> <lb/>
the pangs of hunger for a season. It did not <lb/>
remove the cloud which shrouded her prospects, nor <lb/>
free her from the anxieties which gnawed at her <lb/>
heart like a worm hidden in a rosebud.</p>
<p>The pecuniary needs of Miss Adams spurred her <lb/>
into the field of authorship. She had already <reg orig="be-|gun">begun</reg> <lb/>
to write for her own improvement, having been <lb/>
moved thereto by the perusal of some passages from <lb/>
"Broughton's Dictionary," giving an account of <lb/>
the various religious denominations in the world. <lb/>
These passages piqued her curiosity. She wished <lb/>
to know more than they contained concerning <reg orig="opin-|ions">opinions</reg>, <lb/>
to maintain which so many different sects <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0053"/>

existed. Hence she read all the books on the <reg orig="ques-|tion">question</reg> <lb/>
that she could procure. The lack of candor and <lb/>
charity shown in many of those works disgusted <lb/>
her kindly nature; and she forthwith began to <reg orig="com-|pile">compile</reg> <lb/>
a manuscript in which she gave her own views <lb/>
of their agreements and differences, but with no <lb/>
thought at the time of offering her compilation to <lb/>
the public. But when her lace became unsalable, <lb/>
because of the renewed importation of foreign laces <lb/>
after the war, and her other employments proved <lb/>
insufficient for her support, she bravely resolved to <lb/>
enlarge her plan, and give her "View of Religions" <lb/>
to the world. "It was desperation," said she in <lb/>
after years, "and not vanity that induced me to publish."</p>
<p>It was a bold project for a mind so poorly <reg orig="pre-|pared">prepared</reg> <lb/>
by previous suitable studies to treat the many <lb/>
difficult problems involved. It required much <reg orig="pa-|tient">patient</reg> <lb/>
research and varied reading. But her courage <lb/>
was equal to the height of her ambitious purpose, <lb/>
and so also was her perseverance. She sought <reg orig="dili-|gently">diligently</reg> <lb/>
for the books required, read them carefully, <lb/>
weighed their opinions in the scale of charity, <lb/>
abridged their contents, grew enthusiastic over her <lb/>
task, and finally completed it. She was then <reg orig="twenty-|eight">twenty-eight</reg> <lb/>
years old.</p>
<pb n="48" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0054"/>
<p>The manuscript was ready for the press; but <lb/>
how was it to be published? Her father, with <lb/>
little business judgment, seems to have managed to <lb/>
find a printer, who, after she, aided by her father, <lb/>
had procured some four hundred subscribers for it, <lb/>
brought out the volume, pocketed the proceeds, and <lb/>
gave her fifty copies, for which she had to find <lb/>
purchasers, as the pitiful return for her toil! Alas, <lb/>
poor girl! She had fallen into the hands of a <reg orig="thor-|oughly">thoroughly</reg> <lb/>
selfish man.</p>
<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that, when this <lb/>
pecuniary disappointment was added to the <reg orig="exhaus-|tion">exhaustion</reg> <lb/>
caused by her severe mental toil in preparing <lb/>
the book, she became the victim of severe nervous <lb/>
prostration. For a time it seemed as if disease <lb/>
would speedily terminate both her labors and her <lb/>
life. At last, by Heaven's blessing on the skillful <lb/>
measures of her physician, she was restored to <lb/>
health.</p>
<p>She was now cheered by information from her <lb/>
selfish printer, that there was a demand for a second <lb/>
edition of her book. Would she contract with him <lb/>
to publish it? With becoming spirit she <reg orig="emphati-|cally">emphatically</reg> <lb/>
replied, "No." She would try, she thought, <lb/>
to print it for her own benefit. While looking for <lb/>
means to execute this very questionable plan, she <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0055"/>
was most sorely smitten by the death of her elder <lb/>
sister, Elizabeth, of whom she said: "There was <lb/>
but one heart between us, and I used sometimes to <lb/>
tell her, in the overflowing of my affection, that I <lb/>
could bear to lose every thing if she was spared to <lb/>
me, but that if she were taken away I should <lb/>
surely die." Yet it pleased the Master of life to <lb/>
take her beloved Elizabeth to himself, through the <lb/>
illuminated gate of a calm Christian death. <reg orig="Han-|nah's">Hannah's</reg> <lb/>
grief was for a time excessive, and she <lb/>
exclaimed: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"The world's a desert. Nothing now on earth</l>
<l>Can yield me joy or comfort."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>But time, "the great healer," with the comfort <lb/>
she found in the study of the consolatory passages <lb/>
of Holy Writ, enabled her to recover hope and <lb/>
mental elasticity. And although her poor health, <lb/>
her pecuniary destitution, her father's poverty, and <lb/>
her brother's inability to support her, stalked like <lb/>
haunting specters in her path, she yet roused <lb/>
herself from the stupor of grief, and resolved to <lb/>
struggle with energy once more for the means of <lb/>
self-support.</p>
<p>Having made additions to her "View of <reg orig="Re-|ligions">Religions</reg>," <lb/>
she now opened a correspondence with <lb/>
several printers, with a view to its publication; <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0056"/>
but, except from one, recived none but ambiguous, <lb/>
meaningless replies. While in Boston seeking to <lb/>
negotiate with that one, she was fortunately <reg orig="intro-|duced">introduced</reg> <lb/>
by a friend to the Rev. Mr. Freeman, a <reg orig="large-|hearted">largehearted</reg> <lb/>
man, who aided her so judiciously and <lb/>
effectively, that in 1791 the second edition of her <lb/>
work was published. It was so successful that, from <lb/>
her share in its proceeds, she was placed, she says, <lb/>
"in a comfortable situation;" she paid her debts, <lb/>
and "put out a small sum upon interest."</p>
<p>Miss Adams had dedicated this edition of her <lb/>
"View of Religions" to the venerable President <lb/>
Adams, who had already taken a sympathetic <reg orig="inter-|est">interest</reg> <lb/>
in her success, and with whom she occasionally <lb/>
corresponded. Though her name indicated <reg orig="rela-|tionship">relationship</reg> <lb/>
to him, the connection could not be <lb/>
directly and positively traced. Nevertheless, in <lb/>
one of his letters to her, Mr. Adams courteously <lb/>
wrote:</p>
<p>"You and I are undoubtedly related by birth, <lb/>
and, although we were both 'born in humble <reg orig="ob-|scurity">obscurity</reg>,' <lb/>
yet I presume neither of us has any cause <lb/>
to regret that circumstance. If I could ever <reg orig="sup-|pose">suppose</reg> <lb/>
that family pride was in any case excusable, I <lb/>
should think a descent from a line of virtuous, <reg orig="in-|dependent">independent</reg> <lb/>
farmers, for one hundred and sixty years, <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0057"/>
was a better fountain for it than a descent through <lb/>
royal or titled scoundrels ever since the flood."</p>
<p>This was sound democratic doctrine, flattering, <lb/>
no doubt, to the practical and serious-minded Miss <lb/>
Adams, because it ranked her ancestry, as well as <lb/>
his, not among the peerage of the herald's office in <lb/>
London or Paris, but among those genuine peers <lb/>
and peeresses whose patent of nobility was earned, <lb/>
not by the sword or by flattering princes, but by <lb/>
patient industry and self-denying virtue.</p>
<p>Success stimulates laudable ambition. In the <lb/>
case of Miss Adams it moved her to attempt a <lb/>
second work, called "A Summary History of New <lb/>
England." To obtain the requisite information for <lb/>
this undertaking, besides consulting the works then <lb/>
existing, she made researches among the State papers <lb/>
of Rhode Island. Hoping to gain something more <lb/>
than present subsistence from this work, she toiled <lb/>
early and late to complete it. In doing this she <reg orig="over-|tasked">over-tasked</reg> <lb/>
her powers of endurance, and so injured her <lb/>
eyes that, for two years, she had to lay aside her pen. <lb/>
As soon as her eyes were restored she resumed her <lb/>
labors, finished her manuscript, and had it printed <lb/>
at her own expense in 1799. She was then <reg orig="forty-|three">forty-three</reg> <lb/>
years old, and, as she says, "derived but little <lb/>
profit" from her labor.</p>
<pb n="52" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0058"/>
<p>While writing this book it appears that she <lb/>
taught district schools in several towns during the <lb/>
Summer months, generally "boarding round," as <lb/>
the custom then was, in the homes of her pupils.</p>
<p>A third edition of her "View of Religions" <lb/>
being called for, the Rev.Mr. Freeman again rendered <lb/>
her such business assistance that she obtained five <lb/>
hundred dollars for an edition of two thousand <lb/>
copies. This sum was as a cordial to one who is <lb/>
faint, and a stimulant to further efforts in her <lb/>
chosen pursuit.</p>
<p>Her next production was a "Concise View of the <lb/>
Christian Religion," selected from the writings of <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">eminent laymen</hi>. It was written under the serious <lb/>
difficulty of making the booksellers' shops in <reg orig="Bos-|ton">Boston</reg> <lb/>
her places of labor, because of her need to <lb/>
consult books which she could not borrow, and <lb/>
which she was too poor to buy. When it was <reg orig="fin-|ished">finished</reg>, <lb/>
she could find no better publisher than a <lb/>
man who gave her the pitiful compensation of one <lb/>
hundred dollars, <hi rend="italic">in books</hi>, for the copyright. It <lb/>
was published in 1804.</p>
<p>With genuine New England perseverance, Miss <lb/>
Adams, still refusing to yield to discouragement <lb/>
because of the meager pecuniary fruits of her <reg orig="pa-|tient">patient</reg> <lb/>
labors, prepared an abridgment of her "History <lb/>
<pb n="53" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0059"/>
of New England," for the use of schools. She was <lb/>
very sanguine that this work would fill her purse; <lb/>
but when it was finished she was grieved to find that <lb/>
it had been anticipated by a similar book, from the <lb/>
pen of the Rev. Jedediah Morse, a well-known and <lb/>
accomplished clergyman. Nevertheless, despite this <lb/>
formidable obstacle to its success, after some delay, <lb/>
she had it put to press. And then&mdash;alas for this <lb/>
patient and much-tried lady!&mdash;her printer failed <lb/>
before it was published, and she gained not a penny <lb/>
from it. Singularly enough, she met with a similar <lb/>
misfortune two years after, while a second edition <lb/>
was in the hands of another party! It seemed as <lb/>
if her mettle was destined to be tested to the <reg orig="utter-|most">uttermost</reg> <lb/>
by untoward circumstances.</p>
<p>But her impulse to write was still vigorous, and <lb/>
her courage so undismayed that she undertook still <lb/>
another work, requiring wider research than any of <lb/>
her previous books. She would write a history <lb/>
of the Jews, a formidable task even for one in <lb/>
vigorous health and possessing a full knowledge of <lb/>
the subject. Yet she undertook it with her usual <lb/>
enthusiasm, removing first to Dedham, and then to <lb/>
Boston, that she might find access to the standard <lb/>
authorities which were to be the basis of her <reg orig="compi-|lation">compilation</reg>. <lb/>
She had previously formed the acquaintance <lb/>
<pb n="54" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0060"/>
of the Rev. Mr. Buckminster, the eloquent and <lb/>
learned pastor of Brattle Street Church, and he <reg orig="gen-|erously">generously</reg> <lb/>
gave her the unlimited use of his valuable <lb/>
library. President Adams invited her to Quincy, <lb/>
with liberty to explore the alcoves of his library in <lb/>
search of information. The Athen&aelig;um also gave <lb/>
her the free use of its literary treasures. Several <lb/>
gentlemen of high position, impressed by her zeal, <lb/>
ability, and character, favored her with their <reg orig="coun-|sels">counsels</reg>; <lb/>
and ladies of the highest social standing took <lb/>
deep interest in her work and welfare. Better even <lb/>
than all this recognition of her worth, was the fact <lb/>
that these ladies and gentlemen voluntarily secured <lb/>
her an annuity, which relieved her of anxiety with <lb/>
respect to her future, and left her with liberty, <reg orig="un-|embarassed">unembarassed</reg> <lb/>
by care, to devote herself to her darling <lb/>
pursuits.</p>
<p>Miss Adams unconsciously betrayed one secret <lb/>
of her working capacity while gathering materials <lb/>
for her history of the Jews in the library of <reg orig="Pres-|ident">President</reg> <lb/>
Adams. Struck with the rapidity of her <lb/>
examinations of the heavy folios containing the <lb/>
writings of the fathers, he pleasantly questioned <lb/>
her one day as to their contents. Her ready replies <lb/>
surprised him. They showed that, while rapidly <lb/>
glancing from page to page, she had actually culled <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0061"/>
from them all they contained <hi rend="italic">apropos</hi> to her <reg orig="pro-|posed">proposed</reg> <lb/>
work. Quickness of perception, with a power <lb/>
of abstraction from all but the work in hand, and <lb/>
a most tenacious memory, made her a marvelous <lb/>
gatherer of facts and ideas. In the library of the <lb/>
Athen&aelig;um, too, her abstraction was such that she <lb/>
was sometimes absolutely unconscious of what passed <lb/>
around her. When spending a day in its alcoves, <lb/>
as she often did, she took no note of time. When <lb/>
the hour of noon struck, the librarian on several <lb/>
occasions tried to notify her in vain. Seeing her <lb/>
so absorbed in her book, that nothing less than <lb/>
discourteous urgency could break her reveries, he <lb/>
would give up the attempt, lock the door of the <lb/>
building, and go home to his luncheon. On his <lb/>
return he would find her in the same spot, unaware <lb/>
that it was past noon, and that she had been the <lb/>
sole occupant of the library for the preceding hour.</p>
<p>After mentioning this fact to her one day, a <lb/>
friend asked, "Is it true, Miss Adams, that you <lb/>
have been thus lost to every thing but your work?"</p>
<p>"It is much exaggerated," she smilingly replied. <lb/>
"I do n't think it ever happened more than once <lb/>
or twice."</p>
<p>But who was the better witness in such a case? <lb/>
Doubtless the observant librarian, not the abstracted <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0062"/>
student. But may not these abstracted moods account <lb/>
both for her ability as a compiler and for the physical <lb/>
exhaustion which so frequently followed her weeks <lb/>
and months of application? A body lacking <reg orig="con-|stitutional">constitutional</reg> <lb/>
soundness could but suffer in some of its <lb/>
functions from such periods of profound mental <lb/>
abstraction.</p>
<p>Aided by the ample materials found in these <lb/>
libraries, Miss Adams threw her whole strength into <lb/>
her proposed history, and opened correspondence <lb/>
with some learned men and women in Europe, <reg orig="seek-|ing">seeking</reg> <lb/>
information not to be found in American <reg orig="col-|lections">collections</reg> <lb/>
of books. Her zeal was, however, greater <lb/>
than her strength. Too close application again <lb/>
affected her eyes; her father's death depressed her <lb/>
spirits; the weakness of advancing age began to <lb/>
oppress her. Nevertheless, she pressed on in spite <lb/>
of all obstacles, finding happiness despite her <reg orig="afflic-|tions">afflictions</reg>, <lb/>
in writing, and, she says, "I completed my <lb/>
work in 1812." It was published in Boston the <lb/>
same year. Six years after, an edition of it was <lb/>
issued in London by the society for promoting <lb/>
Christianity among the Jews. Its English editor <lb/>
commended it highly as a book well calculated to be <lb/>
useful in the special work of the society he <reg orig="repre-|sented">represented</reg>. <lb/>
No doubt this compliment, which was shown <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0063"/>
to be sincere by the publication of the book&mdash;a <lb/>
stately octavo volume of 576 pages&mdash;was very <reg orig="grat-|ifying">gratifying</reg> <lb/>
to its modest author. It must have cheered <lb/>
her spirits, which were oppressed at times by her <lb/>
increasing infirmities. It was a recognition of her <lb/>
literary ability by highly respectable parties who were <lb/>
well qualified judges, and an assurance that her <lb/>
hope of benefiting the Jews by her labor was likely <lb/>
to be attained.</p>
<p>It is pleasing to know that the latter years of <lb/>
this good lady's "troubled life" were spent in <reg orig="com-|fort">comfort</reg>, <lb/>
and in the enjoyment of congenial society, in <lb/>
or near the city of Boston. The extreme delicacy <lb/>
of her health was of course a burden that no <reg orig="meas-|ure">measure</reg> <lb/>
of human sympathy could remove; but her faith <lb/>
in Holy Writ made her strength equal to that <reg orig="bur-|den">burden</reg>, <lb/>
and kept her cheerful until, in 1832, God sent <lb/>
the angel of death to loose the bonds of life. Not <lb/>
long before his messenger came, she said smilingly <lb/>
to a visiting friend:</p>
<p>"I believe some people think I have lived long <lb/>
enough, but I am willing to remain as long as it <lb/>
pleases God to continue my life;" and then, <reg orig="point-|ing">pointing</reg> <lb/>
to the landscape without, she added, "How <lb/>
can any body be impatient to quit such a <reg orig="beau-|tiful">beautiful</reg> <lb/>
world?"</p>
<pb n="58" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0064"/>
<p>It is not often that a person in feeble health, at <lb/>
the age of seventy-six, feels life to be so attractive <lb/>
and earth so beautiful as this latter remark proves <lb/>
Miss Adams did. But her heart was a fountain of <lb/>
cheerfulness. She loved to live, because to her life <lb/>
had always been thought, hope, action. She had <lb/>
loved the beautiful, both in the moral and the <lb/>
material world. She had always aimed at the <reg orig="high-|est">highest</reg> <lb/>
good within reach of her powers. Though <lb/>
excessively timid, even to shyness, she yet, when in <lb/>
society, charmed all she met by her modest simplicity, <lb/>
affectionate tenderness of spirit, and unique, winning <lb/>
manners. Her character, without being eccentric, <lb/>
was original. It is not surprising, therefore, that <lb/>
in old age she found enough of friendship, of <reg orig="sym-|pathy">sympathy</reg>, <lb/>
of good in life, to love it still; albeit she <lb/>
had also sufficient faith in the great All-Father to <lb/>
look to life beyond the grave, if not with the <lb/>
warmth of enthusiastic desire, yet with the calmness <lb/>
of a well-grounded and tranquil hope.</p>
<p>As to her literary ability, it must suffice here to say <lb/>
that, if not of the highest rank, as is not pretended, <lb/>
it was yet sufficient to command the respect of some <lb/>
of the best minds of her times, and to win the <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg> <lb/>
of many readers. Her books, particularly her <lb/>
"View of Religions," met, if they did not fully <lb/>
<pb n="59" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0065"/>
satisfy a want of her generation, and contributed in <lb/>
their measure to the cause of righteousness. In <lb/>
producing them, as we have seen, under difficulties <lb/>
which few women could have surmounted, she gave <lb/>
her sex an example of perseverance and strength <lb/>
of purpose worthy of imitation. She was, in truth, <lb/>
a noble-minded, honorable, true woman &mdash;a pioneer <lb/>
of the numerous ladies who have since contributed <lb/>
to the literature of America, and specially deserving <lb/>
respect, because the productions of her pen were not <lb/>
only free from moral blemishes, but positively pure, <lb/>
adapted, not to injure, nor merely to amuse, but to <lb/>
promote the best interests of mankind.</p>

<p>If these sentiments have a right within the realm <lb/>

<pb n="61" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0067"/>
as equal to very many of the daughters of <lb/>
genius whose pens have won the pleased attention <lb/>
of the world. But her goodness, her devotion to <lb/>
the service of mankind, and her deep sympathy <lb/>
with the children of affliction, place her in a higher <lb/>
rank than those whose fame reposes on literature <lb/>
alone. These gave pleasure to mankind by the <lb/>
airy creations of their imaginations, but Mrs. <lb/>
Prentiss wrought among men as one who deeply <lb/>
felt the truth that we are born, not merely to <lb/>
charm others, but "to do benefits" to all within <lb/>
our reach.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Prentiss was the daughter of the Rev. <lb/>
Dr. Edward Payson, a Congregational clergyman, <lb/>
who was one of the best, most devout men of <lb/>
modern times. She was born in Portland, Maine, <lb/>
October 26, 1818, "the fifth of eight children." Her <lb/>
home was a nest of tender, parental love, in which <lb/>
natural affection was purified and exalted by an <lb/>
uncommon measure of piety, and refined by the <lb/>
graces of intellectual culture.</p>
<p>When a child Elizabeth is described by her <lb/>
husband and biographer<ref target="n1" n="1">*</ref>
<note id="n1" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>"The Life and Letters of Elizabeth Prentiss," author of <lb/>
"Stepping Heavenward," by George L. Prentiss.</p></note>
 as "a dark-eyed, delicate <lb/>
little creature of sylph-like form, reserved and shy <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0068"/>
in the presence of strangers, of a sweet disposition, <lb/>
and very intense in her sympathies. Her <reg orig="constitu-|tion">constitution</reg> <lb/>
was feeble, and she inherited from her father <lb/>
his high-strung, nervous temperament." She was <lb/>
venturesome, frolicsome, uncommonly susceptible to <lb/>
impressions, and so moved by a spectacle or story <lb/>
of suffering that she trembled with excitement, and <lb/>
was ready to make any possible sacrifice to relieve <lb/>
it. Speaking of her strong sympathies one day, <lb/>
Dr. Payson said, with playful exaggeration:</p>
<p>"She will be in danger some day of marrying <lb/>
a blind man, or a helpless cripple, out of pure <lb/>
sympathy."</p>
<p>Her love for her father was the strongest <reg orig="pas-|sion">passion</reg> <lb/>
of Elizabeth's child-life. To be with him was <lb/>
her chief delight. His praise was ecstasy, his <lb/>
absence her sorest grief. She seemed to have <reg orig="inher-|ited">inherited</reg> <lb/>
many of his characteristics, both mental and <lb/>
physical. His piety gave inspiration to her religious <lb/>
affections, and she never forgot the impression made <lb/>
upon her mind by finding him on his face before <lb/>
God in agonizing prayer, when, by mistake, she <lb/>
rushed one day into his study. And when he died <lb/>
in 1827, she being then only nine years old, she <lb/>
tasted her first bitter grief. But though dead, his <lb/>
influence remained with her to the end of her life.</p>
<pb n="63" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0069"/>
<p>Some three years later Elizabeth joined the <lb/>
visible Church. Young as she was, she <reg orig="compre-|hended">comprehended</reg> <lb/>
not a little of the nature and duties of <lb/>
Christian discipleship. Early Christian nurture had <lb/>
taught and trained her in the way of faith. And <lb/>
she continued to adorn her profession; first in her <lb/>
mother's house, next in the schools she attended, <lb/>
and then in the wider spheres of adult life.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the great loss she suffered in <lb/>
the death of her devout father, her youth was passed <lb/>
under conditions highly favorable to the right <lb/>
development of her mind and character. Her <lb/>
mother, who had been reared in the lap of wealth, <lb/>
which had been lost in the fluctuations of her <lb/>
father's mercantile business, was a lady of a noble <lb/>
nature, sympathetic in feeling, kind in act, firm yet <lb/>
gentle in ruling her household, and skillful in <reg orig="adapt-|ing">adapting</reg> <lb/>
her discipline to the peculiarities of her <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg>. <lb/>
The vivacity of her well-informed mind <lb/>
made her a delightful companion, and drew around <lb/>
her a charming circle of cultivated friends. She <lb/>
was withal a superior house-mother, and therefore <lb/>
it was that Elizabeth's youth was passed in a home <lb/>
which, though not rich in material things, was, <lb/>
intellectually, religiously, and in its domestic <reg orig="rou-|tine">routine</reg>, <lb/>
in no mean degree an ideal home.</p>
<pb n="64" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0070"/>
<p>To be reared in such a delightful home was a <lb/>
special gift of Providence. Whether Elizabeth <lb/>
should reap its full benefits depended largely upon <lb/>
herself. To her credit be it said, she was <reg orig="spontane-|ously">spontaneously</reg> <lb/>
faithful to her rare opportunity. Sent to the <lb/>
best schools in Portland and, for a season, to one in <lb/>
Ipswich, Massachusetts, she studied with diligence, <lb/>
and made rapid progress. In the home circle, <lb/>
though she had occasional fits of unamiable temper, <lb/>
yet her sparkling wit, her cheerful temper, her warm <lb/>
filial and sisterly affection, made it questionable <lb/>
whether she or her learned sister Louisa was the <lb/>
life of the household. She spent her leisure <reg orig="mo-|ments">moments</reg> <lb/>
in reading, in rambling near the shores of <lb/>
Casco Bay with some beloved school friend, and in <lb/>
writing poetry. She was also much given to the <lb/>
quiet study of character, as revealed in the spirit, <lb/>
words, and actions of her associates. When only <lb/>
twenty years old she opened a school for girls in her <lb/>
mother's house, and being a "born teacher," was <lb/>
successful in securing the mental improvement and <lb/>
in winning the love of her pupils.</p>
<p>Her first attempts in authorship were <reg orig="contribu-|tions">contributions</reg> <lb/>
to the <hi rend="italic">Youth's Companion</hi>, of which popular <lb/>
sheet the father of N. P. Willis was then both <reg orig="pub-|lisher">publisher</reg> <lb/>
and editor. In writing, she simply followed <lb/>
<pb n="65" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0071"/>
the bent of her genius. Her articles attracted <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg>, <lb/>
and gave early assurance to her friends that <lb/>
she was destined to win reputation as a writer. Her <lb/>
unique and charming letters to her relatives and <lb/>
chosen friends confirmed this impression, which was <lb/>
justified, as we shall see, by her subsequent career.</p>
<p>Such was the girl-life of Elizabeth Prentiss. It <lb/>
had its trials, arising largely from the death of her <lb/>
father and the struggles for comfortable subsistence <lb/>
on the part of her mother, to which that <reg orig="bereave-|ment">bereavement</reg> <lb/>
gave rise. It had its bright side in the beauty <lb/>
of her mother's strong character, in the spiritual <lb/>
and intellectual culture of her home circle, in the <lb/>
culture and respectability of her associations, and in <lb/>
her educational advantages. In herself, nature and <lb/>
grace combined to furnish her the conditions of <lb/>
happiness and usefulness. The former endowed her <lb/>
with rare gifts of both heart and mind; the latter, <lb/>
from the beginning, moved her to be a truly loyal <lb/>
disciple of the Lord Jesus. Such a girlhood <reg orig="con-|tained">contained</reg> <lb/>
the "promise and potency" of a noble <lb/>
womanhood. And to such a womanhood Elizabeth <lb/>
Payson attained, not by the neglect or careless use, <lb/>
but by the earnest improvement of her early <lb/>
opportunities.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth was about twenty-one years of <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0072"/>
age, she passed through a spiritual "valley of the <lb/>
shadow of death." As stated above, she had made <lb/>
a profession of discipleship when twelve years old. <lb/>
From that profession she had never fallen away. <lb/>
She had, indeed, been the instrument of winning <lb/>
some of her friends and pupils to Christ in 1837&ndash;8. <lb/>
But in 1839&ndash;40 a thick cloud of darkness enveloped <lb/>
her soul, and she fell under the power of a morbid <lb/>
moral feeling. Doubt usurped the place of faith, <lb/>
and despair blotted out the visions of hope. Through <lb/>
four dreary months she endured unspeakable agonies <lb/>
of mind, seeing nothing but such vileness in herself <lb/>
and such unapproachable holiness in God as made <lb/>
it seem impossible that he could possibly love her. <lb/>
Her anguish through this gloomy period put both <lb/>
her health and life in peril.</p>
<p>Most earnest Christians who are endowed with <lb/>
highly sensitive consciences, pass through a <reg orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg> <lb/>
similar, though less morbid, state of mental <lb/>
unrest as this, when God lifts them farther into the <lb/>
light of his purity. In that ineffable light they see <lb/>
sin as never before; they look into the hitherto <lb/>
hidden depths of their hearts until they so abhor <lb/>
themselves that it seems impossible to them that <lb/>
God can ever forgive and dwell in them. The <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg> <lb/>
of this manifestation is to lead its subject to <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0073"/>
look at the immeasurable breadth and depth of the <lb/>
infinite love of God in Christ. Elizabeth realized <lb/>
this when, after listening one Sunday to a sermon <lb/>
on the ability of Christ to save "unto the <reg orig="utter-|most">uttermost</reg>," <lb/>
her weary spirit rested itself on the love of <lb/>
Christ. Then, giving herself to admire, to love, to <lb/>
praise him, her turbulent emotions subsided, and <lb/>
were replaced with a holy peace and an exultant <lb/>
love which moved her to put self and every thing <lb/>
else aside, and to devote herself entirely to the <reg orig="serv-|ice">service</reg> <lb/>
of Christ. This experience, good in itself, <lb/>
though made needlessly severe by that tendency to <lb/>
morbid feeling, which she inherited from her father, <lb/>
lifted her into a higher plane of Christian living; <lb/>
so that, says her biographer, "henceforth to her <lb/>
dying hour His will was the sovereign law of her <lb/>
existence, and her sweetest joy also."</p>
<p>In 1840 we find Elizabeth in Richmond, <reg orig="Vir-|ginia">Virginia</reg>, <lb/>
successfully teaching a department in the <lb/>
school of a Mr. Persico, winning the affections both <lb/>
of her fellow-teachers and pupils, living a godly <lb/>
life, delighting her associates by her cheerful spirit <lb/>
and playful manners, and earning the gratitude of <lb/>
the parents of her pupils, because of her influence <lb/>
in elevating the characters of their children. <reg orig="Dur-|ing">During</reg> <lb/>
her stay in Richmond, she suffered very severely <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0074"/>
at times from a disease of the heart, which <reg orig="threat-|ened">threatened</reg> <lb/>
to become chronic; but she was graciously <lb/>
enabled to, adorn her profession by her patience <lb/>
under suffering, as she did by her daily demeanor when <lb/>
in health. In August, 1841, "she left Richmond, <lb/>
and flew homeward like a bird to its nest."</p>
<p>Her sister Louisa was married to Professor <reg orig="Hop-|kins">Hopkins</reg> <lb/>
immediately after her arrival in Portland. Her <lb/>
school duties had taxed her strength too severely, <lb/>
and her supersensitive nervous system made <reg orig="self-|control">self-control</reg> <lb/>
difficult, even in the comparative quiet of <lb/>
her maternal home. But, battling bravely against <lb/>
this hindrance, she devoted her time to the diligent <lb/>
performance of home duties, to study, to Christian <lb/>
work, and to the pursuit of still greater measures <lb/>
of God-likeness. With her peculiar temperament, <lb/>
it was scarcely possible to escape from occasional <lb/>
depression of spirits. Nevertheless, her religious <lb/>
progress was obvious, if not to herself, yet to her <lb/>
observing friends. After spending little over a year <lb/>
at home, at the earnest solicitation of Mr. Persico, <lb/>
she returned to her place in his school, where she <lb/>
remained until late in the Summer of 1843. These <lb/>
were trying months, on account of the death of <lb/>
Mrs. Persico, and the subsequent insolvency of the <lb/>
unfortunate widower. She was herself sick part of <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0075"/>
the time. Despite all these drawbacks, she did her <lb/>
duty with her wonted cheerfulness, won the hearts <lb/>
of most of her pupils, and when she returned to <lb/>
her home she was, though faint because of being <lb/>
overtasked, yet still pursuing after the highest <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg> <lb/>
spiritual attainments. At Richmond, as at <lb/>
Portland, she was constantly "stepping heavenward."</p>
<p>A new and sweet experience awaited her, shortly <lb/>
after her return to what she calls her "dear, good <lb/>
home." She found, as she expressed it, "the liberty <lb/>
to love." Mr. George Lewis Prentiss had the good <lb/>
fortune to win her large affections. In his character, <lb/>
tastes, culture, and religious aspirations, she <reg orig="recog-|nized">recognized</reg> <lb/>
the counterpart to her own, and he became <lb/>
her accepted suitor.</p>
<p>To Miss Payson, says her biographer, "love, <lb/>
after religion, was the holiest and most wonderful <lb/>
reality of life." So passionate was her desire to be <lb/>
truly and strongly loved, and so intense was the love <lb/>
she gave to others, that her betrothal put her <reg orig="spir-|itual">spiritual</reg> <lb/>
life to a crucial test. Happily, she both saw <lb/>
and felt her danger, saying in a letter to her cousin, <lb/>
"I am tempted to seek my heaven in so loving!" <lb/>
To her betrothed she wrote, "If ever there was a <lb/>
heart tempted to idolatry, to give itself up fully, <lb/>
utterly, with perfect abandonment of every other <lb/>
<pb n="70" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0076"/>
hope and interest, to an earthly love, so is mine <lb/>
tempted now." Again writing to her cousin, she <lb/>
says of her lover: "I am <hi rend="italic">afraid</hi> of love. There is <lb/>
no other medium save that of the happiness of <reg orig="lov-|ing">loving</reg> <lb/>
and being loved, by which my affections could <lb/>
be effectually turned from divine to earthly things. <lb/>
Am I not, then, on dangerous ground? Yet God <lb/>
mercifully shows me that it is so, and when I think <lb/>
how he has saved me hitherto, through sharp <reg orig="tempta-|tions">temptations</reg>, <lb/>
it seems wicked distrust of him not to feel that <lb/>
he will save me through those to come."</p>
<p>Thus guarding her heart against the excess of <lb/>
earthly love, she was enabled to keep it centered on <lb/>
the Highest. The letters to her betrothed, which, <lb/>
in their ardor, simplicity, and frank confessions, <lb/>
remind one of Meta's letters to Klopstock, are filled <lb/>
with the aspirations of a soul which was aflame with <lb/>
a love for God, still more ardent than that which she <lb/>
felt for him. And thus she solved the problem of <lb/>
giving her betrothed as warm a love as a good man <lb/>
could rightly claim, without taking from her divine <lb/>
Lord that supreme affection which she had already <lb/>
given him. Her spirituality did not, therefore, <reg orig="hin-|der">hinder</reg>, <lb/>
but really helped, the legitimate action of her <lb/>
womanly affections.</p>
<p>During the months of her betrothal, she had to <lb/>
<pb n="71" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0077"/>
undergo a terrible trial of her physical courage. A <lb/>
tumor in her neck made it necessary that she should <lb/>
suffer the cruel pains of the surgeon's knife. The <lb/>
first operation she endured heroically; but for some <lb/>
reason it was not successful, and she had to submit <lb/>
a second time to its torture. There was no <reg orig="chloro-|form">chloroform</reg> <lb/>
used at that time to deaden sensibility. <reg orig="Dur-|ing">During</reg> <lb/>
an hour and a quarter she bore up under the <lb/>
agony caused by the knife and needle, with a <reg orig="forti-|tude">fortitude</reg> <lb/>
which compelled the admiration of Dr. Warren, <lb/>
the skillful operator. The strong will which had <lb/>
kept her feet "stepping heavenward" despite many <lb/>
temptations, made her a heroine when subjected to <lb/>
physical pains kindred to those of martyrdom.</p>
<p>In April, 1845, Miss Payson became the bride of <lb/>
the Rev. George L. Prentiss, and, for the ensuing five <lb/>
years and a half, had her home in New Bedford, Mass., <lb/>
Mr. Prentiss being the newly ordained pastor of the <lb/>
South Trinitarian Church in that busy city. <reg orig="Un-|like">Unlike</reg> <lb/>
some ministers' young wives, who abstain from <lb/>
active work in the Church on the idle plea that such <lb/>
work belongs not to them, but to their husbands, <lb/>
Mrs. Prentiss gave herself heartily to such spheres <lb/>
of action as were open to her. With a wisdom <lb/>
beyond her years, she seized on the kind of work <lb/>
for which she was naturally best fitted. Her <reg orig="pecu-|liarly">peculiarly</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0078"/>
sympathetic nature prepared her to be an angel <lb/>
of mercy to the sick, and to such as, being in trouble, <lb/>
stood in need of sympathy. Accordingly, she made <lb/>
herself the bearer of balm to wounded hearts. Her <lb/>
natural shyness caused her to be reserved in such <lb/>
large companies as she was often invited to meet; <lb/>
but, while shrinking from conversation with elderly <lb/>
people, she would gather around her such young <lb/>
persons as were present, and interest them with an <lb/>
entertaining and instructive story, to which they <lb/>
listened with profit and delight. In private <reg orig="con-|versation">conversation</reg> <lb/>
with individuals, she was also very skillful <lb/>
in imparting spiritual comfort. Thus, within the <lb/>
line of her limitations, she was a true helpmeet to <lb/>
her husband in his work. Those of his people who <lb/>
understood her peculiar character loved her, and <lb/>
many not belonging to his parish, attracted by her <lb/>
sprightly manner and her literary accomplishments, <lb/>
sought her acquaintance.</p>
<p>Her married life was happy, not for a short <lb/>
time only, but to the end of her days, though, like <lb/>
all human lives, it was clouded at times by those <lb/>
trials that are common to our race, and by those <lb/>
which grew out of her marked idiosyncrasies. Some <lb/>
of those clouds cast their shadows upon her during <lb/>
her stay at New Bedford. With the mysterious <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0079"/>
joys of motherhood there came the cares and <reg orig="weari-|ness">weariness</reg> <lb/>
of the nursery. With these came also the <lb/>
visitations of the death-angel. Her sister-in-law, <lb/>
Abby L. Prentiss, her mother, and her brother-<reg orig="in-|law">in-law</reg>, <lb/>
S. S. Prentiss, were successively summoned <lb/>
into the land of the departed. To these saddening <lb/>
events, long and severe personal illness was added <lb/>
in the Winter of 1850. Nevertheless, her spiritual <lb/>
life continued to increase, and after her recovery <lb/>
she could write to her absent husband: "I can truly <lb/>
say I have not spent a happier Winter since our <lb/>
marriage, in spite of all my sickness."</p>
<p>In October, 1850, her husband having accepted a <lb/>
call to the Mercer Street Presbyterian Church, New <lb/>
York, she accompanied him to that city, where she <lb/>
found a wider sphere of action, and where her gifts <lb/>
took a direction which crowned her with the honors <lb/>
of a literary reputation, and made her a blessing <lb/>
to thousands. Thirteen years had passed since she <lb/>
had written for the press, when in 1853, under the <lb/>
spur of a sudden impulse, she wrote "Little Susy's <lb/>
Six Birthdays." Time, experience, reading, and a <lb/>
habit of observing the working of her own mind, <lb/>
and of studying the characters of others, of children <lb/>
especially, had stored her mind with facts which <lb/>
her sprightly genius enabled her to readily weave <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0080"/>
into quaint and lively story. Her first work took <lb/>
its place at once in the best class of books for <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg>. <lb/>
Its popularity stimulated her to write, and <lb/>
the public to buy her next production, "The Flower <lb/>
of the Family." "Henry and Bessie" was equally <lb/>
well received, as were also "Susy's Six Teachers," <lb/>
"Susy's Six Servants," and other juvenile books, <lb/>
which her fertile and charming pen subsequently <lb/>
produced. Between 1853 and 1879 she gave <reg orig="twenty-|five">twenty-five</reg> <lb/>
volumes to the public.</p>
<p>The most important of these productions was <lb/>
"Stepping Heavenward," published in 1869. <lb/>
Though inferior as a literary production to the <lb/>
"Diary of Kitty Trevelyan," of which it constantly <lb/>
reminds one, it was yet immensely popular both <lb/>
in America and Europe, and was, without doubt, <lb/>
very useful to thousands who, like herself, were <lb/>
seeking to be truly and wholly devoted to Christ. <lb/>
It is evidently a transcript of her own experience, <lb/>
an autobiography, not of her exterior but of her <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">interior</hi> life. She was a keen self-anatomist, and a <lb/>
close observer of the thoughts and conflicts of her <lb/>
own heart. Like her devout and pure-minded <lb/>
father, she was, as already stated, much given to <reg orig="de-|pressed">depressed</reg> <lb/>
and, at times, even morbid states of feeling. <lb/>
Her sensibilities were exquisitely keen, and naturally <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0081"/>
disposed her to attach an exaggerated importance <lb/>
to the words and actions of others. She was, <reg orig="more-|over">moreover</reg>, <lb/>
a close but quiet observer of all whose lives <lb/>
touched hers. She had a rare insight into <reg orig="charac-|ter">character</reg>, <lb/>
and what she observed she remembered. These <lb/>
qualities of mind and temperament produced an <lb/>
unusually varied religious experience, and an <reg orig="un-|commonly">uncommonly</reg> <lb/>
clear perception of the minute and <lb/>
trifling incidents which, by being misinterpreted, <lb/>
often disturb the harmonies of family and social <lb/>
life. Hence it came to pass, when Mrs. Prentiss <lb/>
put much of herself and her friends into a book <lb/>
written with dashing sprightliness, with a frankness <lb/>
which is refreshing, and seasoned with a quiet, quaint <lb/>
humor, which ripples over nearly every page, that <lb/>
the religious public read it with avidity. Almost <lb/>
every one found something in it that touched some <lb/>
phase of his own experience, and photographed <lb/>
either his own foibles or those of his acquaintances. <lb/>
To many who were burdened with vexatious <reg orig="house-|hold">household</reg> <lb/>
trials it was helpful, because it taught them <lb/>
valuable lessons of patient endurance. Nor was it <lb/>
without value to the spiritual life of many <reg orig="per-|plexed">perplexed</reg> <lb/>
believers, in that it taught them to take <lb/>
cheerful and trustful views of the Divine goodness. <lb/>
On the other hand, it may be questioned whether <lb/>
<pb n="76" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0082"/>
its pictures of a mind excessively given to <reg orig="self-|analysis">self-analysis</reg> <lb/>
were not calculated to encourage rather <lb/>
than to cure that morbid habit which is so <reg orig="detri-|mental">detrimental</reg> <lb/>
to healthy spiritual development. Minds <lb/>
naturally inclined to much self-anatomy, or moved <lb/>
to it by errors of creed, are more likely to sink <lb/>
into "the depths" with the Katy of the volume, <lb/>
than to rise with her to those highlands of <reg orig="cheer-|fulness">cheerfulness</reg> <lb/>
and hope to which she was accustomed to <lb/>
ascend by sudden bounds, but from which she also <lb/>
descended with a fatal facility which a more equable <lb/>
temperament and a better-grounded Christian faith <lb/>
would have cured. Nevertheless, it is more than <lb/>
probable that "Stepping Heavenward," despite this <lb/>
defect, helped very many more than it hindered. <lb/>
Like all the other works of its author, it breathes <lb/>
a spirit of ethical purity, and its sympathy is not <lb/>
with the selfishness of the earthy, but with the active, <lb/>
self-sacrificing love of the heavenly.</p>
<p>Her biographer, speaking of the motives which <lb/>
impelled her to write books, says: "From first to <lb/>
last she wrote not to get gain, or to win applause, <lb/>
but to do good." And she herself, writing to a <reg orig="cul-|tivated">cultivated</reg> <lb/>
friend who thoroughly appreciated her <reg orig="pro-|ductions">productions</reg>, <lb/>
said: "A woman should not live for, or <lb/>
even desire fame. This is yet more true of a <reg orig="Chris-|tian">Christian</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0083"/>
woman. If I had not steadily suppressed all <lb/>
such ambition, I might have become a sour, <reg orig="disap-|pointed">disappointed</reg> <lb/>
woman, seeing my best work unappreciated. <lb/>
But it has been my wish to <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'Dare to be little and unknown,</l>
<l>Seen and loved by God alone.'"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>The interpretation of this last sentence is <reg orig="con-|tained">contained</reg> <lb/>
in the following statements from her <reg orig="hus-|band's">husband's</reg> <lb/>
pen. After saying that, with respect to her <lb/>
desire to do good by writing, "she had her reward, <lb/>
good measure, pressed down and running over," he <lb/>
adds: "But of that kind of reward which gratifies <lb/>
literary taste and ambition she had almost none. <lb/>
Her books, even those most admired by the best <lb/>
judges, and which had the widest circulation both <lb/>
at home and abroad, attracted but little attention <lb/>
from the press. The organs of literary intelligence <lb/>
and criticism scarcely noticed them at all. Nor is <lb/>
it known that any attempt was ever made to analyze <lb/>
any of her more striking characters, or to point out <lb/>
the secret of her power and success as a writer."</p>
<p>It need surprise no one who has studied the <lb/>
spirit which animates the "organs of literary <reg orig="intel-|ligence">intelligence</reg> <lb/>
and criticism," to learn that those organs <lb/>
let the writings of Mrs. Prentiss "severely alone." <lb/>
Her spirit and theirs had few things in common. <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0084"/>
They would have lauded to the skies a Christless <lb/>
novel with no higher aim than the amusement of <lb/>
its readers; but for books so decidedly spiritual as <lb/>
hers, books in which literary art is held subordinate <lb/>
to religious purpose, they had no praises to bestow. <lb/>
Their editors, or most of them, not being spiritually <lb/>
minded men, could not comprehend them, and in <lb/>
their pride of intellect, probably, tossed them <reg orig="con-|temptuously">contemptuously</reg> <lb/>
aside as "goody-goody" books. But <lb/>
Mrs. Prentiss could richly afford to despise their <lb/>
neglect, in view of the fact that she was constantly <lb/>
in receipt of letters from all parts of the world, <lb/>
written by intelligent persons, to whom her books <lb/>
had given light, comfort, and stimulus in their <reg orig="strug-|gles">struggles</reg> <lb/>
with sorrow and sin. Had she done no more <lb/>
than to produce her twenty-five books, she would <lb/>
not have lived in vain.</p>
<p>But she did much more. Her beautiful home <lb/>
life, her church work, and her remarkable <reg orig="cheerful-|ness">cheerfulness</reg> <lb/>
under much affliction, as represented in her <lb/>
"Life and Letters," are interesting and precious <lb/>
illustrations of the power of Christian faith, by <lb/>
which, though dead, she will yet speak to coming <lb/>
generations, as she did during her life-time to the <lb/>
wide circle in which it was her lot to move. As <lb/>
our outline of the movements of her life was broken <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0085"/>
at the point of her entrance upon her career of <lb/>
authorship, we will now take up its thread, and <lb/>
briefly trace the events of her career from 1853 to <lb/>
the termination of her life.</p>
<p>During the five years next succeeding 1853 she <lb/>
appears to have been an almost constant pupil in <lb/>
"the school of suffering." Insomnia, mental <reg orig="de-|pression">depression</reg>, <lb/>
and frequent illnesses tried her faith <reg orig="exceed-|ingly">exceedingly</reg>. <lb/>
In her most serious sickness she was thought <lb/>
to be dying. She herself supposed that her hour <lb/>
had come, and she joyfully set her heart on <reg orig="enter-|ing">entering</reg> <lb/>
heaven. She appeared at one time to be <reg orig="uncon-|scious">unconscious</reg>, <lb/>
though she was herself still aware of what <lb/>
was going on around her. Her physician had left <lb/>
a medicine to be given her in case of the extremity <lb/>
she had now reached. She had refused to take it <lb/>
several times, until her husband besought her <lb/>
to do so, expressing a hope that it might save <lb/>
her life.</p>
<p>Thinking that she was at the very gate of bliss, <lb/>
she asked herself, "Will it be wrong for me to <lb/>
refuse to take this medicine?" Her conscience told <lb/>
her it would; and then, strong as was her longing <lb/>
to enter heaven, she finally took the medicine and <lb/>
lived. It was a great disappointment to her to be <lb/>
thus called back from heaven's door to the duties <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0086"/>
of life; not that she did not love life, but that she <lb/>
loved heaven more.</p>
<p>In 1858 the failure of the health of her husband <lb/>
compelled him to resign his pastorate, and to spend <lb/>
more than two years in Europe, mostly in <reg orig="Switzer-|land">Switzerland</reg>. <lb/>
As rest was what Mr. Prentiss most needed, <lb/>
they traveled very little, but found their enjoyment in <lb/>
reading, in communing with nature amid the majesty <lb/>
of Alpine scenery, and in quiet fireside fellowship. <lb/>
While in Switzerland, she gave birth to her sixth <lb/>
child. Her enjoyment of these two happy years <lb/>
was sadly broken toward the latter months of her <lb/>
stay by the prostration of her children, first with <lb/>
whooping-cough and then with scarlet fever. Her <lb/>
husband had been invited to preach for a time in <lb/>
the American Chapel at Paris. He had scarcely <lb/>
left her when the fever smote one of the children. <lb/>
The doctor, after seeing the child, informed her that, <lb/>
even though her children might escape death, yet <lb/>
she must make up her mind that it would be at <lb/>
least forty days before she could expect to leave her <lb/>
present abode. This was indeed a gloomy prospect. <lb/>
Yet, with heroic and characteristic courage, she <lb/>
resolved to face it bravely, by herself, and therefore <lb/>
wrote her husband urging him not to give up his <lb/>
engagement in Paris. Then, with true maternal <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0087"/>
fortitude, sustained by Christian faith, she gave <lb/>
herself to the task of nursing her fever-stricken <lb/>
children, aided only by the friendly strangers around <lb/>
her. After much weary watching and painful <reg orig="solic-|itude">solicitude</reg> <lb/>
she had the satisfaction of seeing her children <lb/>
again in good health. In February, 1860, she <lb/>
joined her husband in Paris. The health of Dr. <lb/>
Prentiss being greatly improved, they spent a few <lb/>
months in England, and in September of the same <lb/>
year had the pleasure of greeting old friends at home, <lb/>
and, with their four children, breathing once more <lb/>
the air of their native land.</p>
<p>But neither the joys of friendship nor the air of <lb/>
home could save her from the suffering to which <lb/>
her delicate constitution seemed destined. Through <lb/>
much of the five years succeeding her return from <lb/>
Europe, she was in the furnace of chronic affliction. <lb/>
Insomnia, neuralgia, and other ailments, "<reg orig="aggra-|vated">aggravated</reg> <lb/>
by the frequent illness of her younger <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg>," <lb/>
by the events of the War of the Rebellion, <lb/>
by the death of her beloved sister Louisa and other <lb/>
family bereavements, and by her deep sympathy <lb/>
with her husband in his arduous labors while <reg orig="build-|ing">building</reg> <lb/>
a stately church edifice for the new up-town <lb/>
Church which had been organized for him out of <lb/>
his old Mercer Street Church, reduced her to a <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0088"/>
state of "almost continuous ill-health." She endured <lb/>
all this in the spirit of sublime submission so <reg orig="char-|acteristically">characteristically</reg> <lb/>
expressed in the following extract from <lb/>
one of her letters:</p>
<p>"It is a part of God's discipline with me to <lb/>
keep me shut up a good deal more than the old <lb/>
Adam in me fancies; but his way is <hi rend="italic">absolutely <reg orig="per-|fect">perfect</reg>,</hi> <lb/>
and I hope I would n't change it in any <lb/>
particular."</p>
<p>In 1870 she was "on the mount;" her physical <lb/>
sufferings were much less, her activity in Christian <lb/>
work greater, and her soul finding almost constant <lb/>
delight in God. The writings of Madame Guyon <lb/>
and F&eacute;n&eacute;lon, the latter especially, contributed much <lb/>
to her elevation of mind. The following year she <lb/>
was once more in the vale of depression, from strong <lb/>
temptation, arising largely out of her reading on <lb/>
the question of personal holiness and its instant <lb/>
attainment by an act of faith. To be holy was her <lb/>
abiding passionate desire. She regarded holiness <lb/>
as a growth, having its roots in an indwelling <lb/>
Christ, secured by habitual faith. But her <hi rend="italic">standard</hi> <lb/>
was high. When told that she was looking, "not <lb/>
for Christian, but angelic perfection," she replied: <lb/>
"I see no difference in kind. Perfection is <reg orig="perfec-|tion">perfection</reg>, <lb/>
to my mind, and I have always thought it a <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0089"/>
dangerous thing for a soul to fancy it had attained <lb/>
it. &hellip; If the higher life means utter <reg orig="sinless-|ness">sinlessness</reg>, <lb/>
then I shall have to own that I have never <lb/>
had any experience of it."</p>
<p>Evidently she was looking, not for that Christian <lb/>
perfection or perfect love for Christ which is <reg orig="attain-|able">attainable</reg>, <lb/>
and to which, judging by her letters, she had <lb/>
already attained, but for that absolutely sinless <reg orig="per-|fection">perfection</reg> <lb/>
which is unattainable by fallen, frail, erring <lb/>
human beings. Constant, close, unsparing <reg orig="self-|inspection">self-inspection</reg>, <lb/>
in presence of that standard of holiness <lb/>
proper, not to fallen, but to unfallen man, or to <lb/>
unsinning angels, caused her quick, sharp-eyed <reg orig="con-|science">conscience</reg> <lb/>
to whip her exquisite sensibilities as with a <lb/>
whip of scorpions. It made her "morbid, stupid," <lb/>
sometimes "wild," melancholy, and even physically <lb/>
sick. Had she but understood that "love is the <lb/>
fulfilling of the law," and that under the Gospel <lb/>
dispensation a disciple whose faith fills his heart <lb/>
with a love for Christ which is dominant, all-<reg orig="absorb-|ing">absorbing</reg>, <lb/>
and productive of ethical obedience, is held to <lb/>
be guiltless of sin, Mrs. Prentiss would have <lb/>
escaped such harassing conflicts as she passed <lb/>
through at this time. The self-questioning which <lb/>
her failure to make this discrimination occasioned, <lb/>
though measurably overcome, had such a depressing <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0090"/>
effect on her faith that, says her biographer, "she <lb/>
was, perhaps, never again conscious of that constant <lb/>
spiritual delight which she had once enjoyed. But, <lb/>
if less full of sunshine, her religious life was all <lb/>
the time growing deeper and more fruitful, was <reg orig="cen-|tering">centering</reg> <lb/>
itself more entirely in Christ, and rising faster <lb/>
heaven ward. &hellip; Her whole being, indeed, <lb/>
seemed to gather new light and sweetness from the <lb/>
sharp discipline she had been passing through." <lb/>
She undesignedly reveals the secret of this <reg orig="sweet-|ness">sweetness</reg> <lb/>
when she writes to a friend, "I think God has <lb/>
provided a way to perfection, and that is 'looking <lb/>
unto Jesus.'" Thus, despite her theories, she was <lb/>
actually gaining holiness through faith.</p>
<p>The above testimony from her husband's pen is <lb/>
amply sustained by her correspondence, as given in <lb/>
her biography, from 1873 to her departure in 1878. <lb/>
Whether in New York, where her husband in 1873, <lb/>
having resigned his parish, had become a professor <lb/>
in the Union Theological Seminary, or in Dorset, <lb/>
Vermont, where she spent the Summer months of <lb/>
the last ten years of her life, she was constantly <lb/>
doing "what she could" for the Lord she loved so <lb/>
deeply and so truly.</p>
<p>In 1874 she was asked to conduct a Bible <reg orig="read-|ing">reading</reg> <lb/>
in Dorset. The profit she had derived the <lb/>
<pb n="85" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0091"/>
previous Spring from such a reading, conducted by <lb/>
Miss Susan Warner, in New York, moved her to <lb/>
consent to conduct one in Dorset. Writing of its <lb/>
success, she said: "The interest in it did not flag <lb/>
all Summer, and ladies, young and old, came from <lb/>
all directions, not only to the readings, but with <lb/>
tears, to open their hearts to me. Some hitherto <lb/>
worldly ones were among the number."</p>
<p>Encouraged by this success in Dorset, she began <lb/>
Bible readings in New York the ensuing Autumn. <lb/>
Her fascinating manners, her cheerful spirit, her <lb/>
apt illustrations, her wide religious reading, her <lb/>
rich and varied experience, and, above all, the <reg orig="spir-|ituality">spirituality</reg> <lb/>
of her mind, eminently qualified her for <lb/>
this mode of Christian work. She continued it <lb/>
both during her Summer residence in Dorset, and <lb/>
in the Winter at New York, until her last sickness. <lb/>
Describing her last Bible reading service, her <reg orig="biog-|rapher">biographer</reg> <lb/>
says: "There was something very impressive <lb/>
in Mrs. Prentiss's Bible readings. She seemed not <lb/>
unlike her gifted father in the power she possessed <lb/>
of captivating those who heard her. Her manner <lb/>
was perfectly natural, quiet, and even shy; it <reg orig="evi-|dently">evidently</reg> <lb/>
cost her considerable effort to speak in the <lb/>
presence of so many listeners. She rarely looked <lb/>
round, or even looked up, but a sort of magnetic <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0092"/>
influence attracted every eye to <hi rend="italic">her,</hi> and held all <lb/>
our hearts in breathless attention. Her style was <lb/>
entirely conversational. Her sentences were short, <lb/>
clear as crystal, full of happy turns, and always fresh <lb/>
and to the point. The tones of her voice were <lb/>
peculiar; I scarcely know how to describe them, <lb/>
they had such a fine, <hi rend="italic">subtle,</hi> womanly quality; were <lb/>
touched&mdash;especially at her last reading&mdash;with such <lb/>
tenderness and depth of feeling. I only know that <lb/>
as we heard them it was almost as if we were <reg orig="list-|ening">listening</reg> <lb/>
to the voice of an angel."</p>
<p>From this last reading, on the 8th of August, <lb/>
1878, she went home to die. Even while speaking <lb/>
to her spell-bound listeners, the shadow of death <lb/>
was upon her. Six days later, after suffering with <lb/>
uncomplaining patience, and unfaltering triumphing <lb/>
trust, the agony of a fierce, pitiless disease, "she <lb/>
drew one long breath, and all was over."</p>
<p>The sublime victory of her faith can only be <reg orig="un-|derstood">understood</reg> <lb/>
by considering, not only what it achieved, <lb/>
but also what it overcame in herself. Next to <lb/>
one's natural selfishness, there is, perhaps, no greater <lb/>
hindrance to a life of faith than an inherited <reg orig="ten-|dency">tendency</reg> <lb/>
to morbid feeling, especially when, as in this <lb/>
noble woman's case, it is associated with extreme <lb/>
moral sensibility. Their joint effect is to surround <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0093"/>
the mind with gloomy clouds without, and to torture <lb/>
it within with the sting of guilt, which it imagines <lb/>
so great as to be unpardonable. Besides this <reg orig="ten-|dency">tendency</reg>, <lb/>
and this exquisite moral sensitiveness, Mrs. <lb/>
Prentiss had a delicate physical constitution, which <lb/>
subjected her to constantly recurring attacks of very <lb/>
painful sickness. She was, moreover, owing to her <lb/>
highly wrought nervous organization, governed by <lb/>
an irresistible impulse to an activity both of mind <lb/>
and body, which levied heavy taxes on her vitality. <lb/>
These were, indeed, formidable obstacles to a life <lb/>
of faith&mdash;so formidable that one can not view their <lb/>
conqueror without affectionate admiration. Coarser <lb/>
natures than hers may have to contend against <lb/>
tyrannical proclivities to vices of which her refined <lb/>
spirit never dreamed. But it is not exaggeration <lb/>
to say that it, probably, never, in any human life, <lb/>
required more strenuous resolution, and greater <lb/>
strength of will to live as she did, a sublimely <lb/>
beautiful life, to do a vast amount of varied <reg orig="Chris-|tian">Christian</reg> <lb/>
work, and to soar, if not to the loftiest plane <lb/>
of spiritual thought and feeling, yet to an elevation <lb/>
far above that reached by the average Christian. <lb/>
Assuredly no candid mind can read the "Life and <lb/>
Letters of Elizabeth Prentiss" without exclaiming, <lb/>
"O woman, great was thy faith!"</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Who</hi> was <hi rend="small-caps">Sister Dora?</hi></p>
<p>Sister Dora was the daughter of the Rev. <lb/>
Mark Pattison, rector of Hauxwell, Yorkshire, <lb/>
England. Her name was <hi rend="small-caps">Dorothy <reg orig="Wynd-|Low">Wynd-Low</reg> <lb/>
Pattison</hi>; but when she joined a Protestant <lb/>
sisterhood, who called themselves "Good <reg orig="Samari-|tans">Samaritans</reg>," <lb/>
because they devoted their lives to various <lb/>
works of mercy, she became known as Sister Dora. <lb/>
I will introduce Miss Pattison to the reader as she <lb/>
appeared in the year 1852, at which date she was <lb/>
twenty years of age.</p>
<p>As described by her biographer,<ref target="n2" n="1">*</ref>
<note id="n2" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>"Sister Dora: a Biography," by Margaret Lonsdale.</p></note>
 she was then <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0095"/>
a young lady of remarkable personal beauty. Her <lb/>
splendid figure was tall, slender, and uncommonly <lb/>
graceful. Her features were nearly perfect in their <lb/>
regularity. Her unusually high and wide forehead <lb/>
indicated the possession of superior mental <reg orig="quail-|ties">quailties</reg>. <lb/>
Her mouth was small when its full, red lips <lb/>
were closed, but quite wide when she spoke or <lb/>
laughed, and in its corners there lay a half-concealed <lb/>
expression of fun. Her brilliant dark-brown eyes <lb/>
twinkled in "merry sympathy" with her lips. Her <lb/>
head was covered with "dark, tightly curling, brown <lb/>
hair." To these attractions she added a delicate <lb/>
and beautiful complexion, and she was, says Miss <lb/>
Lonsdale, "a fascinating creature to look upon." <lb/>
Her courteous manners and gentle speech <reg orig="harmon-|ized">harmonized</reg> <lb/>
with her beauty, and made her beloved by her <lb/>
friends and popular with all classes in the <reg orig="neighbor-|hood">neighborhood</reg> <lb/>
of her home. By many she was often <lb/>
described as "a real princess," because of her <reg orig="sweet-|ness">sweetness</reg> <lb/>
and dignity.</p>
<p>Such was Miss Dorothy Pattison at twenty. Her <lb/>
life up to this period had been spent in her father's <lb/>
rectory, under external conditions every way <reg orig="favor-|able">favorable</reg> <lb/>
to the right formation of her character. <reg orig="Haux-|well">Hauxwell</reg> <lb/>
itself was a small, "intensely quiet" village of <lb/>
only three hundred inhabitants, situated on the <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0096"/>
border of extensive moorlands. But the rectory <lb/>
was alive with the stir of twelve children, of whom <lb/>
Dorothy was the youngest but one. She was very <lb/>
delicate when a child, and because of this and of <lb/>
her sweet and even temper, she became "the pet <lb/>
and darling of her elder sisters." But though petted <lb/>
and kept from regular study because of her <reg orig="phys-|ical">physical</reg> <lb/>
debility, she was neither spoiled in disposition <lb/>
nor dwarfed in mind. She learned as by instinct, <lb/>
and through a habit of minute observation <reg orig="uncon-|sciously">unconsciously</reg> <lb/>
formed. What she learned she remembered. <lb/>
If not always a correct, she was yet a precocious <lb/>
reasoner. Her will was strong as iron, but her <lb/>
unselfishness and her desire to please kept her from <lb/>
being willful and obstinate. Instead of meeting <lb/>
opposition to her wishes with sulkiness and <reg orig="ill-|temper">ill-temper</reg>, <lb/>
she resorted to shrewd but good-natured <lb/>
devices to accomplish her purposes. These devices, <lb/>
though often, perhaps generally, successfull, were <lb/>
sometimes blameworthy, and brought her into <reg orig="con-|flict">conflict</reg> <lb/>
with the firm discipline of her judicious parents, <lb/>
to whose corrections she submitted, if not with <reg orig="abso-|lute">absolute</reg> <lb/>
cheerfulness, yet with filial respect.</p>
<p>When fourteen years old Dorothy suffered <lb/>
through several months from painful and dangerous <lb/>
illness. She bore the pain with singular fortitude; <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0097"/>
she endured the weariness of slow recovery <reg orig="cheer-|fully">cheerfully</reg>, <lb/>
by constantly looking on the bright side of <lb/>
her case. Thus her sick-chamber was made a school <lb/>
of discipline, in which the best traits of her <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg> <lb/>
were strengthened.</p>
<p>Dorothy's parents were much given to deeds of <lb/>
charity. They trained their children to habits of <lb/>
economy and self-denial, not for the purpose of <reg orig="sav-|ing">saving</reg> <lb/>
money, but that, by saving and self-denial, they <lb/>
might have more to give to the poor. Dorothy <lb/>
entered into their benevolent spirit quite readily, <lb/>
yet showed as yet no specially warm devotion to <lb/>
charitable work.</p>
<p>After recovering from her long illness, she took <lb/>
to riding much on horseback, and became a good, <lb/>
even a daring, horsewoman. She learned to follow <lb/>
the hounds with her brothers, and to ride across the <lb/>
wild moorlands with a dashing speed, which fairly <reg orig="fas-|cinated">fascinated</reg> <lb/>
the Yorkshire lads who witnessed her feats <lb/>
of courage and independence. Thus, by much <reg orig="rid-|ing">riding</reg>, <lb/>
and by running, jumping, and other active <reg orig="out-|door">outdoor</reg> <lb/>
games, she at length became a strong, healthy, <lb/>
energetic woman. She was gifted with a flow of <lb/>
animal spirits which seemed unbounded, and with a <lb/>
power of perceiving and enjoying the humorous <lb/>
side of things. These gifts made her the "bright <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0098"/>
bonnie maiden" of the rectory, constantly bubbling <lb/>
over with harmless fun. She was, withal, <reg orig="thought-|ful">thoughtful</reg>, <lb/>
given to meditation, to reflection, and to the <lb/>
silent gathering-up of such facts and principles as <lb/>
were the topics of conversation around the rectory <lb/>
fireside, where culture and religion presided in <lb/>
delightful harmony, making the atmosphere of her <lb/>
home peaceful and every way enjoyable&mdash;an absolute <lb/>
contrast to that other Yorkshire rectory in which <lb/>
the gifted Bront&eacute; sisters passed their lives.</p>
<p>The activity of Miss Dorothy's nature, and the <lb/>
monotony of life in a wild moorland region, begot <lb/>
a restlessness in her spirit which was extremely <lb/>
painful, and hard to be endured. This feeling was <lb/>
highly stimulated when reports of Florence <reg orig="Night-|ingale's">Nightingale's</reg> <lb/>
noble work in the Crimean hospitals reached <lb/>
her. "Let me go to her and be one of her nurses!" <lb/>
she said to her father. "No, my daughter," the <lb/>
good rector wisely replied, "you have had no <reg orig="train-|ing">training</reg> <lb/>
for such work. You would be worse than <reg orig="use-|less">useless</reg> <lb/>
to Miss Nightingale. Besides, there is work <lb/>
enough for you here, if you would only think so."</p>
<p>She submitted to her father's decision with filial <lb/>
respect; albeit her craving for a more active life <lb/>
grew inwardly stronger. This inward tempest she <lb/>
so far concealed, however, as still to be the sunshine <lb/>
<pb n="93" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0099"/>
of her home, and to share with one of her sisters <lb/>
the duty of tenderly nursing her now invalid mother. <lb/>
It was a pleasing relief to her to visit her elder <lb/>
brother during his vacations, because from her <reg orig="con-|versations">conversations</reg> <lb/>
with him she reaped much intellectual <lb/>
quickening. During one of those visits she had a <lb/>
singular dream, in which she saw her mother <reg orig="draw-|ing">drawing</reg> <lb/>
aside the curtains of her bed, and heard her <lb/>
calling, "Dora, Dora, Dora!" This dream was <lb/>
repeated the following night. The next day a letter <lb/>
informed her of her mother's dangerous sickness. <lb/>
She hastened home and found her mother sick <lb/>
unto death!</p>
<p>It is perhaps impossible to explain the <reg orig="philos-|ophy">philosophy</reg> <lb/>
of this remarkable dream. But the effect of <lb/>
her mother's death on Dora's life is easily <reg orig="compre-|hended">comprehended</reg>. <lb/>
Her mother's departure left her with <lb/>
slight domestic occupation, and thereby gave her <lb/>
restlessness such full play that her home-life, loving, <lb/>
elevating, and peaceful though it was, became <reg orig="abso-|lutely">absolutely</reg> <lb/>
distasteful to her. She had heard of the <lb/>
Sisterhood of Good Samaritans, and now asked her <lb/>
father's permission to join them. He strongly <lb/>
objected, though he did not absolutely forbid her <lb/>
doing so, since he very properly recognized her <reg orig="lib-|erty">liberty</reg> <lb/>
to decide freely for herself, seeing that she was <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0100"/>
now nearly thirty years of age. She so far respected <lb/>
his wishes as not to join the Sisters at that time, but <lb/>
she did display her self-will to the extent of leaving <lb/>
the home of her childhood and becoming a <reg orig="school-|mistress">schoolmistress</reg> <lb/>
in the village of Woolston. In this she <lb/>
did "very wrong," as she confessed years after on <lb/>
her death-bed; because instead of biding the <reg orig="open-|ing">opening</reg> <lb/>
of a providential path, she made a road for <lb/>
herself out of her proper place into a position which <lb/>
was much below her capabilities, her habits, and <lb/>
early associations. Instead of waiting for Providence <lb/>
to open a door for her entrance to the world <lb/>
beyond her home, she forced an opening with her <lb/>
own hands.</p>
<p>She spent three years in the Woolston School, <lb/>
giving herself wholly to her chosen work. These <lb/>
years, though marked by privations, humiliations, <lb/>
and hardships, were far from being wasted. Her <lb/>
pupils loved her, and profited by her skillful <reg orig="teach-|ing">teaching</reg>; <lb/>
the people of the place also recognized her as a <lb/>
lady&mdash;" a real princess," the working classes called <lb/>
her. One wealthy old gentleman and his wife were <lb/>
so charmed with her, that they begged her to give <lb/>
up her school and live with them. As they had no <lb/>
children, the old gentleman offered to make her his <lb/>
heir. This offer Dora declined. It was not ease, <lb/>
<pb n="95" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0101"/>
but active work, that she craved. And this craving <lb/>
grew so morbid that to her teaching by day she <lb/>
added nursing the sick by night. She was <reg orig="con-|stantly">constantly</reg> <lb/>
haunted by an impression that she was not <lb/>
doing enough. Driven by this unnatural spur, she <lb/>
so overtaxed her vigorous physical powers, that <lb/>
she was at length stricken with pleurisy, and taken <lb/>
to the Home of the Good Samaritans at Redcar, <lb/>
to be nursed. There she recovered her health, but <lb/>
did not rid herself of her morbid feelings, which <lb/>
were rather intensified than diminished by intercourse <lb/>
with the Sisterhood. Hence, in the Autumn of <lb/>
1864, very much to the regret of all her family, <lb/>
she became a member of the order of Good <reg orig="Sa-|maritans">Samaritans</reg>.</p>
<p>This Sisterhood, unlike those of the Papal <lb/>
Church, and of some of the High Church of <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg> <lb/>
orders, took no vows, excepting a pledge of <lb/>
obedience to the clergyman whom they recognized <lb/>
as their pastor, and to the Sister whom he might <lb/>
appoint from their number to fill the office of <lb/>
"Sister in charge," or "Mother Superior." Their <lb/>
work was not contemplative, but secular and active, <lb/>
consisting chiefly in nursing the sick, both in <reg orig="hos-|pitals">hospitals</reg> <lb/>
and in private dwellings. As to the Sisters <lb/>
composing it, they appear to have been mostly <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0102"/>
uncultivated women, without much special intellectual <lb/>
training, and in every way inferior to Miss Pattison, <lb/>
who, as we have seen, was a lady by birth, habit, <lb/>
associations, and manners. In every thing but the <lb/>
charitable nature of the work to be done, her <lb/>
entrance among them was a descent from her proper <lb/>
social position. Even her motive, at that <reg orig="partic-|ular">particular</reg> <lb/>
period of her life, did not much ennoble her <lb/>
act; for just then she was simply seeking to stifle <lb/>
the doubts she had latterly entertained concerning <lb/>
the truth of historical Christianity, by the mental <lb/>
preoccupation involved in toiling to excess in the <lb/>
sick-rooms of the poor. We shall see, by and by, <lb/>
how this motive was subsequently replaced by one <lb/>
which lifted her life up to the highest plane of <lb/>
moral grandeur and Christian nobleness.</p>
<p>These well-meaning but somewhat misjudging <lb/>
Sisters subjected Dorn to very severe discipline. <lb/>
She was a neophyte, and they thought she must <lb/>
be taught implicit obedience to their authority. <lb/>
Hence they gave her such servile and, to her, <reg orig="dis-|tasteful">distasteful</reg> <lb/>
tasks as making beds, sweeping and <reg orig="scrub-|bing">scrubbing</reg> <lb/>
floors, scouring grates, and cooking in the <lb/>
kitchen of their "Home."</p>
<p>Not very pleasant tasks, truly, for a highly <lb/>
bred lady, nor such as she had expected; yet, when <lb/>
<pb n="97" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0103"/>
speaking of this training in after years, she said, <lb/>
"It <hi rend="italic">was</hi> good for me." Assuredly it must have <lb/>
tended to humble her pride, and subdue her <lb/>
strongly-developed self-will.</p>
<p>This initiatory training was succeeded by her <lb/>
introduction to hospital work, which was better <lb/>
suited to her taste and purposes. The year after <lb/>
she joined the Sisters, she was sent to a hospital <lb/>
containing fourteen beds, in the populous town of <lb/>
Walsall. Scarcely had she begun her appointed <lb/>
task there, before she caught the small-pox from <lb/>
an out-patient. She was very sick, and very poorly <lb/>
cared for by her "Sister" nurses. Nevertheless, <lb/>
she recovered, and resumed her duties.</p>
<p>Walsall was a coal and iron town. Its people <lb/>
mostly wrought in the mines and at the furnaces. <lb/>
Ignorance and vice largely prevailed among them. <lb/>
In Mr. Wesley's day they were given to riot and <lb/>
cruelty, and seem to have retained their disposition <lb/>
to violence to modern times. By some means an <lb/>
impression was made that the. "Good Samaritans" <lb/>
were papists, and they proposed to treat them as <lb/>
they had treated the Methodists a century before. <lb/>
A mob stoned their hospital; and one evening <reg orig="Sis-|ter">Sister</reg> <lb/>
Dora, returning from a visit to an out-patient, <lb/>
was struck in the forehead by a stone from the <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0104"/>
hand of a lad, who shouted, "There goes one of <lb/>
the sisters of misery!"</p>
<p>Not long after, this violent lad was severely <lb/>
injured in a coal-pit. On being taken to the <reg orig="hos-|pital">hospital</reg>, <lb/>
he was at once recognized by Dora, and she <lb/>
nursed him with special care. One day during his <lb/>
convalescence, he sobbed, and said:</p>
<p>"Sister, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> threw that stone at you."</p>
<p>"O," she replied, "did you think I did not know <lb/>
that? Why, I knew you the very first minute you <lb/>
came in at the door."</p>
<p>"What!" he rejoined, "you knew me, and yet <lb/>
have been nursing me like this?"</p>
<p>This was the first practical experience of good <lb/>
returned for evil that young man had ever received, <lb/>
and it filled him with wonder, and with admiration <lb/>
of Sister Dora.</p>
<p>The superiority of Sister Dora to the other <lb/>
members of the Sisterhood was soon obvious to all <lb/>
who had the opportunity of seeing them. When <lb/>
Sir James Simpson, of Edinburgh, visited their <lb/>
Home in search of a suitable nurse, to take care <lb/>
of a partially insane old lady, after seeing all the <lb/>
others, he was introduced to Dora. She was busy, <lb/>
with her sleeves tucked up, making a pudding. But <lb/>
his experienced eye, despite her employment, saw <lb/>
<pb n="99" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0105"/>
in her a character that was lacking in all her <reg orig="com-|panions">companions</reg>, <lb/>
and he promptly said: "Send me that <lb/>
sister. She is the one for my case."</p>
<p>The event proved that Sir James was not <reg orig="mis-|taken">mistaken</reg>. <lb/>
Dora managed the half-mad old lady with <lb/>
a degree of skill and tact that soothed her violent <lb/>
moods, and she actually won her affections. In <lb/>
speaking of this service subsequently, Sister Dora <lb/>
said: "I had an uncommonly unpleasant time with <lb/>
that mad old lady."</p>
<p>The cold-hearted tyranny of the probably jealous <lb/>
Sisterhood was shown when Sister Dora, in <reg orig="obedi-|ence">obedience</reg> <lb/>
to their order, was preparing to go to <reg orig="Devon-|shire">Devonshire</reg>, <lb/>
to nurse a private patient. Just then a letter <lb/>
informed her that her father was dangerously sick, <lb/>
and desired to see her. She begged permission to <lb/>
visit him. But her stern Superior replied, "No; <lb/>
you must go at once to Devonshire!"</p>
<p>With an aching heart Sister Dora unwisely <reg orig="sac-|rificed">sacrificed</reg> <lb/>
her filial obligations on the altar of obedience <lb/>
to the Sisterhood. She had scarcely reached her <lb/>
patient's home before she was informed that her <lb/>
father was dead. Then the Sisterhood, ashamed, <lb/>
probably, of their tyranny, or else afraid of public <lb/>
censure, wrote her: "You may attend your father's <lb/>
funeral, if you please."</p>
<pb n="100" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0106"/>
<p>With pardonable bitterness, Dora replied: <lb/>
"When my father was alive, you would not permit <lb/>
me to go to him. Now he is dead, I no longer <lb/>
care to go."</p>
<p>Sister Dora ought not to have yielded to the <lb/>
cold-hearted tyranny of those so-called Good <reg orig="Sa-|maritans">Samaritans</reg>, <lb/>
whose zeal for their order had evidently <lb/>
chilled their finer affections. But in this they only <lb/>
illustrated the tendency of all those organizations, <lb/>
whether male or female, Catholic or Protestant, <lb/>
which require implicit submission to official <reg orig="author-|ity">authority</reg>. <lb/>
No human being has a right to make such a <lb/>
surrender of personal freedom to the will of others. <lb/>
The effect of this tyranny on Sister Dora was to <lb/>
weaken her respect for the Sisterhood; and but for <lb/>
the fixedness of her desire to lighten the burdens <lb/>
of the afflicted, she would probably have quitted <lb/>
them at once. Nevertheless, seeing that through <lb/>
them she could best find opportunities to gratify <lb/>
her desire, she, though sore at heart, retained her <lb/>
connection with them a little longer.</p>
<p>She was sorely tempted, too, about this time, to <lb/>
quit the sisters, by an eligible offer of marriage. <lb/>
Her affection for her suitor, though sufficiently deep <lb/>
to produce a severe conflict in her mind with her <lb/>
cherished purpose to devote her life to works of <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0107"/>
mercy, was yet not strong enough to overcome it. <lb/>
Marriage and maternity had unusually strong <reg orig="attrac-|tions">attractions</reg> <lb/>
for her affectionate nature, and when reviewing <lb/>
her life, near its close, she said, "If I had to begin <lb/>
life over again I would marry." But the candidate <lb/>
for her hand failed to awaken in her a love strong <lb/>
enough to overcome the passion for a life devoted <lb/>
to active usefulness among the suffering. Had he <lb/>
sought her earlier, while her nursing was as yet only <lb/>
a means of calming somewhat the restlessness of her <lb/>
mind caused by her nascent skepticism, it is likely <lb/>
that she would have become his wife. But by this <lb/>
time her doubts had found their solution in a <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg> <lb/>
love for Christ. Hence, her motive in nursing <lb/>
was no longer simply a desire to escape unrest, but <lb/>
a noble purpose to serve suffering humanity for the <lb/>
sake of Him who died for her and for the whole <lb/>
world. And but for the counsels of judicious friends, <lb/>
she would most likely at this time have joined one <lb/>
of those High Church Sisterhoods which are bound <lb/>
by vows to lead a single life. As it was, her conflict <lb/>
ended in the rejection of this suitor and her <reg orig="contin-|uance">continuance</reg>, <lb/>
with renewed zeal, in the work she had <lb/>
chosen, especially in her hospital work at Walsall.</p>
<p>The Walsall mines and iron works, in which <lb/>
accidents to their workers were common occurrences, <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0108"/>
created a constant demand for surgical skill in the <lb/>
hospital. Sister Dora perceived this at once, and <lb/>
gave the full power of her penetrative mind to such <lb/>
close observation of the surgical work done by its <lb/>
medical attendants as to acquire a quick and "keen <lb/>
discernment of the character of wounds and of the <lb/>
exact position of fractures." Her courage, <reg orig="self-|possession">self-possession</reg>, <lb/>
and tactual skill soon so won the confidence <lb/>
and admiration of the old doctor of the hospital <lb/>
that he gladly gave her all the instruction in his <lb/>
power. The result was that she became a skillful <lb/>
surgeon as well as a nurse, whose tenderness, patience, <lb/>
activity, endurance, and power to inspire the <reg orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg> <lb/>
with hopeful courage, could not be excelled. <lb/>
For a time she did her work so unobtrusively as <lb/>
not to attract much attention outside of the hospital <lb/>
and of the homes of the out-door patients. But <lb/>
having contracted a serious sickness in 1866 by her <lb/>
utter and unpardonable disregard of her own health, <lb/>
the general public began to hear of her good deeds <lb/>
through the reports of those to whom she had <reg orig="ren-|dered">rendered</reg> <lb/>
valuable services. Then many asked, "Who <lb/>
is this Sister Dora of whom we hear so much?" <lb/>
The replies they got led not a few to seek her <lb/>
acquaintance.</p>
<p>Among these was a clergyman of the National <lb/>
<pb n="103" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0109"/>
Church, named Richard Twigg, a truly evangelical <lb/>
man, whose instructions and friendship proved <reg orig="un-|speakably">unspeakably</reg> <lb/>
valuable to her. Indeed, she ascribed her <lb/>
recovery mainly to the prayers of this devout <reg orig="min-|ister">minister</reg>, <lb/>
and of his large congregation, whom he had <lb/>
interested in her behalf.</p>
<p>The demands of the growing population of <reg orig="Wal-|sall">Walsall</reg> <lb/>
on the hospital led to the erection of a larger <lb/>
structure in a more healthful situation, over which <lb/>
Sister Dora was duly installed in 1868. Just then <lb/>
the small-pox became epidemic in the town. <reg orig="Noth-|ing">Nothing</reg> <lb/>
daunted by the disgusting and infectious <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg> <lb/>
of this loathsome disease, she labored day and <lb/>
night, in and out of the hospital, for several months. <lb/>
Her excessive labors, her neglect of her own needs <lb/>
of sleep and food, were truly marvelous during the <lb/>
prevalence of this epidemic, and excited general <lb/>
admiration.</p>
<p>One night she was sent for by a poor man who <lb/>
was dying of the worst type of this disease. She <lb/>
found him forsaken by all his relations. Only a <lb/>
neighbor was left to watch him. Finding only a <lb/>
small piece of candle in the house, she gave this <lb/>
woman money to procure more candles, promising <lb/>
to stay with the sufferer until her return. But the <lb/>
woman spent the money for drink, and did not <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0110"/>
reappear with the needed candles. Sister Dora <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
by the poor creature's bedside. Presently <lb/>
he raised himself up in his bed as far as his <reg orig="depart-|ing">departing</reg> <lb/>
strength permitted and said: "Sister, kiss me <lb/>
before I die!" It was a loathsome task, but Dora, <lb/>
thinking more of the poor man's feelings than of <lb/>
herself, put her arms around him and kissed him! <lb/>
The next moment the candle went out. "Do n't <lb/>
leave me, Sister, while I live," groaned the dying <lb/>
man. It was then past midnight, but she remained <lb/>
beside him until he died. Even then she kept <lb/>
dreary watch in the darkness, fearing that, though <lb/>
silent and cold, the poor creature might still be <lb/>
alive. When the day dawned she groped her way <lb/>
to the door and called in the neighbors. Surely <lb/>
she was a ministering angel to that deserted man!</p>
<p>The tenderness of Dora's nature moved her to <lb/>
closely study "what is called conservative surgery." <lb/>
The doctors of the hospital, when they saw a bruised <lb/>
and mangled limb, were but too apt to decide, without <lb/>
much hesitation, on its amputation. Dora, knowing <lb/>
that the loss of limb by a miner or iron-founder <lb/>
meant future poverty both for the man and his <reg orig="fam-|ily">family</reg>, <lb/>
always urged the surgeons to save the limb if <lb/>
at all possible. Here is a typical case of her action <lb/>
in this direction: A fine, healthy young man was <lb/>
<pb n="105" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0111"/>
brought to the hospital one night with an arm <lb/>
badly crushed by a machine. The doctor said, <lb/>
peremptorily:</p>
<p>"Nothing can save that arm! It must be cut <lb/>
off at once."</p>
<p>The man groaned deeply. Sister Dora's <reg orig="sympa-|thies">sympathies</reg> <lb/>
were moved. She scanned the mangled limb <lb/>
with a critical eye, and thought it could be saved. <lb/>
The young man, as if reading her thoughts, cried <lb/>
piteously:</p>
<p>"O, Sister! save my arm for me; it's my <lb/>
right arm.</p>
<p>Turning to the surgeon, Dora said, "I believe <lb/>
I can save this arm if you will let me try."</p>
<p>"Are you mad?" retorted the doctor, angrily. <lb/>
"I tell you it's an impossibility. Mortification will <lb/>
soon set in. Nothing but amputation can save <lb/>
his life."</p>
<p>Dora, turning to the sufferer, asked: "Are you <lb/>
willing I should try to save your arm, my man?"</p>
<p>The man joyfully consented to accept the risk. <lb/>
The doctor was now in as much passion as he could <lb/>
be with this wonderful woman, whom he greatly <lb/>
admired, and walked away, saying: "Well, mind, <lb/>
it's your arm! If you choose to have the young <lb/>
man's death on your conscience, I shall not interfere. <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0112"/>
I wash my hands of him. Do n't think I am going <lb/>
to help you."</p>
<p>Dora had often disagreed with the doctor, and <lb/>
results had usually justified her opinion. In this <lb/>
case she used her utmost skill during the ensuing <lb/>
three weeks. Then she said to the doctor, "Come <lb/>
and see my work!"</p>
<p>Scarcely willing to be proved wrong by a woman <lb/>
who was under his personal direction, he somewhat <lb/>
sullenly complied. Dora removed the bandages, <lb/>
and showed him the arm, no longer mangled, but <lb/>
straight and healthy. Astonished at this <reg orig="unex-|pected">unexpected</reg> <lb/>
sight, he exclaimed: "Why, you have saved <lb/>
it! It will be useful to him for many a long year." <lb/>

Then calling in the rest of his medical staff, he <lb/>
proudly bade them look at the work of his pupil, <lb/>
and learn from it "what might be done."</p>
<p>Dora was gratified. She loved approbation, <lb/>
especially when she knew it to be deserved. More <lb/>
precious, however, to her was the young man's <lb/>
gratitude, and the influence this and other feats of <lb/>
nursing skill gave her, not only with her medical <lb/>
superior, but also with the trustees of the hospital. <lb/>
By their permission, she now undertook to take <lb/>
lady pupils, to train in the hospital as surgical <lb/>
nurses. This work did not, probably, add as much <lb/>
<pb n="107" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0113"/>
to her burdens as to her responsibilities, because <lb/>
the lady pupils, while under her instruction, by <lb/>
acting as nurses and assistants, relieved her of other <lb/>
portions of her too heavy duties.</p>
<p>Sister Dora had large intellectual capacities <lb/>
which, despite her constant preoccupation, craved <lb/>
sympathy with some kindred spirit. Her patients <lb/>
mostly belonged to the uncultivated classes; her <lb/>
lady pupils were not sufficiently long with her&mdash; <lb/>
were not, perhaps, of an intellectual standard high <lb/>
enough to satisfy her craving; her pastor, though <lb/>
very helpful to the religious side of her life, could <lb/>
not, with the many claims upon his time, minister <lb/>
to her mental wants; and she was too fully <reg orig="occu-|pied">occupied</reg> <lb/>
to find what she needed in the best social <lb/>
circles of Walsall. This sense of intellectual <reg orig="iso-|lation">isolation</reg> <lb/>
prepared her to fall into a snare, which came <lb/>
very near working a complete, perhaps an unhappy, <lb/>
change in her career. This snare was no other <lb/>
than a new suitor for her hand. A gentleman <reg orig="in-|tellectually">intellectually</reg> <lb/>
her superior, fitted in all but one feature <lb/>
of his character to meet the demands of both her <lb/>
mind and heart, became strongly attached to her, <lb/>
and offered to make her his wife. Dora <reg orig="recipro-|cated">reciprocated</reg> <lb/>
his affection with all the ardor of her <reg orig="sympa-|thetic">sympathetic</reg> <lb/>
nature. Her love became a passion. She <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0114"/>
engaged herself to him, and was on the point of <lb/>
exchanging her chosen vocation for the more <reg orig="at-|tractive">attractive</reg> <lb/>
duties of married life.</p>
<p>This was very natural, and not in itself <reg orig="im-|proper">improper</reg>. <lb/>
Nay, it was in many ways desirable. But <lb/>
the friend whose counsels had kept her from giving <lb/>
her hand to a previous suitor, ventured to protest <lb/>
against her present passion. "Your affianced," he <lb/>
pleaded, "is a <hi rend="italic">pronounced skeptic.</hi> You are bound <lb/>
to your God by the ties of faith and love. Can <lb/>
you retain your faith if you become the wife of an <lb/>
infidel? If you can, will not your differences on <lb/>
this most momentous of all subjects, breed discord <lb/>
between you?</p>
<p>Dora pondered these weighty questions until, <lb/>
convinced that her love to Christ was infinitely <lb/>
more important, both to her personal happiness <lb/>
and to her influence over others, than her <reg orig="pas-|sionate">passionate</reg> <lb/>
love for this cultivated infidel, she <reg orig="with-|drew">withdrew</reg> <lb/>
from her engagement. This was a great, a <lb/>
really noble sacrifice. It cost her a mental <reg orig="strug-|gle">struggle</reg> <lb/>
so intensely agonizing that it made her the <lb/>
prey of a fit of sickness which lasted a month, and <lb/>
brought her to the very door of death. At least, <lb/>
the good old hospital doctor thought she was near <lb/>
her end when he left the institution one day, saying, <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0115"/>
with tears, "If Sister Dora dies, I'll never enter <lb/>
these doors again!"</p>
<p>But Sister Dora did not die. Her strong will, <lb/>
with skillful treatment, and the blessing of God, <lb/>
restored her to health, and to the work she loved.</p>
<p>Were it not authentically vouched, the story of <lb/>
Sister Dora's work, both in and out of the hospital, <lb/>
would be deemed incredible. Her capacity of <lb/>
working incessantly all day, and of watching four <lb/>
or five nights in succession, was such as few, either <lb/>
men or women, possess. Her ability as a tender <lb/>
nurse, her surgical skill in reducing a fracture, <lb/>
tying an artery, and dressing a wound, is rarely <lb/>
excelled, even by professional surgeons. Her <reg orig="ver-|satility">versatility</reg>, <lb/>
by which she could turn from managing <lb/>
the sick wards to directing the catering <reg orig="depart-|ments">departments</reg> <lb/>
of the establishment, was remarkable; her <lb/>
power to command the respect of the rude, often <lb/>
vile, men who were constantly placed under her <lb/>
care, was such as few men or women possess; and <lb/>
the magnetism by which she inspired her patients <lb/>
with fortitude under terrible surgical operations, <lb/>
or when their wounds, caused by burning and <reg orig="scald-|ing">scalding</reg>, <lb/>
were dressed, and with cheerfulness under the <lb/>
weariness of long-continued weakness and pain, was <lb/>
also wonderful. But besides all these qualities, and <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0116"/>
the burden of her onerous hospital duties, she <reg orig="en-|gaged">engaged</reg> <lb/>
after 1873 in missionary work. She had <lb/>
previously regarded her nursing as a ministration <lb/>
to Christ's sick and suffering ones, and had <reg orig="con-|stantly">constantly</reg> <lb/>
prayed for his blessing on her nursing. <lb/>
But when, in 1873, a special meeting was held in <lb/>
Walsall for the spiritual welfare of the people, she <lb/>
went out among them, and persuaded many to <lb/>
attend the services. She also attended prayer-<reg orig="meet-|ings">meetings</reg> <lb/>
established by her pastor, the liberal-minded <lb/>
Mr. Twigg; and after going to Birmingham, for <lb/>
the purpose of studying the methods of Moody and <lb/>
Sankey, she taught her hospital patients to sing <lb/>
the Sankey hymns; and at the close of the Sunday <lb/>
afternoon hospital services, conducted by a <reg orig="clergy-|man">clergyman</reg>, <lb/>
she addressed them in her own peculiar and <lb/>
effective manner. "I try to put myself," she said, <lb/>
"in the place of these poor men, to see with their <lb/>
eyes, and to feel their wants and difficulties as if <lb/>
they were my own, and then God puts into my <lb/>
heart the words which will reach their hearts." Is <lb/>
it surprising that by this simple process, and by her <lb/>
habits of constant Bible study, she became wise to <lb/>
win souls? She always carried a small Bible in her <lb/>
pocket, and when found reading it one day by one <lb/>
of her lady pupils, "the expression on her face," <lb/>
<pb n="111" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0117"/>
said this eye-witness, "was indescribable; it was <lb/>
like nothing I had ever seen on a human face <reg orig="be-|fore&mdash;unearthly">before&mdash;unearthly</reg> <lb/>
is the word I must use for it." <lb/>
Evidently Sister Dora had learned to see the face <lb/>
and heart of her Lord in his Word. To her, <reg orig="read-|ing">reading</reg> <lb/>
the Bible was communing with God.</p>
<p>In 1874 Sister Dora dissolved her connection <lb/>
with the "Good Samaritans," saying, when asked <lb/>
her reason for this act, "I am a woman, and not <lb/>
a piece of furniture!" The Sisterhood then <lb/>
wrote the committee that they would no longer be <lb/>
responsible for the nursing at the Walsall hospital. <lb/>
But the committee, esteeming Sister Dora's services <lb/>
as of higher value to them than those of the whole <lb/>
Sisterhood, requested her to assume its entire charge, <lb/>
to which she gladly assented, seeing that it was only <lb/>
formally accepting a responsibility which she had <lb/>
practically borne for several years.</p>
<p>Perhaps Dora's crowning act of self-denial was <lb/>
her offer, in 1875, to take charge of the Epidemic <lb/>
Hospital, which had been built after the visitation <lb/>
of small-pox suffered by the Walsall people in 1868. <lb/>
Dora knew that the poor would not send their sick <lb/>
to such a hospital if conducted by ordinary nurses. <lb/>
She knew, too, as did the authorities of the city, <lb/>
that if she took it in charge they would willingly <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0118"/>
trust their friends to her care. It was a daring, a <lb/>
revolting, a perilous task to isolate herself from the <lb/>
community, and to shut herself up with small-pox <lb/>
patients, for an indefinite time. It was too much to <lb/>
ask her to do it, for was it not going into the jaws <lb/>
of death? But, seeing that she might thereby <reg orig="pre-|vent">prevent</reg> <lb/>
the town from being ravaged by this <reg orig="disgust-|ing">disgusting</reg> <lb/>
and deadly pestilence, and so save many lives, <lb/>
she did not wait to be asked; but, after finding <lb/>
that she could safely trust her own hospital to the care <lb/>
of three lady pupils, she heroically volunteered to <lb/>
undertake it. Her offer was gladly accepted. The <lb/>
public breathed more freely, as men and women <lb/>
went about saying to one another, "Sister Dora <lb/>
is going to the Epidemic Hospital!" O, <reg orig="Christ-|like">Christlike</reg> <lb/>
Sister Dora!</p>
<p>It is a pity that this Christly act was marred by <lb/>
Dora's jealousy lest, during her absence from her <lb/>
post, some one of her lady pupils should display <lb/>
qualities that might rival her own. To prevent <lb/>
this, instead of placing one of them in charge, she <lb/>
left, simply bidding them divide its duties among <lb/>
themselves. The result, as she must have <reg orig="antici-|pated">anticipated</reg>, <lb/>
was disagreement and inefficiency. The pride <lb/>
she took in her acknowledged superiority as a nurse <lb/>
was the root of her jealousy. It was a spot on the <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0119"/>
otherwise grand decision of Dora's love for <reg orig="human-|ity">humanity</reg> <lb/>
and Christ, which led her to immure herself <lb/>
within the walls of the Epidemic Hospital. Alas, <lb/>
poor human nature!</p>
<p>When Dora stood on the steps of the Epidemic <lb/>
Hospital, a great dread of what she was to encounter <lb/>
there filled her heart. Shivering with a strange <lb/>
spasm of terror, she exclaimed:</p>
<p>"O, take me back! I can not endure this <lb/>
dreadful place! I had no idea what it would be <lb/>
like when I said I would come here."</p>
<p>Her companion, the physician of the hospital, <lb/>
only replied, "Come in!" She followed him. The <lb/>
internal arrangements of the building at once <lb/>
arrested her attention. Her momentary fear <reg orig="van-|ished">vanished</reg>, <lb/>
and she went quietly to her work.</p>
<p>Dora spent six months in that dreadful <reg orig="lazar-|house">lazar-house</reg>, <lb/>
among the victims of the repulsive epidemic, <lb/>
with no one to assist her except an old porter and <lb/>
some poor women employed to do the washing of <lb/>
the patients. The toil she endured, the scenes she <lb/>
witnessed, the courage she displayed, the skill with <lb/>
which she fought the disease, the cheerfulness with <lb/>
which she encouraged the sufferers, and the <reg orig="won-|derful">wonderful</reg> <lb/>
fortitude which kept her at her post, can <lb/>
neither be described nor even imagined. <reg orig="Never-|theless">Nevertheless</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0120"/>
sustained by her indomitable will, and by <lb/>
the grace of the Lord Jesus, she lived to see the <lb/>
last small-pox patient pass out from her care, to see <lb/>
the gates of the building closed, and to resume her <lb/>
old place in the regular hospital.</p>
<p>The limits of this sketch forbid further details <lb/>
of the work of this really wonderful woman. It <lb/>
must, therefore, suffice to add that she continued <lb/>
her career as nurse and Christian worker, chiefly at <lb/>
Walsall, with unabated zeal and self-devotion, <reg orig="win-|ning">winning</reg>, <lb/>
as usual, the affections of even her rudest and <lb/>
vilest patients, until, in 1877, she began to feel her <lb/>
masculine strength slightly declining. "What can <lb/>
be the cause?" she asked herself. Unable to answer <lb/>
this question, she consulted Mr. Crompton, a <reg orig="physi-|cian">physician</reg> <lb/>
who was her personal friend. The result of his <lb/>
examination was startling. It brought her face to <lb/>
face with death; for, as he assured her, she had a <lb/>
cancer which, said he, "must ultimately destroy <lb/>
your life!"</p>
<p>Mr. Crompton proposed a surgical operation. <lb/>
"It may prolong your life somewhat," he said. But <lb/>
Dora hesitated. She knew the uncertainty of the <lb/>
treatment proposed. Finally she said:</p>
<p>"No, I will allow the disease to take its natural <lb/>
course. But promise me to keep my condition a <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0121"/>
secret. If my friends find it out, they will not <reg orig="per-|mit">permit</reg> <lb/>
me to keep on working, as I wish to do to <lb/>
the last."</p>
<p>Dr. Crompton gave the required promise, and <lb/>
Dora returned to her duties, knowing that her <lb/>
death-sentence was written on her person. She <lb/>
then prayerfully reviewed her past life, and saw in <lb/>
it, as she thought, so much work left undone, so <lb/>
many wasted opportunities, so much time <reg orig="unre-|deemed">unredeemed</reg>, <lb/>
that she resolved to give all the financial <lb/>
resources she had inherited from her father, with <lb/>
the whole energy of her soul and body, to make the <lb/>
very utmost of every moment still left her. Besides <lb/>
this motive for keeping her disease a secret, she <lb/>
shrunk from being an object of pity. She, who <lb/>
could pity others and give them her overflowing <lb/>
sympathy, could not endure to be herself pitied. <lb/>
Perhaps there was a little pride in this shrinking <lb/>
from pity and sympathy, or it may be she was <reg orig="con-|tent">content</reg> <lb/>
with the sympathy of Him in whose steps she <lb/>
was so treading, that common opinion was voiced <lb/>
by one of her friends, who said, after her death, <lb/>
"Sister Dora was as like the Lord Jesus as any <lb/>
human creature could be."</p>
<p>Dora visited the Isle of Man in the Summer of <lb/>
1878, to see some of her nieces. She then went to <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0122"/>
Paris to the Exhibition, and afterwards to London, <lb/>
at both of which places she gave close attention to <lb/>
medical and surgical questions. In appearance she <lb/>
was still a beautiful, healthful lady; in reality she <lb/>
was slowly approaching the crisis of her disease. In <lb/>
October she wrote to a clerical friend: "The decree <lb/>
has gone forth, 'Sister, put thy house in order, for <lb/>
thou shalt die, and not live.' There is only Mount <lb/>
Calvary to climb, by the ladder of sickness. I have <lb/>
not had two hours' sleep for four days and nights; <lb/>
but in the midst of the fiery furnace there was a <lb/>
form like unto the Son of God."</p>
<p>Then came eleven weeks of exquisite suffering, <lb/>
during which she was lovingly nursed by her <reg orig="Wal-|sall">Walsall</reg> <lb/>
friends, and visited by many leading citizens <lb/>
of the place. On the 24th of December, replying <lb/>
to a friend who had remarked, "Our blessed Lord <lb/>
is standing at the gates of heaven to open them for <lb/>
you," she said: "I see him there; the gates are <lb/>
opened wide."</p>

<p>A little later her pain subsided, and Sister Dora's <lb/>
life ebbed quietly away, and her escaped spirit <lb/>
swelled the glorified throng, and was forever with <lb/>
her Lord.</p>
<p>Dora's death filled all Walsall with genuine <lb/>
grief. The whole city was deeply moved, and <lb/>
<pb n="117" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0123"/>
almost its entire population, from its civic officers <lb/>
to its poor, its halt, and its maimed, was present at <lb/>
her burial. Never did any city pay greater honor <lb/>
to one of its dead than Walsall to the remains of <lb/>
Sister Dora.</p>
<p>There was much in Sister Dora's life that can <lb/>
not be, perhaps ought not to be, imitated by any <lb/>
other woman. Her idiosyncrasies were peculiarly <lb/>
her own. What woman ever combined so much <lb/>
masculine physical strength with so much feminine <lb/>
grace and beauty? or so much manly force of <lb/>
character with so much womanly delicacy? or so <lb/>
much broad, not to say coarse, humor with so much <lb/>
purity of feeling and language? or so much <reg orig="self-|forgetfulness">self-forgetfulness</reg> <lb/>
in the presence of the many inevitable <lb/>
indelicacies of hospital practice with so much <reg orig="per-|fect">perfect</reg> <lb/>
modesty? It is not her idiosyncrasies, <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg>, <lb/>
that the Christian woman is to aspire to imitate, <lb/>
but only her spirit of self-sacrifice. Dora gave all <lb/>
she had to the service of Christ and humanity. My <lb/>
lady reader can give <hi rend="italic">all she has</hi> to the same high <lb/>
service. Dora spent herself in a way suited to her <lb/>
peculiar endowments. The lady reader can spend <lb/>
her life in a way suited to her own gifts. The voice <lb/>
of duty does not call any lady, young or old, to <lb/>
tread paths which nature has unfitted her to walk <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0124"/>
in, but only to consecrate whatever gifts she has to <lb/>
the Master's service. When our dear Lord gave <lb/>
judgment concerning Mary's devotion, he did not <lb/>
say, She hath done what Deborah or Elizabeth or <lb/>
Salome did, but, "She hath done <hi rend="italic">what she could."</hi> <lb/>
And this is duty's call to every daughter of the <lb/>
Church&mdash;so to act that, at her death, the Eternal <lb/>
Judge may say of her, "She hath done what <lb/>
she could."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Mary anne lamb</hi> is ranked among famous <lb/>
women, not because of her contributions to <lb/>
literature, though they were by no means <reg orig="des-|picable">despicable</reg>, <lb/>
as will be shown, but because of her <lb/>
sisterly devotion to her brother Charles, whose genial <lb/>
and witty essays gave him, as the reader knows, a <lb/>
high place among the literary celebrities of his <lb/>
times. The story of the love of this brother and <lb/>
sister probably has no parallel in the lives of men <lb/>
and women. The tragic circumstances which called <lb/>
it into activity invest it with rare interest, and <lb/>
cause its marvelous beauty to stand out so <reg orig="conspic-|uously">conspicuously</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0126"/>
as to compel the admiration of every class <lb/>
of readers. In both it was a love of sacrifice, and <lb/>
it may be difficult to determine which made the <lb/>
greater sacrifice for the other's sake. Without <lb/>
attempting to solve this problem, one may certainly <lb/>
affirm that Mary was a true sister in the original <lb/>
sense of that familiar word, which, as etymologists <lb/>
teach, signifies, "she who pleases or consoles." The <lb/>
love of Antigone for her brothers, as presented by <lb/>
Sophocles in his famous tragedy, was more than <lb/>
equaled in depth and beauty by the love of Mary <lb/>
Lamb for her wonderfully affectionate brother.</p>
<p>Miss Lamb was born in London on the 3d of <lb/>
December, 1764. She was the third of a family <lb/>
of seven children born to her father, who was a <lb/>
barrister's clerk. Of these, four died in early <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg>, <lb/>
leaving John, the eldest, Mary, and Charles, <lb/>
the youngest of the seven, to grow to maturity.</p>
<p>Mary was a shy, sensitive, nervous, affectionate <lb/>
child, in whom a close observer might have <reg orig="dis-|cerned">discerned</reg> <lb/>
symptoms of a brain likely to be disordered <lb/>
by a tendency to insanity, inherited from her father's <lb/>
ancestors. It was her misfortune that her mother, <lb/>
though kind, and even affectionate, did not, <reg orig="proba-|bly">probably</reg> <lb/>
could not, comprehend her peculiar need of <lb/>
being loved with an affection as demonstrative as <lb/>
<pb n="121" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0127"/>
her own. Hence, instead of responding to the child's <lb/>
fond words and caresses with sympathetic warmth, <lb/>
she repelled her, if not with sharp words, yet with <lb/>
a coldness which chilled her heart.</p>
<p>Mary's home, which, though humble, was above <lb/>
want, was still more unfitted to her needs because <lb/>
of a maiden aunt who dwelt in it, and whose odd <lb/>
ways, "witch-like mutterings and mumblings," and <lb/>
uncanny glances, made her an object of dread to <lb/>
the shrinking maiden, as she was also to her brother <lb/>
Charles. Her school education was limited to <reg orig="instruc-|tion">instruction</reg> <lb/>
in reading, writing, and "ciphering," by "a <reg orig="gen-|tle">gentle</reg> <lb/>
usher" named Starkey. The library of Mr. Salt, <lb/>
her father's employer, in which she was suffered "to <lb/>
browse" at will, doubtless contributed to the <reg orig="unfold-|ing">unfolding</reg> <lb/>
of her mind, as it did also, by the unsuitable <lb/>
books it contained, to the birth of fancies and <reg orig="feel-|ings">feelings</reg> <lb/>
which nourished the seeds of insanity sown by <lb/>
nature in her susceptible spirit. Occasional visits <lb/>
to her maternal grandmother and other relatives, <lb/>
living in the country, also had their influence, both <lb/>
good and ill, in forming her character.</p>
<p>When Mary was full ten years old, her brother <lb/>
Charles was born. He was "a weakly but very <lb/>
pretty babe," and his coming not only made Mary's <lb/>
life less lonely, but, as she was old enough to act <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0128"/>
the part of a nurse, her care of him, by diverting <lb/>
her mind from its uncanny fancies, had a health-giving <lb/>
effect upon her young soul. His nature, as he grew <lb/>
up, proved to be very like her own. His mind <lb/>
responded to her intelligence, and his heart <reg orig="recip-|rocated">reciprocated</reg> <lb/>
her strong affection. They were inseparable <lb/>
companions until, in 1782, when he was seven years <lb/>
old, and a handsome boy with curling, black hair, <lb/>
brown complexion, and glittering eyes, she had to <lb/>
lose his daily companionship because of his <reg orig="admis-|sion">admission</reg> <lb/>
to Christ's Hospital. But, though he was a <lb/>
"Blue-coat boy," his home was near at hand, and his <lb/>
association with his sister, though interrupted, was <lb/>
by no means broken up.</p>
<p>Seven years in Christ's Hospital had to suffice <lb/>
for Charles Lamb's school education. The <reg orig="help-|lessness">helplessness</reg> <lb/>
and infirmities of old age had overtaken <lb/>
their parents, and made it necessary for him and <lb/>
Mary to undertake, at least in part, the support of <lb/>
their now mentally incompetent father, and their <lb/>
physically broken down mother. Mary had already <lb/>
begun her part, by "taking in millinery work," which <lb/>
she continued to do for eleven years, or until she was <lb/>
thirty-two years old. Charles now put his <reg orig="shoul-|der">shoulder</reg> <lb/>
beneath the family burden, by accepting a <lb/>
clerk's desk, procured for him by his elder brother, <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0129"/>
the selfish John, in the South Sea House. Then, <lb/>
in the happy fellowship of love and self-sacrificing <lb/>
toil, this loving brother and sister traveled <reg orig="uncom-|plainingly">uncomplainingly</reg> <lb/>
along the humble path in which their <lb/>
lots were cast.</p>
<p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge, though two years <lb/>
older than Lamb, had become acquainted with him <lb/>
at Christ's Hospital, where Lamb had almost <reg orig="wor-|shiped">worshiped</reg> <lb/>
the rising genius of the future philosopher. <lb/>
After entering the South Sea House, the two old <lb/>
school-mates often met at a tavern known as the <lb/>
"Salutation and Cat." There their <reg orig="acquaintance-|ship">acquaintanceship</reg> <lb/>
ripened into friendship, and Lamb introduced <lb/>
Coleridge to his own modest home, and to his <reg orig="sis-|ter">sister</reg>. <lb/>
In the literary chitchat with which they <reg orig="enliv-|ened">enlivened</reg> <lb/>
the evening hours, Coleridge learned to perceive <lb/>
the fine qualities of Mary's mind and heart, and <lb/>
became the firm friend of both.</p>
<p>But the shadow of a lifelong affliction fell across <lb/>
the path of this unfortunate, devoted brother and <lb/>
sister in the year 1795. Crossed in an affection he <lb/>
had cherished for a young lady, and oppressed with <lb/>
the cares of family life forced prematurely upon <lb/>
him, poor Lamb's reason reeled, and for six weeks <lb/>
he became an inmate of an insane asylum. He had <lb/>
not been long restored before his brother John, <lb/>
<pb n="124" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0130"/>
who, when well, had not offered to assist them, <lb/>
though abundantly able, having met with an <reg orig="acci-|dent">accident</reg>, <lb/>
sought the nursing he required in the modest <lb/>
home of Charles and his sister. The nursing was <lb/>
cheerfully given, but it cost them a fearful price. <lb/>
Mary, then thirty-two years old, worn down with <lb/>
overmuch care, excessive needlework, and incessant <lb/>
nursing of her crippled mother, to which the <reg orig="watch-|ing">watching</reg> <lb/>
of her elder brother was superadded, fell into a <lb/>
state of "extreme nervous misery." Symptoms of <lb/>
the family madness appearing one morning, Charles, <lb/>
on his way to his office, requested a physician to call <lb/>
and prescribe for Mary. The doctor was, <reg orig="unfortu-|nately">unfortunately</reg>, <lb/>
out. Mary's symptoms grew worse in the <lb/>
afternoon, when she was suddenly seized with <lb/>
frenzy. Grasping a knife, she rushed upon her <lb/>
sewing-girl with murderous intent. The girl fled <lb/>
before her. Mary pursued her. Her mother hastily <lb/>
interposed, and the blow aimed at the affrighted girl <lb/>
fell upon the mother and killed her instantly! <lb/>
Charles entered the room only in time to snatch the <lb/>
knife from the hand of his maniac sister. She was <lb/>
utterly unconscious of what she had done, and <lb/>
Charles, with a sorrow-stricken, foreboding heart, <lb/>
placed her within the walls of an asylum for the <lb/>
insane.</p>
<pb n="125" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0131"/>
<p>This double tragedy almost unnerved the <reg orig="sensi-|tive">sensitive</reg> <lb/>
Charles. But his friend Coleridge cheered him <lb/>
with letters full of beauty, wisdom, and religious <lb/>
consolations. He seems also to have sought strength <lb/>
and healing in prayer. Unlike his brother, who <lb/>
refused to act a brother's part, and even censured <lb/>
him for refusing to let their sister be sent by the <lb/>
civic authorities to a public hospital for life, Charles <lb/>
rose nobly to the demands of the occasion. Though <lb/>
his entire income&mdash;he was by this time a clerk in <lb/>
the India House&mdash;was but nine hundred dollars per <lb/>
annum, and it would require one-third of that sum <lb/>
to pay Mary's expenses in the asylum, yet he right <lb/>
manfully and nobly determined to give up his <reg orig="long-|cherished">long-cherished</reg> <lb/>
hope of marrying" the fair-haired maid" <lb/>
whom he loved, and to take upon himself the <reg orig="sup-|port">support</reg> <lb/>
of his infirm father and insane sister.</p>
<p>This determination involved a measure of <reg orig="self-|sacrifice">self-sacrifice</reg> <lb/>
few brothers would be willing to make. <lb/>
But Charles knew that Mary was worthy of it. He <lb/>
loved her, not only because she was his sister, but <lb/>
also because he believed her to be "uniformly great <lb/>
and amiable. Of all the people I ever saw in the <lb/>
world," he said, with proud affection, "my poor <lb/>
sister was most and thoroughly devoid of the least <lb/>
tincture of selfishness."</p>
<pb n="126" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0132"/>
<p>But what of Mary after her terrible deed? She <lb/>
was not long in the asylum before she was restored, <lb/>
says Charles, "to her senses, and to a dreadful sense <lb/>
and recollection of what had passed," which was <lb/>
awful to her mind, but tempered with religious <lb/>
resignation. "Even then she was happily able to <lb/>
discriminate between a deed committed in a transient <lb/>
fit of frenzy, and the terrible guilt of a mother's <lb/>
murder. &hellip; She had a most affectionate and <lb/>
tender concern for what had happened." She grieved, <lb/>

but there was no sting of guilt in her grief, and she <lb/>
found comfort in the thought that she had always <lb/>
loved her mother with a deep and tender affection, <lb/>
which had been "but half requited," and that it <lb/>
was "the long years of daily and nightly devotion <lb/>
to her" which had developed the madness that <lb/>
led to the sad catastrophe. No wonder, therefore, <lb/>
that the recollection of her mother's death awakened <lb/>
no accusing voice in her conscience, no fear as to her <lb/>
accountability for the unintentional deed. Very <lb/>
touchingly she wrote to Charles on this point, <reg orig="say-|ing">saying</reg>: <lb/>
"I have no bad, terrifying dreams. At midnight, <lb/>
when I happen to awake, &hellip; with the noise <lb/>
of the poor mad people around me, I have no fear. <lb/>
The spirit of my mother seems to descend and <lb/>
smile upon me and bid me live to enjoy the life and <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0133"/>
reason which the Almighty has given me." Had <lb/>
she been an unloving, disobedient daughter, could <lb/>
such thoughts have arisen to comfort her? Had <lb/>
there been any unfilial acts in her past, would they <lb/>
not have reappeared in her memory and dreams as <lb/>
accusing specters? And what was the mother's <lb/>
smile she saw in her nightly visions but a bright <lb/>
effulgence from that complete and loving observance <lb/>
of a daughter's obligations which she had rendered <lb/>
unceasingly up to the hour of her insanity?</p>
<p>It is illustrative of Mary's charming disposition <lb/>
that she won, not the respect and indulgence merely, <lb/>
but the love of the keepers of the asylum. It was <lb/>
thought prudent to detain her within its walls some <lb/>
time after her reason was restored, and, says Charles, <lb/>
"she set herself with characteristic sweetness to <lb/>
make the best of life in a private lunatic asylum." <lb/>
Of her keepers he adds, "They love her and she <lb/>
loves them, and makes herself very useful to them."</p>
<p>In the Spring of 1797 Mary was thought to be <lb/>
sufficiently restored to quit the asylum. Charles, <lb/>
unwilling to burden her with the care of their <reg orig="help-|less">helpless</reg> <lb/>
father, provided her with a lodging, where he <lb/>
spent many of his evenings enjoying her intelligent <lb/>
companionship, and inwardly rejoicing over his hope <lb/>
that she would not be insane again. Vain hope! <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0134"/>
Only a few months later she was again in the <reg orig="asy-|lum">asylum</reg>. <lb/>
Poor Charles was in the depths of <reg orig="disappoint-|ment">disappointment</reg> <lb/>
and dejection, dreading lest it was his sister's <lb/>
doom to live "perpetually on the brink of madness."</p>
<p>In 1799 the death of Lamb's father, and the <lb/>
apparent recovery of Mary, made it practicable for <lb/>
him to take her home. "Mary," he wrote, "was <lb/>
never in better health and spirits than now." Shortly <lb/>
after this she made her first attempt at verse-making, <lb/>
by producing a playful little epigram entitled <lb/>
"Helen," which Charles sent to Coleridge in great <lb/>
glee, claiming it to be "very elegant and very <reg orig="orig-|inal">original</reg>." <lb/>
He subsequently published it in the first <reg orig="col-|lected">collected</reg> <lb/>
edition of his works.</p>
<p>About this period of her life Mary began to go <lb/>
into society with her brother, and after setting up <lb/>
their household gods at No. 16 Mitre Court, to <lb/>
gather around their hospitable supper-table "an <lb/>
ever-lengthened succession of friends, cronies, and <lb/>
acquaintances," which included many brilliant <reg orig="con-|versationists">conversationists</reg> <lb/>
and literary celebrities. Mary, during <lb/>
her periods of sanity, bore herself, both in these <lb/>
home-gatherings and in the literary parties at which <lb/>
she and her brother were guests, with such habitual <lb/>
serenity of demeanor that, says Talfourd, "little <lb/>
could any one observing Miss Lamb guess the calamity <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0135"/>
which frightfully checkered her life." De Quincey <lb/>
called her "that Madonna-like lady." In person <lb/>
she was under the middle-size. Her very placid <lb/>
features were well formed; her changeful eyes were <lb/>
described by Procter as "gray and intelligent," and <lb/>
by Miss Cowden Clarke as "brown, soft, and <reg orig="pene-|trating">penetrating</reg>." <lb/>
Miss Clarke also says that "her smile <lb/>
was winning in the extreme." Her manners were <lb/>
quiet and easy. Her voice was soft and persuasive, <lb/>
with an emotional stress in breathing which gave a <lb/>
charm to her reading of poetry, and a captivating <lb/>
earnestness. She talked sparingly, but her speech <lb/>
was "quaint and pleasant." These external <reg orig="char-|acteristics">characteristics</reg> <lb/>
were the visible expressions of a mind <lb/>
richly endowed with clear and quick perceptions, <lb/>
sound judgment, strong reasoning powers, and ex <lb/>
ceeding sweetness of disposition. Her culture had <lb/>
been derived, not from scholastic training, but from <lb/>
much and varied reading. She was not, therefore, <lb/>
an unnoticed cipher when in the society of her <lb/>
brother's literary associates, but an agreeable <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg>, <lb/>
who contributed, by her sensible <reg orig="apprecia-|tion">appreciation</reg> <lb/>
of their wit and wisdom, to their entertainment. <lb/>
Hazlitt used to say of her, "I never met with a <lb/>
woman who could reason, and I have met with only <lb/>
one thoroughly reasonable, and that was Mary <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0136"/>
Lamb; a remark, by the way, as unfair, at least <lb/>
to many women, as "it was commendatory of <lb/>
Mary Lamb."</p>
<p>When Mary's constantly recurring fits of <reg orig="mad-|ness">madness</reg> <lb/>
were coming on, her speech, though rambling <lb/>
and fantastic, was, as Mrs. Gilchrist informs us, <lb/>
sometimes brilliant, beautiful, and courtly, "as if <lb/>
the finest elements of her mind had been shaken <lb/>
into fantastic combinations, like those of a <reg orig="ka-|leidoscope">kaleidoscope</reg>."</p>
<p>Her attacks were usually brought on by <reg orig="excite-|ment">excitement</reg> <lb/>
of any kind, or by excessive fatigue. First <lb/>
sleeplessness, then restlessness, sometimes stupor, <lb/>
were their premonitory symptoms. Fully aware of <lb/>
her liability to them, she was accustomed, when <lb/>
starting on a holiday trip, which necessarily involved <lb/>
fatigue, to pack a strait-waistcoat with her own <lb/>
hands. When warned by her feelings that her <lb/>
mind was about to lose control of itself, she would <lb/>
gently and sadly intimate the fact to her brother. <lb/>
Reluctant to give publicity to his great affliction, <lb/>
poor Lamb would ask leave of absence from his <lb/>
office, as if for a day's excursion. Then, taking <lb/>
Mary's hand, he would walk with her to the <reg orig="asy-|lum">asylum</reg>. <lb/>
Mr. Charles Lloyd, one of their intimate <lb/>
friends, met them one day thus slowly walking <lb/>
<pb n="131" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0137"/>
together along a footpath in Hoxton Fields, both <lb/>
weeping bitterly. On joining them they told him <lb/>
that they were on their way to the asylum, to which <lb/>
she so often resorted for treatment. What a sad, <lb/>
yet beautiful spectacle! Sad, because of the <reg orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg>; <lb/>
beautiful, because of the depth and tenderness <lb/>
of the affection it displayed.</p>
<p>Lamb's tender anxiety led him to be always <lb/>
watching his sister. Even when in his most <reg orig="con-|vivial">convivial</reg> <lb/>
moods, if he saw a languid look in her sweet <lb/>
face, he would turn from his companions to her, and <lb/>
ask, "Mary, does your head ache? Do you feel <lb/>
unwell?" If it chanced that the conversation <lb/>
turned to exciting events, he would change its <reg orig="cur-|rent">current</reg> <lb/>
with a laughable jest or a <reg orig="mirth-provok-|ing">mirth-provok-ing</reg> <lb/>
pun. On one occasion, when he overheard a <lb/>
lady speaking to her so earnestly in praise of <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>, <lb/>
that Mary was moved to lay her hand upon <lb/>
the eulogist's shoulder, he suddenly stepped to them <lb/>
and said:</p>
<p>"Come, come, we must not talk sentimentally!" <lb/>
and then he began to rattle off some of his gayest <lb/>
nonsense.</p>
<p>The strain of this constant anxiety on the <lb/>
brother's part was terrible. It made him nervous, <lb/>
irritable, melancholy at times, and wrote deep lines <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0138"/>
of suffering on his expressive countenance, which <lb/>
said Coleridge, "went to the heart of his friends." <lb/>
But it never made him bitter, morose, morbid, or <lb/>
violent. When his elastic spirit rose from the <lb/>
depth of its depression, its reaction was seen by his <lb/>
friends in bursts of wild, fantastic gayety, which <lb/>
made him a problem to strangers and a charming <lb/>
mystery to his friends. Its most serious effect on <lb/>
him was to drive him to the free use of intoxicating <lb/>
drinks. The habits of society were all against him <lb/>
in this temptation; and while the warmest admirers <lb/>
of this much-tried, gentle soul can not exonerate him <lb/>
from blame for this weakness, they yet mingle a large <lb/>
proportion of pity with their regretful censure.</p>
<p>In 1802 we find Mary sufficiently vigorous to <lb/>
accompany her brother to the "Lakes," on a visit <lb/>
to Coleridge, whose warm sympathies with both <lb/>
were as precious ointment poured forth. On their <lb/>
return they found Wordsworth and his sister in <lb/>
London, they having just returned from a trip to <lb/>
the Continent. Dorothy Wordsworth was a woman <lb/>
after Mary's own heart, at least so far as their love <lb/>
for their respective brothers was concerned. <reg orig="Cir-|cumstances">Circumstances</reg> <lb/>
excepted, Dorothy was to Wordsworth <lb/>
what Mary was to Lamb. Both were examples of <lb/>
rare and beautiful sisterly devotion.</p>
<pb n="133" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0139"/>
<p>Poverty, though it never created genius, has often <lb/>
been a spur to its development where it lay idle or <lb/>
latent. In the case of Mary Lamb, who, if not a <lb/>
genius, was highly gifted with talent, it did this <lb/>
latter office in that the insufficiency of her brother's <lb/>
income to meet their growing wants, despite her <lb/>
rare economical abilities, moved her to enter the <lb/>
field of authorship. Her malady forbade close <lb/>
mental application. Yet during her lucid interval <lb/>
in 1806 she undertook to transform fourteen of <lb/>
Shakespeare's plays into stories for children. Her <lb/>
fondness for children furnished her inspiration for <lb/>
this task; her clear perceptive qualities, her <reg orig="shrewd-|ness">shrewdness</reg>, <lb/>
and her tact fitted her to do it well. Lamb who, <lb/>
to her fourteen dramas, added six tragedies, assisted <lb/>
and encouraged her. His fun made their work seem <lb/>
like play at times, as appears by the following <reg orig="ex-|tract">extract</reg> <lb/>
from one of her letters to a lady friend:</p>
<p>"You would like to see us," she writes, "as we <lb/>
often sit writing at one table &lpar;but not on one <reg orig="cush-|ion&rpar;">cushion&rpar;</reg>, <lb/>
sitting like Hermia and Helena in the '<reg orig="Mid-|summer">Midsummer</reg> <lb/>
Night's Dream,' or rather like an old literary <lb/>
Darby and Joan, I taking snuff, and he groaning <lb/>
all the while, and saying he can make nothing <lb/>
of it, which he always says till he has finished, and <lb/>
then finds out he has made something of it."</p>
<pb n="134" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0140"/>
<p>In one of Lamb's letters we find him laughingly <lb/>
saying: "Mary begins to think Shakespeare must <lb/>
have wanted imagination! I flatter her with telling <lb/>
how well such and such a play is done."</p>
<p>Thus cheered and encouraged, this afflicted lady, <lb/>
who must have written in hourly apprehension of <lb/>
a visitation of her dreadful malady, completed her <lb/>
contract. Her "Tales from Shakespeare," duly, <lb/>
though not satisfactorily, illustrated, appeared in <lb/>
the book market. "Their success," says Mrs. <reg orig="Gil-|christ">Gilchrist</reg>, <lb/>
"was decisive and complete. New editions <lb/>

were called for," and even now "hardly a year passes <lb/>
but a new edition is called for" in England; albeit <lb/>
they are but little known in America.</p>
<p>Mary's next literary venture was a volume of ten <lb/>
short tales for children, entitled "Mrs. Leicester's <lb/>
School." Of these Charles was the author of three. <lb/>
These simple stories were praised with "whimsical <lb/>
extravagance" by Landor; and Coleridge, scarcely <lb/>
less extravagant, said: "It at once soothes and <lb/>
amuses me to think&mdash;nay, to know&mdash;that the time <lb/>
will come when this little volume of my dear, <reg orig="well-|nigh">well-nigh</reg> <lb/>
oldest friend, Mary Lamb, will be not only <lb/>
enjoyed, but acknowledged as a rich jewel in the <lb/>
treasury of our permanent English literature." <lb/>
These opinions were inspired more by friendly <lb/>
<pb n ="135" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0141"/>
feeling than by unbiased critical judgment. There <lb/>
was, nevertheless, a measure of truth in them which <lb/>
the public acknowledged by rapidly buying up the <lb/>
first edition, and calling for several more during the <lb/>
ensuing five years. The volume is still found in <lb/>
the English book-market.</p>
<p>To the mental strain caused by the composition <lb/>
of these stories, the fatigue of two removals was <lb/>
added in 1809; and poor Mary was forced to <reg orig="aban-|don">abandon</reg> <lb/>
her household gods and her writing-desk, and <lb/>
submit once more to the necessary restraints of the <lb/>
mad-house.</p>
<p>"What sad, large pieces," exclaimed her <reg orig="dis-|tressed">distressed</reg> <lb/>
brother, "it cuts out of life!&mdash;out of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> <lb/>
life, who is getting rather old &lsqb;Mary was then <reg orig="forty-|five&rsqb;">fortyfive&rsqb;</reg>, <lb/>
and we may not have many years to live to <lb/>
gether. I bear it worse than ever I did."</p>
<p>"Poetry for Children, Entirely Original," was <lb/>
the title of a volume of little poems, "the joint <lb/>
production of Mary and me," as Lamb called it. <lb/>
It was published in the Summer of 1809, probably <lb/>
while Mary was crushed beneath her affliction. <lb/>
This also had a large sale, but "ultimately dropped <lb/>
out of sight." It was Mary's last book, though she <lb/>
subsequently wrote occasionally for the periodicals <lb/>
of the day. Neither these poems, nor her "Stories" <lb/>
<pb n="136" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0142"/>

and "Tales," nor all together, entitle her to rank <lb/>
with women of genius. But taking her lack of <lb/>
early education, the unfavorable circumstances in <lb/>
which her youth and early womanhood were passed, <lb/>
and the mental derangements to which she was so <lb/>
long subjected, into account, they suggest, if they <lb/>
do not amply prove, that with favorable <reg orig="opportuni-|ties">opportunities</reg> <lb/>
for mental culture, and with a mind unimpaired <lb/>
by hereditary madness, she would have won no mean <lb/>
degree of celebrity in the literary world.</p>
<p>As this is only a sketch, not a biography, further <lb/>
space can not be given to the details of Mary's later <lb/>
life. It would be interesting to accompany her and <lb/>
Charles to the various homes they occupied, to <lb/>
share the pleasures of their holiday trips, to peruse <lb/>
her letters, to sit with them in the gatherings of <lb/>
their many literary friends at their famous evening <lb/>
supper parties where, if there was less learning, <lb/>
stateliness, and splendor than at the much celebrated <lb/>
assemblies of Holland House, there was equal <reg orig="intel-|lectual">intellectual</reg> <lb/>
brightness and no less genial wit; albeit, <lb/>
it must be confessed that too much of their joviality <lb/>
owed its inspiration to flagons of strong ale, and <lb/>
tumblers of brandy and water; but it must suffice <lb/>
us in this paper to sum up the events of their <reg orig="sub-|sequent">subsequent</reg> <lb/>
years in a few words.</p>
<pb n="137" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0143"/>
<p>Mary never freed herself from the assaults of <lb/>
her hereditary foe. After 1824, a year which was <lb/>
marked by unusual freedom from his visitations, <lb/>
she was more and more frequently compelled to <lb/>
take up her abode with the unfortunate victims of <lb/>
mental distraction. The duration of her attacks <lb/>
became longer, until in 1833, Lamb wrote <reg orig="Words-|worth">Wordsworth</reg>: <lb/>
"Half her life she is dead to me, and the <lb/>
other half is made anxious with fears and lookings <lb/>
forward to the next shock." In 1834 Charles died <lb/>

of erysipelas, brought on by an accidental fall which <lb/>
wounded his face. At the time of his departure, <lb/>
though not actually insane, Mary's mind was so far <lb/>
under a cloud as not to clearly comprehend what a <lb/>
loss had befallen her. And she remained in that <lb/>
condition for nearly a year after he had passed away. <lb/>
Thus, for once, her disease was her friend in a time <lb/>
of her great need.</p>
<p>When again in her right mind, and made fully <lb/>
aware that her brother was in the grave, she took <lb/>
in the sad fact with calmness. Nevertheless "she <lb/>
refused to leave Edmonton. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> was there asleep in <lb/>
the old church-yard, beneath the turf near which <lb/>
they had stood together, and had selected for a <lb/>
resting-place. To this spot she used when well to <lb/>
stroll out mournfully in the evening; and to this <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0144"/>
spot she would contrive to lead any friend who <lb/>
came in on Summer evenings to tea, and went out <lb/>
with her afterward for a walk." His very grave <lb/>
seemed to tranquillize her feelings. Thirteen years <lb/>
after her brother's death, on the 28th of May, 1847, <lb/>
her body was laid with his in the same grave. She <lb/>
had lived eighty-three years.</p>
<p>To what purpose had Mary Lamb lived? the <lb/>
reader may ask. If for no other, surely for this&mdash; <lb/>
to give the world a rich and rare example of <reg orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg>, <lb/>
beautiful, sisterly affection. With all the <lb/>
anxiety and care that her mental upsettings brought <lb/>
him, Charles Lamb in the last year of his life wrote: <lb/>
"I could nowhere be happier than under the same <lb/>
roof with her." But this was but the expression <lb/>
of his love for her, not hers for him, it may be <lb/>

urged. Very true. But how rich, sweet, patient, <lb/>
and pure must have been Mary's disposition and <lb/>
character to win such an enduring regard from the <lb/>
sensitive, excitable, and singularly constituted <lb/>
Charles Lamb?</p>
<p>Was Mary Lamb a Christian? Nominally, yes. <lb/>
She appears to have had at least an intellectual <reg orig="be-|lief">belief</reg> <lb/>
in the truths of our holy religion. Of her <lb/>
inner religious life nothing appears either in her <lb/>
biography, or in that of her brother. Charles <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0145"/>
evidently lived in and for the present. His morals <lb/>
were not unimpeachable. He shrunk from serious <lb/>
thought of the future. Perhaps Mary, whose <lb/>
moral virtues were unblemished, thought and felt <lb/>
as he did on the great question of experimental <lb/>
godliness. Perhaps not. But this much one may <lb/>
say, that if to her rare sweetness of disposition, to <lb/>
her patience, to her self-sacrifice, to her <reg orig="indefatiga-|ble">indefatigable</reg> <lb/>
industry, and her more than ordinary literary <lb/>
ability, she had added that experimental faith in <lb/>
the Gospel, and that tender love for the Lord Jesus <lb/>
which are the brightest adornments of human <reg orig="na-|ture">nature</reg>, <lb/>
she would have ranked, not merely among <lb/>
women famous for sisterly affection, intellectual <lb/>
gifts, and social virtues, but also among those elect <lb/>
ladies whose saintliness entitles them to the <reg orig="rever-|ence">reverence</reg> <lb/>
and love of mankind.</p>

<p>Personal beauty and mental accomplishments <lb/>
impart a certain charm to women, but they can not <lb/>
kindle that "lambent light" which is the source <lb/>
<pb n="141" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0147"/>
of the highest type of female loveliness, and which <lb/>
makes the daughters of the Church, to use an <reg orig="in-|spired">inspired</reg> <lb/>
comparison, "as corner-stones polished after <lb/>
the similitude of a palace." The purpose of this <lb/>
sketch is to briefly portray the character of one such <lb/>
woman, who, whatever rank may be given her in <lb/>
the world of literature, was most assuredly a polished <lb/>
corner-stone in the Church of the living God.</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Frances Ridley Havergal</hi> had the good <reg orig="for-|tune">fortune</reg> <lb/>
to be the child of truly Christian parents, and <lb/>
to be born in a home of abundant comfort, of <reg orig="refine-|ment">refinement</reg>, <lb/>
and of very tender affection. She was the <lb/>
daughter of William Henry Havergal, rector of <lb/>
Astley, Worcestershire, England. She was born <lb/>
December 14, 1836, the youngest of six children, <lb/>
and was remarkably pretty, bright, and active during <lb/>
her infancy. She grew into a fairy-like child, so <lb/>
mentally prococious as to be able to read correctly <lb/>
and to write in round hand when only four years <lb/>
old. Shortly after, she was given lessons in French <lb/>
and in music, albeit her instruction was more or <lb/>
less informal and irregular. When seven years old <lb/>
she began to acquire German by listening, of her <lb/>
own free will, to the professor who gave lessons to <lb/>
her elder sisters, in the rectory drawing-room. Like <lb/>
the distinguished Jaqueline Pascal, she wrote poetry <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0148"/>
which was almost "perfect in rhyme and rhythm" <lb/>
before she was nine years of age&mdash;a gift which she <lb/>
seems to have inherited from her devout father. <lb/>
These premature developments were not the result <lb/>
of undue pressure, but of the spontaneous activities <lb/>
of a gifted, buoyant intellect. Frances was not, <lb/>
however, a plodding child. She lived a free, <reg orig="glad-|some">gladsome</reg> <lb/>
life, in a home which was to her a warm nest <lb/>
of love and cheerfulness, and when out of doors <lb/>
took as much delight as a wild boy might find in <lb/>
climbing a tree or scaling a wall. It seemed as <lb/>
natural to her to acquire knowledge as it was to <lb/>
work off her excess of animal spirits in active <lb/>
amusements.</p>
<p>Seeing that Miss Havergal's career was chiefly <lb/>
marked by the spirituality of her mind and her <lb/>
abundant success in winning souls, the reader will <lb/>
very naturally desire to trace her inner life back to <lb/>
its beginnings. Were her natural inclinations toward <lb/>
the spiritual life stronger than in children generally? <lb/>
some may inquire. She herself has answered this <lb/>
question in the negative. Though living in a home <lb/>
whose atmosphere was in no mean sense like the <lb/>
air of heaven, in which conversation, action, spirit, <lb/>
and reading were all in harmony with the law of <lb/>
Christ, yet she tells us that up to her seventh year <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0149"/>
she had no religious impressions whatever. When <lb/>
about that age a sermon on the future life filled her <lb/>
mind with troubled thoughts, and subsequently led <lb/>
her to pray in secret, and to desire that God would <lb/>
"make her a Christian." She was doubtless then <lb/>
for a long time under conviction for sin, but owing <lb/>
to a perverse indisposition "to be talked to" by <lb/>
those she loved best, she concealed her feelings, <lb/>
albeit they were to her at times like burning coals <lb/>
carried in the bosom.</p>
<p>When she was in her tenth year, her father's <lb/>
appointment as canon of Worcester Cathedral and <lb/>
rector of St. Nicholas Church, in that city, took her <lb/>
from the free country life she had hitherto enjoyed, <lb/>
and compelled her to become, as her father called <lb/>
her, "a caged lark" in a city rectory. It was a <reg orig="bit-|ter">bitter</reg> <lb/>
trial to her young heart, seeing that her love <lb/>
of nature had become almost a passion. Shortly <lb/>
after her arrival at Worcester, a sermon by her <lb/>
father's curate so strengthened her desire to be a <lb/>
Christian that she sought his advice. But the curate <lb/>
either did not comprehend her state of mind, or <lb/>
was so experimentally ignorant of the way of faith, <lb/>
that instead of teaching her bewildered young soul <lb/>
how to find rest in Jesus through simple faith, he <lb/>
merely bade her "try to be a good child and to <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0150"/>
pray;" and then, he said, her bad feelings would <lb/>
"soon go off." This was giving the dear, <reg orig="thought-|ful">thoughtful</reg> <lb/>
child a stone, instead of the bread for which she <lb/>
hungered, and which, but for her strange <reg orig="unwilling-|ness">unwillingness</reg> <lb/>
to tell her thoughts to her parents, she might <lb/>
then have found.</p>
<p>When she was eleven years old Frances was <lb/>
called to drink her first cup of bitter earthly grief. <lb/>
Her fond, gentle, devoted mother died, and she was <lb/>
for a time disconsolate. Her father wisely took her <lb/>
and her sisters from the house of death, on a trip to <lb/>
North Wales. Seeing new objects broke the flow <lb/>
of her sorrow, and on her return her animal spirits <lb/>
recovered, in great measure, their wonted activity, <lb/>
though, as she afterwards wrote, her grief still <lb/>
affected her very deeply at times. Yet, if any thing <lb/>
else attracted her attention, she had a happy faculty <lb/>
of forgetting her great grief for the moment. "And <lb/>
thus it happened," she says, "that a merry laugh or <lb/>
a sudden light-heeled scamper up-stairs and <reg orig="down-|stairs">downstairs</reg>, <lb/>
led others to think I had not many sad <lb/>
thoughts; whereas, not a minute before, my little <lb/>
heart was heavy and sad." Thus, as is probably <lb/>
the case with most thoughtful children, not even <lb/>
her nearest friends could fathom the mysteries of <lb/>
her child nature.</p>
<pb n="145" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0151"/>
<p>In this disturbed state of mind, this interesting <lb/>
girl continued for five years, learning more and more <lb/>
of the evil in her heart, constantly reading the <lb/>
Scriptures, praying for faith which she knew not <lb/>
how to exercise, and still studiously hiding her <lb/>
mental exercises, beneath a cheerful demeanor, from <lb/>
friends who would have gladly led her to the "light <lb/>
of life." When thirteen years old, she was sent to <lb/>
a young ladies' school at Belmont, which was <reg orig="con-|ducted">conducted</reg> <lb/>
by a Mrs. Teed, who was a truly Christian <lb/>
teacher. The spirit of this institution was truly <lb/>
religious. It pupils were taught that while it was <lb/>
important to acquire secular knowledge, it was still <lb/>
more important to "know God and his Son Jesus <lb/>
Christ." Such teaching could not well fail of <lb/>
spiritual results, and toward the close of Miss <reg orig="Hav-|ergal's">Havergal's</reg> <lb/>
first term it culminated in a powerful revival. <lb/>
Many of the young ladies were led to pluck sweet <lb/>
fruit from the tree of life. Miss Havergal's <reg orig="sensi-|tive">sensitive</reg> <lb/>
mind responded to those quickening energies <lb/>
of the Holy Spirit. She became increasingly <reg orig="desir-|ous">desirous</reg> <lb/>
to find Him for whom she had so long and, as it <lb/>
seemed, so vainly sought. Still her reticence kept <lb/>
her from making her anxieties known, until one <lb/>
afternoon a young lady whom she loved very dearly, <lb/>
sat down by her side and told her with joyful <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0152"/>
tears that she had received the forgiveness of her <lb/>
sins through faith in Christ. "He is my Savior," <lb/>
she said, "and I am so happy!" and then she urged <lb/>
Miss Havergal to look to Him who, she said, "now <lb/>
loves you, though you do n't know it."</p>
<p>After that afternoon Frances ceased to hide her <lb/>
religious feelings. She talked with others who had <lb/>
recently found salvation. She sought more earnestly <lb/>
than ever, but found no peace until during the <reg orig="vaca-|tion">vacation</reg>, <lb/>
while visiting at Oakhampton, she opened her <lb/>
heart to a Miss Cooke&mdash;a lady who was about to <lb/>
become her mother-in-law. That lady saw that, <lb/>
though the girl was thoroughly in earnest&mdash;was <lb/>
ready to sacrifice even life, if necessary, for Christ's <lb/>
sake, and had faith in the sense of mere <hi rend="italic">belief</hi> of <lb/>
the truth&mdash;yet she had not faith in the sense of <lb/>
simple <hi rend="italic">trust</hi>. Hence she said to her: "Why <lb/>
can not you <hi rend="italic">trust</hi> yourself to your Savior at once? <lb/>
Supposing that now, at this moment, Christ were <lb/>
to come in the clouds of heaven, &hellip; could <lb/>
you not <hi rend="italic">trust</hi> him? Would not his call, his promise, <lb/>
be enough for you? Could you not commit your <lb/>
soul to him, to your Savior, Jesus?"</p>
<p>This was the word in season. The long-time <lb/>
disheartened girl grew breathless. Hope sent a <lb/>
bright ray into her heart as she responded, "I <hi rend="italic">could</hi>,
<pb n="147" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0153"/>
surely." And then hastening to her chamber she <lb/>
dropped upon her knees before the Lord, committed <lb/>
her soul to his keeping for eternity, and, as the <lb/>
persuasion arose within her, that he was faithful, <lb/>
and would keep what she intrusted to his keeping, <lb/>
"earth and heaven" grew bright from that moment. <lb/>
And she wrote of that crucial point in her life, "I <lb/>
did trust the Lord Jesus."</p>
<p>It is singular that with a mind so acute and <lb/>
bright, with so much religious instruction from truly <lb/>
pious parents, with habits of prayer and of Bible <lb/>
reading, with such deep spiritual convictions, and <lb/>
with such strenuous desire to be the Lord's disciple, <lb/>
this young lady should have groped so long and <lb/>
darkly after the faith by which all souls must enter <lb/>
into the rest promised by Jesus to all who come to <lb/>
him. Doubtless there was a lack of definiteness in <lb/>
all that had been taught her concerning faith, until <lb/>
Miss Cooke led her to see the difference between <lb/>
mere intellectual belief and heart trust. Yet her <lb/>
own stubborn refusal to be "talked to" about her <lb/>
personal relations to Christ must be accepted as the <lb/>
principal cause of her many days of darkness. But <lb/>
for that, her deceased mother, her truly devout <lb/>
father, or her pious elder sister, might, probably <lb/>
would, have given her the light imparted at last by <lb/>
<pb n="148" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0154"/>
Miss Cooke. Pride, self-will, and a secret recoil <lb/>
from the spiritual claims of the Gospel, no doubt <lb/>
entered into her reticence and stubbornness. When <lb/>
these dispositions were surrendered, light broke in <lb/>
upon her mind, and she received the faith by which <lb/>
she was to become a burning and a shining light.</p>
<p>The birth of the spiritual life did not check <lb/>
Miss Havergal's intellectual aspirations. It rather <lb/>
stimulated them by adding to the pleasures of <reg orig="acqui-|sition">acquisition</reg> <lb/>
the spur of moral motives. "I can not bear <lb/>
to be ignorant," she wrote. She thought "that <lb/>
earthly learning would not tempt her to forget <lb/>
heavenly things." There was no need of its doing <lb/>
so; but such was the enthusiasm with which she <lb/>
pursued her secular studies, first at a school near <lb/>
Worcester, and then at an institution in D&uuml;sseldorf, <lb/>
Germany, that they did not only tempt her to <reg orig="for-|get">forget</reg> <lb/>
the heavenly, but actually succeeded for a time <lb/>
in hindering her spiritual growth. "Day after <lb/>
day," she writes, "I grew more eager for my lessons, <lb/>
and less earnest in seeking Jesus." But this <reg orig="lessen-|ing">lessening</reg> <lb/>
of her zeal for Christ was only temporary. It <lb/>
checked but did not choke the divine life, which lived <lb/>
on, while she pursued her studies in French, in <reg orig="Ger-|man">German</reg>, <lb/>
in Italian, in general literature, in Greek, in <lb/>
Hebrew, and in music. In the D&uuml;sseldorf school, <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0155"/>
notwithstanding some attacks of illness, she stood first <lb/>
among one hundred and ten pupils. Her teachers <lb/>
there rightly enough regarded her as a remarkably <lb/>
gifted young lady, with a singular aptitude for <reg orig="ac-|quiring">acquiring</reg> <lb/>
languages, and an uncommon capacity for <lb/>
perceiving and enjoying the beauties of the best <lb/>
literature.</p>
<p>Her school life terminated in 1853, but not her <lb/>
pursuit of knowledge, which she loved, not for its <lb/>
own sake alone, but also because, as she wrote in <lb/>
1866, it "fitted her to do the Master's work." Her <lb/>
external life, spent for the next few years partly at <lb/>
home and partly as a private teacher in the family <lb/>
of one of her sisters, was by no means marked by <lb/>
stirring incidents. In fact, Miss Havergal's life <lb/>
interests the public, not because of its eventfulness, <lb/>
but because of its spirituality, earnestness in <reg orig="Chris-|tian">Christian</reg> <lb/>
work, and uncommon usefulness.</p>
<p>Looking, therefore, for the influences which tended <lb/>
to the development of her religious life, we find that <lb/>
she was greatly quickened, after her arrival home <lb/>
from D&uuml;sseldorf, by the solemnities of the cathedral <lb/>
services at her "confirmation." To very many, if <lb/>
not to most persons, this ritualistic and non-<reg orig="scrip-|tural">scriptural</reg> <lb/>
performance is little else than a lifeless form. <lb/>
In her case it was a very profitable ceremony. She <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0156"/>
entered into the inner meaning of its forms, and <lb/>
uttered the required vows, not with lips alone, but <lb/>
with her heart. As she knelt before the bishop she <lb/>
prayed, "My God, O my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> Father, thou blessed <lb/>
Jesus, my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> Savior, thou Holy Spirit, my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> <reg orig="Com-|forter">Comforter</reg>." <lb/>
When called on to promise fidelity to her <lb/>
baptismal vows, she said in her heart: "Lord, I can <lb/>
not, without thee, but O, with thy almighty help, <lb/>
I <hi rend="small-caps">Do</hi>!" And when in the final prayer it was asked <lb/>
that she "may continue thine forever," her heart <lb/>
swelled and thrilled with the thought, "<hi rend="italic">Thine <reg orig="for-|ever">forever</reg>!"</hi> <lb/>
And after returning home she wrote: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"O, thine forever! What a blessed thing</l>
<l rend="indent">To be forever his who died for me!</l>
<l>My Savior, all my life thy praise I'll sing,</l>
<l rend="indent">Nor cease my song throughout eternity."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>From this time her experience became a <reg orig="con-|stant">constant</reg> <lb/>
yearning after a perfect faith. Its key-notes <lb/>
were: "O, to be filled with joy and the Holy <lb/>
Ghost!" "O, why can not I trust him fully?" <lb/>
"O, that I could grow up in him!" These deep <lb/>
desires were no sickly and fitful sentimentalities, <lb/>
but the healthy longings of a truly devout mind. <lb/>
She fed these lofty aspirations, not with mystical <reg orig="fan-|cies">fancies</reg> <lb/>
or fanatical imaginations, but with holy <reg orig="Scrip-|ture">Scripture</reg> <lb/>
systematically read, constantly searched, and <lb/>
<pb n="151" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0157"/>
prayerfully accepted as words spoken to her by their <lb/>
divine Author. Speaking of her love of God's Word <lb/>
her sister writes:</p>
<p>"She knew the whole of the Gospels, Epistles, <lb/>
Revelation, the Psalms, and Isaiah. The minor <lb/>
prophets she learned in later years. At this time <lb/>
&lpar;1858&rpar; she was taking the titles of Christ for her <lb/>
daily searchings and remarks." And Frances <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>, <lb/>
speaking of her method of reading Scripture, <lb/>
says: "Yesterday I took Christ, our advocate. It <lb/>
is one of the sweet titles. I like to think about the <lb/>
Lord Jesus as he is in himself, not only in relation <lb/>
to myself."</p>
<p>Thus striving to use the Word as a revelation <lb/>
of Christ, her growth was steadfast, and her spiritual <lb/>
life soon grew into a perennial Spring. Writing of <lb/>
some particular experience at this time, she said: <lb/>
"I really then took a step onward. &hellip; The <lb/>
truth made me free. I lost that dreary bondage <lb/>
of doubt, and almost despair, that chained me <lb/>
for so many years. &hellip; Whereas, I could not <lb/>
see why I should be <hi rend="italic">saved</hi>, I now can not see why <lb/>
I should not be saved, if Christ died for all. On <lb/>
that word I take my stand, and <hi rend="italic">rest there</hi>. I still <lb/>
wait for the hour when he will reveal himself to <lb/>
me more directly; but it is the quiet waiting of <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0158"/>
present trust, not the restless waiting of anxiety and <lb/>
danger. <hi rend="italic">His death</hi> is really my confidence, and I <lb/>
have tasted the sweetness of one new thing&mdash;<hi rend="italic">praise!"</hi></p>
<p>Holding this Scriptural conception of faith, one <lb/>
might reasonably expect to find Frances abiding <lb/>
henceforth on the high table-lands of settled peace. <lb/>
Her letters, however, show that she was often driven <lb/>
into the gloomy valleys of doubt. Reasoning on the <lb/>
causes of these seasons of mental depression, she <lb/>
wrote: "I think the great root of all my trouble <lb/>
and alienation is, that I do not now make an <reg orig="un-|reserved">unreserved</reg> <lb/>
surrender of myself to God, and until this <lb/>
is done I shall know no peace. I have so much to <lb/>
regret, a greater dread of the opinion of worldly <lb/>
friends, a loving of the world, and proportionate <lb/>
cooling in heavenly desire and love."</p>
<p>Again she gives the result of her self-scrutiny <lb/>
in these expressive words: "I want to make the <lb/>
most of my life, and to do the best with it; but <lb/>
here I feel my desires and motives need much <reg orig="puri-|fying">purifying</reg>; <lb/>
for even where all would sound fair enough <lb/>
in words, an element of self, of lurking pride, may <lb/>
be detected. O, that He would indeed purify me, <lb/>
and make me white at any cost!"</p>
<p>Later on we find her saying: "It seems as if <lb/>
the Lord had led me into a calmer and more equable <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0159"/>
frame of mind; not joy, but peace. &hellip; Why <lb/>
should I not take for granted all I find in the <lb/>
Bible? &hellip; I have been so happy lately, and <lb/>
the words, 'Thou hast put gladness in my heart,' <lb/>
I can use as true of my own case, especially as to <lb/>
one point. I am <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> now &lpar;and I never was before&rpar; <lb/>
that I do love God. I love him distinctly, <reg orig="posi-|tively">positively</reg>, <lb/>
and I think I have loved him more and <lb/>
longer than I thought, only I dared not own it to <lb/>
myself. O, that I loved him more and more! <lb/>
How I abhor myself for having loved, for loving, <lb/>
so little."</p>
<p>Doubtless, while under these leadings of the <lb/>
Spirit, Miss Havergal had underrated her own faith <lb/>
and love. One cause of this was her highly <reg orig="devel-|oped">developed</reg> <lb/>
conscientiousness. Her standard of action and <lb/>
feeling was high. Things of which many Christians <lb/>
would take no note, she regarded as serious offenses. <lb/>
Hence we find her writing to a friend: "I said <lb/>
something yesterday, dear Elizabeth, which I much <lb/>
regret, though thoughtlessly and not intentionally <lb/>
uttered. I thought after that it seemed like an <lb/>
imputation upon <gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g1"/>; the faintest impression of <lb/>
which I would remove from your mind. Perhaps <lb/>
you did not notice it; but I did, and grieved that <lb/>
I said it."</p>
<pb n="154" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0160"/>
<p>Having such a keenly sensitive conscience, and <lb/>
a habit of constant introspection, joined to an <reg orig="emo-|tional">emotional</reg> <lb/>
nature, which for a long time led her to <lb/>
bring the question of her relation to God to the test <lb/>
of feeling, it is not surprising that this devout soul, <lb/>
whose spotless life was a daily self-denial, whose <lb/>
aspirations breathed after the highest, and whose <lb/>
bodily frame was fragile as a flower, and subject to <lb/>
frequent attacks of illness, should be often found <lb/>
in the valley of humiliation writing bitter things <lb/>
against herself. And it was not until she learned <lb/>
to keep her mental eye looking, not upon herself, <lb/>
but upon Jesus, that she escaped from her doubts. <lb/>
Then she wrote: "As soon as 'I' in any form comes <lb/>
in, there is a shadow upon the light. Still this <lb/>
shadow need not fall. When the eye is fixed upon <lb/>
Christ as the substitute, the lamb slain, then all is <lb/>
clear. But once introduce that 'I,' and you get <lb/>
bewildered between faith and feeling."</p>
<p>But to get that "I" from clouding the vision <lb/>
of faith, she learned at last that the "I" must be <lb/>
fully surrendered, inwardly as well as outwardly <lb/>
consecrated, to the absolute control of her Lord. <lb/>
Glimpses of this duty had been given her by the <lb/>
Holy Spirit for some time; but it was not until <lb/>
1873 that she clearly comprehended its breadth, its <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0161"/>
obligation, and its attainability through simple faith. <lb/>
A tractate, entitled "All for Jesus," was then sent <lb/>
her by a friend. It attracted her attention, because <lb/>
it pointed the way to a state of mind for which she <lb/>
was earnestly yearning, and toward which the Spirit <lb/>
was leading her. She thus described its effects <lb/>
upon her experience:</p>
<p>"I first saw clearly the blessedness of true <reg orig="con-|secration">consecration</reg>. <lb/>
I saw it as a flash of electric light; and <lb/>
what you <hi rend="italic">see</hi> you can never <hi rend="italic">unsee</hi>. There must be <lb/>
full surrender before there can be full blessedness. <lb/>
God admits you by the one into the other. He <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
showed me all this most clearly. &hellip; First, I <lb/>
was shown that 'the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, <lb/>
cleanseth us all from sin;' and then it was made <lb/>
plain to me that he who had thus cleansed me had <lb/>
power to keep me clean; so I just <hi rend="italic">utterly yielded</hi> <lb/>
myself to him, and <hi rend="italic">utterly trusted</hi> him to keep me."</p>
<p>Was ever the faith that opens the gate to the <lb/>
highest attainable purity on earth more simply, <lb/>
more beautifully defined? <hi rend="italic">Utterly yielding,</hi> and <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">utterly trusting</hi>&mdash;the whole being given to God, <lb/>
and an unquestioning trust that he would fulfill his <lb/>
promise! These are, indeed, the keys to the inner <lb/>
sanctuary of Christian saintliness. By them Miss <lb/>
Havergal passed out of the "sunless ravines," in <lb/>
<pb n="156" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0162"/>
which she had often walked with her harp unstrung, <lb/>
into the "highway of holiness," where, henceforth, <lb/>
says her sister, "her peace and joy flowed onward, <lb/>
deepening and widening under the teaching of God <lb/>
the Holy Ghost." And she herself declared, "The <lb/>
blessing she had received lifted her whole life into <lb/>
sunshine, of which all she had previously <reg orig="experi-|enced">experienced</reg> <lb/>
was but as pale and passing April gleams, <lb/>
compared with the fullness of Summer glory."</p>
<p>Of the genuineness of this high experience her <lb/>
subsequent life was a constant illustration. Her <lb/>
sister testifies that it shone conspicuously in "the <lb/>
unswerving obedience of her <hi rend="italic">home life,"</hi> which, as <lb/>
she well observes, "is the surest test of all." It <lb/>
was visible in her endurance of trials and losses, <lb/>
both great and small, which were no longer causes <lb/>
of worriment and vexed feelings. It was manifest in <lb/>
her humility of spirit, which, while rejoicing that she <lb/>
was "kept from falling, kept from sins, &hellip; by the <lb/>
power of God," confessed that "one instant of <reg orig="stand-|ing">standing</reg> <lb/>
alone" would involve "a certain fall" into sin; <lb/>
that God's "very keeping implies total helplessness <lb/>
without it, and the very cleansing most distinctly <lb/>
implies defilement without it."</p>
<p>An intense hatred of sin was another evidence <lb/>
of the genuineness of this blessed life. Sin had <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0163"/>
become to her an intolerable thing, against which <lb/>
she "watched like a sentinel when his captain is <lb/>
standing by him on the ramparts." And with all <lb/>
her frankness in writing and speaking to her friends <lb/>
of this new-born blessedness, she was too modest <lb/>
and too truthful to profess herself absolutely <reg orig="sin-|less">sinless</reg>. <lb/>
"Sinlessness," she said, "belongs only to <lb/>
Christ now, and to our glorified state in heaven." <lb/>
Hence she continued to pray, "Cleanse me <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="thor-|oughly">thoroughly</reg></hi> <lb/>
from my sin;" and pleaded to be shown any <lb/>
unknown depths of it which might have been <lb/>
hidden from her through lack of sufficient light. <lb/>
"Understand me," she wrote, "it is not as though <lb/>
I had already attained, either were already perfect, <lb/>
but I follow after, I press <hi rend="italic">toward</hi> the mark, for the <lb/>
prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."</p>
<p>In Miss Havergal's manner and spirit there <lb/>
appears to have been no real or affected austerity, <lb/>
no forbidding primness, no repulsive gloominess. <lb/>
On the contrary, "joyousness" was the characteristic <lb/>
of her spiritual life. She always had been <reg orig="remark-|ably">remarkably</reg> <lb/>
cheerful. She was so still. The abiding <reg orig="glad-|ness">gladness</reg> <lb/>
within had its expression in her face and action. <lb/>
Hence it was a common remark among her <reg orig="acquaint-|ances">acquaintances</reg>, <lb/>
"Frances looks so really happy, she must <lb/>
have something we have not." And her sister <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0164"/>
says that, "with the utmost skill, no artist or <reg orig="pho-|tograph">photograph</reg> <lb/>
gives a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> idea of her lighted-up <reg orig="ex-|pression">expression</reg>. <lb/>
Is it because soul can not be represented <lb/>
any more than a sunbeam? And my pen too fails <lb/>
in giving an idea to strangers of her sunny ways, <lb/>
merrily playing with children, and heartily enjoying <lb/>
all things. But her deep sympathy with others' joys <lb/>
and sorrows, and her loyal longings that all should <lb/>
know the joy unspeakable and full of glory, were <lb/>
the secret of her influence with others."</p>
<p>Another fruit of her exalted attainment was an <lb/>
increase in her zeal for Christ and human souls. <lb/>
She had been early trained by her devout father <lb/>
to love benevolent work. While yet at Worcester, <lb/>
she had been a worker for the poor. After her <lb/>
conversion she had done admirable work in her <lb/>
father's parish Sunday-school, at St. Nicholas. Two <lb/>
successive classes of boys, who had seemed <reg orig="incorri-|gible">incorrigible</reg>, <lb/>
had been intrusted to her care, and had been <lb/>
wonderfully benefited by her affectionate and <reg orig="faith-|ful">faithful</reg> <lb/>
teaching. Her rare musical gifts she had made <lb/>
to do good service, by "singing for Jesus," and <lb/>
composing hymns which were much sought after, <lb/>
and many of which have won a permanent place in <lb/>
sacred psalmody. Her "cards," and her writings for <lb/>
various periodicals had also been the fruitage of <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0165"/>
her Christian activity. In all these departments <lb/>
she had illustrated the activity of her faith. Her <lb/>
increased faith added fuel to the already steadfast <lb/>
flame of her zeal. Up to the extreme measure of <lb/>
her strength she now kept her facile pen employed, <lb/>
and the works she produced were very widely read. <lb/>
Perhaps, however, in nothing was the effect of her <lb/>
stronger faith more fully seen than in the increased <lb/>
effectiveness of her personal efforts to win souls. <lb/>
Her skill in this difficult sphere of action was <lb/>
singularly great. She was an adept in the art of <lb/>
speaking for Christ. She could do it in social <reg orig="meet-|ings">meetings</reg>, <lb/>
in parlor readings, and in conversation with <lb/>
individuals in such a manner that, though it might <lb/>
sometimes fail in making a conquest, yet it did not <lb/>
alienate the individual either from herself or from <lb/>
religion. She did it, too, when need required, under <lb/>
circumstances ordinarily considered unfavorable. <lb/>
At a large party, for example, when asked to sing, <lb/>
she selected a spiritual song, and rendered it with <lb/>
such deep feeling that it subdued the giddy throng <lb/>
into "dead silence." Writing of this incident, she <lb/>
adds:</p>
<p>"Afterwards I had two really important <reg orig="conver-|sations">conversations</reg> <lb/>
with strangers. One seemed extremely <reg orig="sur-|prised">surprised</reg> <lb/>
at finding himself quite easily drifted from <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0166"/>
the badinage with which he started, into a right <lb/>
down personal talk about <hi rend="italic">his</hi> personal danger and <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">his</hi> only hope for safety; he took it very well, and <lb/>
thanked me."</p>
<p>The secret of her effectiveness in such personal <lb/>
conversation is revealed, where she says: "Somehow <lb/>
it is wonderful how the Master manages for me in <lb/>
such cases. I do n't think any one can say that I <lb/>
force the subject; it just develops one thing out of <lb/>
another, quite naturally, till very soon they find <lb/>
themselves face to face with eternal things, and the <lb/>
Lord Jesus can be freely lifted up before them. I <lb/>
could not <hi rend="italic">contrive</hi> a conversation thus."</p>
<p>Of course she could not contrive, for there was <lb/>
no cant, nothing perfunctory, in her Christian work. <lb/>
Christ and his Gospel were to her living facts. <lb/>
She really lived in them and for him. It was, <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg>, <lb/>
as natural for her to speak of them as of the <lb/>
realities of her material life and surroundings. <reg orig="Per-|haps">Perhaps</reg> <lb/>
much of the influence of her numerous hymns <lb/>
and excellent books arises out of her strong sense of <lb/>
the reality of the things about which she wrote. But <lb/>
for this, some of her writings would impress one as <lb/>
the outflow of a woman's sentimentalism. They do, <lb/>
indeed, abound in sentiment, but it is not the <reg orig="shal-|low">shallow</reg> <lb/>
sentiment of empty feeling, but the expression <lb/>
<pb n="161" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0167"/>
of solid truth, impregnated with the genuine <reg orig="emo-|tion">emotion</reg> <lb/>
of a soul thoroughly possessed by it.</p>
<p>Miss Havergal's faith bore the test of many <lb/>
external trials, bereavements, sickness, and delicate <lb/>
health. She had been called to close the eyes of <lb/>
her beloved father in 1870. In 1874 she suffered <lb/>
long from typhus fever. In 1878 her "second <lb/>
mother" passed the mysterious river we call Death, <lb/>
and, as a consequence, the family home-nest was <lb/>
broken up, and she sought a quiet retreat with her <lb/>
sister Marie, in Wales, at a place named the <reg orig="Mum-|bles">Mumbles</reg>, <lb/>
in the town of Swansea. In 1879 her fragile <lb/>
body was attacked by a painful and mortal disease. <lb/>
Her sufferings were intense. When nearing her <lb/>
end, one of her physicians said to her, "Good-bye; <lb/>
I shall not see you again." Very composedly she <lb/>
asked him:</p>
<p>"Do you really think I am going?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the doctor.</p>
<p>"To-day?" she inquired.</p>
<p>"Probably," said he.</p>
<p>"Beautiful; too good to be true!" she <reg orig="ex-|claimed">exclaimed</reg>; <lb/>
and then, after a pause, she smiled and <lb/>
added, "Splendid! to be so near the gates of heaven."</p>
<p>In this glad frame of mind she awaited the final <lb/>
moment. Its coming was announced by terrible <lb/>
<pb n="162" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0168"/>
convulsions. When they ceased she nestled down <lb/>
in the pillows, folded her hands on her breast, and <lb/>
said, "There, now it is all over! Blessed rest!"</p>
<p>"And now," says her sister, "she looked up <lb/>
steadfastly, as if she saw the Lord, and surely <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg> <lb/>
less heavenly could have reflected such a <reg orig="glori-|ous">glorious</reg> <lb/>
radiance upon her face. For ten minutes we <lb/>
watched that almost visible meeting with her King, <lb/>
and her countenance was so glad, as if she were <lb/>
already talking to him. Then she tried to sing; <lb/>
but after one sweet high note, 'He&mdash;,' her voice <lb/>
failed, and, as her brother commended her soul into <lb/>
her Redeemer's hand, she passed away. &hellip; <lb/>
So <hi rend="italic">she</hi> took <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'The one grand step beyond the stars of God</l>
<l>Into the splendor, shadowless and broad,</l>
<l>Into the everlasting joy and light,</l>
<l rend="indent">The zenith of the earthly life was come.'"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Frances was in her prime when she finished her <lb/>
earthly work. Only forty-two years were permitted <lb/>
her in this preparatory school for the life which is <lb/>
to be lived, and the duties which are to be <reg orig="per-|formed">performed</reg> <lb/>
in the city of our God. But she had made <lb/>
those years fruitful, through the grace of Christ, in <lb/>
building her own character into beauty and strength, <lb/>
and in good works for the benefit of others. Her <lb/>
<pb n="163" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0169"/>
noble character is a precious legacy to the Church <lb/>
and the world. To young women it is especially <lb/>
valuable, as showing them that when a woman adds <lb/>
the adornments of elevated piety to the charm of <lb/>
her personal attraction and intellectual gifts, she not <lb/>
only attains the highest degree of possible human <lb/>
happiness for herself, but is also made instrumental <lb/>
of immeasurable good to others. Multitudes now <lb/>
call Miss Havergal blessed. Why? Because she <lb/>
was a gifted, cultivated lady, with winning manners? <lb/>
Nay, not for these endowments alone. Had she <lb/>
lived a selfish life, seeking her pleasure in dress, in <lb/>
amusements, in gay assemblies, in the delights of <lb/>
this life, to whom would her life have been a rich <lb/>
guerdon? Who would revere and cherish her <reg orig="mem-|ory">memory</reg> <lb/>
to-day? Not for her gifts, therefore, is she <lb/>
lovingly remembered by multitudes, but because <lb/>
those gifts were consecrated to Christ and to human <lb/>
good. Because she was a woman inspired by a <lb/>
faith founded on the Word of God; nourished by <lb/>
that Word made radiant by the divine illumination, <lb/>
she lives, and will live in the memory of coming <lb/>
generations, as a beautiful illustration of the power <lb/>
of piety to sanctify and enlarge the influence of <lb/>
woman. "Favor is deceitful and beauty is vain; but <lb/>
a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised."</p>

<q>"We do not hesitate to say that Mrs. Hemans is, beyond <lb/>

occasional verses that our literature has yet to boast of."</q>

</epigraph>
<figure id="f9" rend="block" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0170"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the above epitaph we have the verdict of the <lb/>
leading literary Review of our Fatherland some <lb/>
sixty years since, respecting the poems of Mrs. <lb/>
Hemans. This approving criticism found its <lb/>
echo on this side of the Atlantic in the <reg orig="unprece-|dented">unprecedented</reg> <lb/>
demand of American readers for her works. <lb/>
Professor Norton, of Cambridge, was so impressed <lb/>
with the beauty and sweetness of her poems, that <lb/>
he sent her a letter, with a book, by the hand of a <lb/>
friend, who accidentally dropped it on the sands of <lb/>
Illverstone, in England. The packet was picked <lb/>
up, badly injured by its wetting, taken to a little <lb/>
wayside inn, and placed near the fire to dry. There <lb/>
<pb n="165" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0171"/>
it was noticed by an intelligent gentleman, who, <lb/>
after deciphering its address, forwarded it to Mrs. <lb/>
Hemans. The letter contained a generous offer <lb/>
from the friendly and admiring professor to <reg orig="super-|intend">superintend</reg> <lb/>
the republication of her writings in this <lb/>
country. She gladly and gratefully accepted his <lb/>
proffered aid. The popularity of her poems led <lb/>
some distinguished Americans to become her <reg orig="corre-|spondents">correspondents</reg>. <lb/>
Among these was that devout lover of <lb/>
noble thought and pure morality, Dr. Channing. It <lb/>
also became fashionable for Americans traveling in <lb/>
England to call on Mrs. Hemans. Mr. Chorley, <lb/>
author of her "Memorials," says, perhaps with <lb/>
some exaggeration:</p>
<p>"I remember seeing a beautiful girl from New <lb/>
York much excited and awe-struck at the thought <lb/>
of being admitted to her presence. 'My friends at <lb/>
home,' she said, 'will think so much of me for <reg orig="hav-|ing">having</reg> <lb/>
seen Mrs. Hemans!'"</p>
<p>It may be because of a change in the taste of <lb/>
readers, or possibly because of the shoals of books <lb/>
and periodicals which inundate their tables, that the <lb/>
poems of Mrs. Hemans are now less generally read <lb/>
than in other days. This is to be regretted, <reg orig="espe-|cially">especially</reg> <lb/>
because it prevents many young ladies from <lb/>
becoming acquainted with a collection of poems <lb/>
<pb n="166" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0172"/>
most admirably fitted to refine their tastes, cultivate <lb/>
their love of the beautiful, and to guard them <lb/>
against their liability&mdash;or shall I say, tendency?&mdash; <lb/>
to permit sentiment to flow into sentimentality, <reg orig="un-|chastened">unchastened</reg> <lb/>
by the checks and balances of religious <lb/>
thought. Mrs. Hemans gives an example of her <lb/>
sentiment in her epigraph prefixed to "Constanza," <lb/>
one of the poems in her "Records of Woman," in <lb/>
which she expresses the feelings of a true wife, whose <lb/>
false husband had abandoned her without cause: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"Art thou, then, desolate?</l>
<l>Of friends, of hopes, forsaken? Come to me!</l>
<l>I am thine own. Have trusted hearts proved false?</l>
<l>Flatterers deceived thee? Wanderer, come to me!</l>
<l>Why didst thou ever leave me? Knowest thou all</l>
<l>I would have borne, and called it joy to bear,</l>
<l>For thy sake? Know'st thou that thy voice had power</l>
<l>To shake me with a thrill of happiness</l>
<l>By one kind tone&mdash;to fill mine eyes with tears</l>
<l>Of yearning love? And thou&mdash;O, thou didst throw</l>
<l>That crushed affection back upon my heart;</l>
<l>Yet come to me!&mdash;it died not."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>These lines were doubtless wrung from her own <lb/>
heart, as will appear in the course of the following <lb/>
sketch of her somewhat uneventful life.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hemans was the daughter of a Liverpool <lb/>
merchant named Browne. He was a native of <lb/>
<pb n="167" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0173"/>
Ireland. Her mother was of mingled Italian and <lb/>
German descent, some of her ancestors having been <lb/>
numbered among the doges of Venice. Felicia <lb/>
was born in Liverpool, September 25, 1793, but was <lb/>
taken to the town of Gwrych &lpar;pronounced Grieth&rpar;, <lb/>
in Wales, with her parents when she was less than <lb/>
seven years of age. There, in a lonely old mansion <lb/>
near the sea, shut in by a picturesque range of <lb/>
mountains, she passed the following nine years of <lb/>
her childhood, under the care of one of the best <lb/>
of mothers. If the reader can imagine an extremely <lb/>
beautiful, fairy-like child, with a brilliant <reg orig="complex-|ion">complexion</reg>, <lb/>
with a face that constantly changed its color <lb/>
with her swiftly-changing thoughts, and with a <lb/>
finely-formed head, covered with long, curling, <lb/>
golden hair, she will have before her mind an <lb/>
image of Felicia Dorothea Browne, as she was <lb/>
when little more than five years of age. A lady <lb/>
who saw her at this period in one of her sprightly <lb/>
moods, observed, "That child is not made for <reg orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg>, <lb/>
I know; her color comes and goes too fast."</p>
<p>This remark was not meant to imply that little <lb/>
Felicia's disposition was unhappy, but only that her <lb/>
exquisite sensibilities, indicated by her changing <lb/>
color, would cause her to suffer unusually from <lb/>
such troubles as might touch her life. In this <lb/>
<pb n="168" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0174"/>
sense, the woman's words were a prophecy. Felicia <lb/>
was quick to drink in delight from the beautiful <lb/>
and the good, but she was also quick to suffer keen <lb/>
pain when touched by the nettles of evil.</p>
<p>"Poets are born, not made," says the popular <lb/>
adage, and it was illustrated in Felicia's childhood. <lb/>
She revealed her poetic nature in the fantastic <lb/>
visions which filled her childish mind; in her <reg orig="pas-|sionate">passionate</reg> <lb/>
love for every grand and beautiful thing in <lb/>
nature; in her vague, romantic aspirations; in the <lb/>
pleasure she found in hearing, reading, and reciting <lb/>
fragments of poetry; and in that unrest of spirit <lb/>
which is born of the early struggles of genius to <lb/>
give expression to its as yet cloud-like perceptions.</p>
<p>She was also a precocious child, eager to acquire, <lb/>
quick to learn, and gifted with a remarkable <reg orig="mem-|ory">memory</reg>. <lb/>
"Why, Felice, you can not have read that," <lb/>
her teacher often said to her When she went to <lb/>
repeat her lesson. "O, yes! I have, and I will <lb/>
repeat it to you," was her prompt reply. And she <lb/>
always did, to the astonishment of her teacher, who <lb/>
thought her memory to be almost supernatural.</p>
<p>This gifted child owed much for both her mental <lb/>
and spiritual growth to her pious and devoted <lb/>
mother, whose love she returned with all the wealth <lb/>
of her deep filial affection. In her sonnet "To a <lb/>
<pb n="169" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0175"/>
Family Bible," she subsequently drew a picture of <lb/>
her mother's methods of training her, which is <reg orig="sur-|passingly">surpassingly</reg> <lb/>
tender and beautiful. Addressing the <lb/>
dear old Book, she says: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"What household thoughts around thee as their shrine</l>
<l rend="indent">Cling reverently! Of anxious looks beguiled</l>
<l>My mother's eyes, upon thy page divine,</l>
<l rend="indent">Each day were bent; her accents gravely mild,</l>
<l rend="indent">Breathed out thy love; whilst I, a dreamy child,</l>
<l>Wandered, on breeze-like fancies, far away,</l>
<l rend="indent">To some lone tuft of gleaming Spring-flowers wild&mdash;</l>
<l>Some fresh-discovered nook for woodland play;</l>
<l rend="indent">Some secret nest: yet would the solemn Word,</l>
<l rend="indent">At times with kindlings of young wonder heard,</l>
<l>Fall on my wakened spirit, there to be</l>
<l rend="indent">A seed not lost; for which, in darker years,</l>
<l rend="indent">O, Book of Heaven! I pour, with grateful tears,</l>
<l>Heart-blessings on the holy dead and thee!"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>The solitude of the home of her childhood, with <lb/>
the free life permitted her, contributed to the growth <lb/>
of her poetic instincts. She rambled at her own <lb/>
sweet will in mountain nooks, lowland dells, and <lb/>
along the ocean shore, fearing no danger. <reg orig="Tradi-|tion">Tradition</reg> <lb/>
said the ancient old mansion was haunted, and <lb/>
that a fiery goblin grayhound kept nightly watch at <lb/>
the end of the avenue leading from its doors. So <lb/>
fearless was she of being harmed that one moonlit <lb/>
night she crept from her chamber eager to catch a <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0176"/>
glimpse of the phantom dog. And it was one of <lb/>
her childish freaks, after being put snugly to bed <lb/>
by her nurse-maid, to steal from her bed to the <reg orig="sea-|shore">seashore</reg>, <lb/>
and indulge in the luxury of a bath. This <lb/>
half-wild freedom, this confiding familiarity with <lb/>
nature, together with her prematurely developed <lb/>
capacity to read and appreciate such books as <lb/>
Shakespeare's plays, and standard historic works, <lb/>
especially histories of Spain, in which land of <reg orig="ro-|mance">romance</reg> <lb/>
one of her brothers was serving in the British <lb/>
army under the great Wellington, furnished <reg orig="abun-|dant">abundant</reg> <lb/>
food for her fancy. Of systematic education <lb/>
she had little. She was never at school. Her <reg orig="prin-|cipal">principal</reg> <lb/>
instructor was a gentleman who gave her <reg orig="les-|sons">lessons</reg> <lb/>
in French, English grammar, and the rudiments <lb/>
of Latin. So delighted was this teacher with her <lb/>
intellectual power that he was wont to say:</p>
<p>"It is a pity she was not born a man, for then she <lb/>
might have borne away the highest honors of a <lb/>
college."</p>
<p>Twice during her girlhood Felicia was taken to <lb/>
London by her parents. Many things in that vast <lb/>
city impressed her susceptible mind, particularly a <lb/>
gallery of statuary, on entering which she exclaimed, <lb/>
"O, hush! do n't speak!" But amidst all the <lb/>
strange sights of the great metropolis, she longed for <lb/>
<pb n="171" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0177"/>
her home by the sea-side, and for the companionship of <lb/>
her younger brother and sister, in their favorite rural <lb/>
haunts in the woods, and in their rambles along <lb/>
the shore, where she could enjoy <lb/>
<q>"A sound and a gleam of the moaning sea."</q></p>
<p>Felicia's winning manners fascinated all who <lb/>
knew her. The old gardener at Gwrych used to <lb/>
say, "Miss Felicia can 'tice me to do whatsoever <lb/>
she pleases." A gentleman of the neighborhood was <lb/>
so warm in his praises of her character and genius <lb/>
that his sister said to him playfully, "Brother, you <lb/>
must be in love with that girl." To this he <lb/>
promptly replied, "If I were twenty years younger <lb/>
I would marry her!" It is not, therefore, a matter <lb/>
of surprise that when she was only fifteen years of <lb/>
age her friends persuaded her to print a volume <lb/>
of her poems, one, at least, of which she had <reg orig="writ-|ten">written</reg> <lb/>
when only nine years of age. It was published <lb/>
in quarto form. Her youth ought to have been her <lb/>
shield against the critic's dart. It was partly, but <lb/>
not wholly, so. One pitiless reviewer struck her <lb/>
work with so sharp a pen that her sensitive young <lb/>
soul suffered so keenly that, says Mr. Chorley, one <lb/>
of her biographers, "she was confined to her bed <lb/>
for several days." Nevertheless, though the gall <lb/>
of his pen was bitter, it proved to be a wholesome <lb/>
<pb n="172" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0178"/>
medicine, in that it stimulated her to study more <lb/>
deeply, and to meditate more patiently, before <reg orig="giv-|ing">giving</reg> <lb/>
her future poetic compositions to the world. <lb/>
Her second volume, published four years later, gave <lb/>
evidence both of the growth of her mind and of <lb/>
greater carefulness in weaving her thoughts into <lb/>
verse. And Mr. Chorley informs us that her <reg orig="ear-|liest">earliest</reg> <lb/>
volume was almost the only one "for the sake <lb/>
of which she had to taste the gall, as well as the <lb/>
honey of criticism."</p>
<p>About the time of the publication of her earliest <lb/>
poems, there came to the neighborhood of Gwrych <lb/>
a soldier whose person, manners, and education were <lb/>
such as to awaken the admiration of this susceptible <lb/>
and romantic girl. He was a captain in the British <lb/>
army. Felicia, says her sister, "was then only <reg orig="fif-|teen">fifteen</reg>; <lb/>
in the full glow of that radiant beauty which <lb/>
was destined to fade so early. The mantling bloom <lb/>
of her cheeks was shaded by a profusion of natural <lb/>
ringlets of a rich, golden brown; and the <reg orig="ever-|varying">ever-varying</reg> <lb/>
expression of her brilliant eyes gave a <lb/>
changeful play to her countenance, which made it <lb/>
impossible for any painter to do justice to it." To <lb/>
cite Wordsworth's graceful lines: <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"She was a phantom of delight,</l>
<l>When first she gleamed upon my sight;</l>
<pb n="173" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0179"/>
<l>A lovely apparition, sent</l>
<l>To be a moment's ornament</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>A dancing shape, an image gay,</l>
<l>To haunt, to startle, and waylay."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>That such a lovely, gifted girl should charm the <lb/>
eyes of a gay young soldier, was natural, as it also <lb/>
was that she, so artless, romantic, and full of <reg orig="enthusi-|asm">enthusiasm</reg> <lb/>
for the heroes of war, should be won to regard <lb/>
him with affection. Neither his friends nor hers <lb/>
favored their attachment. On both sides it was <lb/>
hoped that, as the captain was about to sail with his <lb/>
regiment to Spain, time and distance would dissolve <lb/>
the spell of their as yet unripened regard. They <lb/>
were mistaken. Spain was to Felicia the land of <lb/>
heroes, and when her lover went thither to fight in <lb/>
the land of the ancient Cid, her imagination <reg orig="trans-|formed">transformed</reg> <lb/>
him into a hero, to whom she freely <reg orig="surren-|dered">surrendered</reg> <lb/>
her heart. They did not meet again for <lb/>
three years, but when they did, in 1812, she became <lb/>
the soldier's bride.</p>
<p>During his absence, Felicia's family had removed <lb/>
from Gwrych to Bronwylfa, Flintshire. She had <lb/>
more society here than in the former place, but she <lb/>
gave herself with supreme devotion to study. To <lb/>
her knowledge of French and Italian, she now <lb/>
<pb n="174" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0180"/>
added the Spanish, Portuguese, and German. She <lb/>
astonished her friends, one day, by committing to <lb/>
memory the whole of Reginald Heber's poem of <lb/>
"Europe," containing four hundred and <reg orig="twenty-|four">twenty-four</reg> <lb/>
lines, in the almost incredibly short space of <lb/>
one hour and twenty minutes&mdash;a feat of memory <lb/>
which shows that the acquisition of languages must <lb/>
have been for her a by no means difficult task.</p>
<p>Her days at Bronwylfa appear to have been <lb/>
among the happiest of her life. Congenial society, <lb/>
added to the studies she loved, to the pleasures of <lb/>
poetical composition, and to the hope begotten of <lb/>
the love which nestled in her guileless spirit, made <lb/>
her life one long joy. And in 1812, as remarked <lb/>
above, she published her second volume, entitled <lb/>
"The Domestic Affections and Other Poems," gave <lb/>
her hand to Captain Hemans, and removed with <lb/>
him to Daventry, England, where they took up <lb/>
their residence, because he had been appointed <lb/>
adjutant to the Northamptonshire militia.</p>
<p>Her eldest son, Arthur, was born in Daventry, <lb/>
from which place she returned to her mother's <lb/>
home at Bronwylfa, at the close of a year. Her <lb/>
biographers shed no light on the character of her <lb/>
marital relations. One can not tell whether they <lb/>
were harmonious or discordant. On her part, she <lb/>
<pb n="175" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0181"/>
was still zealous in the pursuit of knowledge, and <lb/>
went very little into society. The captain, her <lb/>
husband, seems to have been somewhat broken in <lb/>
health. The hardships of Sir John Moore's famous <lb/>
retreat to Corunna, in Spain, in which he bore a <lb/>
part, and the still greater hardships he endured in <lb/>
an unfortunate British military expedition in <reg orig="Hol-|land">Holland</reg>, <lb/>
had proved too much for his constitution. Six <lb/>
years after his marriage, he therefore determined to <lb/>
try the effect of a softer climate. Mrs. Hemans <lb/>
thought that her literary pursuits, and the <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg> <lb/>
of their five sons, required her to remain with <lb/>
her beloved mother at Bronwylfa. Hence, in 1818, <lb/>
he went to Rome, not with any defined purpose of <lb/>
separating from her, and, though they corresponded, <lb/>
they never met again. Over the real causes which <lb/>
led to their divided lives, there hangs a cloud. The <lb/>
probability is, that their tastes and habits of thought <lb/>
not being wholly congenial, they gradually grew <lb/>
apart, and their ill-advised marriage ended in <reg orig="prac-|tical">practical</reg> <lb/>
separation. Nevertheless, if the lines prefixed <lb/>
to her poem entitled "Constanza," and cited above, <lb/>
were an expression of her feelings, it would appear <lb/>
that her affection for her husband, though sorely <lb/>
wounded, was never entirely quenched.</p>
<p>On the departure of her husband, Mrs. Hemans, <lb/>
<pb n="176" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0182"/>
instead of indulging in indolent sorrow, as a weaker <lb/>
woman might have done, threw the full force of <lb/>
her active mind into her literary work. In 1819 <lb/>
she published a poem on Wallace and Bruce, <lb/>
which won a prize for which a little army of writers <lb/>
had contested. The next year she published "The <lb/>
Sceptic," which was warmly praised by the <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="Edin-|burgh">Edinburgh</reg> <lb/>
Monthly Magazine,</hi> not for its poetic merits <lb/>
only, but especially for its freedom from every stain, <lb/>
and for the "breath of all moral beauty and <reg orig="love-|liness">loveliness</reg>" <lb/>
which animated it. The last lines of this <lb/>
truly beautiful composition indicate, not only a <reg orig="deep-|ening">deepening</reg> <lb/>
of her religious feelings, under her <reg orig="matri-|monial">matrimonial</reg> <lb/>
trials, but also of her maternal interest in <lb/>
the spiritual needs of her children. What but this <lb/>
could have inspired her pen when, writing of <lb/>
"Devotion's Voice" in cottage homes, she said: <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"There may the mother, as with anxious joy</l>
<l>To heaven her lessons consecrate her boy,</l>
<l>Teach his young accents still the immortal lays</l>
<l>Of Zion's bards in inspiration's days;</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And as, her soul all glistening in her eyes,</l>
<l>She bids the prayer of infancy arise,</l>
<l>Tell of His name who left His throne on high,</l>
<l>Earth's lowliest lot to bear and sanctify;</l>
<l>His love divine by keenest anguish tried,</l>
<l>And fondly say, "My child, for thee he died!"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<pb n="177" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0183"/>
<p>The growth of her genius, shown in the <reg orig="increas-|ing">increasing</reg> <lb/>
beauty and strength of her work, now began to <lb/>
attract the attention of distinguished men. Such <lb/>
notable personages as Dr. Luxmoore, bishop of St. <lb/>
Asaph, Reginald Heber, and, a little later, Sir <reg orig="Wal-|ter">Walter</reg> <lb/>
Scott, Henry Park, Esq., and Rev. Robert <reg orig="More-|head">Morehead</reg>, <lb/>
were led to seek her acquaintance and take an <lb/>
interest in her growing reputation. In 1821 the <lb/>
Royal Society of Literature, having offered a prize <lb/>
for the best poem on the subject of "Dartmoor," <lb/>
she entered the contest, and was awarded the prize. <lb/>
This success gratified her exceedingly, but chiefly <lb/>
because of the delight it awoke in her sons, one of <lb/>
whom, Arthur, being told the welcome news while <lb/>
working on his Latin exercise, sprang from his seat <lb/>
and exclaimed in high glee:</p>
<p>"Now I am sure mamma is a better poet than <lb/>
Lord Byron!"</p>
<p>Her son George gave vent to his joy in <reg orig="deafen-|ing">deafening</reg> <lb/>
acclamations, and finally said, "The excess of <lb/>
my pleasure has really given me a headache."</p>
<p>Thus she found the sweetest drop in the cup <lb/>
which Fame was bringing to her lips to be the <lb/>
happiness with which it swelled the heart of her <lb/>
fond mother and of her noble and beloved boys. <lb/>
And thus she illustrated in herself the truth of a <lb/>
<pb n="178" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0184"/>
remark she had often repeated, that "Fame can <lb/>
only afford <hi rend="italic">reflected</hi> delight to a woman." She <lb/>
loves it, not for itself, but because it adds to <lb/>
the happiness of the beings in whom she lives her <lb/>
own life.</p>
<p>In 1821, at the suggestion of Reginald Heber, <lb/>
she wrote a dramatic poem entitled "The Vespers of <lb/>
Palermo." She had no intention when composing it <lb/>
to offer it for performance in a theater, but some of <lb/>
her admirers urged her to let this beautiful piece <lb/>
of dramatic work try its fortunes on the stage. <lb/>
She consented, and after manifold vexations and <lb/>
delays it was produced in Covent Garden, London, <lb/>
under the direction of Mr. C. Kemble. It failed <lb/>
to please the corrupt fancies of an audience unused <lb/>
to such pure, high-toned thoughts as gave it <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg>, <lb/>
though its failure was attributed by Kemble <lb/>
and others to the actress who personated Constance, <lb/>
its principal female character, which was so much <lb/>
above her own she could not fairly represent it. It <lb/>
was subsequently acted in Edinburgh with marked <lb/>
success, under the auspices of Sir Walter Scott and <lb/>
Joanna Baillie, with Mrs. Siddons as Constance. <lb/>
But it did not secure a permanent place among <lb/>
plays acceptable to the theater-going public. Mrs. <lb/>
Hemans did not regret this, for as she became <lb/>
<pb n="179" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0185"/>
better acquainted with the character and influence <lb/>
of the theater she lost what little sympathy she had <lb/>
at first with the acted drama. The truth is, that the <lb/>
theater is too incurably corrupt ever to tolerate such <lb/>
lofty-toned dramas as "The Vespers of Palermo;" <lb/>
or as the plays of Joanna Baillie and Hannah More, <lb/>
which were written for the avowed purpose of <reg orig="test-|ing">testing</reg> <lb/>
the possibility of reforming the stage. And <lb/>
within the current year the present proprietor of <lb/>
Covent Garden Theater, London, in a review <reg orig="ar-|ticle">article</reg>, <lb/>
oonfesses that after making an experiment <lb/>
running through several years, he can not satisfy <lb/>
his audiences even with the "legitimate drama;" <lb/>
that is, standard plays like Shakespeare, etc., but <lb/>

that they will have spectacular plays, including the <lb/>
disgusting ballet dancers, or withhold their <reg orig="patron-|age">patronage</reg>. <lb/>
Surely the theater is not a fitting institution <lb/>
for a Christian lady to approve even by writing for <lb/>
its benefit, much less is it fit for her to frequent. <lb/>
It is one of "the unfruitful works of darkness."</p>
<p>In 1825 Mrs. Hemans removed with her mother <lb/>
from Bronwylfa to Rhyllon, an adjacent property. <lb/>
Here she spent one of the happiest years of her <lb/>
life. It was most beautifully situated, and had just <lb/>
beyond its sloping lawn a woodland dell in which <lb/>
she was wont to sit and read in the soft afternoons <lb/>
<pb n="180" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0186"/>
of Summer. This romantic spot she described with <lb/>
picturesque effect in the following lines found in <lb/>
her "Hour of Romance."</p>
<lg type="group">
<l>"There were thick leaves above me and around,</l>
<l rend="indent">And low, sweet sighs, like those of childhood's sleep,</l>
<l>Amidst their dimness, and a fit'ul sound</l>
<l rend="indent">As of soft showers on water. Dark and deep</l>
<l>Lay the oak shadows o'er the turf&mdash;so still,</l>
<l rend="indent">They seemed but pictured gloomy; a hidden rill</l>
<l>Made music&mdash;such as haunts us in a dream&mdash;</l>
<l rend="indent">Under the fern tufts; and a tender gleam</l>
<l>Of soft green light, as by the glow-worm shed,</l>
<l rend="indent">Came pouring through the woven beech-boughs down."</l>
</lg>
<p>But these months of peaceful brightness and <lb/>
cheerful activity spent with her happy boys and her <lb/>
thoughtful, loving mother, proved to be the <reg orig="pre-|cursors">precursors</reg> <lb/>
of months of gloom and sorrow. In 1826 <lb/>
death made the hearth-stone of her eldest brother <lb/>
"lonely and deserted." The angel of affliction <lb/>
then took up his abode at Rhyllon, and her mother, <lb/>
whose long years of superintending, sympathetic <lb/>
care had deluded them into the fancy that for her <lb/>
the earth "contained no tomb," was laid on a bed <lb/>
of mortal sickness. Through eight weary months <lb/>
of suffering that best of mothers gradually lost her <lb/>
hold on life, and then her "kind eyes were sealed <lb/>
forever" by the gentle hand of the death-angel. <lb/>
<pb n="181" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0187"/>
The feelings of Mrs. Hemans in that sad hour can <lb/>
not be better told than in the following touching <lb/>
hymn which she composed at the bedside of her <lb/>
dying mother:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"Father! that in the olive shade</l>
<l rend="indent">When the dark hour came on,</l>
<l>Did'st with a breath of heavenly aid,</l>
<l rend="indent">Strengthen thy Son;</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>O! by the anguish of that night,</l>
<l rend="indent">Send us down blest relief;</l>
<l>Or to the chastened, let thy might</l>
<l rend="indent">Hallow this grief!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And thou, that when the starry sky</l>
<l rend="indent">Saw the dread strife begun,</l>
<l>Did'st teach adoring faith to cry,</l>
<l rend="indent">'Thy will be done,'</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>By thy meek spirit, thou, of all</l>
<l rend="indent">That e'er have mourned the chief&mdash;</l>
<l>Thou Savior! if the stroke <hi rend="italic">must</hi> fall,</l>
<l rend="indent">Hallow this grief."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>The effect of the religious training given her <lb/>
children by Mrs. Hemans was beautifully illustrated <lb/>
in the hour of her mother's death. Wearied with <lb/>
grief and watching, she left the chamber of death <lb/>
and went down stairs to the room where her <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg> <lb/>
were sitting silent and awe-stricken around the <lb/>
<pb n="182" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0188"/>
fire. Her face wore such a sad expression that it <lb/>
moved them to pity, and her little boy, George, <lb/>
said to her with childish tenderness:</p>
<p>"Please, mamma, let me read you a chapter in <lb/>
the Bible; I am sure it will do you good."</p>
<p>The child thought rightly. The words of God <lb/>
did prove to be balm to her wounded heart, and <lb/>
the faith of her boy in the healing power of those <lb/>
divine words added not a little to her consolation <lb/>
in that hour of sorrow.</p>
<p>In the death of her mother Mrs. Hemans lost <lb/>
her chief earthly stay. Her father had died <reg orig="sev-|eral">several</reg> <lb/>
years earlier. Her husband, except in name, <lb/>
was as a stranger to her. Her mother's thoughtful <lb/>
care had hitherto relieved her of household <reg orig="respon-|sibilities">responsibilities</reg>. <lb/>
Henceforth the burden of her family <lb/>
must rest upon her own shoulders. It was a prime <lb/>
necessity also that her literary work should be <reg orig="pros-|ecuted">prosecuted</reg> <lb/>
with unremitting vigor. Her health, which <lb/>
had been quite delicate for several years, was <reg orig="inad-|equate">inadequate</reg> <lb/>
to the strain now put upon it. Painful <lb/>
symptoms of disease, with depressions of spirit, <lb/>
amounting at times to fits of melancholy, gave her <lb/>
occasional intimations that her life henceforth must, <lb/>
in part at least, be that of an invalid. It is not, <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg>, <lb/>
surprising that she wrote of herself to a friend:</p>
<pb n="183" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0189"/>
<p>"My spirits are as variable as the lights and <lb/>
shadows now flitting with the wind over the high <lb/>
grass, and sometimes the tears gush into my eyes, <lb/>
when I can scarcely define the cause. &hellip; I am <lb/>
a strange being, I think. I put myself in mind of <lb/>
an Irish melody, with its quick and wild transitions <lb/>
from sadness to gayety."</p>
<p>But she had yet eight years to live, during <lb/>
which, said her sister, "she was to be a stranger to <lb/>
any thing like an equal flow of quiet, steadfast <lb/>
happiness. Fugitive enjoyments; entrancing <reg orig="ex-|citements">excitements</reg>; <lb/>
adulation the most intoxicating; society <lb/>
the most brilliant&mdash;all these, and more than these, <lb/>
were hers in after years; but the old home feeling <lb/>
of shelter and security was gone forever, 'removed <lb/>
like a shepherd's tent.'"</p>
<p>But notwithstanding these oppressive afflictions, <lb/>
her courage still nerved her to obey the impulses <lb/>
of her genius, and to complete her most popular <lb/>
work, "The Records of Women," which was <reg orig="pub-|lished">published</reg> <lb/>
in 1828. "I have put my heart and <reg orig="indi-|vidual">individual</reg> <lb/>
feelings into this volume more than in any <lb/>
thing else I have written," she wrote to a friend. <lb/>
And there is the inspiration of a heart exquisitely <lb/>
tender and affectionate in the poems of which it <lb/>
is composed. Take, for example, the following <lb/>
<pb n="184" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0190"/>
extract from the "Bride of the Greek Isle." In her <lb/>
farewell to the home of her girlhood, the bride is <lb/>
made to say to her sister: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"I leave thee, sister! We have played</l>
<l rend="indent">Through many a joyous hour,</l>
<l>When the silvery green of the olive shade</l>
<l rend="indent">Hung dim over fount and bower.</l>
<l>Yes, thou and I, by stream, by shore,</l>
<l rend="indent">In song, in prayer, in sleep,</l>
<l>Have been as we may be no more&mdash;</l>
<l rend="indent">Kind sister, let me weep!"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Then to her mother the Greek bride says: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Mother! I leave thee! On thy breast,</l>
<l rend="indent">Pouring out joy and woe,</l>
<l>I have found that holy place of rest</l>
<l rend="indent">Still changeless! Yet I go.</l>
<l>Lips that have lulled me with your strain,</l>
<l rend="indent">Eyes that have watched my sleep!</l>
<l>Will earth give love like <hi rend="italic">yours</hi> again?</l>
<l rend="indent">Sweet mother; let me weep."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>The bride is then described as turning to her <lb/>
husband in these touchingly beautiful lines: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"And like a slight young tree, that throws</l>
<l>The weight of rain from its drooping boughs,</l>
<l>Once more she wept. But a changeful thing</l>
<l>Is the human heart, as a mountain spring</l>
<l>That works its way through the torrent's foam</l>
<l>To the bright pool near it, the lily's home!</l>
<pb n="185" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0191"/>
<l>It is well! the cloud on her soul that lay</l>
<l>Hath melted in glittering drops away.</l>
<l>Wake again; mingle sweet flute and lyre!</l>
<l>She turns to her lover. She leaves her sire.</l>
<l>Mother! on earth it must be so:</l>
<l>Thou rearest the lovely to see them go."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Shortly after the publication of "The Records of <lb/>
Women," Mrs. Hemans, partly on account of her <reg orig="sis-|ter's">sister's</reg> <lb/>
marriage and removal from Rhyllon, and partly <lb/>
because she wished to be nearer educational facilities <lb/>
for her sons, left Wales and fixed her residence at <lb/>
Wavertree, near Liverpool. This change of abode, <lb/>
with her growing popularity, brought her into <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg> <lb/>
communication with many minds eminent in <lb/>
the literary world. Her fame spread; her <reg orig="corre-|spondents">correspondents</reg> <lb/>
multiplied; society opened its doors to <lb/>
her; invitations to visit the seats of distinguished <lb/>
persons were given her. Accepting one of these, she <lb/>
went to Scotland, where she met Sir Walter Scott, who <lb/>
treated her with distinguishing attention. He <reg orig="in-|vited">invited</reg> <lb/>
her to visit him at Abbotsford, which she <lb/>
did, to her very great satisfaction and delight. In <lb/>
bidding her farewell when she left, he said to her:</p>
<p>"There are some whom we meet, and should <lb/>
like ever after to claim as kith and kin; and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are <lb/>
one of these." In writing of this visit to a friend, <lb/>
<pb n="186" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0192"/>
she said: "It is delightful to take away with me <lb/>
so unmingled an impression of what I may now <lb/>
call almost affectionate admiration." Nor was Sir <lb/>
Walter the only noted personage in Scotland who <lb/>
treated her with such affectionate respect, for when <lb/>
she went to Edinburgh its most distinguished <reg orig="peo-|ple">people</reg> <lb/>
showered upon her similar tokens of their regard.</p>
<p>On her return from Scotland, she wrought on <lb/>
her "Songs of the Affections," published in 1830. <lb/>
In June of this year she visited the lakes of <reg orig="West-|moreland">Westmoreland</reg>, <lb/>
where she gained strength for her <reg orig="en-|feebled">enfeebled</reg> <lb/>
body from its health-giving climate, and <lb/>
enjoyment for her mind from her intercourse with <lb/>
the patriarchal Wordsworth, who, she said, "treated <lb/>
me with so much consideration, gentleness, and care."</p>
<p>Wavertree was not favorable to the health of <lb/>
Mrs. Hemans. She also felt the need of some near <lb/>
relative to protect and advise her with respect both <lb/>
to her domestic affairs and the education of her <lb/>
sons. Her brother was filling a position of high <lb/>
responsibility in Ireland, and was anxious to do all <lb/>
that fraternal love could suggest to promote her <lb/>
welfare. Hence, in 1831, she bade farewell to <lb/>
Wavertree and to England, and established herself <lb/>
in the city of Dublin. Here she found ample <reg orig="op-|portunities">opportunities</reg> <lb/>
for the education of her boys, <reg orig="introduc-|tion">introduction</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="187" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0193"/>
to the best society of the place, and in a very <lb/>
short time the warm friendship of Archbishop <lb/>
Whately, his amiable wife, and a number of other <lb/>
refined, congenial spirits. Mrs. Hemans had so <lb/>
many attractive qualities, that she never failed to <lb/>
win the strongest regard of every cultivated, serious <lb/>
mind to whose society she was introduced. <reg orig="Affec-|tionate">Affectionate</reg> <lb/>
herself, she readily gained the affectionate <lb/>
admiration of kindred spirits.</p>
<p>The climate of Ireland was favorable for a short <lb/>
time to her health, which, however, after a few <lb/>
months, again became seriously impaired. The <lb/>
burdens of life had been too heavy for her delicate <lb/>
constitution. The grief caused by her husband's <lb/>
alienation and the death of her mother had slowly <lb/>
but surely dried up the sources of her energy. She <lb/>
had been stimulated to overtask both her physical <lb/>
and mental powers by the pecuniary necessities of <lb/>
her situation, having too often forced herself to work <lb/>
on her poems when nature required her to rest. <lb/>
She was now called on to pay the cost of all this <lb/>
in nervous prostrations and in painful weaknesses, <lb/>
which led her to write, "It is with me as if I felt, <lb/>
and more particularly heard, every thing with <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="un-|sheathed">unsheathed</reg></hi> <lb/>
nerves. There is this line in Coleridge: <lb/>
<q>'O! for a sleep for sleep itself to rest in!'</q>
<pb n="188" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0194"/>
I believe I shall require some such quintessence of <lb/>
repose to restore me."</p>
<p>She was favored, however, at times with <reg orig="tem-|porary">temporary</reg> <lb/>
returns of her former vigor, sufficient to <lb/>
allow of excursions to visit some of the most <reg orig="charm-|ing">charming</reg> <lb/>
scenery of Ireland. She was able also in 1834 <lb/>
to superintend the publication of her "Hymns for <lb/>
Childhood" &lpar;which had appeared in America in <lb/>
1827, but not in England&rpar;, of "The National <lb/>
Lyrics" in a collected form, and of "Scenes and <lb/>
Hymns of Life." This latter volume a friendly <lb/>
critic in the <hi rend="italic">Atheneum</hi> pronounced "her best work" <lb/>
and the opening of "a noble path." After reading <lb/>
this last remark she wrote: "My heart is growing <lb/>
faint. Shall I have power given me to tread that <lb/>
way much farther?"</p>
<p>This misgiving of her heart was prophetic. <lb/>
Her life-work was almost finished. Yet her active <lb/>
mind was still busy with literary projects which <lb/>
were never fulfilled. An attack of scarlet fever, <lb/>
which seized her when away from home, greatly <lb/>
reduced her strength. Next came the wasting <reg orig="de-|cay">decay</reg> <lb/>
of a malarial fever, then dropsy, followed by <lb/>
that gradual decay of her physical powers which is <lb/>
often nature's preparation for the coming of the <lb/>
death-angel.</p>
<pb n="189" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0195"/>
<p>In this exhausted state she was not uncomforted. <lb/>
She often said to Anna Creer, her faithful attendant, <lb/>
"I feel like a tired child&mdash;wearied and longing to <lb/>
be with the pure in heart."</p>
<p>At another time she said: "I feel as if I were <lb/>
sitting with Mary at the feet of my Redeemer, <lb/>
hearing the music of his voice and learning of him <lb/>
to be meek and lowly. &hellip; I am like a quiet <lb/>
babe at his feet, and yet my spirit is full of his <lb/>
strength. When any body speaks of his love to me, <lb/>
I feel as if he was too slow; my spirit can mount <lb/>
alone with him into those blissful realms with far <lb/>
greater rapidity!"</p>
<p>The poetic spirit and power remained with her <lb/>
to the last, as she showed when a Sabbath or two <lb/>
before she "fell asleep," she dictated this Sabbath <lb/>
sonnet: <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"How many blessed groups this hour are bending,</l>
<l rend="indent">Through England's primrose meadow-paths, their way</l>
<l>Toward spire and tower, 'midst shadowy elms ascending,</l>
<l rend="indent">Whence the sweet chimes proclaim the hallowed day!</l>
<l rend="indent">The halls, from old heroic ages gray,</l>
<l>Pour their fair children forth; and hamlets low,</l>
<l rend="indent">With whose thick orchard blooms the soft winds play,</l>
<l>Send out their inmates in a happy flow,</l>
<l rend="indent">Like a freed vernal stream; I may not tread</l>
<l rend="indent">With them those pathways&mdash;to the feverish bed</l>
<pb n="190" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0196"/>
<l>Of sickness bound. Yet O, my God! I bless</l>
<l rend="indent">Thy mercy, that with Sabbath peace hath filled</l>
<l rend="indent">My chastened heart, and all its throbbings stilled</l>
<l>To one deep calm of lowliest thankfulness."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>In this deep calm of a heart resting in the arms <lb/>
of the Father's everlasting love, our sweet singer, on <lb/>
the 16th of May, 1835, passed painlessly from the <lb/>
troubled life of earth to that life which is <reg orig="everlast-|ing">everlasting</reg> <lb/>
love and perfect rest.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hemans can not be ranked with poets of <lb/>
the highest class, but she stands among the first of <lb/>
England's minor poets. Her poetry is what Miss <lb/>
Jewsbury said Mrs. Hemans was in her <reg orig="woman-|hood">womanhood</reg>, <lb/>
"exquisitely feminine." It is not abstractly <reg orig="in-|tellectual">intellectual</reg>, <lb/>
neither is it superficial. Its characteristic <lb/>
is the beautiful in history, scenery, character, and <lb/>
religion. It is, as Jeffrey said of it, "singularly <lb/>
sweet, elegant, and tender&mdash;touching, perhaps, and <lb/>
contemplative, rather than vehement and <reg orig="overpow-|ering">overpowering</reg>." <lb/>
It is, in brief, just such poetry as young <lb/>
ladies need to study, not for its pure thoughts alone, <lb/>
but also for its fitness to form the taste, furnish the <lb/>
imagination with images of the beautiful, fill the <lb/>
mind with lofty sentiments afford them innocent <lb/>
pleasure, and to kindle affection for "the right, the <lb/>
beautiful, and the true."</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">One</hi> November evening in 1837 there was <lb/>
not a little stir among the quiet citizens of <lb/>
the ancient village of Hingham, <reg orig="Massachu-|setts">Massachusetts</reg>, <lb/>
because of a lecture to be given by a <lb/>
lady in the Unitarian Church, of which Mr. Brooks <lb/>
was then the pastor. The reputation of the <reg orig="lec-|turer">lecturer</reg>, <lb/>
the novelty of a public address to a mixed <lb/>
audience from the lips of a woman, the exciting <lb/>
topic&mdash;slavery&mdash;had raised the feelings of the <reg orig="in-|habitants">inhabitants</reg> <lb/>
to fever heat. The friends and foes of <lb/>
the anti-slavery movement were alike moved by <lb/>
curiosity to hear a woman speaker, and despite the <lb/>
prejudice of many against the cause, and of most <lb/>
<pb n="192" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0198"/>
against what then appeared to be an unseemly <lb/>
thing for a lady to attempt, the spacious edifice <lb/>
was crowded at the appointed hour. Probably a <lb/>
large majority of that audience was predisposed to <lb/>
judge the expected orator unfavorably.</p>
<p>But that predisposition was wonderfully modified <lb/>
by the lady's appearance even before she uttered a <lb/>
word. Her tall, graceful figure, clad in <reg orig="Quaker-|like">Quaker-like</reg> <lb/>
garments, her dignified though modest bearing, <lb/>
her finely formed head, sharply chiseled features, <lb/>
beautiful complexion, and clear blue eyes at once <lb/>
disarmed many minds of resentful prejudice. And <lb/>
when she began to speak, her faultless modesty of <lb/>
manner, her intense feeling, her evident mastery of <lb/>
her theme, her intellectual strength, her grand <lb/>
appeals, and at times her almost Websterian <reg orig="elo-|quence">eloquence</reg>, <lb/>
captured, if not the convictions, yet the <lb/>
sympathies of her audience. When <hi rend="small-caps">Miss Angelina <lb/>
Grimk&eacute;</hi>, for that was her name, sank back at the <lb/>
close of her oration, for such it was, exhausted <lb/>
by her effort, upon the sofa on the pulpit platform, <lb/>
she had not only won a goodly number to the cause <lb/>
she advocated, but had also dissolved the prejudices <lb/>
of many against the fitness of, at least, some women <lb/>
to speak in public. "If," said one of her hearers <lb/>
that evening, "every woman were as accomplished, <lb/>
<pb n="193" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0199"/>
and as qualified in mind and manners as Angelina <lb/>
Grimk&eacute;, I should not object to her public advocacy <lb/>
of such questions as the moral aspects of slavery; <lb/>
but then, there are very few women who have her <lb/>
qualifications for such work." And this probably <lb/>
expressed the opinion of the majority present at her <lb/>
lecture, on the still "vexed question" of woman's <lb/>
relation to public speaking.</p>
<p>Nearly fifty years have passed since Miss <reg orig="An-|gelina">Angelina</reg> <lb/>
gave that lecture in Hingham. At that time <lb/>
her name, with that of her elder sister, Sarah, was <lb/>
a household word, especially in the Northern States. <lb/>
It is but little known to the young ladies of to-day, <lb/>
albeit a biography of both sisters has recently been <lb/>
given to the public.<ref target="n3" n="1">*</ref>

first American Women Advocates of Abolition and Woman's <lb/>
Rights." By Catherine O. Birney. The writer is indebted <lb/>
to this very entertaining volume for much of his materials <lb/>
for this sketch.</p></note>
 The lives of these <reg orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
women have lessons for the young women of <lb/>
to-day, and for this reason the writer presents this <lb/>
brief sketch of their careers and characters.</p>
<p>The Grimk&eacute; sisters were natives of Charleston, <lb/>
South Carolina. Their father was the Hon. John <lb/>
F. Grimk&eacute;, who came of good Huguenot stock, and <lb/>
was a judge of the Supreme Court of South <reg orig="Caro-|lina">Carolina</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="194" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0200"/>
Their mother could claim a highly <reg orig="respect-|able">respectable</reg> <lb/>
Puritan ancestry. Fourteen sons and daughters <lb/>
were born to them, of whom Sarah was the sixth, <lb/>
and Angelina the youngest. They were High <lb/>
Church Episcopalians. Their home was an abode <lb/>
of wealth and luxury; their social relations were <lb/>
of the most aristocratic type, and their numerous <lb/>
children were reared in the prevailing habits of <lb/>
what was regarded as the best society in Charleston. <lb/>
The sons were educated for professional life, but <lb/>
following the prevailing customs, the daughters <lb/>
were not taught solid learning, but only those <reg orig="orna-|mental">ornamental</reg> <lb/>
branches which were requisite to their <reg orig="rep-|utation">reputation</reg> <lb/>
in society as accomplished and fashionable <lb/>
women. There certainly was nothing, either in <lb/>
their education or surroundings, to beget in them <lb/>
that spirit of self-sacrificing philanthrophy which was <lb/>
the distinguishing feature of their womanhood. <lb/>
Least of all was there any thing to suggest their <lb/>
future emnity to the peculiar institution, inasmuch <lb/>
as their father was a slaveholder, they were served <lb/>
by slaves from their earliest infancy, and were never <lb/>
taught to think there was any taint of sin in <reg orig="claim-|ing">claiming</reg> <lb/>
and using human beings as property, or, to <lb/>
cite the words of South Carolina law, as "chattels <lb/>
personal."</p>
<pb n="195" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0201"/>
<p>Their Huguenot and Puritan blood, however, <lb/>
revealed itself in their early tendency to think and <lb/>
decide for themselves, in their keen sense of natural <lb/>
justice, in their courageous love of truth, and in <lb/>
their tender sympathies with the oppressed. Sarah <lb/>
exhibited her independence by protesting against <lb/>
the superficial studies assigned her, and begging <lb/>
permission to study the classics and the law as her <lb/>
brothers did. But custom forbade this, and she <lb/>
was forced to be content with such instructions <lb/>
as were usually given young ladies of fashion. But <lb/>
neither their imperfect education, nor corrupt <reg orig="pub-|lic">public</reg> <lb/>
opinion, could prevent the revolt of their tender <lb/>
feelings against the punishments commonly inflicted <lb/>
upon slaves, and also against the utter ignorance in <lb/>
which those poor creatures were designedly reared.</p>
<p>Catherine Birney tells us that Sarah, when only <lb/>
five years old, after seeing a slave woman cruelly <lb/>
whipped, sobbed as if heart-broken, and then ran <lb/>
from her nurse to the wharf and begged the <reg orig="cap-|tain">captain</reg> <lb/>
of a vessel to take her from a city in which the <lb/>
whipping of women was permitted. The same <reg orig="ten-|derness">tenderness</reg> <lb/>
of heart was shown by Angelina, who, on <lb/>
one occasion, stole out to the slave quarters with a <lb/>
bottle of oil with which to soothe the wounds of <lb/>
one of her father's slaves who had been whipped <lb/>
<pb n="196" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0202"/>
that day. Thus the natural tenderness of both <lb/>
girls caused them to hate slavery long before <lb/>
their moral judgments had taught them the <reg orig="sinful-|ness">sinfulness</reg> <lb/>
of slaveholding. It was the germ of their <lb/>
subsequent devotion to the cause of human freedom.</p>
<p>Never, perhaps, were two sisters more closely <lb/>
bound to each other by sympathy and affection <lb/>
than were these Grimk&eacute; sisters. Their strong and <lb/>
life-long sisterly love had its origin in somewhat <lb/>
exceptional circumstances. Sarah was twelve years <lb/>
old when Angelina was born. The presence of her <lb/>
baby-sister begot in her girlish heart a tenderness <lb/>
akin to that of a mother for her child. She begged <lb/>
to be permitted to stand at the baptismal font as <lb/>
godmother to the infant. This strange request, <lb/>
after many refusals, was finally granted, and this <lb/>
girl of twelve gave the promise required by the <lb/>
Episcopalian ritual, to train her infant sister in the <lb/>
ways of Christian duty. This promise, usually <lb/>
made without serious thought or purpose, had so <lb/>
much meaning for the juvenile godmother, that she <lb/>
carried it to God, with tears and prayers, asking <reg orig="fit-|ness">fitness</reg> <lb/>
for the duty she had engaged to perform. Years <lb/>
after she wrote of her feelings at the time, saying: <lb/>
"O, how good I resolved to be, how careful in all <lb/>
my conduct, that my life might be blessed to her."</p>
<pb n="197" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0203"/>
<p>And it was; for never was sister-love more true, <lb/>
devoted, and lasting than in Sarah Grimk&eacute;. And <lb/>

never was it more warmly reciprocated than by <lb/>
Angelina.</p>
<p>The home of these sisters, though affluent, and <lb/>
refined by culture, was nevertheless not a happy <lb/>
one. Their mother seems to have been unequal to <lb/>
the management of a large household in which the <lb/>
service was all performed by slaves. Hence came <lb/>
waste, disorder, irritation of temper, and chronic <lb/>
discontent. In Sarah's case, as she passed from <lb/>
girlhood into young womanhood, there was added <lb/>
the unrest of an unusually active and mature mind <lb/>
refused, in obedience to prevailing custom, the <reg orig="priv-|lege">privlege</reg> <lb/>
of instruction in that solid learning for which <lb/>
she hungered. Her parents wished to make her, <lb/>
not a student, but a young lady of fashion; a <reg orig="draw-|ing-room">drawing-room</reg> <lb/>
doll; a belle in the ball-room; a merry <lb/>
participant in the frivolous amusements of <reg orig="aristo-|cratic">aristocratic</reg> <lb/>
society. She wished to be a scholar, and <lb/>
could not be satisfied with what the fashionable <lb/>
world offered her starving intellect.</p>
<p>To this hunger of the mind there was added in <lb/>
her seventeenth year the hunger of the heart. As <lb/>
stated above, her parents were Episcopalians, but <lb/>
do not appear to have been much more than <reg orig="devo-|tees">devotees</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="198" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0204"/>
to forms and ceremonies. Moreover, their <reg orig="con-|struction">construction</reg> <lb/>
of the Church creed was highly <reg orig="Calvin-|istic">Calvinistic</reg>, <lb/>
and therefore narrow and unsatisfying. Sarah <lb/>
attended all the services and sacraments of the <reg orig="Epis-|copal">Episcopal</reg> <lb/>
Church, but was, as she wrote, insensible to <lb/>
spiritual feeling. Going one evening to a <reg orig="Presby-|terian">Presbyterian</reg> <lb/>
church, the words of the eloquent Rev. H. <lb/>
Kolloch were sharp arrows to her wounded heart, <lb/>
but did not win her from "scenes of dissipation <lb/>
and frivolity," in which she stifled the emotions she <lb/>
could not wholly suppress. A conversation with this <lb/>
devout minister, whom she met while away from <lb/>
home a year or two later, revived her convictions. <lb/>
Her father's long illness, during which she was his <lb/>
most faithful nurse, and his death, which was made <lb/>
peaceful by his late-born faith in Christ, intensified <lb/>
her desires for a manifestation of Christ to her <lb/>
almost despairing spirit. In Catherine Birney's <lb/>
interesting work the struggles of her strong mind <lb/>
with the comfortless dogmas of an unscriptural <lb/>
theology, and with the unsatisfactory conditions of <lb/>
her life, are given with considerable fullness. In <lb/>
these conflicts we see her turning, first to <reg orig="Univer-|salism">Universalism</reg>, <lb/>
which yielded no balm to her wounded <lb/>
spirit; then, while on a visit to North Carolina <lb/>
seeking to recover her health, which had given way <lb/>
<pb n="199" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0205"/>
beneath the burden of her anguished mind, to <lb/>
Methodism, in which she found partial consolation, <lb/>
but did not fully accept, because its doctrines were <lb/>
not in harmony with the religious theories which <lb/>
had so confused her mind as to mislead her <reg orig="judg-|ment">judgment</reg>. <lb/>
At last, influenced by a book presented <lb/>
to her by a Quaker, she accepted the theories of <lb/>
the Friends, and found as she vainly hoped, "a <lb/>
resting-place for her weary, sore-travailed spirit."</p>
<p>The mystic feature in Quakerism seems to have <lb/>
been the star of this false hope. Its doctrine of <lb/>
the "inward light," of God speaking directly to the <lb/>
heart, had a charm for her strong but misdirected <lb/>
mind. The beliefs in which she had been reared <lb/>
had given an interpretation to the Scriptures from <lb/>
which her sense of justice so revolted that she <lb/>
could not readily accept them as her guide. Her <lb/>
acquaintance with the doctrines of Methodism was <lb/>
too superficial and partial to replace her <reg orig="erro-|neous">erroneous</reg> <lb/>
impressions. But by the fancied inner light <lb/>
of Quakerism she could read into Holy Writ such <lb/>
conceptions as her imagination suggested. Had <lb/>
she been more wisely taught in early life, had she <lb/>
grasped the fundamental truths of the Gospel, her <lb/>
ardent mind would have been satisfied to take the <lb/>
plain meaning of the Written Word as a sufficient <lb/>
<pb n="200" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0206"/>
guide to duty, and thereby have escaped much <reg orig="suf-|fering">suffering</reg>, <lb/>
and avoided the mistakes into which she <lb/>
was led by confounding the voice of her own heart <lb/>
with the voice of God. The Divine Spirit <reg orig="illumi-|nates">illuminates</reg> <lb/>
the mind and comforts the soul, but it speaks <lb/>
no word to the understanding other than what is to <lb/>
be found in the Holy Book.</p>
<p>Sarah's fancied inner life soon moved her to <lb/>
see visions, to commune with spirits, and to <reg orig="be-|lieve">believe</reg> <lb/>
that it was her duty to be a minister among <lb/>
the Quakers. Those imaginary visions and spirits <lb/>
troubled her exceedingly, but not nearly so much <lb/>
as her supposed call to the ministry. From this <lb/>
call she shrank as from a threat of torture. Her <lb/>
sensitive modesty, her sense of womanly propriety, <lb/>
and the prejudices of her education, made it seem <lb/>
a crushing burden. Yet she resolved to begin the <lb/>
work at the Friends' meeting-house; but when the <lb/>
opportunity was within her reach, her tongue, <reg orig="par-|alyzed">paralyzed</reg> <lb/>
by fear, refused to speak. Again and again <lb/>
her resolution yielded to nervous timidity. She <lb/>
sat silent and wretched, for her imaginary inner <lb/>
light accused her of sinning against the Holy Ghost, <lb/>
and this false accusation haunted her like a ghost <lb/>
through several years&mdash;a sincere but unhappy <reg orig="vic-|tim">victim</reg> <lb/>
of erroneous teaching!</p>
<pb n="201" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0207"/>
<p>Thus tempest-tossed by false impressions, made <lb/>
uncomfortable by the censures of family friends, <lb/>
who frowned upon her eccentricities, and panting <lb/>
for the sympathy of congenial minds, Sarah easily <lb/>
persuaded herself that the Lord required her to <lb/>
quit the home of her childhood and remove to <lb/>
Philadelphia. Hence in 1821 we find her domiciled <lb/>
at the house of a Friend, named Israel Morris, in <lb/>
the "City of Brotherly Love."</p>
<p>But what was the history of Angelina during <lb/>
these years? Lovingly nursed in infancy, petted <lb/>
in childhood, trained in early youth by her sister <lb/>
god-mother, Angelina very naturally imbibed <lb/>
her opinions and shared her feelings; albeit she was <lb/>
not so pliable as to accept the views even of her <lb/>
beloved sister, or of her Calvinistic mother, without <lb/>
seeing what seemed to be sufficient grounds for <lb/>
doing so. She was beautiful, gay, fashionable, yet <lb/>
respectful of religious forms. In disposition she <lb/>
was more cheerful, and in judgment more <reg orig="independ-|ent">independent</reg> <lb/>
than her sister. Like Sarah she had "starved <lb/>
on the cold water of Episcopacy," and was <reg orig="con-|vinced">convinced</reg> <lb/>
of sin under the preaching of a Presbyterian <lb/>
minister. Unlike Sarah, she had speedily found <lb/>
peace in believing, and her conceptions of the <reg orig="Gos-|pel">Gospel</reg> <lb/>
were such as filled her with joy in the Holy <lb/>
<pb n="202" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0208"/>
Ghost. She was less self-reproachful, but more <lb/>
self-reliant, more self-assertive, and of more <reg orig="com-|manding">commanding</reg> <lb/>
presence than her sister. Yet she was <lb/>
like her, in that she did not remain long at rest <lb/>
with regard to the doctrines of the Presbyterian <lb/>
Church, under whose instructions she had found <lb/>
Peace.</p>
<p>In 1827 the morbidly conscientious Sarah <reg orig="revis-|ited">revisited</reg> <lb/>
Charleston, drawn hither partly because of her <lb/>
yearning desire to commune with her mother, her <lb/>
"precious Angelina," and her other sisters, and <lb/>
partly because she was fighting against an affection <lb/>
she had formed for a young Quaker who was <reg orig="desir-|ous">desirous</reg> <lb/>
of making her his bride. The dear, mistaken <lb/>
girl was trying to persuade herself that it was her <lb/>
duty to crucify that natural, healthful, and <reg orig="inno-|cent">innocent</reg> <lb/>
passion. She hoped that absence might <reg orig="dis-|solve">dissolve</reg> <lb/>
the charm of love. She was never married.</p>
<p>During Sarah's stay in Charleston she <reg orig="communi-|cated">communicated</reg> <lb/>
a very decided impulse to Angelina's mind <lb/>
toward Quakerism. Its mystic theory of the inner <lb/>
light captured the younger, as it had the elder sister. <lb/>
Its effect was soon seen in Angelina's abandonment <lb/>
of Presbyterian worship, of ornamental dress, of <lb/>
the family worship, and of all reading except of <lb/>
strictly religious books, and in her at least partial <lb/>
<pb n="203" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0209"/>
surrender to what she fancied was the guidance of <lb/>
the inner light.</p>
<p>The result of all this was, as might be expected, <lb/>
that she gave great offense to her family, to the <lb/>
Church, and to the fashionable circle in which it <lb/>
had been her wont to shine. She was censured by <lb/>
her relatives, and ridiculed by society, as a very <lb/>
eccentric young lady, especially because she <reg orig="per-|sisted">persisted</reg> <lb/>
in going to the little Quaker meeting-house, <lb/>
to sit in silence with the two elderly men who were <lb/>
its only attendants besides herself. This treatment, <lb/>
though it did not subdue her strong will, wounded <lb/>
her pride and stung her unbending spirit. After <lb/>
Sarah's return to Philadelphia she had no one to <lb/>
comfort her with sympathy, and the irritations of <lb/>
her mind produced such physical prostration that <lb/>
in 1828 she, too, went to Philadelphia to recruit <lb/>
her strength.</p>
<p>This visit had an important bearing on <reg orig="Ange-|lina's">Angelina's</reg> <lb/>
destined work. Three months' <reg orig="companion-|ship">companionship</reg> <lb/>
with her sister and her Quaker associates so <lb/>
strengthened her adhesion to their notions that she <lb/>
adopted the style of dress peculiar to that sect. Her <lb/>
consciousness of a call to be one of its ministers <lb/>
became more distinct. She also heard so much said <lb/>
on the slavery question, then strongly agitated in <lb/>
<pb n="204" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0210"/>
the North, that her dislike of slave-holding, already <lb/>
very deep, was greatly intensified. Hence, on her <lb/>
return to Charleston she was more than ever <reg orig="pro-|nounced">pronounced</reg> <lb/>
in her Quaker peculiarities, in her rebukes <lb/>
of the ostentatious luxuries of her mother's house, <lb/>
and of the treatment of the family slaves. So much <lb/>
did she dwell upon the cruelties of the slave system, <lb/>
that her hatred of it became a passion. She wept at <lb/>
what she saw daily in her native city, and her <reg orig="swell-|ing">swelling</reg> <lb/>
heart heaved with desire to be "the means of <lb/>
exposing the cruelty and injustice which was <reg orig="prac-|ticed">practiced</reg> <lb/>
in that institution of oppression; .. above all, <lb/>
of exposing the awful sin of professors of religion <lb/>
sending their slaves to the house of correction, and <lb/>
having them whipped, so that when they come out <lb/>
they can scarcely walk, or having them put upon the <lb/>
tread-mill until they are lamed for days afterwards."</p>
<p>Such thoughts and desires were the roots on <lb/>
which her subsequent labors in the anti-slavery <lb/>
crusade grew. They were burning thoughts, and <lb/>
became so unendurable that she could not willingly <lb/>
remain in a city where the spectacles which met her <lb/>
eyes almost daily, were as fuel to the torture they <lb/>
caused in her indignant soul. Moreover, the truth, <lb/>
hitherto unperceived, that slave-holding was sinful, <lb/>
began to dawn upon her, and she wrote in her <lb/>
<pb n="205" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0211"/>
diary, "May it not be laid down as an axiom, that <lb/>
that system must be radically wrong which can only <lb/>
be supported by transgressing the laws of God?"</p>
<p>This perception which a false early education <lb/>
had heretofore kept hidden from her moral <reg orig="judg-|ment">judgment</reg>, <lb/>
stimulated her to deeper and more painful <lb/>
feelings, and moved her to speak with boldness, not <lb/>
only to her relatives, but also to visitors. Such <lb/>
courageous expression of opinion in a city which <lb/>
regarded censure of slave-holding as little less than <lb/>
treason against the State, made her position less and <lb/>
less tolerable; and, therefore, in 1829, she forsook <lb/>
her native city and the home of her childhood, and <lb/>
joined her beloved Sarah in Philadelphia, where <lb/>
she could hope to enjoy liberty of speech, and live <lb/>
without being compelled to witness those acts of <lb/>
cruelty which had vexed her righteous soul.</p>
<p>The sisters now richly enjoyed each other's <lb/>
society, and engaging actively in works of charity, <lb/>
found abundant congenial occupation. Still they <lb/>
did not find Quakerism to be that sweet rest of <lb/>
mental repose which their free souls had expected. <lb/>
They had thought to find full liberty in it to obey <lb/>
the voice of their invisible guide. They found it <lb/>
to be a system of restraint, under which the will <lb/>
of the elders was practically superior to that voice <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0212"/>
in the unofficial individual. They supposed that <lb/>
among the Friends gentleness and love excluded <lb/>
harsh authority and ungenerous sentiments. They <lb/>
found no small measure of uncharitableness and <lb/>
severity in the treatment meted out to them, <reg orig="espe-|cially">especially</reg> <lb/>
to the more docile Sarah, whose aspirations <lb/>
as a minister were most unkindly checked, even so <lb/>
far that she was once openly commanded to be silent <lb/>
while in the act of speaking. But such was the <lb/>
strength of her adhesion to the sect, that Sarah <lb/>
would have borne such treatment unresistingly but <lb/>
for the more independent Angelina, whose bolder <lb/>
spirit resented every encroachment on her liberty <lb/>
of thought and action. Both sisters were loyal to <lb/>
the principles of the Society, but they practically <lb/>
dissented from some of the details imposed by the <lb/>
elders on its members. Angelina, despite their <lb/>
requirements, would read papers and books not <lb/>
approved by them. She would attend other than <lb/>
Quaker assemblies. Hence, after a short time, she <lb/>
began to grow away from strict Quakerism, and <lb/>
gradually influenced Sarah in the same direction. <lb/>
Quakerism was too narrow for a woman possessing <lb/>
such activity and strength of mind, such marked <lb/>
individuality, and such large desires to achieve <lb/>
something for humanity as belonged to Angelina.</p>
<pb n ="207" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0213"/>
<p>In the exercise of her self-asserted liberty of <lb/>
action, Angelina, disregarding the advice of the <lb/>
elder Friends, went, in 1835, to hear that eloquent <lb/>
philanthropist, George Thompson, and other <reg orig="anti-|slavery">antislavery</reg> <lb/>
orators. Their words fell upon her <reg orig="long-|cherished">long-cherished</reg> <lb/>
humane sympathies like sparks on dry <lb/>
tinder, and kindled her desire to do what she could <lb/>
to promote the then despised movements in behalf <lb/>
of crushed humanity in the Southern States. <lb/>
She knew that to identify herself openly with the <lb/>
then unpopular anti-slavery agitation would offend <lb/>
her Quaker friends, grieve her beloved sister, and <lb/>
exasperate her relatives in the South. In presence <lb/>
of these certain consequences she hesitated, prayed, <lb/>
and pondered long and deeply, saying in her heart, <lb/>
"What shall I do? what shall I do?"</p>
<p>At last, in August, 1835, an appeal to the <reg orig="cit-|izens">citizens</reg> <lb/>
of Boston, from the fiery pen of William Lloyd <lb/>
Garrison, protesting against the mobs which <reg orig="dis-|turbed">disturbed</reg> <lb/>
the meetings in which George Thompson <lb/>
was the chief orator, inspired her to write Mr. <lb/>
Garrison a letter of sympathy. This letter was a <lb/>
strong and eloquent production. It was as the <lb/>
voice of a grandly heroic soul. It declared <reg orig="eman-|cipation">emancipation</reg> <lb/>
to be "a cause worth dying for." Its <lb/>
tone delighted Mr. Garrison, who printed it with <lb/>
<pb n="208" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0214"/>
approving comments in the <hi rend="italic">Liberator</hi>, in which he <lb/>
called special attention to Angelina's high Southern <lb/>
connections, and the opportunities her early life <lb/>
had afforded her for studying the institution she <lb/>
condemned.</p>
<p>The publication of her letter was a surprise to <lb/>
Angelina, and it brought down a storm of <reg orig="disap-|proval">disapproval</reg> <lb/>
upon her head from all sides. She met this <lb/>
storm with the courage she had displayed in her <lb/>
letter. Only her sister's grief disturbed her <reg orig="affect-|tionate">affecttionate</reg> <lb/>
spirit. Sarah, though hostile to the <reg orig="cru-|elties">cruelties</reg> <lb/>
of slavery from her childhood, was not yet <lb/>
sufficiently alive to its sinfulness to join a crusade <lb/>
for its destruction. She even fancied that her more <lb/>
energetic sister was "given over to blindness of <lb/>
mind," and did not know "light from darkness, <lb/>
right from wrong." But Angelina had no doubt <lb/>
about the path she had entered being the right one. <lb/>
With her the only question was as to whither it led; <lb/>
what specific part heaven wished her to take in the <lb/>
grand anti-slavery drama!</p>
<p>The story of her mental perplexities is well told <lb/>
by Catherine Birney. These continued several <lb/>
months, until one morning she entered the <reg orig="break-|fast-room">breakfast-room</reg> <lb/>
of Mrs. Parker, with whom she was then <lb/>
visiting, in Shrewsbury, New Jersey, her face <lb/>
<pb n="209" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0215"/>
beaming with the brightness of a mind relieved from <lb/>
doubt, as she exclaimed:</p>
<p>"It has all come to me. God has shown me <lb/>
what I can do. I can write an appeal to Southern <lb/>
women. &hellip; I will speak to them in such tones <lb/>
that they <hi rend="italic">must</hi> hear me, and through me the voice <lb/>
of justice and humanity."</p>
<p>With the promptitude of a lofty enthusiasm born <lb/>
of genuine conviction, she began her proposed task <lb/>
at once. After writing a few pages she received a <reg orig="let-|ter">letter</reg> <lb/>
from the Secretary of the American Anti-slavery <lb/>
Society, inviting her to New York, to meet with <lb/>
Christian women in private parlors, and talk to <lb/>
them on slavery.</p>
<p>This invitation was a flash of brighter light <lb/>
upon the hitherto misty path she had entered. Yet <lb/>
it startled her. Though impressed long before that <lb/>
she was called to be a minister among the Friends, <lb/>
yet she had not hitherto addressed any such public <lb/>
assembly as she was now invited to do. She <reg orig="hesi-|tated">hesitated</reg>, <lb/>
delayed her reply, wrote to Sarah for counsel, <lb/>
prayed for divine direction, and held the question <lb/>
in abeyance until she finished her appeal.</p>
<p>When it was prepared she sent her manuscript <lb/>
to the Anti-slavery Society in New York. Its <lb/>
adaptation to its purpose, its eloquence, the felicity <lb/>
<pb n="210" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0216"/>
of its style, the fervor of its tone, its telling facts, and <lb/>
the strength of its indictment against the peculiar <lb/>
institution, impressed the committee so deeply that <lb/>
they at once put it to press, and speedily sent it <lb/>
broadcast over the country. It produced "the most <lb/>
profound sensation wherever it was read," Catherine <lb/>
Birney justly remarks. In Charleston it was <reg orig="pub-|licly">publicly</reg> <lb/>
burned; and when it was rumored that its <lb/>
author was about to visit her mother, the police <lb/>
were instructed to prevent her landing. The mayor <lb/>
also told her mother that if she came hither it <lb/>
would be impossible for him to protect her from <lb/>
the violence of a mob. O, chivalric Carolinians! <lb/>
Angelina would have defied mob violence and gone <lb/>
to Charleston, but unwilling to put her family <lb/>
in peril, she wisely refrained from making her <lb/>
intended visit.</p>
<p>The Friends in Philadelphia, who were then <lb/>
hostile to the anti-slavery movement, were deeply <lb/>
offended with Angelina for giving this heart-stirring <lb/>
pamphlet to the world. Sarah, though grieved <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
of its injury to her sister's influence in the <lb/>
Society, was, nevertheless, not offended. She was, <lb/>
in fact, gradually growing into Angelina's spirit. <lb/>
The Friends themselves promoted that growth by <lb/>
their arbitrary treatment of both sisters. And <lb/>
<pb n="211" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0217"/>
when, after proposing to go to New England, to <lb/>
speak among Friends only upon the duty of using <lb/>
none but goods produced by free labor, and being <lb/>
advised not to go thither, Angelina decided to accept <lb/>
the invitation of the New York Committee. Sarah <lb/>
resolved to accompany her, saying, "We have wept <lb/>
and prayed together; we will go and work together." <lb/>
As their purpose was not likely to be approved by <lb/>
the Society, it practically severed the sisters from <lb/>
their obligation to observe their rules. The attempt <lb/>
"to ingraft these scions of the Charleston <reg orig="aristoc-|racy">aristocracy</reg> <lb/>
upon the rugged stock of Quaker orthodoxy," <lb/>
as Miss Birney observes, proved to be futile.</p>
<p>Our noble pair of sisters, isolated from their <lb/>
Quaker friends, soon found themselves in friendly <lb/>
relation with men and women of broader minds, <lb/>
higher culture, and more generous sympathies. <lb/>
With characteristic independence they refused the <lb/>
offer of salaries, and proposed to pay their own <reg orig="ex-|penses">expenses</reg>, <lb/>
as they were able to do, they having each <lb/>
inherited the sum of ten thousand dollars from their <lb/>
father's estate, the interest of which sums was <reg orig="suffi-|cient">sufficient</reg> <lb/>
to cover the cost of their simple modes of <lb/>
dress and plain manner of living.</p>
<p>Before beginning their proposed work in New <lb/>
York, the sisters attended an anti-slavery <reg orig="conven-|tion">convention</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="212" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0218"/>
in that city, at which the eloquent Theodore <lb/>
D. Weld took a very prominent part. To both <lb/>
sisters it was a rich and profitable occasion. To <lb/>
Sarah it proved such a stimulant, that she at once <lb/>
wrote an "Epistle to the Clergy of the Southern <lb/>
States," which, when published, was accepted as a <lb/>
very effective argument against the theories of <reg orig="cleri-|cal">clerical</reg> <lb/>
apologists for slave-holding. Being freed from the <lb/>
repressive spirit of Quakerism, the true heart of that <lb/>
excellent woman moved her to cast the full weight <lb/>
of her really great ability into freedom's scale.</p>
<p>After the convention the Female Anti-slavery <lb/>
Society held its first quarterly-meeting in New York, <lb/>
for the purpose of listening to the two sisters. <lb/>
Their purpose had been to speak only in parlors, <lb/>
but their presence in the convention had produced <lb/>
so favorable an impression that it was obvious no <lb/>
parlor would hold the numbers sure to attend. <lb/>
Therefore the session-room of a Baptist church <lb/>
was announced as the place of meeting. It was not <lb/>
only a novelty, but an objectionable act, in those <lb/>
days for a woman to speak in a public place, even <lb/>
to an assembly of women. The Quakers in New <lb/>
York were shocked by the announcement, and not <lb/>
a few Abolitionists thought it scarcely a proper <lb/>
thing to encourage. Rumors of these hostile views <lb/>
<pb n="213" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0219"/>
reached the ears of the shrinking sisters, and they <lb/>
trembled at being called "two bold Southern <lb/>
women." But prayer and the sympathy of good <lb/>
men encouraged them to go to the session-room. <lb/>
There they found some three hundred women. <lb/>
Prayer was offered by a Mr. Ludlow; a few words <lb/>
of welcome were given them by Mr. Dunbar, the <lb/>
pastor of the church; and then, the two gentlemen <lb/>
having modestly retired, Angelina spoke with good <lb/>
effect for forty minutes without the least <reg orig="embarrass-|ment">embarrassment</reg>. <lb/>
Sarah followed with impressive remarks. <lb/>
The ladies present requested that another meeting <lb/>
should be held. Thus these two heroic sisters <lb/>
crossed the Rubicon of an adverse public opinion, <lb/>
and began that brief but brilliant career of public <lb/>
speaking, by which they doubtless contributed very <lb/>
materially to the diffusion of correct information <lb/>
concerning slavery as it actually was, and to the <lb/>
progress of the great anti-slavery movement in <lb/>
the North.</p>
<p>In these days of our familiarity with the fact of <lb/>
women addressing large audiences of both men and <lb/>
women on questions of religion and reform, one is <lb/>
amused when told that at this first appearance of <lb/>
the Misses Grimk&eacute; before an assembly of ladies, a <lb/>
curious but friendly gentleman having quietly crept <lb/>
<pb n="214" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0220"/>
into the sessions-room was, when discovered, <reg orig="re-|quested">requested</reg> <lb/>
to withdraw. No wonder, when <reg orig="Theo-|dore">Theodore</reg> <lb/>
D. Weld was told this ludicrous incident, that <lb/>
he exclaimed, "How supremely ridiculous, to think <lb/>
of a man being shouldered out of a meeting for <lb/>
fear he should hear a woman speak!"</p>
<p>The dignified manners and tender eloquence of <lb/>
these good women struck a chord of sympathy in <lb/>
the hearts of many ladies, who, as the fame of the <lb/>
fair Carolinians spread, crowded to hear them in <lb/>
such numbers that it became necessary to hold their <lb/>
meetings in the church. After addressing <reg orig="numer-|ous">numerous</reg> <lb/>
assemblies in New York, the sisters visited <lb/>
several towns in New Jersey, where they were <lb/>
equally well received; as they were also in the <lb/>
cities of Hudson and Poughkeepsie, on the North <lb/>
River. Then their oratorical fame spread far and <lb/>
wide. Invitations poured in upon them from many <lb/>
quarters. Boston anti-slavery women called for <lb/>
their presence and labors. They obeyed this <reg orig="sum-|mons">summons</reg>, <lb/>
spoke in many places, and always created <lb/>
convictions and stimulated rational enthusiasm for <lb/>
the cause of liberty in their hearers. At first they <lb/>
spoke to females only, but as their reputation spread <lb/>
a few gentlemen began to steal into their meetings <lb/>
uninvited; yet being tolerated their numbers grew, <lb/>
<pb n="215" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0221"/>
until, in July, 1837, the sisters spoke in Lynn, <lb/>
Massachusetts, to a mixed audience of at least a <lb/>
thousand persons. The gentlemen then present <lb/>
were so astonished and delighted with their <reg orig="pow-|erful">powerful</reg> <lb/>
oratory that they insisted on hearing them <lb/>
again. At their next address the edifice was <lb/>
overcrowded.</p>
<p>Their success as speakers to mixed assemblies <lb/>
roused opposition. The enemies of the <reg orig="emancipa-|tion">emancipation</reg> <lb/>
movement, clergymen who felt that it was an <lb/>
innovation not to be tolerated for women to speak <lb/>
to promiscuous gatherings, and even many <reg orig="true-|hearted">true-hearted</reg> <lb/>
anti-slavery men, were offended. The <reg orig="ene-|mies">enemies</reg> <lb/>
of the cause spoke and wrote wrathfully, while <lb/>
not a few of its friends were grieved. For a time <lb/>
a storm raged round the heads of these devoted <lb/>
ladies. But their sense of duty held them to their <lb/>
work. As fast as the doubting friends of the cause <lb/>
heard them they were won to their side, being <reg orig="dis-|armed">disarmed</reg> <lb/>
of prejudice by that perfect propriety of <lb/>
manner and speech which gave character to their <lb/>
performances, albeit many of them were not <reg orig="con-|vinced">convinced</reg> <lb/>
of either the wisdom or fitness of much that <lb/>
was said and done at that time by the agitation <lb/>
which grew out of their action on the vexed <reg orig="ques-|tion">question</reg> <lb/>
of so-called "Woman's Rights." The Misses <lb/>
<pb n="216" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0222"/>
Grimk&eacute; were ladies of lofty character, gifted with <lb/>
extraordinary endowments, and could usefully do a <lb/>
work which if attempted by women of inferior <reg orig="char-|acters">characters</reg> <lb/>
and abilities would neither elevate the sex <lb/>
nor promote any good cause. Since the world <lb/>
began God has anointed a succession of prophets, <lb/>
but only now and then has he called a woman to <lb/>
be prophetess.</p>
<p>It is highly creditable to the judgment of these <lb/>
sisters that, although misled for a brief season by <lb/>
the persuasions of William L. Garrison, H. C. Wright, <lb/>
and a few others, and inclined to force their pet <lb/>
notions on woman's rights, non-resistance, no-<reg orig="gov-|ernment">government</reg>, <lb/>
etc., on the anti-slavery cause, they soon <lb/>
yielded to the arguments of Whittier, T. D. Weld, <lb/>
H. B. Stanton, and other judicious counselors, and <lb/>
ceased their efforts in that direction. For this they <lb/>
were unsparingly censured by Garrison and those <lb/>
who idolized him. Of this treatment Sarah wrote: <lb/>
"They were exhibiting in the high places of moral <lb/>
reform the genuine spirit of slave-holding." Of <lb/>
Garrison she writes very justly: "His spirit of <lb/>
intolerance toward those who did not draw in his <lb/>
traces, and his adulation of those who surrendered <lb/>
themselves to his guidance, have always been very <lb/>
repulsive to me." In this opinion Miss Grimk&eacute; <lb/>
<pb n="217" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0223"/>
was doubtless right. In his treatment of opponents <lb/>
Garrison thought he was acting on principle; but, <lb/>
unconsciously, perhaps, he was too despotic to "let <lb/>
others be themselves."</p>
<p>The public labors of the Grimk&eacute; sisters <reg orig="culmi-|nated">culminated</reg> <lb/>
in Boston, in 1838, when Angelina spoke <lb/>
twice in the halls of the Massachusetts Legislature <lb/>
before a committee of that body, appointed to <reg orig="con-|sider">consider</reg> <lb/>
the "petitions on the subject of slavery." As <lb/>
she stood in the place of the speaker of the House, <lb/>
in presence of a vast crowd which more than filled <lb/>
the hall, her heart which, as she wrote, "had never <lb/>
quailed before, almost died within her at that <reg orig="tre-|mendous">tremendous</reg> <lb/>
hour." "The best culture and character," <lb/>
said Wendell Phillips, "was there; and the profound <lb/>
impression then made on a class not often found <lb/>
in anti-slavery meetings, was never wholly lost&hellip; <lb/>
The converts she made needed no after-training. <lb/>
When she was opening some secret record of her <lb/>
own experience, the painful silence and breathless <lb/>
interest told the deep effect and lasting impression <lb/>
her words were making."</p>
<p>After speaking twice before that committee, the <lb/>
sisters appeared in the Odeon, where Sarah lectured <lb/>
once, and Angelina five times, to audiences of <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg> <lb/>
two thousand souls, whose frequent bursts of <lb/>
<pb n="218" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0224"/>
applause illustrated the marvelous power of these <lb/>
eloquent daughters of South Carolina. With her <lb/>
lecture in the Odeon Sarah's public labors ended, <lb/>
her throat being so seriously diseased as to compel <lb/>
retirement and rest. Angelina spoke but once more. <lb/>
A few weeks later she was married in Philadelphia <lb/>
to Theodore D. Weld. Invited to speak in <reg orig="Penn-|sylvania">Pennsylvania</reg> <lb/>
Hall, then just dedicated, but at the <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
threatened by a furious mob, she appeared <lb/>
there, "the bride of three days," says Catherine <lb/>
Birney; "and so great was the effect of her pure, <lb/>
beautiful presence, and quiet, graceful manner, that <lb/>
in a few moments the confusion within the hall <lb/>
subsided." Yet during her burning speech the mob <lb/>
within the doors yelled and shouted, while the mob <lb/>
without hurled showers of stones through the <reg orig="win-|dows">windows</reg> <lb/>
across the hall. Nothing daunted, without <lb/>
the slightest change of color, she spoke on for an <lb/>
hour, and when she had finished the applause of the <lb/>
audience drowned the yells of the mob. This was <lb/>
her last speech, her nervous system being so <reg orig="im-|paired">impaired</reg> <lb/>
by an accident shortly after, that she was <lb/>
never again competent to endure the excitement <lb/>
and exertion of public speaking. Henceforth she <lb/>
was able to serve the cause she loved so truly only <lb/>
with her able, fervid pen.</p>
<pb n="219" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0225"/>
<p>The scope of this sketch forbids us to attempt <lb/>
any description of the simple, busy, self-denying, <lb/>
self-sacrificing, unique, beautiful, and happy lives <lb/>
these loving sisters and Mr. Weld lived in their <lb/>
modest homes, first at Fort Lee, next at Belleville, <lb/>
then at Eagleswood, New Jersey, and finally at <lb/>
Hyde Park, near Boston. The pleasing story is <lb/>
well told by Catherine Birney, in her exceedingly <lb/>
interesting book. It must suffice here to say that <lb/>
Miss Grimk&eacute; died December 23, 1873, at Hyde <lb/>
Park, and Mrs. Weld followed her to the mansions <lb/>
of rest October 26th, 1879. They were both rarely <lb/>
good women, alike in many of their idiosyncrasies, <lb/>
yet unlike in others. Both suffered through lack <lb/>
of educational training suited to their naturally <lb/>
strong, active, resolute, impulsive minds. Perhaps <lb/>
the uncertainties, changes, and final peculiarities of <lb/>
their religious beliefs had their origin chiefly in <lb/>
this lack. Both were charitable and self sacrificing <lb/>
to the last degree. Both possessed a strong sense <lb/>
of justice, an uncommonly acute conscientiousness, <lb/>
and a courage that was fearless of the consequences <lb/>
of doing right. Of the two, Angelina had the <lb/>
quicker perception; but in reasoning both were apt <lb/>
to seize on generalizations too broad for the facts <lb/>
on which they were based. Both were somewhat <lb/>
<pb n="220" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0226"/>
eccentric. Both had great strength of will, but <reg orig="An-|gelina's">Angelina's</reg> <lb/>
character was the stronger of the two, the <lb/>
more prompt to decide, the more forward to act, <lb/>
the more magnetic in its action upon other minds. <lb/>
Both were good, pure, noble, honorable women, not <lb/>
faultless, yet in many things models for the <reg orig="imita-|tion">imitation</reg> <lb/>
of the young women of to-day.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the month of January, 1848, the body of a <lb/>
lady who had lived to be nearly ninety-eight <lb/>
years old was borne into the grave-yard, at <lb/>
Hanover, Germany, followed by a long <reg orig="pro-|cession">procession</reg> <lb/>
of mourners. Royal carriages were there, as <lb/>
evidences that the court honored the memory of the <lb/>
dead. Garlands of laurel, cypress, and palm branches, <lb/>
sent by the crown princess from Herrnhausen, <lb/>
covering her coffin, showed that she, too, shared <lb/>
in the affectionate regard of the reigning monarch <lb/>
for the deceased lady. The following inscription, <lb/>
written by the departed lady shortly before her <lb/>
death, and subsequently placed over her grave, <lb/>
<pb n="222" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0228"/>
shall inform the reader who she was, and to what <lb/>
her long life had been devoted: <lb/>
<q>"Here rests the earthly exterior of <hi rend="small-caps">Caroline Lucretia <lb/>
Herschel</hi>, born at Hanover, March 16, 1750, died January <lb/>
9, 1848. The eyes of her who is glorified were here below <lb/>
turned to the starry heavens. Her own discoveries of <reg orig="com-|ets">comets</reg>, <lb/>
and her participation in the immortal labors of her <lb/>
brother, William Herschel, bear witness of this to future <lb/>
ages. The Royal Irish Academy, of Dublin, and the Royal <lb/>
Astronomical Society, of London, enrolled her name among <lb/>
their members."</q></p>
<p>The reputation of this lady was not the <reg orig="blos-|soming">blossoming</reg> <lb/>
of her own discoveries, though she was <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
a highly gifted astronomer, but of her marvelous <lb/>
sister-love. She had chosen so to merge her life <lb/>
into that of her brother as partly to justify what <lb/>
she said of herself in her old age, namely: "I am <lb/>
nothing. I have done nothing. All I am, all I <lb/>
know, I owe to my brother. I am only the tool <lb/>
which he shaped to his use; a well-trained <reg orig="puppy-|dog">puppy-dog</reg> <lb/>
would have done as much."</p>
<p>Our sketch will show that she, doubtless, owed <lb/>
her musical and astronomical knowledge to her <lb/>
noble brother's teaching. It will also show that in <lb/>
calling herself his "tool," she was underrating <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>. <lb/>
Her love was moving her to exalt him at her <lb/>
own expense, for she was neither a passive tool nor <lb/>
<pb n="223" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0229"/>
a "well-trained puppy-dog," but a woman of rare <lb/>
genius, who was in strong intellectual sympathy <lb/>
with his pursuits, and whose marvelous sister-love <lb/>
moved her to subordinate her own ambitions to <lb/>
those of her brother; to find her pleasure, not in <lb/>
seeking celebrity for herself, but in contributing to <lb/>
his, and to rejoice in his successes as if they were <lb/>
her own. Could she but see him shine as a <reg orig="lumi-|nary">luminary</reg> <lb/>
in the world of science, she was content to sit <lb/>
in the light of his reputation. For this rare degree <lb/>
of beautiful sisterly affection the world admired <lb/>
and still admires her, and will always rank her <lb/>
with such devoted sisters as Dorothy Wordsworth <lb/>
and Mary Lamb.</p>
<p>The child-life of Caroline Herschel was not, on <lb/>
the whole, a happy one. Her father was a <reg orig="hautboy-|player">hautboy-player</reg> <lb/>
in the band of the Guards, and a skilled <lb/>
musician. Hence his family was subject to the <lb/>
vicissitudes of military life, and, during the "Seven <lb/>
Years' War," to serious discomforts growing out of <lb/>
the occupation of Hanover by the victorious French <lb/>
for nearly two years. These adversities of the <reg orig="king-|dom">kingdom</reg> <lb/>
often reduced the Herschel family to great <lb/>
straits. Peace brought easier times. Caroline's <lb/>
two eldest brothers, by their early display of <reg orig="mu-|sical">musical</reg> <lb/>
talents, then found employment in the court <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0230"/>
orchestra, and thereby brought such good cheer <lb/>
into the home circle, that Caroline, writing of her <lb/>
early days, said: "It made me so happy to see <lb/>
them so happy"&mdash;a remark, by the way, which <lb/>
shows that Caroline was gifted in her childhood <lb/>
with that unselfish disposition which, in her <reg orig="ma-|ture">mature</reg> <lb/>
years, enabled her to find enjoyment in her <lb/>
brother's success.</p>
<p>On one occasion, when Caroline's father and her <lb/>
brother William had arrived in Hanover with their <lb/>
regiment, from foreign service, her mother gave <lb/>
her permission to go to the parade to meet them. <lb/>
The day was cold, the streets crowded. The little <lb/>
girl, unable to find her friends, wandered about <lb/>
until she was very nearly frozen. At last, she <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg> <lb/>
to her home, where she found the family at <lb/>
dinner. So delighted were they over the return of <lb/>
the father and brother, that no one had noticed <lb/>
Caroline's absence. The first to greet her was <lb/>
William. "My dear brother William," she wrote <lb/>
in her "Early Recollections," "threw down his <lb/>
knife and fork, ran to welcome me, and crouched <lb/>
down to me, which made me forget all my <reg orig="griev-|ances">grievances</reg>." <lb/>
Even at that early age her love for her <lb/>
brother William was so strong that his smile was <lb/>
her childish heaven.</p>
<pb n="225" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0231"/>
<p>Caroline's girl-life was not spent in idle pastimes. <lb/>
She was at the military school every day until three <lb/>
o'clock. From her studies there she went to <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg> <lb/>
school, to learn knitting. When she had <lb/>
acquired this simple art she was kept busy out of <lb/>
school hours knitting stockings for her brothers. <lb/>
Stockings so long that they reached from her chin <lb/>
to the floor! She was also made to wait at table <lb/>
when her exacting brother Jacob was at home. <lb/>
And he was so unkind as to give her "many a <lb/>
whipping for being awkward." Besides these <reg orig="em-|ployments">employments</reg> <lb/>
she wrote letters to the absent ones, <lb/>
for her mother and for the neighbors, and was, <lb/>
consequently, if not a family drudge, yet a very <lb/>
busy child.</p>
<p>When she was ten years old her father left the <lb/>
army, broken down by the hardships of his soldier's <lb/>
life. He then became a teacher of music, and <reg orig="Car-|oline">Caroline</reg> <lb/>
was one of his most ready pupils, until a year <lb/>
later typhus fever so reduced her strength that, she <lb/>
writes, "for several months I was obliged to mount <lb/>
the stairs on my hands and feet like an infant."</p>
<p>When Caroline's strength returned, her mother, <lb/>
much against the wish of her father, instead of <lb/>
keeping her at school, compelled her to drudge like <lb/>
a servant, both in the kitchen and with her needle. <lb/>
<pb n="226" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0232"/>
Not that she was opposed to education in itself, but <lb/>
because two of her sons being musically educated had <lb/>
been tempted to seek employment in England, and <lb/>
she feared that if Caroline became a superior scholar, <lb/>
she too might leave her natal home. This drudgery, <lb/>
with grief over the continued absence of her <reg orig="best-|beloved">best-beloved</reg> <lb/>
brother, clothed the girl's spirits with <lb/>
gloom, which became "a kind of stupefaction" <lb/>
when her father died, as he did when she was <lb/>
seventeen years old.</p>
<p>That Caroline might acquire sufficient skill to <lb/>
support herself, if need should arise, by her needle, <lb/>
Mrs. Herschel now sent her as an apprentice to a <lb/>
fashionable milliner and dress-maker, but resolutely <lb/>
refused to let her study French and music, as she <lb/>
wished to do, in order that she might qualify <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
to fill the place of a governess. In all this <lb/>
the mother was blameworthy. Out of a selfish <lb/>
desire to keep her daughter from going to England <lb/>
as two of her sons had done, she strove to repress <lb/>
the development of her mental powers. Happily <lb/>
the maiden's genius would not yield itself wholly <lb/>
to this unwise mother's measures. Knowing that <lb/>
it was her brother William's wish to have her with <lb/>
him in England, that he might train her to assist <lb/>
him in his concerts and musical pursuits, she, while <lb/>
<pb n="227" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0233"/>
not refusing to perform her household tasks, did <lb/>
her utmost when her mother was from home to <lb/>
cultivate her voice for singing the solo parts of <lb/>
concert music.</p>
<p>When Caroline was twenty-two her brother <lb/>
William set her free from these restraints by settling <lb/>
an annuity upon her mother sufficient to pay the <lb/>
expense of a personal attendant to fill her place in <lb/>
the household; and then, with her mother's reluctant <lb/>
consent, taking her with him to England. Thus, <lb/>
despite her unmotherly efforts, the event Mrs. <reg orig="Her-|schel">Herschel</reg> <lb/>
dreaded as an evil came to pass, and her <lb/>
daughter fell into the place for which nature had <lb/>
fitted her.</p>
<p>When Caroline arrived in England her brother's <lb/>
home was in Bath, its most fashionable <reg orig="watering-|place">watering-place</reg>. <lb/>
In that gay city he had acquired reputation <lb/>
as a teacher and composer of music. He was also <lb/>
the popular director of the public concerts, <reg orig="patron-|ized">patronized</reg> <lb/>
by the royal and aristocratic visitors who spent <lb/>
the "season" there. But while music was his <reg orig="vis-|ible">visible</reg> <lb/>
profession, the real work of his life, the thing <lb/>
he pursued with passionate affection, was the study <lb/>
of the heavens. He was a music-master only that <lb/>
he might acquire means and have leisure to invent <lb/>
better astronomical instruments than any then in <lb/>
<pb n="228" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0234"/>
use. Dissatisfied with what astronomers already <lb/>
knew, he aimed to be an explorer among the stars, <lb/>
a discoverer of worlds hitherto unrevealed to the <lb/>
eyes of men. To achieve this worthy end, he was <lb/>
at this time secretly toiling to construct a more <lb/>
powerful telescope than the opticians of the past had <lb/>
been able to produce. He was beginning that long <lb/>
series of mechanical labors, of which "the mirror <lb/>
for the mighty forty-foot telescope was the <reg orig="crown-|ing">crowning</reg> <lb/>
result."</p>
<p>If Miss Herschel had dreamed of her brother's <lb/>
residence as a luxurious Castle of Indolence, her <lb/>
dream would have been swiftly dissolved on her <lb/>
arrival within its walls. But she probably had <lb/>
indulged in no such dreaming. Her mind was <lb/>
practical, and not poetical. Her early life, as we <lb/>
have seen, had been a life of drudging toil, but <lb/>
little brightened by recreation or the sympathies of <lb/>
demonstrative family affections. Most likely in <lb/>
going to Bath she thought of little else than of <lb/>
becoming the companion of the brother she most <lb/>
fondly loved, and of doing what might be in her <lb/>
power to contribute to his prosperity and happiness.</p>
<p>It was well, both for herself and her brother, <lb/>
that she had this practical turn of mind. Had she <lb/>
been frivolous, self-indulgent, fond of admiration, a <lb/>
<pb n="229" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0235"/>
lover of amusements, and dependent on society for <lb/>
the enjoyment of her daily life, she would have <lb/>
been an unhappy woman in her brother's busy <lb/>
home. But, looking on life as she did, with the <lb/>
eye of sound common sense, she accepted things as <lb/>
she found them, without complaining of their <reg orig="hard-|ships">hardships</reg>. <lb/>
And they were hard in many respects. She <lb/>
had much, almost every thing, indeed, to learn. The <lb/>
second morning after her arrival her brother began <lb/>
giving her lessons in English, in arithmetic, and in <lb/>
keeping a book account of her marketing, and other <lb/>
household transactions. He also talked to her <lb/>
about astronomy, tried her voice, and being <reg orig="satis-|fied">satisfied</reg> <lb/>
that it only needed culture to be effective in <lb/>
concerts and oratorios, he at once put her under a <lb/>
course of training which demanded several hours <lb/>
of time every day.</p>
<p>He also installed her as the manager of his <lb/>
household, which, having heretofore been in the <lb/>
hands of a "hot-headed old Welsh woman," was in <lb/>
a sadly disarranged and dirty condition. Knowing <lb/>
but little English, and nothing of English customs, <lb/>
yet having all the marketing to do, Caroline found <lb/>
it no easy task to deal with butchers, bakers, <reg orig="fish-|women">fish-women</reg>, <lb/>
and hucksters. Her brother's time was so <lb/>
completely occupied that she seldom saw him except <lb/>
<pb n="230" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0236"/>
at meals, and when he was giving her lessons. Her <lb/>
inability to speak English made it impossible for <lb/>
her to enter into society. Her correspondence from <lb/>
the home circle was tinged with sorrowful accounts <lb/>
of the death of her sister's husband, and of her <lb/>
disconsolate condition with six fatherless children <lb/>
dependent upon her. No wonder, therefore, that <lb/>
she tells us of her social loneliness, saying: "I was <lb/>
entirely left to myself;" and "I had to struggle <lb/>
against homesickness and low spirits." But for <lb/>
her deep sister-love for William her life in Bath <lb/>
would have been unendurable.</p>
<p>Miss Herschel was not a faint-hearted, <reg orig="vacil-|lating">vacillating</reg> <lb/>
damsel, but a hopeful, persevering woman. <lb/>
Hence we soon find her in demand as a singer of <lb/>
songs and glees at her brother's evening parties, <lb/>
given during the season. At the close of the season <lb/>
her brother, now desperately busy on his new <reg orig="tel-|escope">telescope</reg>, <lb/>
made large demands on her time for <reg orig="assist-|ance">assistance</reg>. <lb/>
He turned the whole house, even to one of <lb/>
its bedrooms, into a workshop, in which <reg orig="cabinet-|work">cabinetwork</reg> <lb/>
was going on, and a lathe kept running, <lb/>
making patterns, grinding glasses and eye-pieces. <lb/>
In the midst of these unpoetical proceedings, <reg orig="Caro-|line">Caroline</reg> <lb/>
had to continue her practice for the concerts <lb/>
of the ensuing Winter.</p>
<pb n="231" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0237"/>
<p>Both her musical capacity and her energy find <lb/>
illustration in the fact that seven years after her <lb/>
arrival in England she was able to take leading <lb/>
parts in a public presentation of those grand <reg orig="orato-|rios">oratorios</reg>, <lb/>
the "Messiah," and "Judas Maccabeus." She <lb/>
rendered the songs and recitations assigned her so <lb/>
well, that she was highly complimented, not only <lb/>
by her friends, but also by such high-born dames <lb/>
as the Marchioness of Lothian, and other titled <lb/>
ladies, who were particularly struck with the <reg orig="cor-|rectness">correctness</reg> <lb/>
of her pronunciation of English words, and <lb/>
with the elegance of her manners. So marked was <lb/>
her vocal ability, that she was made first singer at <lb/>
the concerts of the following year. She was then <lb/>
offered an engagement at what was called the "<reg orig="Bir-|mingham">Birmingham</reg> <lb/>
Festival," but declined because of her <lb/>
determination not to sing in public, except in <reg orig="con-|certs">concerts</reg> <lb/>
conducted by her brother.</p>
<p>It was now apparent that Miss Herschel might, <lb/>
by further persistent culture, win a national <reg orig="repu-|tation">reputation</reg> <lb/>
and abundant support as a singer. She <lb/>
might, if she chose, make herself independent in <lb/>
temporalities of her brother. But this was not her <lb/>
choice. Her life was too closely linked to his to <lb/>
permit a wish to shine in her own light. Hence, <lb/>
when his astronomical reputation brought him <lb/>
<pb n="232" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0238"/>
the means of self-support, and he abandoned his <lb/>
musical pursuits, as he did in 1782, Miss Caroline <lb/>
also bade adieu to her promising prospects as <lb/>
a singer, and devoted herself to astronomical <lb/>
studies, that she might become his effective and <lb/>
life-long assistant. Was ever sister more <reg orig="disin-|terested">disinterested</reg> <lb/>
in her devotion to a brother than Caroline <lb/>
Herschel?</p>
<p>Miss Herschel's connection with her brother <lb/>
William's astronomical studies was brought about <lb/>
through the instability of her brother Alexander, <lb/>
who, though abundantly capable, was not sufficiently <lb/>
persevering to be an assistant upon whom he could <lb/>
depend. He would not give himself to the <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
labor required. Hindered in his <reg orig="observa-|tions">observations</reg> <lb/>
by this fault in Alexander, he turned to <lb/>
Caroline, who responded to his call with alacrity. <lb/>
With inexhaustible patience she copied his long <lb/>
catalogues of stars, his tedious astronomical tables, <lb/>
by day, and set herself at night when he was <lb/>
making telescopic observations to the regulation of <lb/>
his lamp micrometer; the keeping up of a fire when <lb/>
necessary; and when his watching was long <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg>, <lb/>
to the preparation of a cup of coffee for his <lb/>
refreshment. Of these tasks she wrote: "I <reg orig="under-|took">undertook</reg> <lb/>
with pleasure what others might have thought <lb/>
<pb n="233" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0239"/>
a hardship." Doubtless these were very trying tasks, <lb/>
but her sister-love made them seem easy to her.</p>
<p>William's enthusiastic devotion to his work led <lb/>
him to suffer his willing sister to toil at a very <lb/>
unfeminine task while he was preparing to cast a <lb/>
mirror for his projected thirty-foot telescope. It <lb/>
had to be cast "in a mold of loam, prepared from <lb/>
horse-dung, pounded in a mortar, and sifted through <lb/>
a fine sieve." "It was an endless piece of work," <lb/>
she wrote, "and served me for many an hour's <reg orig="ex-|ercise">exercise</reg>. <lb/>
Alee frequently took his turn at it, for we <lb/>
were all eager to do something toward the great <lb/>
undertaking." This prolonged pounding of such <lb/>
offensive material must have been very repugnant <lb/>
to Caroline's sensibilities; yet she did it with more <lb/>
than cheerfulness, because of her absorbing interest <lb/>
in her brother's pursuits. She felt amply repaid <lb/>
when she witnessed the favor with which the <reg orig="great-|est">greatest</reg> <lb/>
scientific minds in England now began to regard <lb/>
her brother; when the king and queen invited <lb/>
him to their royal abode; when he was appointed <lb/>
royal astronomer, with a salary of one thousand <lb/>
dollars per annum, and especially when the sum of <lb/>
ten thousand dollars was provided to enable him to <lb/>
finish his thirty-foot telescope.</p>
<p>Caroline was thirty-three years of age when her <lb/>
<pb n="234" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0240"/>
brother gave her a small telescope, called a "finder," <lb/>
with which she was to sweep the heavens in search <lb/>
of comets during the many nights on which, at this <lb/>
time, he was from home in attendance on his royal <lb/>
patron, or at the meetings of distinguished men of <lb/>
science. She found little to cheer her at first in this <lb/>
lonely work, which had to be done on starlight <lb/>
nights, "on a grass-plot, covered with dew or <reg orig="hoar-|frost">hoarfrost</reg>, <lb/>
without a human being near enough to be <lb/>
within call." Moreover, she was as yet so ignorant <lb/>
of the starry heavens as to be dependent on an atlas <lb/>
for finding what the objects were which she saw, and <lb/>
which she was required to describe. But when her <lb/>
brother returned and praised her work, which <reg orig="con-|tained">contained</reg> <lb/>
a list of fourteen clusters of stars, which she <lb/>
had duly catalogued, she was highly gratified, and felt <lb/>
repaid for all the discomforts of her nightly toil.</p>
<p>After his return she became the attendant of <lb/>
his labors on the telescope. She ran to the clocks, <lb/>
wrote memoranda, fetched and carried instruments, <lb/>
measured the ground with poles, re-measured the <lb/>
double stars with the micrometers, and when not <lb/>
thus engaged continued her sweepings in search of <lb/>
comets. There was peril as well as hardship in <lb/>
some of these duties. On the last night of <reg orig="Decem-|ber">December</reg>, <lb/>
1783, for example, the clouds having dispersed <lb/>
<pb n="235" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0241"/>
about ten o'clock, she and her brother hurried out <lb/>
to take an observation. Mr. Herschel, on taking <lb/>
his place in front of his instrument, called Caroline <lb/>
to alter its lateral motion. It was dark, and the <lb/>
ground was covered with melting snow a foot deep. <lb/>
In approaching the machinery which regulated <lb/>
the motion of the telescope, she did not notice a <lb/>
tenter-hook which was fastened to the end of the <lb/>
machinery. Consequently she fell upon it, and it <lb/>
entered her right leg above the knee.</p>
<p>"Make haste!" cried her brother, wondering <lb/>
why the telescope did not move.</p>
<p>"I am hooked!" was her pitiful response.</p>
<p>Rushing to her assistance, with the workman <lb/>
who was with him, he lifted her from her painful <lb/>
position, but, she writes, "not without leaving nearly <lb/>
two ounces of my flesh behind."</p>
<p>The workman's wife was summoned, but was <lb/>
too nearly paralyzed with fright to render any <reg orig="val-|uable">valuable</reg> <lb/>
aid. Hence she had to bandage the wound <lb/>
with her handkerchief, and treat it as best she <lb/>
could. She suffered much, and for six weeks her <lb/>
physician was uncertain whether or not he could <lb/>
save the limb. But the wound healed at last, and <lb/>
she comforted herself for all this suffering by being <lb/>
told that, owing to the clouds which returned after <lb/>
<pb n="236" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0242"/>
her accident, and for several nights following, "her <lb/>
brother was no loser through this accident." What <lb/>
admirable self-forgetfulness is implied in this!</p>
<p>In 1786 Miss Herschel was richly rewarded for <lb/>
her nights spent in sweeping the heavens, by her <lb/>
discovery of a comet. Her brother was absent in <lb/>
Germany at the time, setting up a telescope which <lb/>
he had made by order of the King of England for <lb/>
a German prince. Desiring no respite, the <reg orig="indefat-|igable">indefatigable</reg> <lb/>
Caroline had been spending her days writing <lb/>
up catalogues and tables, and in overlooking the <lb/>
preparations being made at Slough, their residence <lb/>
at this time, for completing a forty-foot telescope. <lb/>
The nights, when clear, had been spent with her <lb/>
"finder" counting the nebul&aelig;. On the night of <lb/>
the 1st of August she thought she saw a comet. <lb/>
The next night she was able to write with <reg orig="confi-|dence">confidence</reg>: <lb/>
"The object I saw last night <hi rend="italic">is a comet!"</hi> <lb/>
She was delighted, and wrote at once an account of <lb/>
her discovery to two distinguished astronomers. <lb/>
Guided by her descriptions, they and other students <lb/>
of the starry heavens found it also. Alexander <lb/>
Aubert, Esq., wrote her, saying:</p>
<p>"I wish you joy, most sincerely, on the <reg orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg>. <lb/>
I am more pleased than you can well <reg orig="con-|ceive">conceive</reg>, <lb/>
that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have made it; and I think I see <lb/>
<pb n="237" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0243"/>
your wonderfully clever and wonderfully amiable <lb/>
brother, upon the news of it, shed a tear of joy. <lb/>
You have immortalized your name. You deserve <lb/>
such a reward from the Being who has ordered all <lb/>
these things to move as we find them, for your <lb/>
assiduity in the business of astronomy, and for your <lb/>
love for so celebrated and deserving a brother."</p>
<p>Success, while it gratified her love of the <reg orig="ap-|proval">approval</reg> <lb/>
of those she loved and respected, did not <lb/>
relax either her scientific zeal or her diligence in <lb/>
furthering the work of her now illustrious brother. <lb/>
In 1787 she had the further satisfaction of being <lb/>
officially recognized as her brother's assistant, with a <lb/>
salary of two hundred and fifty dollars a year. On <lb/>
receiving her first quarterly payment she wrote: <lb/>
"This is the first money I ever thought myself at <lb/>
liberty to spend to my own liking. A great <reg orig="uneasi-|ness">uneasiness</reg> <lb/>
was by this means removed from my mind, for, <lb/>
though I had been almost the keeper of my brother's <lb/>
purse, with a charge to provide for my personal <lb/>
wants, &hellip; yet, when cast up, the sums I had taken <lb/>
for this purpose only amounted to thirty-five or <lb/>
forty dollars a year, since the time we left Bath," <lb/>
six years ago. O, simple-minded, economical, <reg orig="con-|scientious">conscientious</reg> <lb/>
Caroline Herschel!</p>
<p>In the following year William Herschel was <lb/>
<pb n="238" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0244"/>
married, and his sister was thereby relieved of the <lb/>
care of keeping her brother's house. But this relief <lb/>
did not reconcile her to the fact of his marriage, <lb/>
which, very naturally and properly, placed the wife <lb/>
first in the husband's affections. It mattered not <lb/>
that the wife was gentle, amiable, friendly, and by <lb/>
no means jealous of the supreme place which <reg orig="Caro-|line">Caroline</reg> <lb/>
had held in her husband's regard. His <reg orig="mar-|riage">marriage</reg> <lb/>
grieved her exceedingly; and it is supposed <lb/>
that she did not hesitate to give expression to her <lb/>
grief in her journal for the ensuing ten years, <reg orig="inas-|much">inasmuch</reg> <lb/>
as when time and the affectionate attentions <lb/>
of the sister-in-law had dissipated her grief, she <lb/>
destroyed that tell-tale record, lest it should give <lb/>
needless pain to survivors.</p>
<p>Miss Herschel's regrets did not quench either <lb/>
her devotion to her brother's service or her zeal for <lb/>
her own scientific studies. Though she quitted his <lb/>
home when his wife became its mistress, and lived <lb/>
henceforth in lodgings, she did not cease to be his <lb/>
assistant, nor to sweep the heavens with her <reg orig="tele-|scope">telescope</reg> <lb/>
in search of more comets. "Before the end <lb/>
of 1797," says her biographer, "she had announced <lb/>
the discovery of eight comets, to five of which <lb/>
the priority of her claim over other observers is <lb/>
unquestioned."</p>
<pb n="239" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0245"/>
<p>These faithful labors she continued with <reg orig="unre-|mitting">unremitting</reg> <lb/>
diligence until her brother's death in 1822. <lb/>
The celebrity of Sir William, and her own <reg orig="reputa-|tion">reputation</reg>, <lb/>
brought her into frequent contact with <reg orig="dis-|tinguished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
scientists, and even with many royal <lb/>
personages during the last decade of her life in <lb/>
England. She was also persuaded to pay occasional <lb/>
visits to the homes of her most intimate friends, <lb/>
and thereby to break up in some small measure the <lb/>
laborious monotony of her life. But her brother's <lb/>
health, undermined by his excessive labors, <reg orig="prose-|cuted">prosecuted</reg> <lb/>
with little remission in the night, at all <lb/>
seasons, in cold and heat for years, began in 1819 <lb/>
to excite her anxieties. Her own uncommon vigor <lb/>
also began to give way, and a severe attack of fever <lb/>
brought her to the gates of death. She, however, <lb/>
rallied, and resumed her accustomed tasks. But <lb/>
Sir William, after struggling heroically with disease <lb/>
for some three years, became the victim of the death <lb/>
angel on the 25th of August, 1822, "when," she <lb/>
wrote, "not one comfort was left to me but that of <lb/>
retiring to the chamber of death, there to ruminate <lb/>
without interruption on my isolated situation." Alas, <lb/>
poor lady! the light of her life was extinguished.</p>
<p>Miss Herschel was now "heart-broken and <reg orig="des-|olate">desolate</reg>." <lb/>
"All she had of love to give had been <lb/>
<pb n="240" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0246"/>
concentrated on her brother." With him she had <lb/>
also lost the occupation which, for nearly half a <reg orig="cen-|tury">century</reg>, <lb/>
had occupied her time and filled her thoughts. <lb/>
"I am a person," she said, "who has nothing more <lb/>
to do in the world." Then, in the agony of her <lb/>
heart, she resolved to quit the land which she had <lb/>
loved only for her brother's sake, and go back to <lb/>
her native city. Having in the first moments of her <lb/>
great sorrow made this really unwise resolution, she <lb/>
set about her preparations at once. Only two days <lb/>
after his burial we find her selecting "the books <lb/>
and clothing" she meant to take with her. Two <lb/>
weeks later she is disposing of her furniture, settling <lb/>
with her landlord, etc. After this we see her <lb/>
taking "an everlasting leave" of her friends. On <lb/>
the 18th of October she is on board a "<reg orig="steam-|packet">steam-packet</reg>," <lb/>
bound to Rotterdam, and ten days later she <lb/>
is in "the habitation of her brother Dietrich, at <reg orig="Han-|over">Hanover</reg>," <lb/>
where she hoped to find consolation for her <lb/>
wounded affections in the kindly sympathies of <lb/>
her relatives.</p>
<p>It was a vain hope, destined to bear little else <lb/>
than the thistle disappointment. She found her <lb/>
few living relatives proud of her brother's fame and <lb/>
of her celebrity, but not one of them could <reg orig="appre-|ciate">appreciate</reg> <lb/>
her truly wonderful sister-love, or enter into <lb/>
<pb n="241" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0247"/>
her views of life. Fifty years had passed since <lb/>
she left her native city. She was no longer the <lb/>
damsel of twenty-two, but an old lady of <reg orig="seventy-|two">seventy-two</reg>. <lb/>
Time had wrought great changes both in her <lb/>
and in them. They had plodded along in a sphere of <lb/>
commonplace respectability, and not within the <lb/>
radiance of a mind illuminated by brilliant genius, <lb/>
as she had done. She had, therefore, grown away <lb/>
from their range of thought. She had formed <lb/>
habits very unlike theirs; her ideas were not theirs, <lb/>
and they could not be led to adopt them. Hence, <lb/>
despite the kindly intentions of her relatives and <lb/>
friends, they could not satisfy the craving of the <lb/>
old lady's heart for something, if not to replace, <lb/>
yet fully to sympathize with that affection into <lb/>
which all her life had been freely poured. No <lb/>
wonder, therefore, that shortly after her arrival in <lb/>
Hanover, we hear her crying like one in distress, <lb/>
"Why did I leave happy England?" No wonder as <lb/>
she turned her thoughts more and more, as the <lb/>
years sped on, to her brother's only son and his <lb/>
family, giving to them somewhat of the love so <lb/>
long and so exclusively given to her beloved <lb/>
brother, that she often repeated that cry of deep <lb/>
regret during the twenty-six years which passed <lb/>
before her long life ended!</p>
<pb n="242" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0248"/>
<p>The first months after her return to Hanover <lb/>
she employed herself in completing a catalogue <reg orig="pre-|viously">previously</reg> <lb/>
begun of all the star clusters and nebul&aelig; <lb/>
observed by her brother in his "sweeps." Of this <lb/>
valuable piece of work Sir David Brewster said: <lb/>
"It is a work of immense labor, an extraordinary <lb/>
monument of the unextinguished ardor of a lady of <lb/>
seventy-five in the cause of abstract science."</p>
<p>For this catalogue the Royal Astronomical <reg orig="So-|ciety">Society</reg> <lb/>
voted her its gold medal in 1828, and elected <lb/>
her "to the extraordinary distinction of an honorary <lb/>
membership." In the "Address," made at the time <lb/>
of the presentation of the medal, J. South, Esq., <lb/>
after enumerating the vast and valuable labors of <lb/>
Sir William Herschel, asked: "Who participated <lb/>
in his toils? Who braved with him the inclemency <lb/>
of the weather? Who shared his privations? A <lb/>
female. Who was she? His sister. Miss Herschel <lb/>
it was who, by <hi rend="italic">night,</hi> acted as his amanuensis. She <lb/>
it was whose pen conveyed to paper his <reg orig="observa-|tions">observations</reg> <lb/>
as they fell from his lips.&hellip; She it was who, <lb/>
having passed the night near the instrument, took <lb/>
the rough manuscripts to her cottage at the dawn <lb/>
of day, and produced a fair copy of the night's <lb/>
work on the following morning. She it was who <lb/>
planned the labor of each succeeding night. She <lb/>
<pb n="243" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0249"/>
it was who reduced every observation, made every <lb/>
calculation. She it was who arranged every thing <lb/>
in systematic order; and she it was who helped <lb/>
him to obtain his imperishable name." Then, after <lb/>
describing Miss Herschel's independent discoveries <lb/>
of eight comets, and of many nebul&aelig;, Mr. South <lb/>
added: "Indeed, in looking at the joint labors of <lb/>
these extraordinary personages, we scarcely know <lb/>
whether most to admire the intellectual power of <lb/>
the brother or the unconquerable industry of <lb/>
the sister."</p>
<p>With the finishing of the above-named catalogue <lb/>
Miss Herschel's astronomical labors ended. <reg orig="Hence-|forth">Henceforth</reg> <lb/>
she lived in great simplicity, yet comfortably, <lb/>
on an annuity left her by her brother. She spent <lb/>
her time in receiving the many distinguished <reg orig="vis-|itors">visitors</reg> <lb/>
who called to do her honor; in reading, in <lb/>
corresponding with her nephew, her brother's widow, <lb/>
and her friends; in visiting and being visited by <lb/>
the local nobility and royalty. She was also a <reg orig="con-|stant">constant</reg> <lb/>
visitor at the theater and public concerts. All <lb/>
her physical and social wants were abundantly met. <lb/>
Yet the old lady was not really happy. A vein of <lb/>
restlessness and dissatisfaction with life runs like a <lb/>
darksome thread through her correspondence. She <lb/>
was often ill, a result no doubt of her former labors <lb/>
<pb n="244" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0250"/>
at night, in cold and wet&mdash;sometimes, it is said, <lb/>
when the cold was so intense as to freeze the ink <lb/>
with which she was writing. These illnesses became <lb/>
more frequent as she neared her end, which was <lb/>
not reached until she had attained the venerable <lb/>
age of ninety-eight. She suffered but little in her <lb/>
last illness, and "went to sleep at last with scarcely <lb/>
a struggle." Her nephew, who saw her die, wrote:</p>
<p>"I felt almost a sense of joyful relief at the death <lb/>
of my aunt, in the thought that now the unquiet heart <lb/>
was at rest.&hellip; She lived altogether in the past; <lb/>
and she found the present not only strange but <lb/>
annoying."</p>
<p>Why was Miss Herschel's heart <hi rend="italic">"unquiet?"</hi> <lb/>
Why did she find life <hi rend="italic">"annoying!"</hi> Why did she <lb/>
live "altogether in the past?" To these questions <lb/>
there can be but one answer. She lacked the chief <lb/>
joy of life&mdash;the faith by which the soul lives in <lb/>
fellowship with God. She was eminently virtuous; <lb/>
her pursuits were elevating, and followed with <reg orig="un-|excelled">unexcelled</reg> <lb/>
industry; she was endowed with rare gifts; <lb/>
her sister-love was pure and beautiful. But there <lb/>
is no sign in all her Recollections, journals, or <reg orig="cor-|respondence">correspondence</reg>, <lb/>
that she knew aught of religion beyond <lb/>
its theories and forms. Had she to her excellencies <lb/>
of mind, and to the sisterly affection of her gifted <lb/>
<pb n="245" entity="Wise_SomeRemarkableWomen_0251"/>
soul, which always yearned for love, added the love <lb/>
of Christ, she would for her inquietude have had <lb/>
rest; her annoyances would have left her spirit <reg orig="un-|ruffled">unruffled</reg>; <lb/>
and, instead of living in the past, she would <lb/>
have lived in joyful anticipation of a blissful future. <lb/>
She did well in loving her brother. She would <lb/>
have done better had she loved him with a love <lb/>
less idolatrous, and concentrated her affections in <lb/>
Him who is infinitely better than the best of human <lb/>
brothers. "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God <lb/>
with all thy heart," is a command which, had she <lb/>
obeyed it, would have calmed and sweetened her <lb/>
troubled life.</p>
