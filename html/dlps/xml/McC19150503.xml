            Dear Paul:
            </salute></opener>
        		
        		<p>
            Your card
            just received and I
            presume that by
            now you have the
            letter I sent back
            by Andrew for you.
            Oh, yes I got your
            letter and the address
            is quite right.  Your 
            postal took seven 
            days to arrive.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            I’m awfully 
            glad you are en route
            for reforme and
            hope it goes through
            soon. 
                        
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            We had a hell of a
            fight out here the
            other night with
            the result that
            four trenches were
            taken and a hundred
            and fifty Boches.  I
            saw them right <reg orig="after=|wards">afterwards</reg>.  
            They were the
            “crummiest” looking lot
            you ever saw and
            afraid they were
            going to get killed.
            a
            A Sarge^nt kept saying
            “Nicht capute!” Don’t 
            kill me.  When they
            saw us they had a
            fit thinking us
            English.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            I’ve never heard
                        
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            such a racket as
            the artillery made.
            When it was going
            strong I thought
            there wouldn’t be a
            tree standing or a
            stone on top of
            another.  We work
            between the artillery
            and the trenches
            so get the benefit
            of the racket.&mdash;
            And it was some
            racket as you
            know.  A flock of
            aeros were up all
            day and as a 
            result we had a
            few balls of shrapnel
                        
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            drop down near us
            when the anti air
            craft guns went off.
            A shell burst fifty
            feet back of one 
            of our fellows while
            he was running his
            ambulance after wounded
            and last night an
            eclat of an obus
            tore off the front
            of the top of Davis’
            car.  It missed his
            bean by ten inches.
            And lifted his car
            over on two wheels,
            so close was the
            explosion.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            We have many evacuation
                        
            <pb n="[p.5]"/>
            
            cases besides our
            work back of the
            trenches and some
            of the rides are 
            quite beautiful.  We
            follow the winding
            course of a beautiful
            river.  The road
            runs at the side
            of the velvet green
            bottom lands and
            between rows of
            beautiful tall trees
            that are now covered
            with the delicate
            green of spring.  The 
            hillsides have that
            entrancing miniature
            gardenlike appearance that
                        
            <pb n="[p.6]"/>
            
            the patches of green grass,
            brown soil, and
            yellow mustard plants
            give.  Its all very
            very pretty and 
            makes one appreciate
            living.  I believe I have
            said before that one
            has to leave Paris to
            realize fully the 
            meaning of “La Belle
            France.”
        		</p>
        		<p>
            The Boches have
            established a regular
            schedule for us at
            our base now and
            we know when to
            expect the shells
            to come in.  Its
                        
            <pb n="[p.7]"/>
            
            different up here
            where we’re so near.
            The soldiers that rest
            from the trenches prefer
            to be back in them
            as far as safety is
            concerned at our
            advance point.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            I carried my first
            Boche the other day.
            He was in the hell
            of a mess and
            croaked soon after
            getting to the hospital.
            You see its quite
            impossible to give
            anything but very
            superficial aid out
            here and the men
                        
            <pb n="[p.8]"/>
            
            that are not strong
            and who are very
            badly wounded can’t 
            make the grade.
            The worst thing now
            is the damned
            crapoullot [sic--crapouillot].  You know 
            the little cans one 
            lights with a cigarette
            and tosses over into
            the other fellows 
            trench.  The wounds
            are horrible.  In one
            place here the trenches
            are only thirty inches
            apart.  A soldier back
            from there told me
            they put a sand
            bag up and the 
                        
            <pb n="[p.9]"/>
            
            Germans swiped it.
            The French got another,
            held it up, and
            when the German reached
            across another Frenchman
            clouted him over
            the dome with a
            shovel.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            Often the Boches
            yell out: “Eh Comarade”
            and the French used
            to fall for it thinking
            they were going to
            give them selves up.
            When they looked out
            a hail of crapoullots [sic]
            would meet them.
            Dirty bunch those
            Germans.
                        
            <pb n="[p.10]"/>
            
            God knows when they 
            will be shoved back
            tho [sic].

            Don’t forget the
            sideboard and the
            twin carafes that
            always go with

            By the way I

            has promised me I
            may call on her at
            night and [cause

            jardin.]  I get about
            two nights off a 
            week and have a 
            way of sneaking into
            my billet after eight
            so here’s where I 
            improve my French.
            I suppose it will 
            end in a dose, 
            but trust not.
