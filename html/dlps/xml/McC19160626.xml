            <salute>Dear Paul:</salute>
        		</opener>
        		
            <p>
            Sometime ago I received a
            letter from Sudbury asking me
            if you had received the socks he
            sent you.  I have until now forgotten
            to mention it to you.  His address
            is E.H. Sudbury 343 B’way. N.Y.C.
            </p><p>
            Kiffin, Balsley, Johnson and I
            passed sergeant to day.  Poor, old
            Victor as well but it doesn’t help
            him any now.  What with Thaw and
            Balsley and Chapman I’ll make a guess
            that some of the parade loving chaps
            in the A.A. that were thinking of
            joining the aviation are figuring that
            it will sound well to say their
            country calls them and hie [sic] back to
            the land that likes only picnic wars.
            </p><p>
            I’m sorry that Mrs. Weeks
            has been ill and trust she is
            quite all right now.
            </p><p>
            We expect Skipper here any
            time now.
            </p><p>
            Is Williams back on the job?
            Did you ever run across the half tone
            of sentry in listning [sic] post?
            </p><p>
            By the way I asked Havi to
            send you a book I had left at
            Pau.  Hope you won’t mind looking
            out for it for me.
            </p><p>
            Old Norman Prince is not a bad
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001108_0186" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            sort at all.  He’s serious and works
            hard and tho [sic] crazy as a loon means
            well all the time.
            </p><p>
            Be sure and come out here if
            you can.  We may move north for
            the coming fight and then you
            couldn’t get out near us.
            </p><p>
            What happened to friend Noel?
            I see Decker thinks he’s aerial
            editor for the moment.
            </p>
