                <p>The President then gave his customary report. Much of it was given over to an
                    account of the State's budgetary problems and their affect on the University.
                    The President reported, too, on the 2020 initiatives and how they are being
                    affected by the budgetary shortfalls, even though the 2020 initiatives assume
                    "mixed funding," which is to say a mixture of public and private support.</p>
                <p><name>Mr. Ross</name> suggested that the Board have periodic, regularly
                    scheduled, discussions of the 2020 initiatives. Finally, the President announced
                    a $52.6m bequest, the second largest gift ever made to the University. The
                    bequest was made by the late <name>Ward Buchanan, Law</name> '14, who died in
                    1942. It comes from a trust that was set up to benefit the University after the
                    last of a list of heirs died. The bequest will create an unrestricted endowment
                    fund for the Medical Center and initially will produce $2.5million a year,
                    though the amount is expected to increase as the endowment's assets
                    increase.</p>
