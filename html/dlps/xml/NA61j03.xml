      <title>Letter from Adelaide E. Case to Charles N. Tenney, 3 October 1861</title>
     </bibl>
    </head>

    <p>Addie apologizes for writing in pencil, assuring Charlie that this does not indicate a change
     in her feelings for him, but merely her lack of a pen and her need to write immediately as she
     has the chance to send the letter by Captain Aspen. She wonders what he is doing, and is quite
     anxious about him, having a "presentiment of evil" which she is struggling to overcome. She
     encloses a gift she has made for him, and urges him to come visit soon. She also expresses
     anxiety for and a wish to see Hal.</p>
