    </opener>
    <p> Do you know<lb/> how sweet those three word sound<lb/> to me? and also how dear?<lb/> No
     wonder I love to linger on these words<lb/> but I <hi rend="underline">must</hi> turn to other
     subjects.<lb/> I must give you an account of my "days<lb/> works." I have been engaged, (I
     think) in<lb/> a good work to day.. not as <hi rend="underline">noble</hi> a<lb/> work as <hi
      rend="underline">you</hi> are engaged in, but it is<lb/> the best that I could do. I have
     been<lb/> to the "Soldiers Aid Society" working <hi rend="underline">real hard</hi><lb/> Do I
     hear your approval? Oh: <hi rend="underline">how</hi> I wish<lb/> you could have been there.. It
     is really<lb/> amusing to see old and young gathered<lb/> in the "Union Hall" for the
     benefit<lb/> of the soldiers. Here in one corner of the<lb/> "Hall" sits a group of "Mecca
     Belles"<lb/> busily sewing bandages or some garment or<lb/>
     <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0056"/> perhaps "scraping lint." I hope you will<lb/> never
     see that, and in another place sits<lb/> the "young married people" engaged in<lb/> the same
     way, while the older<sic corr="ladies">laidies</sic><lb/> are standing over the table and stove
     cooking<lb/> chickens to send to the hospitals, What<lb/> a dreadful night last night was for
     the<lb/> four "chickees" A perfect massacre <sic corr="By" resp="h1">Bye</sic> the<lb/> way
     Charlie do you not think it a wise<lb/> idea, that of canning chickens for the sick<lb/>
     soldiers, now when some supplies arrive from<lb/>
     <name type="place">Cleveland</name> for the hospital just "play<lb/> sick" a little while long
     enough to get<lb/> some "Mecca goodies" But Charlie will<lb/> not do so will he? dont mind
     me<lb/> this time, Dear Charlie, do you wonder<lb/> at my little simple letters. <name
      type="person">Laurie</name> has<lb/> just been here and she would read<corr resp="unknown"
      sic="this">it</corr><lb/> I know just by the smile she had<lb/> on her face that she thought
     there was<lb/> simplicity enough about this, and perhaps<lb/> a slight attack of silliness. May
     be so<lb/> but I have tried to make my letters<lb/>
     <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0057"/> as cheerful as possible so that you<lb/> would not get
     homesick. Let <name type="person">Laurie</name> look<lb/> if she wants<sic corr="to" resp="h1"
      >too</sic>, do you care?<lb/>
    </p>
    <p> Our school closes tomorrow. I do<lb/> not regret that it does for our teacher<lb/> has been
     so faithful in his instructions<lb/> to <name type="person">
      <unclear>Miss Hezles</unclear>
     </name> that he has neglected<lb/> his other scholars, therefore I do not feel<lb/> much
      edified <name type="person">Sadie</name> says that he is<lb/> not handsome but "fine looking"
     might be<lb/> appropriately applied to him, any way his<lb/> mouth is crooked. I may be allowed
     the<lb/> expression as our minister used it, that<lb/> he had been kissed so much his
     mouth<lb/> had been drawn to one side<lb/>
    </p>
    <p> Oh: what a benevolent town <name type="place">Mecca</name> is.<lb/> We have had four
     donations here from the<lb/> four different ministers that watch over<lb/> their flocks and now
     we are to have<lb/> one for <name type="person">Mr Duncan</name> the
     singing <unclear>teacher</unclear><lb/> that was.<lb/>

    <p>
     <name type="person">Hallie</name> is in <name type="place">Warren</name> again studying.
     How<lb/> much better it seems to <hi rend="underline">know</hi> that he<lb/>

     making an<lb/> awful sputtering. first it will flash <unclear>out</unclear> and<lb/> give
      a <unclear>"splat"</unclear> and then repeat it, but <name type="person">Laurie</name><lb/> is
     getting frightened and has blown it out<lb/>
    </p>
    <p>
     <hi rend="underline">Oil city is not dead</hi> There are some wells<lb/> in<sic

     ever<lb/> were known <name type="person">Mr Wilbur</name> also has started<lb/> a well which
     yields the liquid money as<lb/> well as any on his farm. But as you pass<lb/> along you would
     not know that such a<lb/> thing as "Mecca Oil" was ever known only<lb/> by the deserted
     shanties which stare at you<lb/> and an occasional glimpse of the steam<lb/>
     <unclear>puffing</unclear> out of the roof of their engine<lb/> houses. There are but few wells
     in opperation<lb/> at present, but what are<sic corr="yield">yeild</sic> very plentifully<lb/>
     The war excitement has mounted the throne<lb/> in precedence of the oil excitement.<lb/>
