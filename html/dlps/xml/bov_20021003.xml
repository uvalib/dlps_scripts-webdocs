                    public college in Southwest Virginia. The college was founded as Clinch Valley
                    College, at first a two-year institution under the aegis of the University, then
                    a four year baccalaureate institution and more recently The University of
                    Virginia's College at Wise.</p>
                <p>The chair, to be known as the Kenneth Asbury Professorship in History, is being
                    established by the Kenneth Asbury Professorship in History Fund, which was
                    created with a lead gift from the late <name>Mrs. Lelia Maude Richmond</name>
