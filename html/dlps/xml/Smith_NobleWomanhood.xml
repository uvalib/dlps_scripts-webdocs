PRINCESS ALICE, GRAND <lb/>
DUCHESS OF HESSE.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> beautiful and devoted life of the Princess <lb/>
Alice, crowned as it was by her pathetic and <lb/>
premature death, will ever remain a cherished <lb/>
memory with the English people. From the <lb/>
tragic elements of human existence, the palace is <lb/>
no more exempt than the cottage; but, happily <lb/>
also, it affords an equal field for the display of <lb/>
those Christian graces and virtues which are the <lb/>
flower of true womanhood. Whether she had been <lb/>
called to an exalted or a humble sphere, the <reg orig="Prin-|cess">Princess</reg> <lb/>
Alice must have furnished a striking <reg orig="illustra-|tion">illustration</reg> <lb/>
of the divine law of love and truth. From her <lb/>
youth up, she realized the blessedness of the sweet <lb/>
spirit of self-sacrifice, and her life was consistently <lb/>
regulated by the lofty principles of that religion <lb/>
which was ever with her a vital force.</p>
<p>The third child and second daughter of Queen <lb/>
Victoria, and Albert, Prince Consort, she was born <lb/>
<pb n="8" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0012"/>
at Buckingham Palace on April 25,1843. Not <lb/>
long after her daughter's birth, the Queen wrote to <lb/>
her uncle, King Leopold&mdash; "Albert has been, as <lb/>
usual, all kindness and goodness. Our little baby <lb/>
is to be called Alice, an old English name, and the <lb/>
other names are to be Maud &lpar;another old English <lb/>
name, and the same as Matilda&rpar;, and Mary, as she <lb/>
was born on Aunt Gloucester's birthday. The <lb/>
sponsors are to be the King of Hanover, Ernestus <lb/>
Primus &lpar;afterwards Duke of Coburg&rpar;, poor Princess <lb/>
Sophia Matilda, and Feodore, and the christening <lb/>
is to be on June 2." The Princess Sophia Matilda <lb/>
was sister-in law to the Duchess of Gloucester, and <lb/>
the Princess Feodore, of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, <lb/>
was half-sister to the Queen. The King of <reg orig="Han-|over">Hanover</reg> <lb/>
arrived too late to be present at the interesting <lb/>
ceremony, which, as the Queen reported to her <lb/>
uncle, "went off very brilliantly. Nothing could <lb/>
be in better taste, and little Alice behaved <reg orig="ex-|tremely">extremely</reg> <lb/>
well."</p>
<p>The childhood of the Princess was a very happy <lb/>
one, as indeed it could scarcely fail to be when her <lb/>
Royal parents were not only devoted to each <lb/>
other, but brought up their children to regard <lb/>
home life as the centre of the purest joys and <lb/>
affections. How the Princess herself regarded <lb/>
these early years was shown in a letter written but <lb/>
a brief period before her death, when she said, "I <lb/>
ever look back to my childhood and girlhood as <lb/>
the happiest time of my life." Whether for youth <lb/>
or maiden, there can be no better preparation for <lb/>
a good and useful career than a childhood hallowed <lb/>
by tender home associations. It was the rare <lb/>
<pb n="9" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0013"/>
fortune of the Princess Alice to have a father who <lb/>
was not only distinguished for strength of character <lb/>
and a fearless and energetic intellect, but one who <lb/>
was able to train and encourage his children in the <lb/>
higher virtues. Destiny wove especially close <lb/>
bonds between the Prince Consort and the Princess <lb/>
Alice, and the daughter repaid, by her profound <lb/>
devotion, much of the love and tenderness she <lb/>
received in her youth.</p>
<p>The high mental qualities for which the Princess <lb/>
was distinguished in later life were not developed <lb/>
very early. She was a good and merry child, <lb/>
courageous and affectionate, and "the beauty of <lb/>
the family," as her father said. But no one thought <lb/>
her highly gifted, and we are told that the Prince <lb/>
Consort often used to speak of her as "poor dear <lb/>
little Alice," as though he had to take her part. But <lb/>
her character opened out naturally and gradually, <lb/>
and in the course of a few years she became a <lb/>
general favourite. Up to the year 1851, Lady <lb/>
Lyttelton had charge of the education and training <lb/>
of the Royal children, so that for eight years she <lb/>
was constantly with the Princess, and has borne <lb/>
testimony to her bright, happy disposition, her <lb/>
beauty, and her affectionate ways. Like her <lb/>
brothers and sisters, she saw little of Court life <lb/>
until she grew up; for it was always the Queen's <lb/>
wish that her children should know most of the <lb/>
homely joys and companionship of the family <lb/>
circle. To the training of childhood succeeded <lb/>
that of English, French, and German governesses, <lb/>
under the supervision of a lady superintendent.</p>
<p>The Empress Frederick, in communicating some <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0014"/>
interesting memoranda for the authorized <reg orig="me-|morial">memorial</reg> <lb/>
volume on the Princess Alice, speaks of her <lb/>
sister's decided talent in music, drawing, etc., and <lb/>
her delight in outdoor games. "Her copybooks <lb/>
were always neatness itself, and she wrote a very <lb/>
pretty hand." "Fresh, blooming, and healthy, <lb/>
escaping most of the illnesses of childhood, cheerful, <lb/>
merry, full of fun and mischief, she delighted in all <lb/>
bodily exercises, such as gymnastics, skating, etc. <lb/>
Above all, she was passionately fond of riding, and <lb/>
of horses. She preferred playing with her brothers, <lb/>
and was bold and fearless as a boy. With all this, <lb/>
however, she soon showed proofs of real kindness <lb/>
of heart, and of tender consideration for others." <lb/>
"I well remember," a former dresser of the Queen <lb/>
relates, "meeting the Royal children playing in <lb/>
the corridor; and, as I passed on, the Prince of <lb/>
Wales making a joke about my great height, the <lb/>
Princess said to her brothers, but so that I should <lb/>
hear it, 'It is very nice to be tall; Papa would <lb/>
like us all to be tall.' Her kindness of heart <lb/>
showed itself in all her actions when a child. <lb/>
Whenever she in the least suspected that <reg orig="any-|body's">anybody's</reg> <lb/>
feelings had been hurt, she always tried to <lb/>
make things smooth again. At Christmas-time, <lb/>
she was most anxious to give pleasure to <reg orig="every-|body">everybody</reg>, <lb/>
and bought presents for them with her own <lb/>
pocket-money."</p>
<p>When the Queen and the Prince Consort paid <lb/>
their memorable visit to Ireland, in August, 1849, <lb/>
the Princess Alice was one of the Royal children <lb/>
who accompanied them, this being her first <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg> <lb/>
journey. From Belfast the illustrious <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0015"/>
visitors sailed for the Highlands of Scotland, <lb/>
eventually arriving at that most cherished spot, <lb/>
Balmoral. The delight of the young Princess here <lb/>
was unbounded, and she paid another visit to <reg orig="Bal-|moral">Balmoral</reg> <lb/>
with her parents in the autumn of 1850. <lb/>
From this time dates the Princess Alice's undying <lb/>
affection for the magnificent scenery of Scotland, <lb/>
and for her mother's Highland home.</p>
<p>From an early period, the Princess distinguished <lb/>
herself in those little festive entertainments and <lb/>
theatrical performances which were always an <lb/>
agreeable feature in the recreations of the Royal <lb/>
Family. It is said that she was a bewitching <reg orig="Ger-|man">German</reg> <lb/>
Red Riding-Hood, and that she played the <lb/>
part of the high priest Joad in Racine's <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">Athalie</hi></foreign> <lb/>
with real dignity. At a performance given in 1854, <lb/>
in honour of her Majesty's wedding-day, a tableau <lb/>
was produced, representing the Four Seasons, which <lb/>
had been studied and contrived by the Royal <lb/>
children. Baroness Bunsen, who was present, <lb/>
writes: "First appeared Princess Alice as Spring, <lb/>
scattering flowers and reciting verses, which were <lb/>
taken from Thomson's <hi rend="italic">Seasons;</hi> she moved <reg orig="grace-|fully">gracefully</reg>, <lb/>
and spoke in a distinct and pleasing manner, <lb/>
with excellent modulation, and a tone of voice <lb/>
sweet and penetrating, like that of the Queen." <lb/>
Princess Louise of Prussia&mdash;afterwards <reg orig="Grand-|Duchess">Grand-Duchess</reg> <lb/>
of Baden&mdash;whose friendship with the <lb/>
Princess Alice began at this early period, thus <lb/>
writes of her: "She was at that time most graceful <lb/>
in appearance, charming, merry, and amiable; and <lb/>
though always occupying a subordinate place to <lb/>
her very gifted and distinguished sister, there never <lb/>
<pb n="12" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0016"/>
was the least semblance of a disagreement. Alice's <lb/>
cheerful disposition, and her great power of <reg orig="obser-|vation">observation</reg>, <lb/>
showed themselves very early in the <reg orig="plea-|santest">pleasantest</reg> <lb/>
manner, and she had a remarkable gift of <lb/>
making herself attractive to others. Her <reg orig="indi-|viduality">individuality</reg> <lb/>
was less decided and prominent than that <lb/>
of her sister, and she had a special charm of <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg> <lb/>
grace. Our walks and drives together, the <lb/>
life in the schoolroom, the games in the corridors, <lb/>
or in dear old Baron Stockmar's room, these and <lb/>
all the pleasure and enjoyment of being together <lb/>
with the two sisters, will ever remain amongst the <lb/>
happiest and most lasting of my recollections."</p>
<p>After an attack of scarlet fever, which the <reg orig="Prin-|cess">Princess</reg> <lb/>
had in 1855, she was delicate for some time; <lb/>
but the healthful outdoor life at Osborne, with <lb/>
the household and gardening work, in which she <lb/>
and her sisters delighted at the Swiss Cottage, had <lb/>
a beneficial effect upon her. Both here and at <lb/>
Balmoral, the Royal children were permitted, and <lb/>
even encouraged, to visit the humblest cottagers, <lb/>
so that their hearts were soon touched with a real <lb/>
pity for the poor, which formed an outlet in <reg orig="prac-|tical">practical</reg> <lb/>
sympathy. As regards the effect upon the <lb/>
Princess Alice, her biographer says: "We know <lb/>
how these early impressions led in later life to her <lb/>
founding some of the noblest and most beneficent <lb/>
institutions. The blessings of a happy family life <lb/>
&mdash;which generally those only are allowed to enjoy <lb/>
who live in happy obscurity from the great world&mdash; <lb/>
were fully appreciated by the Princess, as we may <lb/>
see from her later letters, abounding in gratitude <lb/>
to her parents and brothers and sisters, and from <lb/>
<pb n="13" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0017"/>
the frequent references which she makes to this <lb/>
period of her life." When the Princess Royal <lb/>
married Prince Frederick William of Prussia, in <lb/>
1858, a change came over the life of the Princess <lb/>
Alice. She was now the eldest daughter at home, <lb/>
and acquired a greater sense of responsibility in <lb/>
consequence. Her father entered more closely <lb/>
still into her musical and artistic studies, as well as <lb/>
her more serious occupations. She was prepared <lb/>
for confirmation by the Dean of Windsor, the Hon. <lb/>
and Very Rev. G. Wellesley; and the Prince <reg orig="Con-|sort">Consort</reg> <lb/>
himself gave her supplementary instructions, <lb/>
in order to encourage her to serious reflections on <lb/>
religious questions. The confirmation ceremony <lb/>
was performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, <lb/>
on April 21, 1859, and the Queen wrote <reg orig="concern-|ing">concerning</reg> <lb/>
the event to the King of the Belgians: "She <lb/>
was in a most devotional state of mind, quiet, <lb/>
gentle, self-possessed, and deeply impressed by the <lb/>
importance and solemnity of the event. She <lb/>
answered admirably at the examination, and went <lb/>
through the ceremony in a very perfect manner." <lb/>
It is interesting to find her Majesty writing thus <lb/>
further of her daughter about this time: "She is <lb/>
very good, gentle, sensible, and amiable, and a real <lb/>
comfort to me. I shall not let her marry as long <lb/>
as I can reasonably delay her doing so."</p>
<p>But the destined bridegroom soon appeared upon <lb/>
the scene. In June, 1860, the Queen and Prince <lb/>
Consort received numerous guests at Windsor, and <lb/>
amongst them was Prince Louis of Hesse, son of <lb/>
Prince Charles, and nephew of the reigning <reg orig="Grand-|Duke">Grand-Duke</reg>. <lb/>
After he left England, the Prince Consort <lb/>
<pb n="14" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0018"/>
confided to his friend Baron Stockmar, that the <lb/>
young couple had formed a mutual liking, which <lb/>
he expected would lead to further advances from <lb/>
the young Prince's family. In November, 1860, <lb/>
Prince Louis was again received at Windsor Castle, <lb/>
and in her diary for November 30,the Queen penned <lb/>
this simple picture of the wooing of the Princess <lb/>
Alice: "After dinner, while talking to the <reg orig="gentle-|men">gentlemen</reg>, <lb/>
I perceived Alice and Louis talking before the <lb/>
fireplace more earnestly than usual, and, when I <lb/>
passed to go to the other room, both came up to me, <lb/>
and Alice in much agitation said he had proposed to <lb/>
her, and he begged for my blessing. I could only <lb/>
squeeze his hand, and say, 'Certainly,' and that we <lb/>
would see him in our room later. Got through the <lb/>
evening, working as well as we could. Alice came <lb/>
to our room, agitated, but quiet. Albert sent for <lb/>
Louis to his room&mdash;went first to him, and then <lb/>
called Alice and me in.&hellip; Louis has a warm, <lb/>
noble heart. We embraced our dear Alice, and <lb/>
praised her much to him. He pressed and kissed <lb/>
my hand, and I embraced him. After talking a <lb/>
little we parted&mdash;a most touching and to me most <lb/>
sacred moment."</p>
<p>Three days afterwards &lpar;December 3&rpar;, the Prince <lb/>
wrote to Baron Stockmar:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Close on the heels of my last letter comes this, <lb/>
to announce to you the betrothal of Alice to the <lb/>
Prince Louis of Hesse. You, like ourselves, will <lb/>
have expected this event, but you will not the less <lb/>
share our joy at it, when you are told that the <lb/>
young people are sincerely attached to each other, <lb/>
and justify the hope that they will one day find <lb/>
<pb n="15" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0019"/>
their mutual happiness in marriage. We like <lb/>
Louis better every day, because of his unaffectedly <lb/>
genial and cordial temper, his great modesty, and <lb/>
a very child-like nature, united with strict morality, <lb/>
and genine goodness and dignity."</p>
<p>The Christmas of 1860 was the last unbroken <lb/>
celebration of that joyous festival by the Royal <lb/>
Family of England. Prince Louis remained over <lb/>
the auspicious season, and returned to Darmstadt <lb/>
on December 28. He left a happy heart behind <lb/>
him, however, for it was understood that he <lb/>
would again see his betrothed in the spring. <lb/>
But there was much sorrow to pass through <lb/>
before the young couple were united in the <lb/>
marital bonds. In the spring of 1861, her <lb/>
Majesty's mother, the Duchess of Kent, passed <lb/>
away, and the loving ministrations of her <reg orig="grand-|daughter">granddaughter</reg>, <lb/>
the Princess Alice, furnished the first <lb/>
illustration of the latter's special fitness as the <lb/>
helper of others in the time of sorrow and <reg orig="afflic-|tion">affliction</reg>. <lb/>
Next, Prince Louis, who arrived at Osborne <lb/>
in May, on a visit, caught the measles from Prince <lb/>
Leopold, and for a time was seriously ill. <reg orig="Mean-|while">Meanwhile</reg>, <lb/>
Parliament had been informed of the <reg orig="con-|templated">contemplated</reg> <lb/>
marriage of the Princess, and the news <lb/>
was received with satisfaction by the nation. <lb/>
When the question of the Princess's settlement <lb/>
came before the House of Commons, a dowry of <lb/>
&pound;30,000, with an annuity of &pound;6000, was voted <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
a dissentient voice. In September, the lovers <lb/>
again met, and spent a delightful time at Balmoral.</p>
<p>But before the year closed, gloom settled over <lb/>
the Royal house. Early in December, the Prince <lb/>
<pb n="16" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0020"/>
Consort fell ill, and from the moment his illness <lb/>
assumed a threatening aspect the Princess Alice <lb/>
scarcely left his bedside, the result being that her <lb/>
own health was greatly impaired. Unmistakable <lb/>
signs soon appeared that the Prince was suffering <lb/>
from gastric or low fever, and physical and mental <lb/>
depression supervened. However, he liked to be read <lb/>
to, and this was always done by the Princess Alice, <lb/>
who selected for the purpose "The Talisman," <lb/>
and other favourite works. On December 8&mdash;the <lb/>
last Sunday the Prince spent on earth&mdash;a piano <lb/>
was conveyed into the room adjoining the invalid's <lb/>
chamber, and the Princess Alice played, "A strong <lb/>
tower is our God." The Prince listened with tears <lb/>
in his eyes, and his gaze fixed upwards with a <lb/>
sweet expression. During the next five or six <lb/>
days there were many touching and affectionate <lb/>
scenes between the sufferer and his "dear little <lb/>
wife," but on the 14th he entered into rest. As <lb/>
he passed away, the Queen knelt on one side of <lb/>
the bed, holding her husband's hand. On the other <lb/>
side of the bed was the Princess Alice, while at <lb/>
its foot knelt the Prince of Wales and the Princess <lb/>
Helena. We read in the Princess Alice's Memoirs:&mdash;</p>
<p>"During the days of unspeakable sorrow which <lb/>
followed upon the death of the Prince Consort, it <lb/>
was Princess Alice above all who was a real <lb/>
support to her broken-hearted mother. The <lb/>
unanimous opinion of eye-witnesses as to what <lb/>
the Princess went through and achieved at this <lb/>
time is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>"Herself filled with intensest sorrow at her <lb/>
beloved father's death&mdash;and what a father! what <lb/>
<pb n="17" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0021"/>
a head of a family! what a friend and adviser to <lb/>
his wife and children!&mdash;she at once took into her <lb/>
own hands everything that was necessary in those <lb/>
first dark days of the destruction of that happy <lb/>
home. All communications from the ministers and <lb/>
household passed through the Princess's hands to <lb/>
the Queen&mdash;then bowed down by grief. She <lb/>
endeavoured in every way possible, either verbally <lb/>
or by writing, to save her mother all trouble. The <lb/>
decision to leave Windsor for Osborne directly <lb/>
after the Prince's death, according to the urgent <lb/>
wish of the King of the Belgians, and which it <lb/>
was so difficult and painful for the Queen to make, <lb/>
was obtained by the Princess's influence.</p>
<p>"The gay, bright girl seemed all at once to have <lb/>
changed into the thoughtful woman.</p>
<p>"It was the very intimate intercourse with the <lb/>
sorrowing Queen at that time which called forth <lb/>
in Princess Alice that keen interest and <reg orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg> <lb/>
in politics for which she was afterwards <lb/>
so distinguished. She also gained at this time <lb/>
that practical knowledge for organizing, and the <lb/>
desire for constant occupation, which in her public <lb/>
as well as in her private life became part of herself. <lb/>
The Princess suddenly developed into a wise, <reg orig="far-|seeing">farseeing</reg> <lb/>
woman, living only for others, and beloved <lb/>
and respected by the highest as well as by the <lb/>
lowest."</p>
<p>Life became more serious and earnest than ever <lb/>
to the Princess, after the death of her beloved <lb/>
father, but her happy memories of his affection, <lb/>
and her sense of duty to the living, sustained her, <lb/>
and elevated and refined her character, as gold is <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0022"/>
refined in the crucible. She put herself into the <lb/>
background; but the Queen, knowing the wishes <lb/>
of the dead, desired the preparations for her <lb/>
daughter's marriage to go forward. Accordingly, <lb/>
on July 1, 1862, the wedding was solemnized at <lb/>
Osborne, the Archbishop of York officiating, in <lb/>
consequence of the illness of his brother of <reg orig="Canter-|bury">Canterbury</reg>. <lb/>
After a few days spent in the Isle of <lb/>
Wight, the Prince and Princess Louis of Hesse <lb/>
left England, "accompanied by the fervent prayers <lb/>
and good wishes of a devoted people, who never <lb/>
forgot what their Princess had been to them in <lb/>
their hour of trouble." The Queen felt that, <lb/>
although separated from her daughter, she gained <lb/>
a son in Prince Louis, who had been regarded <lb/>
with warm affection by the Prince Consort almost <lb/>
from the first.</p>
<p>At Darmstadt, the young couple were received <lb/>
with every demonstration of delight and affection, <lb/>
the whole population of the city lining the streets <lb/>
on the day of their arrival. The State which from <lb/>
this time became the home of the Princess was a <lb/>
small one; and the house in which she lived was <lb/>
of a most unpretending character, situated in a <lb/>
quiet quarter of the town, near the palace of Prince <lb/>
Charles of Hesse. She was a stranger in a strange <lb/>
land, but she determined that her husband's home <lb/>
and interests should be hers too, and the power <lb/>
of her individuality soon began to make itself <lb/>
felt everywhere. After visits to Coburg and <lb/>
Auerbach, the Prince and Princess met the Queen <lb/>
at Rheinhardtsbrunn, in September, and returned <lb/>
to Darmstadt in November. Soon after their <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0023"/>
arrival, preparations were made for building a <lb/>
palace for them, after plans designed by the <lb/>
Princess herself. Many were the letters of <reg orig="affec-|tionate">affectionate</reg> <lb/>
'consolation which the Princess wrote <lb/>
during the early years of her married life to her <lb/>
widowed mother. The following extracts from <lb/>
these letters will show the deep tenderness of her <lb/>
nature:&mdash;</p>
<p>"If I could relinquish part of my present <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
to restore to you some of yours, with a full <lb/>
heart would I do it; but God's will be done! <lb/>
God sustain my precious mother! is the hourly <lb/>
prayer of her loving and sympathizing child.</p>
<p>"You tell me to speak to you of my happiness <lb/>
&mdash;our happiness. You will understand the feeling <lb/>
which made me silent towards you, my own dear <lb/>
bereaved mother, on that point; but you are <reg orig="un-|selfish">unselfish</reg> <lb/>
and loving, and can enter into my happiness, <lb/>
though I could never have been the first to tell <lb/>
you how intense it is, when it must draw the <lb/>
painful contrast between your past and present <lb/>
existence. If I say I love my dear husband, that <lb/>
is scarcely enough&mdash;it is a love and esteem which <lb/>
increases daily, hourly; which he also shows to <lb/>
me by such consideration, such tender, loving ways. <lb/>
What was life before to what it has become now? <lb/>
There is such blessed peace being at his side, being <lb/>
his wife; there is such a feeling of security; and <lb/>
we two have a world of our own when we are <lb/>
together, which <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> can touch or intrude upon. <lb/>
My lot is indeed a blessed one; and yet what <lb/>
have I done to deserve that warm, ardent love <lb/>
which my darling Louis ever shows me? I admire <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0024"/>
his good and noble heart more than I can say <lb/>
How he loved you, you know, and he will be a <lb/>
good son to you. He reads to me every day out <lb/>
of 'Westward Ho,' which I think very beautiful <lb/>
and interesting.</p>
<p>"This morning I breakfasted alone, as he went <lb/>
out with his regiment. I always feel quite <reg orig="im-|patient">impatient</reg> <lb/>
until I hear his step coming upstairs, and <lb/>
see his dear face when he returns.</p>
<p>"Yesterday, and the previous night, I thought of <lb/>
you constantly, and of our last journey together to <lb/>
dear Balmoral. Sad, painful, though it was, I <lb/>
liked so much being with you, trying to bear some <lb/>
of your load of sorrow with you. From here I <lb/>
share all as if I were really by your side; and I <lb/>
think so many fervent prayers cannot be offered <lb/>
to a merciful, loving God without His sending <lb/>
alleviation and comfort."</p>
<p>The simplicity of the Princess's life at <reg orig="Darm-|stadt">Darmstadt</reg> <lb/>
is shown in one incident, among others, <lb/>
recorded of her. An English lady of high <reg orig="posi-|tion">position</reg>, <lb/>
residing in the city, received a note from the <lb/>
Princess, saying that she would call and take tea <lb/>
with her the following afternoon. Scarlet cloth, <lb/>
as etiquette seemed to demand, was laid down, <lb/>
and a man was sent to the top of the house to <lb/>
watch for the Royal carriage and give due notice <lb/>
of its approach, so that the Princess might be <lb/>
received at the entrance with all due honours. <lb/>
But up to the time named by the Princess, no <lb/>
carriage of any kind had come in sight. Suddenly <lb/>
a ring at the street door was heard, and a lady <lb/>
attired in a waterproof, and wearing goloshes, made <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0025"/>
her appearance. "I have made a point," she said, <lb/>
"of not treading on your beautiful scarlet cloth;" <lb/>
and she intimated that in future she should be <lb/>
glad to be received, not as a Royal Princess <lb/>
making a State visit, but as a private lady <lb/>
"dropping in" upon a friend.</p>
<p>The Princess begrudged some of the time which <lb/>
drew her from her artistic and musical pursuits, to <lb/>
which she was almost passionately devoted. In <lb/>
the mornings she was obliged to read the <reg orig="news-|papers">newspapers</reg>, <lb/>
a course of State study which was <reg orig="dis-|tasteful">distasteful</reg> <lb/>
to her. Then from eleven to twelve she <lb/>
was engaged with her private secretary. <reg orig="After-|wards">Afterwards</reg> <lb/>
people came constantly to call, so that she <lb/>
had scarcely any leisure or privacy. However, by <lb/>
making a systematic division of the day, she found <lb/>
time to read with her husband, and also to study <lb/>
serious books alone. She discovered that nothing <lb/>
but method would avail to secure a due <reg orig="representa-|tion">representation</reg> <lb/>
of each interest and obligation, public and <lb/>
private, in her daily life.</p>
<p>The Princess spent the first anniversary of her <lb/>
father's death with her Royal mother at Windsor. <lb/>
Her husband came over to England with her, and <lb/>
during his stay in this country paid a number of <lb/>
visits to the chief industrial centres, and to the <lb/>
military arsenals and dep&ocirc;ts. The Prince attended <lb/>
the marriage of the Prince of Wales on March 10, <lb/>
1863, and on April 5 ensuing another happy event <lb/>
occurred by the birth of a daughter to the Prince <lb/>
and Princess Louis of Hesse at Windsor Castle. <lb/>
The child was christened on April 27, and received <lb/>
the names of Victoria Alberta Elizabeth Matilda. <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0026"/>
After her recovery, Princess Alice went for a stay <lb/>
at Osborne, from whence she was able to <reg orig="accom-|pany">accompany</reg> <lb/>
the Queen on her inspection of the Military <lb/>
Hospital at Netley. A brief visit to London <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg>, <lb/>
and then the Prince and Princess Louis <lb/>
returned with their little daughter to Darmstadt. <lb/>
Here the Princess now studied to identify herself still <lb/>
more closely with her husband's people, their lives <lb/>
and their aspirations. In European politics she was <lb/>
strongly German, like her father. She took the <lb/>
part of Prussia in the Schleswig-Holstein difficulty, <lb/>
and she looked forward to a united Germany, <lb/>
"with Prussia at its head, and a Liberal <reg orig="Constitu-|tion">Constitution</reg>." <lb/>
In August, 1863, she had the happiness to <lb/>
receive, on a visit, her Royal mother, and her sisters <lb/>
Helena, Louise, and Beatrice, and her brother <lb/>
Alfred; and there was another meeting of the <lb/>
whole family shortly afterwards at Balmoral. On <lb/>
returning to Darmstadt, in November, the Prince <lb/>
and Princess Louis were able to enter upon the <lb/>
occupation of their new palace.</p>
<p>A typical act of kindness and considerateness <lb/>
on the Princess's part is revealed in one of her <lb/>
letters to the Queen. "You will be amused to <lb/>
hear," she says, "that I have taken a little black <lb/>
&lpar;a Malay&rpar; into my service. He is a dear good <lb/>
boy, was brought over two years ago by a <reg orig="gen-|tleman">gentleman</reg>, <lb/>
to whom he was given away by his own <lb/>
parents, as a mark of gratitude for some <reg orig="ser-|vice">service</reg> <lb/>
done. This man has had him here two <lb/>
years, but has never had him taught anything. <lb/>
He has no religion, and can neither read nor <lb/>
write. I am going to have him taught, and, later, <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0027"/>
christened. He is very intelligent, thirteen years <lb/>
old."</p>
<p>We read of visits to the Darmstadt Hospital, <lb/>
and other acts of a like nature, which the Princess <lb/>
never allowed her social duties and distractions to <lb/>
interfere with. It was as "Protectress" of the <lb/>
Heidenreich Institution for Lying-in Women, that <lb/>
she began to take an active interest in questions <lb/>
of health and sanitary improvement. On November <lb/>
1, 1864, was born her second daughter, Elizabeth <lb/>
Alexandra Louise Alice. She was "very proud <lb/>
of being able to nurse her child herself, and from <lb/>
this time she took up with the keenest interest all <lb/>
questions relating to the physical, mental, and <lb/>
moral training of children." In these remedial <lb/>
efforts she found a sympathizer and helper in Dr. <lb/>
Weber, an eminent medical man of Darmstadt. <lb/>
As patroness of the Heidenreich Institution, all <lb/>
cases of need on the part of poor women had to <lb/>
be reported to the Princess. One sad case she <lb/>
investigated for herself, and the following account <lb/>
of it, which she gave in a letter to the Queen, is <lb/>
probably unexampled in the lives of the Princesses <lb/>
of England: "The other day I went to one <hi rend="italic">incog.</hi> <lb/>
with Christa, in the old part of the town&mdash;and the <lb/>
trouble we had to find the house! At length, <lb/>
through a dirty courtyard, and up a dark ladder, <lb/>
we went into one little room, where lay in one bed <lb/>
the poor woman and her baby; in the room, four <lb/>
other children, the husband, two other beds, and a <lb/>
stove; but it did not smell bad, nor was it dirty. <lb/>
I sent Christa down with the children, then with <lb/>
the husband cooked something for the woman; <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0028"/>
arranged her bed a little, took her baby for her, <lb/>
bathed its eyes&mdash;for they were so bad, poor little <lb/>
thing!&mdash;and did odds and ends for her. I went <lb/>
twice. The people did not know me, and were <lb/>
so nice, so good, and touchingly attached to each <lb/>
other; it did one's heart good to see such good <lb/>
feelings in such poverty. The husband was out <lb/>
of work, the children too young to go to school, <lb/>
and they had only four kreutzers in the house <lb/>
when she was confined. Think of that misery and <lb/>
discomfort!</p>
<p>"If one never sees any poverty, and always lives <lb/>
in that cold circle of Court people, one's good <lb/>
feelings dry up, and I felt the want of going about <lb/>
and doing the little good that is in my power. I <lb/>
am sure you will understand this."</p>
<p>In another letter to her mother, the Princess <lb/>
speaks of reading Froude's "History of England" <lb/>
with her husband, and the beautiful sermons of <lb/>
Robertson, of Brighton, of which she had ordered <lb/>
a German translation. Prince Louis had many <lb/>
duties, military and legislative, but he still found <lb/>
time for intellectual studies with his wife. They <lb/>
breakfasted at half-past eight, dined at two, and <lb/>
took supper at eight, after which the Princess and <lb/>
her ladies worked, read, or played.</p>
<p>The Prince and Princess visited the King and <lb/>
Queen of Prussia at Berlin, in January, 1865, but <lb/>
shortly afterwards Prince Louis sustained a severe <lb/>
loss by the untimely death of his only sister, the <lb/>
young and newly-married Grand Duchess of <lb/>
Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Almost at the same time, <lb/>
the Russian Cesarewitch Nicholas died at Nice. <lb/>

He was engaged to be married to the Princess <lb/>
Dagmar, sister of the Princess of Wales, and <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
Empress of Russia. In the ensuing August, <lb/>
Queen Victoria gathered all her children round <lb/>
her at Coburg, when a statue to the Prince Consort <lb/>
was unveiled in the market-place of that city. <lb/>
Later in the year, the Prince and Princess Louis <lb/>
made a lengthened sojourn in the Highlands. Not <lb/>
long after their return to Germany, the able and <lb/>
estimable King of the Belgians died, so that the <lb/>
year had been one of change and vicissitude. <lb/>
During the following winter, the Princess set on <lb/>
foot many useful enterprises in her adopted <lb/>
country, and glimpses of some of these are <lb/>
furnished in her letters to the Queen. In one <lb/>
letter, this young mother writes: "I have read and <lb/>
studied a great deal about the human body; <lb/>
about children, their treatment, etc. It interests <lb/>
me immensely. Besides, it is always useful to <lb/>
know such things, so that one is not perfectly <lb/>
ignorant of the reasons why doctors wish one to <lb/>
do certain things, and why not. In any moment <lb/>
of illness, before there is time for a doctor to come, <lb/>
one can be able to help one's self a little. I know <lb/>
you don't like these things, and where one is <lb/>
surrounded by such men as dear Sir James Clark <lb/>
and Dr. Jenner, it is perfectly unnecessary, and <lb/>
pleasanter <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to know a good deal. Instead of <lb/>
finding it disgusting, it only fills me with <reg orig="admira-|tion">admiration</reg> <lb/>
to see how wonderfully we are made."</p>
<p>The Princess was much touched by a graceful <lb/>
act on the part of two hundred and fifty of the <lb/>
women of Darmstadt. They subscribed together, <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0030"/>
and sent a German artist to Scotland, to paint a <lb/>
splendid picture of Loch Katrine, which they <reg orig="pre-|sented">presented</reg> <lb/>
to the Princess. In addition to the delicate <lb/>
thought which prompted a present connected with <lb/>
her own country, the feeling which led to the deed <lb/>
touched her deeply.</p>
<p>The year 1866, like its predecessor, was an <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg> <lb/>
one in the life of the Princess and in the <lb/>
history of Prussia. During this year, the Princess <lb/>
realized long-cherished wishes in connection with <lb/>
her new home, and she also enlarged the sphere <lb/>
of her practical usefulness. She founded a special <lb/>
asylum for poor idiots, which was to be available <lb/>
for all who needed it, irrespective of religion or <lb/>
creed. In aid of the scheme, she organized a <lb/>
grand bazaar, in which work she was assisted by <lb/>
her husband and Prince Alfred her brother, and <lb/>
which was quite a novel experience in Germany. <lb/>
The bazaar was thoroughly successful, and realized <lb/>
the handsome sum of 16,000 florins. "In spite of <lb/>
the success of this bazaar," remarks her biographer, <lb/>
Dr. Sell, "the Princess was in later years opposed <lb/>
to the repetition of such an expedient, as she felt, <lb/>
what many do, that people often come on such <lb/>
occasions for their own personal amusement rather <lb/>
than to aid the charity."</p>
<p>A third daughter was born to the Prince and <lb/>
Princess on July 11, 1866, but three days later <lb/>
Prince Louis was compelled to leave his wife, and <lb/>
to go at once into action at Aschaffenburg. The <lb/>
war respecting the Danish provinces was raging at <lb/>
this time, and in consequence of the retreat of the <lb/>
South-German troops, all communication of the <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0031"/>
Prince with his home was for a time cut off. The <lb/>
war caused much sorrow to the Princess, for, while <lb/>
thoroughly German in her hopes and sympathies, <lb/>
there were interests on the other side which deeply <lb/>
affected her. Prince Louis was appointed by the <lb/>
Grand Duke to the command of the Hessian <lb/>
division, then actively engaged in the field, and <lb/>
after a brief visit to Berlin, he took up his quarters <lb/>
at Nierstein-Oppenheim. Here he was joined by <lb/>
the Princess, although there was a severe outbreak <lb/>
of cholera in the place. The little Princess was <lb/>
christened at Darmstadt, on September 12, and <lb/>
received the names of Ir&egrave;ne &lpar;Peace&rpar; Louise Marie <lb/>
Anne. By a happy coincidence, peace was ratified <lb/>
at Berlin on the same day, which was also the <lb/>
birthday of Prince Louis. There was great <reg orig="re-|joicing">rejoicing</reg> <lb/>
in the Darmstadt household over the <reg orig="con-|clusion">conclusion</reg> <lb/>
of the war, which had virtually been a <lb/>
strife between brothers. Prince Louis made a <lb/>
considerable mark during this campaign for his <lb/>
power of organization, and control over the troops. <lb/>
He was constant in his attendance, too, at the <lb/>
various military and civil conferences, and kept <lb/>
firm and judicious order, where previously there <lb/>
had been disorder and great abuse of power.</p>
<p>In these early years, money was not plentiful <lb/>
with the Prince and Princess Louis, and in March, <lb/>
1866, we find the Princess writing to her mother: <lb/>
"We must live so economically, not going <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="any-|where">anywhere</reg>,</hi> <lb/>
or seeing many people, so as to be able to <lb/>
spare as much a year as we can. England cost us <lb/>
a great deal, as the visit was short last time. We <lb/>
have sold four carriage horses, and have only six <lb/>
<pb n="28" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0032"/>
to drive with now, two of which the ladies <reg orig="con-|stantly">constantly</reg> <lb/>
want for the theatre, visits, etc., so we are <lb/>
rather badly off in some things. But I should not <lb/>
bore you with our troubles, which are easy to <lb/>
bear."</p>
<p>Couttses advanced money to pay for the new <lb/>
house, the house being accepted as security. <lb/>
None of these little details are hidden by the <lb/>
Princess, as though they were something of which <lb/>
to be ashamed. Her thrift and carefulness might <lb/>
furnish a valuable lesson to many English <reg orig="house-|holds">households</reg>. <lb/>
In thanking the Queen for a bas-relief of <lb/>
herself and an acceptable present, the Princess <lb/>
writes: "The money will go at once to Louis's <lb/>
man of business towards paying off the furniture, <lb/>
and is, indeed, very, very acceptable, more so <lb/>
under present circumstances than anything else <lb/>
you could give us; and that part of the furniture <lb/>
will then be all your present."</p>
<p>Again she writes to her mother on May 3: "I <lb/>
have made all the summer out-walking dresses, <lb/>
seven in number, with palet&ocirc;ts for the girls, not <lb/>
embroidered, but entirely made from beginning to <lb/>
end; likewise the new necessary flannel shawls for <lb/>
the expected. I manage all the nursery accounts, <lb/>
and everything myself, which gives me plenty to <lb/>
do, as everything increases, and, on account of the <lb/>
house, we must live very economically for these <lb/>
next years.</p>
<p>"It is so kind of you to give Dr. Priestley his fee; <lb/>
otherwise I would have had scruples in giving so <lb/>
large a sum for my own comfort.</p>
<p>"If there is a war then, and Louis is away, what <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0033"/>
shall I do? This is my constant dread and <reg orig="appre-|hension">apprehension</reg>. <lb/>
As long as he comes home safe again, <lb/>
that is all I shall think of. Please God to spare <lb/>
me that fearful anxiety, which weighs on me now <lb/>
already, for he, having only a brigade, could not <lb/>
keep out of danger, like Fritz in Schleswig.</p>
<p>"I put my trust wholly in the Almighty, who has <lb/>
watched over and blessed our life so richly thus <lb/>
far&mdash;so <hi rend="italic">much, much</hi> more than I ever deserved, or <lb/>
can deserve; and He will not forsake us in the hour <lb/>
of need, I am sure.</p>
<p>"These dangerous times make one very serious <lb/>
and anxious; the comfort of faith and trust in <lb/>
God, who does all well and for the best, is the <lb/>
only support. Life is but a pilgrimage&mdash;a little <lb/>
more or a little less sorrow falls to one's lot; but <lb/>
the anticipation of evil is almost as great a suffering <lb/>
as the evil itself, and mine always was an anxious <lb/>
nature, so I cannot banish the thoughts which all <lb/>
the dreadful chances of war force upon us."</p>
<p>The above letter is a noble one, and we applaud <lb/>
the courage of the Princess's friends for publishing <lb/>
it. It brings the writer nearer to her untitled <lb/>
human sisters, and shows the beautiful and <reg orig="un-|sophisticated">unsophisticated</reg> <lb/>
spirit by which she was always <lb/>
moved.</p>
<p>The dreaded war-cloud again gathered in the <lb/>
sky, and the terrible anxiety which racked the <lb/>
heart of the Princess Louise is revealed in her <lb/>
correspondence. Austria and Prussia came into <lb/>
deadly conflict, and Prince Louis was called out to <lb/>
the front. Husband and wife strove to cheer each <lb/>
other, but it was a hard task. When separated, <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0034"/>
they could receive no letters from each other for <lb/>
weeks, and telegrams but seldom. "This dreadful <lb/>
war is enough to break one's heart," the Princess <lb/>
exclaimed on one occasion; "those lives sacrificed <lb/>
for nothing&mdash;and what will be the end of it all? <lb/>
The times are hard; it wants all a Christian's <lb/>
courage and patience to carry one through them; <lb/>
but there is <hi rend="italic">one Friend</hi> who in the time of need <lb/>
does not forsake one, and He is my comfort and <lb/>
support."</p>
<p>The period of agony through which the Princess <lb/>
passed is touchingly shown in a letter to the <lb/>
Queen, dated July 27, 9 o'clock p.m. "At length <lb/>
I have heard that dear Louis is well," she says. <lb/>
"These last four days they have been fighting <lb/>
again. I had a few lines from him. The last <lb/>
two nights he slept in a field, and the country is <lb/>
so poor that they had nothing but a little bread <lb/>
during two days to eat. Now the Prussians, <lb/>
having made peace with Austria, and having <reg orig="re-|fused">refused</reg> <lb/>
it to us, are advancing on our troops from <lb/>
three sides.</p>
<p>"I can scarcely write; this anxiety is killing me, <lb/>
and my love has been so exposed! All are in <lb/>
admiration of his personal bravery and tender <lb/>
attention to the suffering and wants of all around. <lb/>
He never thinks of himself, and shares all the <lb/>
dangers and privations with the others.</p>
<p>"Louis says they long for peace. He disapproves <lb/>
of the different Governments for not now giving <lb/>
way to Prussia, and begs me to use my influence <lb/>
with Uncle Louis to accept Prussian conditions to <lb/>
spare further bloodshed.</p>
<pb n="31" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0035"/>
<p>"From all parts of the country the people beg <lb/>
me to do what I can.</p>
<p>"The confusion here is awful, the want of money <lb/>
alarming; right and left one must help. As the <lb/>
Prussians pillaged here, I have many people's <lb/>
things hidden in the house. Even whilst in bed I <lb/>
had to see gentlemen in my room, as there were <lb/>
things to be done and asked which had to come <lb/>
straight to me. Then out poor wounded&mdash;the <lb/>
wives and mothers, begging I should inquire for <lb/>
their husbands and children. It is a state of <lb/>
affairs too dreadful to describe.</p>
<p>"The new anxiety to-night of knowing a dreadful <lb/>
battle is expected, perhaps going on, in which dear <lb/>
Louis again must be! I can scarcely bear up any <lb/>
longer, I feel it is getting too much. God Almighty <lb/>
stand by us! my courage is beginning to sink. I <lb/>
see no light anywhere, and my own beloved <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg> <lb/>
still in danger, and we cannot hear, for the <lb/>
Prussians are between us and them. Anything <lb/>
may have happened to him, and I can't bear it or <lb/>
know it! I could not go to him were he wounded.</p>
<p>"What I have suffered and do suffer no words <lb/>
can describe&mdash;the sleepless nights of anxiety, the <lb/>
long days without news. How I pray it may soon <lb/>
end, and dear, darling Louis be spared me!'</p>
<p>While weak herself, and distracted with anxiety, <lb/>
the Princess visited the wounded at the different <lb/>
hospitals and houses, which were filled with <reg orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg> <lb/>
soldiers. Though the close and crowded <lb/>
wards made her feel faint, she returned again <lb/>
and again to her beneficent task. One poor man <lb/>
who had had an operation performed became <lb/>
<pb n="32" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0036"/>
very exhausted, and wept like a child. The <reg orig="Prin-|cess">Princess</reg> <lb/>
tried to comfort him, and he held her hand, <lb/>
but kept moaning out, "It burns so!" Another, <lb/>
who had been very patient, died between two of <lb/>
her visits. All the wounded were quite young, <lb/>
and, for their class, well educated. Peace was <lb/>
at length concluded in September. "The terms <lb/>
are not so bad," writes the Princess. "We lose <lb/>
the Hinterland and the domains there, as also <lb/>
the whole of Hesse-Homburg, in all, sixty-four <lb/>
thousand souls; pay three millions contribution, <lb/>
besides having kept a large part of the Prussian <lb/>
army six weeks for nothing, which cost the country <lb/>
twenty-five thousand florins daily. For <reg orig="Ober-|hessen">Oberhessen</reg> <lb/>
we go into the North-German Bund, and <lb/>
half the army is under Prussian command, which <lb/>
will make a dreadful confusion. Louis would <lb/>
prefer having it for the whole, particularly in <reg orig="anti-|cipation">anticipation</reg>, <lb/>
alas! of a coming war. The railroads, <lb/>
posts, and telegraphs also become Prussian." Out <lb/>
of her eight thousand troops, Hesse lost eight <lb/>
hundred men and eleven officers, and of the officers <lb/>
just those who were very intimate with the <lb/>
Prussians, and who wished Germany to be united <lb/>
under Prussia.</p>
<p>When the Princess Alice received from her <lb/>
mother the late General Grey's volume, "The Early <lb/>
Years of the Prince Consort," she thus wrote to the <lb/>
Queen: "The longer I live, the more I see and <lb/>
know of the world, the deeper my tender <reg orig="admi-|ration">admiration</reg> <lb/>
grows for such a father. It makes me feel <lb/>
myself so small, so imperfect, when I think that I <lb/>
am his child, and am still so unworthy of being it. <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0037"/>
How many people here who like to hear of dear <lb/>
papa, ask me about him, and you can understand <lb/>
with what pride and love I talk of him, and tell <lb/>
them things which make them all share our sorrow <lb/>
at not having him here any more! But if ever a <lb/>
life has outlived a man, dear papa's has done so. <lb/>
In my thoughts and aims, he ever remains the <lb/>
centre and the guiding-star. Dear, beloved papa, <lb/>
he never half knew how much, even when a foolish <lb/>
child, I loved and adored him. His great life will <lb/>
be a model for many and many for generations to <lb/>
come, and his great thoughts and aims can leave <lb/>
none idle who knew them."</p>
<p>The letters of the Princess teem with passages <lb/>
demonstrating her undying affection and <reg orig="venera-|tion">veneration</reg> <lb/>
for her father, and her children were always <lb/>
taught to think and speak of their two <reg orig="grand-|papas&mdash;one">grandpapas&mdash;one</reg> <lb/>
in Darmstadt, and one in Heaven.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1866&ndash;67, the Princess began the <lb/>
arduous task of founding a women's union&mdash;to be <lb/>
spread all over the land in different committees, <lb/>
the central one being at Darmstadt, under her own <lb/>
direction&mdash;for the purpose of assisting the <reg orig="Inter-|national">International</reg> <lb/>
Convention for Nursing and Supporting <lb/>
the Troops in Time of War, which was founded at <lb/>
Geneva, and to which Hesse also belonged. The <lb/>
duty in time of peace was to bring up and educate <lb/>
nurses for the task, who could then assist in other <lb/>
hospitals, or amongst the poor or the rich, or <lb/>
wherever they might be required in time of war. <lb/>
The committee of women would collect all the <lb/>
necessary things for the wounded and for the <lb/>
marching troops, and see to their being despatched <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0038"/>
to the right places, etc. In her scheme for the <lb/>
nursing of the wounded, the Princess had before <lb/>
her the bright example of Florence Nightingale, <lb/>
during the Crimean War; and she also profited <lb/>
by a study of what had been done in Baden under <lb/>
the direction of the Grand Duchess. She delighted <lb/>
in the work, and was successful in carrying out her <lb/>
object. A committee was constituted in 1867, <lb/>
consisting of six ladies and four doctors, with the <lb/>
Princess as president. In the course of two years <lb/>
from its inauguration, the Ladies' Union embraced <lb/>
a membership of no less than 2500, a large <reg orig="organi-|zation">organization</reg> <lb/>
for a comparatively small State.</p>
<p>Nor was this the only undertaking which <reg orig="occu-|pied">occupied</reg> <lb/>
the Princess's thoughts. With the aid of <lb/>
Fr&auml;ulein Louise B&uuml;chner&mdash;a well-known authoress, <lb/>
and an advocate of the educational and other <lb/>
claims of women&mdash;she devoted her attention to <lb/>
the improvement of the education and general <lb/>
condition of poor unmarried women and girls. A <lb/>
committee was formed for the encouragement of <lb/>
female industry, and a permanent institution was <lb/>
set on foot called, "The Alice Bazaar," for the <lb/>
purpose of receiving and disposing of articles of <lb/>
needlework at their proper value, and also for <lb/>
obtaining employment for women of all classes. <lb/>
Year by year, the institution progressed, and <lb/>
accomplished excellent work.</p>
<p>The Prince and Princess visited Berlin in 1867, <lb/>
and they also accepted the invitation of the <lb/>
Emperor Napoleon, given to all the Sovereigns <lb/>
and Princes of Europe, to visit the Great <reg orig="Inter-|national">International</reg> <lb/>
Exhibition at Paris. Princess Alice was <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0039"/>
greatly attracted by the art galleries of Paris, and <lb/>
she was long enamoured of the idea of founding <lb/>
schools of art and design in her own country. <lb/>
Crossing over to England from Paris, the Prince <lb/>
and Princess were present at Windsor and Osborne <lb/>
during the visits of the Sultan, and they also <lb/>
witnessed the great naval review at Spithead in <lb/>
his honour. On returning to Germany, they made <lb/>
various excursions in the autumn, travelling quietly <lb/>
and unostentatiously like ordinary tourists. At <lb/>
Cassel, they enjoyed for a time the society of the <lb/>
Crown Prince and Princess of Prussia. Home <lb/>
difficulties arose at Darmstadt, owing to the <reg orig="oppo-|sition">opposition</reg> <lb/>
of the Grand Duke and the War <reg orig="Depart-|ment">Department</reg> <lb/>
to Prince Louis. They were anxious to <lb/>
evade their responsibilities towards Prussia, while <lb/>
he was resolved to keep loyally to the <reg orig="engage-|ments">engagements</reg> <lb/>
made. Matters came to such a pass that <lb/>
the Prince determined to resign his command, <lb/>
hoping that by October 1, when the convention <lb/>
was to be carried out, the King of Prussia would <lb/>
send a Prussian general to Darmstadt invested with <lb/>
full responsibility. Ultimately the Grand Duke <lb/>
gave way, and the Prince retained his command.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1868, the Princess passed <lb/>
a considerable time in England. The ensuing <lb/>
autumn was spent at Kranichstein, and on <reg orig="Novem-|ber">November</reg> <lb/>
25&mdash;after the return to Darmstadt&mdash;a son and <lb/>
heir was born to the Prince and Princess. The <lb/>
occasion was one of great rejoicing to the parents, <lb/>
and also to the whole country, and on December <lb/>
28 the child was christened in the names of Ernst <lb/>
Ludwig, which had been borne by many of the <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0040"/>
old Landgraves of Hesse&mdash;the Queen of England <lb/>
and the King of Prussia being the sponsors. The <lb/>
most interesting personal episode in 1869 was the <lb/>
visit which the Prince and Princess of Wales and <lb/>
their family paid to the Prince and Princess Louis <lb/>
at Kranichstein&mdash;the favourite resort of the latter. <lb/>
Then, on October 15, the Idiot Asylum built by <lb/>
the Princess Alice was formally opened in her <lb/>
presence, and that of the Prince of Wales. Prince <lb/>
Louis had gone on a tour in the east with the <lb/>
Crown Prince of Prussia. They visited Venice, <lb/>
Corfu, Athens, Constantinople, Jaffa, Jerusalem, <lb/>
Damascus, etc., and on November 15 arrived at <lb/>
Port Said, for the opening of the Suez Canal. <lb/>
After this interesting ceremony, they journeyed <lb/>
up the Nile as far as the first and second cataracts, <lb/>
and returned home by way of Naples, and through <lb/>
Italy. While the Princes were absent, the Crown <lb/>
Princess of Prussia and Princess Alice, with her <lb/>
infant son, paid a lengthy visit to Cannes. Here <lb/>
they were joined by their husbands in December, <lb/>
and the whole party returned to Germany shortly <lb/>
before Christmas.</p>
<p>The year 1870 was destined to be a most <lb/>
eventful one. Soon after its opening, Prince Louis <lb/>
was attacked with scarlet fever, and the Princess <lb/>
Victoria and the young Prince were soon down <lb/>
with the same disease. Princess Alice nursed <lb/>
them all through, and although the attack was <lb/>
severe, she had the satisfaction of seeing all the <lb/>
patients recover, and happily no ill effects followed. <lb/>
It was at this time that the Princess became <lb/>
acquainted with David Friedrich Strauss, the <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0041"/>
a sortie of the French from Metz, that he received <lb/>
news of the birth of his second son, who had been <lb/>
born on August 7.</p>
<p>Although the Princess Alice was daily filled <lb/>
with anxiety, knowing that her husband was in <lb/>
the thick of the fight, she bravely subdued her <lb/>
own feelings, and engaged in helping, comforting, <lb/>
and advising all around her at Darmstadt. Dr. <lb/>
Sell observes that "she worked, like any other <lb/>
woman, to alleviate as best she could the sufferings <lb/>
of the sick and the wounded, and giving aid to <lb/>
those who were plunged into destitution by the <lb/>
war. Whilst she was living with her children at <lb/>
Kranichstein, the 'H&uuml;lfsverein,' or Committee of <lb/>
Aid, had its head-quarters in her palace at <reg orig="Darm-|stadt">Darmstadt</reg>. <lb/>
She herself went there every day, and visited <lb/>
all the hospitals, also the ambulance at the <reg orig="rail-|way">railway</reg> <lb/>
station, and superintended the organization <lb/>
of 'Committees of Aid' all over the country. The <lb/>
committees which she had organized long <reg orig="pre-|viously">previously</reg> <lb/>
now proved themselves an untold blessing.</p>
<p>"The 'Alice Society for Aid to the Sick and <lb/>
Wounded' had sixteen trained nurses ready for <lb/>
work at the beginning of the war. Through the <lb/>
voluntary help of some of the best doctors and <lb/>
surgeons, who arranged classes at different places <lb/>
for the instruction of all those who were anxious <lb/>
to help to nurse during the war, the number of <lb/>
nurses was increased to one hundred and sixty <lb/>
four. These were sent to the different hospitals <lb/>
in Hesse, to ambulances near Metz, to the hospital <lb/>
trains, and the hospitals on the steamers.</p>
<p>"In her own palace, the Princess arranged a <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0042"/>
dep&ocirc;t for all necessaries required for the sick and <lb/>
wounded. Later on, another was established in <lb/>
the Grand Ducal palace. Besides the many regular <lb/>
nurses, a number of women and ladies joined <lb/>
together to serve out refreshments, during the <lb/>
night as well as the daytime, to the wounded, who <lb/>
were constantly passing through Darmstadt, and <lb/>
halted at the railway station. Similar committees <lb/>
were, thanks to the Princess's own initiative, formed <lb/>
all over the country.</p>
<p>"One of the hospitals at Darmstadt, erected by <lb/>
the English National Red Cross Society, and <reg orig="sup-|plied">supplied</reg> <lb/>
with English surgeons, received the name of <lb/>
'The Alice Hospital.' Under a special arrangement, <lb/>
it was subsequently taken over by the Hessian <lb/>
military authorities. In this hospital, as in others <lb/>
established independently of the Alice Society, <lb/>
women and girls of all classes lent their aid.</p>
<p>"Simultaneously with the aid to the sick and <lb/>
wounded, those who had been rendered widows, <lb/>
orphans, or destitute by the war, were cared for <lb/>
through the Princess's exertions; and the Alice <lb/>
Society, for the education and employment of <lb/>
women, did good service. Out of this society <lb/>
sprang the 'Alice Lyceum,' which was intended <lb/>
for the intellectual culture of women of the higher <lb/>
classes. Lectures were to be delivered in it on all <lb/>
the interesting subjects of the day. This Lyceum <lb/>
continued for some years to attract a more or less <lb/>
numerous audience. In the first winter of its <lb/>
existence lectures on English and German <reg orig="litera-|ture">literature</reg>, <lb/>
the history of Art, German history, and <lb/>
Natural history, were given. The lady at the <lb/>
<pb n="40" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0043"/>
head of it was Fr&auml;ulein Louise B&uuml;chner. Its <reg orig="sub-|sequent">subsequent</reg> <lb/>
failure was caused by numerous external <lb/>
difficulties, and not because the original idea for <lb/>
which it had been founded had proved otherwise <lb/>
than sound."</p>
<p>Returning to the narrative of the war, Prince <lb/>
Louis garrisoned Fort St. Privat, on October 29, <lb/>
and 173,000 French prisoners, together with the <lb/>
Imperial Guard, passed before Prince Frederick <lb/>
Charles. In November, the German troops were <lb/>
very active. They marched to Troyes, <reg orig="Fontaine-|bleau">Fontainebleau</reg>, <lb/>
and Tours by rapid stages, and, after the <lb/>
decisive battle of Orleans, entered that city on <lb/>
December 5. One portion of the Hessian <reg orig="divi-|sion">division</reg> <lb/>
fought the engagement of Montlivault on <lb/>
the 9th, while the other surprised and captured <lb/>
the Castle of Chambord, taking Blois shortly <lb/>
afterwards. For more than two months of that <lb/>
memorable winter&mdash;that is, from December 10, <lb/>
1870, to February 14, 1871&mdash;the head-quarters of <lb/>
the second German army were at Orleans. To <lb/>
the Hessian division was assigned the important <lb/>
task of guarding the line of the Loire from Gien <lb/>
to Blois during the expedition against General <lb/>
Chanzy.</p>
<p>It is deeply interesting at such a trying time as <lb/>
this to turn to the Princess's letters, and to read <lb/>
what she says, for example, as to the simple <lb/>
upbringing of her children. Writing to her <lb/>
mother on July 2, 1870, she thus deals with this <lb/>
subject: "What you say about the education of <lb/>
our girls I entirely agree with, and I strive to <lb/>
bring them up totally free from pride of their <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0044"/>
position, which is <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, save what their personal <lb/>
worth can make it. I read it to the governess&mdash; <lb/>
who quite enters into all my wishes on the <reg orig="sub-|ject&mdash;thinking">subject&mdash;thinking</reg> <lb/>
how good it would be for her to <lb/>
hear your opinion. &hellip; I feel so entirely as you <lb/>
do on the difference of rank, and how all-important <lb/>
it is for princes and princesses to know that they <lb/>
are nothing better or above others, save through <lb/>
their own merit; and that they have only the <lb/>
double duty of living for others, and of being an <lb/>
example&mdash;good and modest. This, I hope, my <lb/>
children will grow up to."</p>
<p>While the Princess longed for the unity of <lb/>
Germany, which was inevitable, she deplored the <lb/>
painful means by which it must be accomplished. <lb/>
Still, she felt that the King of Prussia had no other <lb/>
course left him to pursue with honour. The war <lb/>
was a national one, and she has frequent <reg orig="refer-|ences">references</reg> <lb/>
to the enthusiasm which it evoked in every <lb/>
German breast. The horrors of war are surely felt <lb/>
most by those left at home; and if women and <lb/>
children could settle these international quarrels, <lb/>
we should soon hear of "the sword being turned <lb/>
into a plough-share, and the spear into a <reg orig="pruning-|hook">pruning-hook</reg>." <lb/>
The agony of those in Darmstadt is vividly <lb/>
shown in the letters of the Princess Alice. Two <lb/>
extracts only will be quoted, one being from a letter <lb/>
which she addressed to the Queen on August 25&mdash;</p>
<p>"Many thanks for your dear words of the 20th. <lb/>
God knows, I have suffered much, and the load of <lb/>
anxiety is great! But thousands of Germans bear <lb/>
this load in unity together for their Fatherland, <lb/>
and none murmur. Yesterday a poor woman came <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0045"/>
to me to ask me to help her to get to the <reg orig="battle-|field">battlefield</reg>, <lb/>
to have the body of her only son looked for <lb/>
and brought home; and she was so resigned and <lb/>
patient.</p>
<p>"I see daily, in all classes, so much grief and <lb/>
suffering; so many acquaintances and friends have <lb/>
fallen! It is heartrending! I ought to be <hi rend="italic">very <lb/>
proud</hi> though, and I am so, too, to hear from the <lb/>
mouths of so many wounded officers the loud <lb/>
praises of Louis's great bravery on the 16th and <lb/>
18th. Always in front, encouraging his men where <lb/>
the battle raged fiercest and the balls fell thickest. <lb/>
He was with our troops, speaking to them, <reg orig="direct-|ing">directing</reg> <lb/>
them, and right, and left of him they fell in <lb/>
masses. This lasted eight hours!</p>
<p>"&hellip; Hourly, almost, the trains bring in fresh <lb/>
wounded, and many and shocking are the sights <lb/>
one sees. I only returned here by one, having <lb/>
gone to town at half-past eight this morning, and <lb/>
have still three hospitals for this afternoon.</p>
<p>"My nurses reached the battle-field in time, and <lb/>
were of great use. Louis telegraphed &lpar;yesterday's <lb/>
date&rpar; from Aubou&eacute;, between Thionville and Metz, <lb/>
where they remain in bivouac. &hellip; It is ten days <lb/>
since Louis has been in a bed or under a roof. <lb/>
They have no water &lpar;it is kept for the wounded&rpar;, <lb/>
and little to eat, but he is very well."</p>
<p>Again, on November 12, she writes: "Last night <lb/>
I was much overcome. I had been sitting at the <lb/>
bedside of one of my poor young friends, and he <lb/>
was gasping in a too-distressing way. The father <lb/>
held his hand, the tears streaming down his cheek, <lb/>
the son trying to say, 'Weine nicht, papa' &lpar;Don't <lb/>
<pb n="43" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0046"/>
weep, papa&rpar;. The poor old father, so proud of <lb/>
his good and handsome child, is heartbroken, and <lb/>
they are touchingly united and full of feeling for <lb/>
each other. I would give anything to save his <lb/>
life; but all efforts will, I fear, be in vain. Though <lb/>
I have seen so many lately die hard deaths, and <lb/>
heard and seen the grief of many heartbroken <lb/>
widows and mothers, it makes my heart bleed <lb/>
anew in each fresh case, and curse the wickedness <lb/>
of war again and again."</p>
<p>When Field-Marshal Wrangel visited the <lb/>
Princess, and said, "Accept my congratulations <lb/>
that your husband is a hero, and has fought <lb/>
magnificently," she felt proud of the tribute from <lb/>
such a veteran, yet she was "too much of a woman <lb/>
not to long, above all things, to have him safe <lb/>
home again." She lived in constant fear and <lb/>
trembling, and when the news came after every <lb/>
fresh battle that his life was preserved in spite of <lb/>
his almost rash courage and daring, she took it as <lb/>
a fresh gift from the Almighty.</p>
<p>The christening of the infant Prince took place <lb/>
on February 11, 1871, in his father's enforced <lb/>
absence. He received the names of Frederick <lb/>
William, the sponsors being the Empress of <lb/>
Germany, the Crown Princess, Crown Prince, <lb/>
Prince Frederick Charles, and the Princess Alice's <lb/>
brother, Prince Leopold. At length, after nearly <lb/>
eight months of weary waiting, Prince Louis <lb/>
obtained ten days' leave of absence, and arrived at <lb/>
Darmstadt on March 21. Joyful indeed was the <lb/>
meeting between husband and wife and children. <lb/>
The hero was accorded a most enthusiastic <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0047"/>
welcome by his native city. On June 16 following, <lb/>
the Prince and Princess Louis were present at <lb/>
the triumphal entry of the Germany troops into <lb/>
Berlin, after the conclusion of peace. The old <lb/>
Emperor, surrounded by the many princes and <lb/>
his great generals, looked truly noble as he rode <lb/>
at the head of his victorious troops. Five days <lb/>
later, the Prince entered Darmstadt at the head of <lb/>
his Hessian division. Subsequently, at Seeheim, <lb/>
near Darmstadt, the Princess welcomed her <lb/>
brother, Prince Alfred, after his three years' <lb/>
voyage round the world; and the Prince and <lb/>
Princess of Wales likewise paid their sister a visit.</p>
<p>The care of the wounded in Darmstadt was a <lb/>
severe tax upon the Princess in many ways, as <lb/>
this extract from one of her letters to the Queen <lb/>
proves: "The poor soldier who had your cape is <lb/>
dead. He died with it round him. I was with <lb/>
him in the afternoon, and he had tears in his eyes, <lb/>
and was very low. In the night he died. This <lb/>
morning I was at the station to give things to the <lb/>
wounded and sick who came through&mdash;a sorry <lb/>
sight. This afternoon I am going to a poor <lb/>
soldier's widow who has just had twins. The <lb/>
distress on all sides is great. I help where I can. <lb/>
Becker tears his hair. The two wounded in the <lb/>
house cost so much. So does everything else; <lb/>
but as long as I can&mdash;through sparing on myself&mdash; <lb/>
help others, I must do it, though I have, as things <lb/>
are now, nothing left."</p>
<p>In September, 1871, the Prince and Princess <lb/>
Louis arrived at Balmoral, only to find her Majesty <lb/>
suffering greatly. They remained with her till <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0048"/>
November 1, and then proceeded to Sandringham. <lb/>
Soon after their arrival, the Prince of Wales was <lb/>
taken ill, and typhoid fever developed itself&mdash;the <lb/>
same disease which had proved fatal to his father. <lb/>
Prince Louis was compelled to return to <reg orig="Darm-|stadt">Darmstadt</reg>, <lb/>
but the Princess Alice remained in England <lb/>
to assist in nursing her brother through his <lb/>
dangerous illness, which she did with the same <lb/>
unremitting and tender care as she had manifested <lb/>
during the Prince Consort's illness. Happily, the <lb/>
Prince's life was spared, an improvement setting <lb/>
in on December 14, the anniversary of Prince <lb/>
Albert's death. Prince Louis again visited <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg> <lb/>
in December, and remained over Christmas.</p>
<p>Another daughter was born to the Prince and <lb/>
Princess Louis on June 6, 1872, and she received <lb/>
the names of Victoria Alix Helena Louise Beatrice. <lb/>
Death again trod quickly upon the heels of life, <lb/>
for in September the Prince and Princess were <lb/>
called to Baden to attend the funeral of the <lb/>
Princess Hohenlohe-Langenburg, half-sister to <lb/>
Queen Victoria.</p>
<p>On October 9 there was a large meeting at <lb/>
Darmstadt of the various associations existing <lb/>
throughout Germany, for the bettering of women's <lb/>
education and social position. Among those who <lb/>
attended the conference were Madame Marie <lb/>
Simon, founder and head of the Institution for <lb/>
Training Nurses at Dresden, Miss Mary Carpenter, <lb/>
Miss Florence Hill, and Miss Catherine <reg orig="Wink-|worth">Winkworth</reg>. <lb/>
The proceedings were characterized by a <lb/>
practical and an earnest spirit. The subjects dis <lb/>
cussed included the admission of women to the <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0049"/>
post-office and telegraph service; the working of <lb/>
Fr&ouml;bel's principles for the further employment of <lb/>
women; the Kindergarten system; the finding <lb/>
of proper localities for the exhibition and sale of <lb/>
women's handiwork of all kinds; nursing as a <lb/>
branch of female industry; the provision of better <lb/>
schools for girls; and the character and progress <lb/>
of female education in England. The Princess <lb/>
evinced the deepest interest in all these subjects, <lb/>
and personally received the members of the <lb/>
different societies at her own house, encouraging <lb/>
them by her aid and sympathy. During the <lb/>
meetings, Miss Carpenter, the veteran friend and <lb/>
helper of her sex, spoke of women's work in Great <lb/>
Britain, and gave a graphic account of the Queen's <lb/>
Institute at Dublin. Miss Hill dealt with the <lb/>
boarding-out system for orphans, and Miss <reg orig="Wink-|worth">Winkworth</reg> <lb/>
with higher education in England.</p>
<p>Miss Carpenter and Miss Hill were the special <lb/>
guests of the Princess, and the presence of the <lb/>
former greatly enhanced the importance of the <lb/>
meeting, while her ripe experience was valued by <lb/>
all. The Princess took Miss Carpenter over the <lb/>
different schools in Darmstadt, so that she might <lb/>
see how the existing systems worked. "The more <lb/>
I saw of the dear Princess," Miss Carpenter wrote <lb/>
to her brother, "the more did I admire and love <lb/>
her. She feels that she owes much to her father, <lb/>
of whom she thinks as we do of ours." The <lb/>
Princess Alice herself afterwards addressed a letter <lb/>
to Mary Carpenter, in which she said, "I would <lb/>
like all to know and share my admiration for such <lb/>
a benevolent and useful life as yours, which has <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0050"/>
influence far beyond the limits of its sphere. To <lb/>
know you has strengthened me and done me good, <lb/>
and made me feel how little I have yet done, and <lb/>
how your example will ever incite me to try and <lb/>
do better."</p>
<p>As one result of the Darmstadt Conference, the <lb/>
Princess now joined to her Nursing Institute <lb/>
an Orphan Asylum, intended for the care of <lb/>
orphans who were boarded out by the State into <lb/>
private families, where some poor children were <lb/>
unhappy and ill used. A special committee of <lb/>
ladies directed the institution under the guidance <lb/>
of the Princess, and the scheme soon achieved a <lb/>
conspicuous and gratifying success.</p>
<p>Early in November, the Prince and Princess <lb/>
Louis were present at the unveiling of a monument, <lb/>
erected near Metz, to the memory of the Hessian <lb/>
soldiers who fell in the war of 1870. The memorial <lb/>
consisted of a dead lion in bronze, on a plain <lb/>
pedestal, bearing an inscription on black marble <lb/>
in front, while the names of all the soldiers were <lb/>
graven at the back. The clergyman of the division <lb/>
delivered a brief but touching address, the band <lb/>
played a chorale, and the Prince spoke a few <lb/>
words, calling at the close for the usual "Hoch!" <lb/>
for the Emperor and the Grand Duke. The Princess <lb/>
then laid some wreaths at the foot of the memorial, <lb/>
and on leaving the spot she and the Prince drove <lb/>
back to Metz across the different battle-fields.</p>
<p>A long-cherished project was carried into <reg orig="execu-|tion">execution</reg> <lb/>
in the spring of 1873, when the Princess visited <lb/>
Italy. She was accompanied by Miss Hardinge <lb/>
and Hofrath Ruland, and journeyed <foreign lang="rus"><hi rend="italic">incognito</hi></foreign>. <lb/>
<pb n="48" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0051"/>
They travelled by way of Munich and the Brenner <lb/>
Pass to Florence, and from there proceeded direct <lb/>
to Rome. From the artistic tastes of the Princess, <lb/>
and her careful historical reading, it will be <reg orig="under-|stood">understood</reg> <lb/>
what a delight it was to her to find herself <lb/>
at length in the "Eternal City." Much time was <lb/>
spent in the picture-galleries, in visiting the <lb/>
churches, and in investigating the ruins of ancient <lb/>
Rome. "The Via Appia," she remarks, "the grand <lb/>
old road lined with ruins of splendid tombs, <reg orig="lead-|ing">leading</reg> <lb/>
from Albano through the Campagna to Rome, <lb/>
along which St. Paul went, and the great kings <lb/>
and emperors made their triumphal entries, is a <lb/>
fit one to lead to such a city as Rome, which ruled <lb/>
the world." The Princess witnessed the beginning <lb/>
of Mass and the blessing of the palms in St. Peter's, <lb/>
and inspected two convents, one of them the Sepolte <lb/>
Vive. Excursions were made into the Campagna, <lb/>
and to the famous villas of Albani Ludovisi, <reg orig="Bor-|ghese">Borghese</reg>, <lb/>
etc. Cardinal &lpar;then Monsignore&rpar; Howard <lb/>
was her guide in unfolding to her all the wonders <lb/>
of St. Peter's, but she was especially interested in <lb/>
the Catacombs, dating back to the time of the first <lb/>
Christians. She attended the grand ceremonies <lb/>
of the Romish Church, but experienced a feeling <lb/>
of relief in afterwards enjoying the simple Protestant <lb/>
service at the German Embassy. The Princess <lb/>
was graciously received by Pius IX., and by King <lb/>
Victor Emanuel and the Crown Princess of Italy, <lb/>
Princess Margherita. Visits to Sorrento and <lb/>
Florence &lpar;the latter being a second visit&rpar; followed, <lb/>
and then the Princess left for home, reaching <lb/>
Darmstadt on May 2.</p>
<pb n="49" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0052"/>
<p>Upon this happy time there quickly supervened <lb/>
a terrible trial and sorrow. Early on the morning <lb/>
of May 29, Prince Louis had left Darmstadt to <lb/>
inspect the troops in Upper Hesse, and the Princess <lb/>
&mdash;who was still suffering from the great fatigue of <lb/>
her Italian journey&mdash;had not yet risen from her <lb/>
bed. "The two little Princes," says Dr. Sell, <lb/>
"came to wish her 'good morning,' and by her <lb/>
wish were left in the room by the nurse. The <lb/>
children soon began to play, as was their wont, <lb/>
running in and out of the room into the adjacent <lb/>
one, and looking from one window and then from <lb/>
another. Prince Ernest having run into the next <lb/>
room, the Princess followed him, leaving Prince <lb/>
Fritz in her bedroom. During her almost <reg orig="momen-|tary">momentary</reg> <lb/>
absence he fell out of the window on to the <lb/>
stone terrace below. Whether he had leaned too <lb/>
far out of it and overbalanced himself, or whether <lb/>
in running fast through the room to the window to <lb/>
look for his brother he could not stop himself and <lb/>
fell from it, no one actually knows. He was picked <lb/>
up insensible, and died a few hours afterwards in <lb/>
the arms of his distracted mother. Effusion of <lb/>
blood on the brain caused by the fall ended that <lb/>
young and bright little life. The loss of this <reg orig="un-|usually">unusually</reg> <lb/>
gifted and beloved child was a blow to the <lb/>
mother from which she never recovered. Her <lb/>
married life had till then been such a happy one that <lb/>
this first sorrow came on her with redoubled force."</p>
<p>The little Prince was buried in the Grand Ducal <lb/>
Mausoleum at Rosenh&ouml;he on June 1, the <reg orig="sorrow-|ing">sorrowing</reg> <lb/>
parents and their daughters and surviving son <lb/>
being present. Her grief took a lasting hold upon <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0053"/>
the Princess, though she was touched by the <reg orig="sym-|pathy">sympathy</reg> <lb/>
extended to her from all quarters and from <lb/>
all classes in Darmstadt and England. She carried <lb/>
the precious image of her dead child in her heart <lb/>
with her everywhere. In one beautiful letter to <lb/>
the Queen, she thus spoke of her bitter trial and its <lb/>
lesson: "You feel so with me when you understand <lb/>
how long and deep my grief must be. And does <lb/>
not one grow to love one's grief, as having become <lb/>
part of the being one loved&mdash;as if through <hi rend="italic">this</hi> one <lb/>
could still pay a tribute of love to them&mdash;to make <lb/>
up for the terrible loss, and missing of not being <lb/>
able to do anything for the beloved one any more? <lb/>
I am so much with my children, and am so <reg orig="accus-|tomed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
to care for them and their wants daily, that <lb/>
I miss not having Frittie, the object of our greatest <lb/>
care, far more than words can describe; and in <lb/>
the quiet of our everyday life, where we have only <lb/>
the children around us, it is doubly and trebly felt, <lb/>
and is a sorrow that has entered into the very <lb/>
heart of our existence.</p>
<p>"May the hour of trial and grief bring its <reg orig="bless-|ing">blessing</reg> <lb/>
with it, and not have come in vain! The day <lb/>
passes so quickly, when one can do good and make <lb/>
others happy, and one leaves always so much <lb/>
undone. I feel more than ever, one should put <lb/>
nothing off, and children grow up so quickly and <lb/>
leave one, and I would long that mine should <lb/>
take nothing but the recollection of love and <lb/>
happiness from their home with them into the <lb/>
world's fight, knowing that they have there <hi rend="italic">always</hi> <lb/>
a safe harbour, and open arms to comfort and <reg orig="en-|courage">encourage</reg> <lb/>
them when they are in trouble."</p>
<pb n="51" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0054"/>
<p>The greater part of December, 1873, the Princess <lb/>
spent in England. In the spring of 1874, she took <lb/>
a deep sisterly interest in the marriage of her <lb/>
brother, Prince Alfred, to the Grand Duchess <lb/>
Marie, of Russia. She had read some of the <lb/>
Duchess's letters, and loved and admired her <lb/>
character. Yet she also entered into the feelings <lb/>
of the Empress of Russia, whose health gave cause <lb/>
for anxiety. "Surely, Marie must feel it very <lb/>
deeply," she wrote; "for to leave so delicate and <lb/>
loving a mother must seem almost wrong. How <lb/>
strange this side of human nature always seems&mdash; <lb/>
leaving all you love most, know best, owe all debts <lb/>
of gratitude to, for the comparatively unknown! <lb/>
The lot of parents is indeed hard, and of such <reg orig="self-|sacrifice">self-sacrifice</reg>." <lb/>
When the Princess received a loving <lb/>
birthday letter from the Queen, dated April 25, <lb/>
she replied: "You can understand that the day <lb/>
was inexpressibly sad, that the fair head missing <lb/>
in our circle was painfully felt, and that all these <lb/>
recollections caused me endless tears and <reg orig="heart-|ache&mdash;though">heartache&mdash;though</reg> <lb/>
not for him, sweet precious child. <lb/>
As you say, life at best is a struggle; happy those <lb/>
who can lie down to rest, having fought their <lb/>
battle well; or those who have been spared <reg orig="fight-|ing">fighting</reg> <lb/>
it at all, and have remained pure and untouched, <lb/>
barely touching this earth, so mixed up with grief <lb/>
and sin!"</p>
<p>On May 24, 1874, the Princess Alice gave birth <lb/>
to a daughter, who received the names of Marie <lb/>
Victoria Feodora Leopoldine. After the mother's <lb/>
recovery, the family went to Blankenberghe for the <lb/>
use of sea-baths. The weather was extremely hot, <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0055"/>
and they could get no rooms at Scheveningen, <lb/>
except at exorbitant prices. While at <reg orig="Blanken-|berghe">Blankenberghe</reg>, <lb/>
Prince Louis saved the life of a lady bather. <lb/>
The waves were very high, and hearing a cry for <lb/>
help, he perceived a lady struggling in the surf. <lb/>
Her husband tried to assist her, but became <reg orig="ex-|hausted">exhausted</reg>, <lb/>
and let her go; equally so the <reg orig="brother-in-|law">brother-in-law</reg> <lb/>
of the lady. The Prince managed to reach <lb/>
her, but after assisting her for some time, felt his <lb/>
own strength to be going. However, the lady kept <lb/>
her presence of mind, and floated as well as she <lb/>
was able. Once the Prince let her go, but a wave <lb/>
bringing her near him again, he caught her hand, <lb/>
and brought her to shore, only just in time to save <lb/>
himself. The sea was so rough at the time that <lb/>
the Princess had herself lost her footing. On <lb/>
recovering herself she left the water, fearing an <lb/>
accident.</p>
<p>The Princess was very busy this year with her <lb/>
many useful and charitable institutions. Her <reg orig="hos-|pital&mdash;which">hospital&mdash;which</reg> <lb/>
was the project nearest to her heart <lb/>
&mdash;was approaching completion. It was to be a <lb/>
model training-school for nurses, and its sanitary <lb/>
arrangements also were to be of the most perfect <lb/>
description. The Alice Hospital originated after <lb/>
the war of 1870, in a very humble way in a small <lb/>
house in the Mayer-Strasse. As it was necessary <lb/>
to extend it&mdash;there being no funds for a new <lb/>
hospital&mdash;the Ladies' Union resolved to erect <reg orig="addi-|tional">additional</reg> <lb/>
buildings, and completely rearrange the <lb/>
interior. In the summer of 1874, the hospital was <lb/>
separated from the Alice Ladies' Union, and given <lb/>
a separate administration and separate funds. A <lb/>
<pb n="53" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0056"/>
lady superintendent, versed in the methods of <lb/>
German and English hospitals, was likewise <reg orig="ap-|pointed">appointed</reg>. <lb/>
During this year, also, the Alice Society <lb/>
for the Education and Employment of Women of <lb/>
all classes was placed on a stable foundation, with <lb/>
the Princess Alice as President, and Fr&auml;ulein <lb/>
Louise B&uuml;chner as Director. Dramatic or musical <lb/>
performances were frequently given on behalf of <lb/>
the charitable organizations fostered by the <reg orig="Prin-|cess">Princess</reg>, <lb/>
the performers always gladly volunteering <lb/>
their services on these occasions. The Hessian <lb/>
Government having amended its educational laws <lb/>
for the schools, and decided that needlework in all <lb/>
its branches should be taught in all the girls' <lb/>
schools, the Alice Society instituted a course of <lb/>
lectures&mdash;with instruction in the art of needlework <lb/>
&mdash;which were open to women and girls of all <lb/>
classes. This new departure proved of great <reg orig="bene-|fit">benefit</reg> <lb/>
to the whole of the community.</p>
<p>On the publication of the first volume of the <lb/>
"Life of the Prince Consort," written by Sir <reg orig="Theo-|dore">Theodore</reg> <lb/>
Martin, at the request of the Queen, some of <lb/>
the Prince's friends were inclined to regard the work <lb/>
as premature, seeing that it was written with <reg orig="un-|reserved">unreserved</reg> <lb/>
fulness and frankness. The Princess <lb/>
Louise, however, strongly upheld the view that <lb/>
people could only be the better for reading about <lb/>
her father, and in a letter to the Queen she <reg orig="re-|marked">remarked</reg>, <lb/>
"For the frivolous higher classes how <lb/>
valuable this book will be, if read with real <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg>, <lb/>
as a record of a life spent in the highest aims, <lb/>
with the noblest conception of duty as a leading <lb/>
star."</p>
<pb n="54" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0057"/>
<p>Her Majesty, in defending the issue of the <lb/>
"Life," thus wrote to her daughter from Osborne, <lb/>
January 12, 1875:&mdash;</p>
<q><text id="d8"><body><div1 type="quotation">

<p>"Now, as regards the book, if you will <lb/>
reflect a few minutes, you will see how I owed <lb/>
it to beloved papa to let his noble character <lb/>
be known and understood as it now is, and that <lb/>
to wait longer, when those who knew him best <lb/>
&mdash;his own wife, and a few &lpar;very few there are&rpar; <lb/>
remaining friends&mdash;were all gone, or too old, and <lb/>
too far removed from that time, to be able to <reg orig="pre-|sent">present</reg> <lb/>
a really true picture of his most ideal and <lb/>
remarkable character, would have been really <lb/>
wrong.</p>
<p>"He must be known, for his own sake, for the <lb/>
good of England and of his family, and of the <lb/>
world at large. Countless people write to say <lb/>
what good it does and will do. And it is already <lb/>
thirteen years since he left us!</p>
<p>"Then you must also remember that endless false <lb/>
and untrue things have been written and said <lb/>
about us, public and private, and that in these days <lb/>
people will write and will know; therefore, the only <lb/>
way to counteract this is to let the real, full truth <lb/>
be known, and as much be told as can be told with <lb/>
prudence and discretion, and then no harm, but <lb/>
good, will be done.</p>
<p>"Nothing will help me more than that my people <lb/>
should see what I have lost! Numbers of people <lb/>
we know have had their Lives and Memoirs <reg orig="pub-|lished">published</reg>, <lb/>

<p>The Princess Alice began to suffer from repeated <lb/>
and severe attacks of illness in 1876, but they were <lb/>
somewhat relieved by a stay in the Black Forest <lb/>
in June, and visits to England and Scotland at a <lb/>
later period. The Prince was detained in Germany <lb/>
by the great military man&oelig;uvres, but in the <lb/>
autumn he came over to England to convey his <lb/>
wife back to Darmstadt. During her stay in <lb/>
England this year, the Princess went with Dean <lb/>
Stanley to see Thomas Carlyle. Conversation <lb/>
flowed for nearly an hour, and the Princess wished <lb/>
she could have taken down its purport. With <lb/>
her sister, Princess Louise, she also visited Motley <lb/>
the historian, who was in his way equally <reg orig="interest-|ing">interesting</reg> <lb/>
with Carlyle, and possessed a great charm. It <lb/>
is a beautiful incident to read after this of the <lb/>
Princess Alice's reception by her children on her <lb/>
return to Darmstadt "They had made wreaths <lb/>
over the doors, and had no end of things to tell me. <lb/>
We arrived at three, and there was not a moment's <lb/>
rest till they were all in bed, and I had heard <lb/>
the different prayers and hymns of the six, with <lb/>
all the different little confidences they had to make. <lb/>
My heart was full of joy and gratitude at being <lb/>
with them once more, and I prayed God to make <lb/>
me fit to be their real friend, and stay as long as <lb/>
they require me, and to have the insight into their <lb/>
different characters, to guide them aright, and to <lb/>
understand their different wants and feelings."</p>
<p>The year 1877 brought with it some startling <lb/>
changes. Prince Charles of Hesse&mdash;the father of <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0059"/>
Prince Louis&mdash;passed peacefully away on March <lb/>
20, and was buried in the mausoleum at Rosenh&ouml;he <lb/>
on the 24th. Barely a month had elapsed before <lb/>
the dead Prince's brother, the Grand Duke himself, <lb/>
was attacked with serious illness, and he also died <lb/>
on June 13, in his seventy-second year. Prince <lb/>
Louis was the next heir, and he accordingly <lb/>
ascended the throne of Hesse as Grand Duke <lb/>
Louis IV. This great upheaval brought new and <lb/>
arduous duties for the Prince and Princess, and <lb/>
although the latter was in delicate health, she <lb/>
looked forward to being of real service to her <lb/>
people. When all the necessary State ceremonies, <lb/>
receptions, etc., were over, the Grand Duke and <lb/>
Duchess retired for a time to the quiet little <reg orig="water-|ing-place">water-ing-place</reg> <lb/>
of Houlgate in Normandy. When they <lb/>
returned to Darmstadt, the Grand Duchess was <lb/>
warmly greeted for the first time as <hi rend="italic">Landesmutter</hi>, <lb/>
or "mother of the country." The Grand Duchess <lb/>
still carried on her benevolent undertakings, but <lb/>
she sustained a severe loss in November, by the <lb/>
death of her right-hand friend and helper, Fr&auml;ulein <lb/>
Louise B&uuml;chner. The Grand Duchess had been <lb/>
much stirred by Miss Octavia Hill's self-denying <lb/>
labours for the poor of London, and feeling <reg orig="con-|vinced">convinced</reg> <lb/>
that the true way to benefit the poor of <lb/>
Germany was to step down into their midst and <lb/>
become their friends, she visited <foreign lang="rus"><hi rend="italic">incognito</hi></foreign> the most <lb/>
insanitary dwellings in Mayence, "and determined <lb/>
to make a plan for the erection of new dwellings <lb/>
for the working classes there."</p>
<p>But the close of her own brave and unselfish life <lb/>
was at hand. Early in 1878, the state of her health <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0060"/>
prevented her from accompanying the Grand Duke <lb/>
to Berlin, for the marriage of their niece, the <lb/>
Princess Charlotte of Prussia, to the Hereditary <lb/>
Prince of Saxe-Meiningen, and that of the Princess <lb/>
Elizabeth of Prussia&mdash;sister to the Duchess of <lb/>
Connaught&mdash;with the Hereditary Grand Duke of <lb/>
Oldenburg. The famous portrait-painter, Heinrich <lb/>
von Angeli, proceeded to Darmstadt in the spring, <lb/>
and executed a family picture of the Grand Duke <lb/>
and Grand Duchess, and their children, by <reg orig="com-|mand">command</reg> <lb/>
of Queen Victoria. The portrait of the <lb/>
Princess was the last painted of her. The whole <lb/>
family spent the summer months at Eastbourne, <lb/>
for the benefit of the sea-air and the sea-bathing. <lb/>
They also visited the Queen at Osborne. During <lb/>
the stay at Eastbourne, the Princess went in and <lb/>
out amongst the people in the poorest parts of <lb/>
the town, especially the fisher-folk; and she found <lb/>
great pleasure, also, in her visits to the Sunday <lb/>
school, and in ministering to the sick at their <lb/>
homes. She attended Divine service at a little <lb/>
church away from the town, because it stood in <lb/>
need of support and pecuniary help. The Princess <lb/>
went over to Brighton <foreign lang="rus"><hi rend="italic">incognito</hi></foreign> to inspect the <lb/>
Albion Home for Women; and, sympathizing with <lb/>
the efforts of its founder and manager, Mrs. Vicars, <lb/>
she became patroness of the Home. "I only come <lb/>
as one woman to visit another," was the Princess's <lb/>
remark, when Mrs. Vicars wished to reveal her <lb/>
identity to the poor patients. On returning to <lb/>
Darmstadt, she tried to throw herself with all her <lb/>
old energy into her own work, but had no longer <lb/>
the bodily strength to do so. In the autumn, she <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0061"/>
welcomed for the last time several of her relatives, <lb/>
her brother, Prince Leopold, being her final visitor.</p>
<p>Owing to some unexplained cause, the Princess <lb/>
Victoria was suddenly attacked with diphtheria <lb/>
on November 8. She was at once isolated, and <lb/>
her courageous mother, though far from well, <reg orig="super-|intended">superintended</reg> <lb/>
the nursing, aided by the <reg orig="lady-superin-|tendent">lady-superin-tendent</reg> <lb/>
of her hospital and other nurses. The <lb/>
Princess Victoria recovered, but all the other <lb/>
children, except the Princess Elizabeth, were seized <lb/>
in turn, as well as the Grand Duke. For eight <lb/>
days the devoted mother went on with her nursing, <lb/>
almost speechless with agony, and then, on <reg orig="Novem-|ber">November</reg> <lb/>
16, the Princess May&mdash;her parents' "sunshine" <lb/>
&mdash;was taken away. The Grand Duchess was alone <lb/>
with the dead child, and the last scene over the <lb/>
coffin was very pathetic. Gradually the Grand <lb/>
Duke and the other children recovered. For a <lb/>
time the mother was nearly heart-broken over the <lb/>
loss of her child; but she was at length able to <lb/>
find comfort in the sympathy of friends, and to <lb/>
say, "I believe all works together for good for <lb/>
those who believe in God."</p>
<p>The Grand Duchess herself, however, was taken <lb/>
ill on December 7. In the course of the day she <lb/>
had been to the Darmstadt railway station, to see <lb/>
the Duchess of Edinburgh&mdash;who was on her way <lb/>
to England; but she was far from well, and on the <lb/>
following day she developed the dreaded symptoms <lb/>
of diphtheria. It was thought that she must have <lb/>
taken the infection from laying her head on her <lb/>
sick husband's pillow, one day when she was <reg orig="over-|come">overcome</reg> <lb/>
by grief and despair. While it was thought <lb/>
<pb n="59" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0062"/>
possible she would recover, she, nevertheless, made <lb/>
preparations for death. She bore her sufferings <lb/>
with singular sweetness and patience, and made <lb/>
every effort to recover, for the sake of her husband <lb/>
and children. But high fever set in, with great <lb/>
prostration; and by the morning of the 13th it was <lb/>
evident to the doctors that her life was ebbing <lb/>
away. She roused herself, after some hours of <lb/>
heavy sleep, to take nourishment, and then said, <lb/>
"Now I will go to sleep again. "It proved to be <lb/>
the sleep that knows no waking. The fatal change <lb/>
came during the early hours of December 14. <lb/>
Several unconscious hours passed by, and then, at <lb/>
half-past eight o'clock, Princess Alice peacefully <lb/>
died, murmuring to herself, "From Friday to <lb/>
Saturday&mdash;four weeks&mdash;May&mdash;dear Papa<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g1"/>!" <lb/>
It was that day four weeks since the death of her <lb/>
beloved child, and exactly seventeen years since <lb/>
the death of the Prince Consort. A solemn service <lb/>
was held by the English chaplain on the 17th; and <lb/>
the next day, amid the universal grief of the nation, <lb/>
the remains of the beloved Princess were laid to <lb/>
rest in the mausoleum at the Rosenh&ouml;he. In the <lb/>
church where the burial service was held, the right <lb/>
side of the altar was occupied by members of the <lb/>
Women's Union for Nursing the Sick and Wounded <lb/>
in War, founded by the Grand Duchess, and on <lb/>
the left were the ladies of the Court and others. <lb/>
The chief mourners were the Grand Duke of Hesse, <lb/>
the Prince of Wales, Prince Leopold, Prince <reg orig="Chris-|tian">Christian</reg> <lb/>
of Schleswig-Holstein, and the Grand Dukes <lb/>
of Mecklenburg and Baden. During the time of <lb/>
the obsequies at Darmstadt and Rosenh&ouml;he, a <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0063"/>
solemn service was held at Windsor Castle&mdash;the <lb/>
Queen, the Princess of Wales, Princess Beatrice, <lb/>
the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Duke of <lb/>
Connaught, and the Duke of Cambridge being <lb/>
present. It was touching to see the many gifts of <lb/>
love, of gratitude, and of esteem laid upon the bier <lb/>
of the Grand Duchess by high and low. The whole <lb/>
people seemed to be moved by one common sorrow. <lb/>
Over the spot in the mausoleum where the Princess <lb/>
sleeps, a beautiful recumbent monument by Boehm <lb/>
is now to be seen, which represents the Grand <lb/>
Duchess holding the Princess May in her arms.</p>
<p>Noble simplicity and unassuming goodness were <lb/>
leading characteristics of the Princess Alice; but <lb/>
there were other winning features besides these. <lb/>
She looked at life from the highest point of view; <lb/>
was compassionate towards the erring, and <reg orig="sympa-|thetic">sympathetic</reg> <lb/>
with the unfortunate. She was independent <lb/>
in judgment, and generous in her sentiments and <lb/>
actions. Never idle, it was in times of difficulty <lb/>
and peril that the largeness of her nature specially <lb/>
manifested itself. No person was too humble to <lb/>
elicit her interest. She had a gracious manner, <lb/>
was dignified yet simply natural in demeanour, and <lb/>
was bright and animated in conversation. All <lb/>
forms of excellence she revered, and she was <lb/>
especially drawn towards music and the arts, in <lb/>
which she excelled. She was well read, and was <lb/>
a keen critic of the political movements of her <lb/>
time. As her sister, the Princess Christian, has <lb/>
observed, "Her letters must deepen the love and <lb/>
admiration which have always been felt for her." <lb/>
But the chief glory of the Princess Alice was no <lb/>
<pb n="61" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0064"/>
doubt her true womanliness. She was a perfect <lb/>
daughter, and a perfect wife and mother. She <lb/>
ever did her duty in these respects as in God's <lb/>
sight; and, animated by a perfect trust in Him, <lb/>
she was always ready to commit herself and those <lb/>
whom she loved to His everlasting care and <lb/>
protection.</p>

FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">A new</hi> generation can scarcely understand the <lb/>
wave of enthusiasm which passed over England <lb/>
in the deadly winter of 1854&ndash;5, when it became <lb/>
known that a lady had left her comfortable home, <lb/>
at the head of a noble band of ministering spirits, <lb/>
to alleviate the sufferings of our wounded soldiers <lb/>
in the Crimea. It was a philanthropic act which <lb/>
deservedly rendered the name of Florence <reg orig="Nightin-|gale">Nightingale</reg> <lb/>
illustrious. Nothing but a courageous sense <lb/>
of duty, and that heroism which is born of personal <lb/>
devotion, could have inspired a gentle, sensitive, <lb/>
and retiring Englishwoman to brave the many <lb/>
dangers which beset her, as she set forth on her <lb/>
great mission of mercy. But that mission was <lb/>
successfully accomplished, and the British nation <lb/>
has ever since held in affectionate regard and <lb/>
veneration the name of the woman who, to save <lb/>
the lives of others, fearlessly carried her own life <lb/>
in her hand.</p>
<p>Florence Nightingale is the younger daughter of <lb/>
a Hampshire landowner, the late Mr. William E. <lb/>
Nightingale, of Embley Park, Hampshire, and Lea <lb/>
Hurst, Derbyshire. Her mother was a daughter <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0069"/>
of Mr. William Smith, who was well known for <lb/>
the part he took in the anti-slavery movement, <lb/>
and who for a considerable period represented the <lb/>
city of Norwich in Parliament. Miss Nightingale <lb/>
was born at Florence, in May, 1820, while her <lb/>
parents were on a visit to that city, and she <lb/>
received the name of the beautiful Italian city in <lb/>
consequence. Her childhood, however, was spent <lb/>
in England, and chiefly at Lea Hurst, amid the <lb/>
lovely scenery of her father's native county. She <lb/>
imbibed from the first a strong love of all animate <lb/>
and inanimate objects in nature. While in her <lb/>
teens, she would accompany her father's old friend, <lb/>
the parish clergyman, in his rounds among his sick <lb/>
parishioners. Even at this early period, nothing <lb/>
that was suffering appealed to her in vain.</p>
<p>One incident related of her youth revealed <lb/>
the tender-hearted woman of the future. Some <lb/>
boys had thrown stones at a valuable shepherd <lb/>
dog, belonging to an old Scotch shepherd, and <lb/>
broken its leg, and it was decided that it would <lb/>
be a mercy to kill the poor animal, when little <lb/>
Florence Nightingale came upon the scene. She <lb/>
went up to where the dog lay, saying in a soft, <lb/>
caressing tone, "Poor Cap! poor Cap!" It was <lb/>
enough; he looked up with his speaking brown <lb/>
eyes, now bloodshot and full of pain, and did not <lb/>
resent it, when, kneeling down beside him, she <lb/>
stroked with her little ungloved hand the large, <lb/>
intelligent head. To the vicar he was rather <lb/>
less amenable, but by dint of coaxing allowed <lb/>
him at last to touch and examine the wounded <lb/>
leg, Florence persuasively assuring him it was <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0070"/>
all right. Indeed, she was on the floor beside <lb/>
him, with his head on her lap. The vicar <reg orig="re-|ported">reported</reg> <lb/>
that there were no broken bones, but <lb/>
the bruised limb ought to be fomented. "How <lb/>
do you foment?" asked Florence. "With hot <lb/>
cloths dipped in boiling water," answered the <lb/>
vicar. "Then that's quite easy. I'll stay here <lb/>
and do it. Now, Jimmy, get some sticks, and <lb/>
make the kettle boil," she said to the shepherd's <lb/>
grandson at the cottage. "But they will be <reg orig="ex-|pecting">expecting</reg> <lb/>
you at home," said the vicar. "Not if <lb/>
you tell them I'm here," answered Florence; "and <lb/>
my sister and one of the maids can come and <lb/>
fetch me home. They had better bring some old <lb/>
flannel and cloths; there does not seem to be <lb/>
much here." The vicar, interested and amused <lb/>
by her energy, showed her how to foment. An <lb/>
old smock-frock of the shepherd's had been <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg> <lb/>
in a corner, which Florence had deliberately <lb/>
torn into pieces; and to the vicar's remark, "What <lb/>
will Roger say?" she replied, "We'll give him <lb/>
another." So Florence Nightingale made her first <lb/>
compress, and spent the bright spring day in <lb/>
nursing her first patient. In the evening, when <lb/>
Roger came, with a cord, intending to put the dog <lb/>
out of its misery, Florence went up to him. "You <lb/>
can throw that away, Roger," she said; "your dog <lb/>
won't die; look at him!" And Cap rose and <lb/>
crawled towards his master, whining with pleasure. <lb/>
"Deary me! deary me! what have you done with <lb/>
him? He could not move this morning, when I <lb/>
left him!" Then Florence explained the mode of <lb/>
treatment, and added, "You have only to go on <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0071"/>
to-night, and to-morrow he will be almost well. <lb/>
He will be able to do his work again." Then, <lb/>
after once more stroking and fondling the dog, <lb/>
she took her leave. The native earnestness thus <lb/>
displayed caused her also to take a great interest <lb/>
in the sick and distressed people of the parish.</p>
<p>Mr. Nightingale was a man of culture and wide <lb/>
sympathies; and as he was also a man of position, <lb/>
his daughter enjoyed the advantages which fall to <lb/>
the lot of the children of the affluent and refined. <lb/>
Under his guidance, she received an excellent <lb/>
education, and attained considerable proficiency <lb/>
in classics, mathematics, and various modern <lb/>
languages. These and other branches of study <lb/>
stood her in good stead in her after career. Nor <lb/>
was the practical side of a girl's education <reg orig="for-|gotten">forgotten</reg>, <lb/>
for she became a clever needlewoman, <lb/>
and an accomplished musician. For the ordinary <lb/>
pleasures of society she cared but little as she grew <lb/>
up, and it is recorded of her that though she was <lb/>
presented at Court, and might have plunged into <lb/>
all the gaieties of London life, she spent her first <lb/>
season in town in thoroughly and assiduously <lb/>
investigating the working of hospitals, <reg orig="reforma-|tories">reformatories</reg>, <lb/>
and other charitable institutions. In the <lb/>
same praiseworthy and enterprising spirit, she <lb/>
visited and inspected civil and military hospitals <lb/>
all over Europe. In the year 1851, she went into <lb/>
training as a nurse in the Institution of Protestant <lb/>
Deaconesses at Kaiserswerth on the Rhine, where <lb/>
she remained for six months, making herself <lb/>
thoroughly acquainted with all the details of <lb/>
hospital management. Though naturally a very <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0072"/>
shy person, when necessity pointed the way she <lb/>
was not afraid to go out into the world. In a <lb/>
letter to young women on work and duty, she <lb/>
remarked, "I would say to all young ladies, who <lb/>
are called to any particular vocation, qualify <reg orig="your-|selves">yourselves</reg> <lb/>
for it, as a man does for his work. Don't <lb/>
think you can undertake it otherwise.&hellip; Submit <lb/>
yourselves to the rules of business, as men do, by <lb/>
which alone you can make God's business succeed; <lb/>
for He has never said that He will give His success <lb/>
and His blessing to sketchy and unfinished work." <lb/>
On another occasion she said: "Three-fourths of <lb/>
the whole mischief in women's lives arises from <lb/>
their excepting themselves from the rules of <lb/>
training considered needful for men." Pursuing <lb/>
her own career, Miss Nightingale studied for a <lb/>
time with the Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul in <lb/>
Paris, the system of nursing and management <lb/>
carried out in the hospitals of that city. While <lb/>
imbued with strong, religious feeling, and firm in <lb/>
her own Protestantism, she welcomed all workers <lb/>
of whatever creed in the broad field of <reg orig="humani-|tarian">humanitarian</reg> <lb/>
effort.</p>
<p>After her return to England, she devoted both <lb/>
her personal energies and private means to <reg orig="re-|storing">restoring</reg> <lb/>
and reorganizing the Governesses' <reg orig="Sani-|tarium">Sanitarium</reg> <lb/>
in Harley Street. This institution was <lb/>
languishing for the lack of supervision and <lb/>
support, and under her direction it soon took a <lb/>
new lease of life.</p>
<p>But a wider and more important sphere of <lb/>
usefulness was destined to open out for Florence <lb/>
Nightingale. In 1854, the sanguinary war in the <lb/>
<pb n="70" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0073"/>
East was in progress, and the inefficiency and <lb/>
mismanagement of our military hospitals in the <lb/>
Crimea led to an outburst of public feeling. <lb/>
Reports reached England of brave men literally <lb/>
dying by hundreds from starvation and neglect. <lb/>
After the battle of the Alma, Sir Robert Peel <lb/>
wrote to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, recounting the sufferings <lb/>
of the victorious troops; a Cabinet Minister <lb/>
described the reports as "horrible and <reg orig="heart-|rending">heart-rending</reg>"; <lb/>
and the Hon. and Rev. S. Godolphin <lb/>
Osborne &lpar;"S.G.O." of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>&rpar; thus gave his <lb/>
testimony as to the unparalleled neglect at the <lb/>
seat of war: "There was an utter absence of the <lb/>
commonest preparation to carry out the very first <lb/>
and simplest demands in a place set apart to <lb/>
receive the sick and wounded of a large army. <lb/>
&hellip; For some weeks, more than a thousand <lb/>
patients had no bedsteads. &hellip; For many weeks, <lb/>
laundry there was none. &hellip; The patients lay <lb/>
either on the floor or on the wooden divans which <lb/>
surrounded some of the wards. The boards under <lb/>
their chaff beds on which they lay were rotten, <lb/>
and I have seen them alive with vermin and <lb/>
saturated with everything offensive. I was <reg orig="in-|formed">informed</reg> <lb/>
by one of the chief authorities that if <lb/>
these wards were washed they never could be got <lb/>
dry. &hellip; The reader may conceive my <reg orig="astonish-|ment">astonishment</reg>, <lb/>
on going to see the cholera ward the day <lb/>
after it was cleared &lpar;of patients&rpar;, when I found <lb/>
some of the authorities had begun to use it <hi rend="italic">for a <lb/>
storeroom for the new blankets and quilts just come <lb/>
from England.</hi> &hellip; The meat brought up for the <lb/>
men's dinners was not only served out in a way <lb/>
<pb n="71" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0074"/>
perfectly disgraceful, but at times I have seen it <lb/>
so raw they could not eat it.&hellip; There were many <lb/>
men lying in bed with dysentery or open sores, who <lb/>
had not had a change of linen for months."</p>
<p>A Patriotic Fund was established, and money <lb/>
poured in from all parts of the country. But <lb/>
before this national movement, an appeal in the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Times</hi> had, in less than a fortnight, brought in a <lb/>
sum of about &pound;15,000 to the office of that <lb/>
journal. The proprietors sent out a Commissioner <lb/>
to administer this fund in the shape of medicines <lb/>
and necessary comforts. Incalculable good resulted <lb/>
from this timely aid, so much so that when at a <lb/>
later date the subscription was reopened, the <lb/>
amount was increased to upwards of &pound;25,000. A <lb/>
Royal Commission was issued on October 13, with <lb/>
the Prince Consort at its head, for the purpose of <lb/>
establishing "a fund for the relief of the orphans <lb/>
and widows of soldiers, sailors, and marines, who <lb/>
may fall in the present war." The fund thus set <lb/>
on foot, known as the Patriotic Fund, exceeded <lb/>
&pound;500,000 before the end of the year, and ultimately <lb/>
it rose to the magnificent total of &pound;1,250,000. <lb/>
Subscriptions were also raised for sending <reg orig="addi-|tional">additional</reg> <lb/>
chaplains to the seat of war, to aid the <lb/>
overtasked military chaplains there.</p>
<p>In his "Life of the Prince Consort," Sir Theodore <lb/>
Martin thus graphically describes what followed: <lb/>
"A spontaneous burst of enthusiasm broke out <lb/>
among ladies in all parts of the country, which <lb/>
took the form of an organization of female hospital <lb/>
nurses. These were placed under the <reg orig="super-|intendence">superintendence</reg> <lb/>
of Miss Florence Nightingale, a lady <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0075"/>
pre-eminently fitted for the task by her great <lb/>
natural gifts for organization, and by invaluable <lb/>
experience gained at the hospital at Kaiserswerth <lb/>
in Prussia, and elsewhere abroad. At the request <lb/>
of Mr. Sidney Herbert &lpar;War Secretary, and <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
Lord Herbert of Lea&rpar;, this lady undertook the <lb/>
direction of this devoted band, and, accompanied <lb/>
by her friends, Mr. Bracebridge, of Atherstone <lb/>
Hall, Warwickshire, and his wife, proceeded with <lb/>
thirty-seven nurses, partly volunteers, partly trained <lb/>
in hospitals, to Constantinople. They reached <lb/>
Scutari on November 5, in time to receive the <lb/>
soldiers who had been wounded at the battle of <lb/>
Balaclava. On the arrival of Miss Nightingale, <lb/>
the great hospital at Scutari, where all had up to <lb/>
this time been chaos and discomfort, began to <lb/>
be reduced to order; and those tender lenitives <lb/>
which only woman's thought and woman's <reg orig="sym-|pathy">sympathy</reg> <lb/>
can bring to the sick man's couch, were <lb/>
applied to solace and alleviate the agonies of <lb/>
pain, or the torture of fever and prostration. The <lb/>
introduction of such an addition to the staff of a <lb/>
military hospital had been deprecated by the <lb/>
worshippers of official routine&mdash;with such men <lb/>
nothing new can be good&mdash;but so completely did <lb/>
experience belie their fears, that a further staff of <lb/>
forty ladies and nurses, under the direction of Miss <lb/>
Stanley, sister of the late Dean of Westminster, <lb/>
was soon afterwards sent from England, to aid in <lb/>
the work which Miss Nightingale and her assistants <lb/>
had begun. In the records of the war, the services <lb/>
of these admirable women occupy a page to which <lb/>
their countrymen must always turn with pride.</p>
<pb n="73" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0076"/>
<p>"While public munificence was busy doing what <lb/>
it might for the well-being and comfort of the <lb/>
army, individual acts of kindness were not wanting <lb/>
in every quarter. It was but little, after all, that <lb/>
could be done, but everything helped to bring <lb/>
the animating assurance of sympathy, where in <lb/>
truth it was sorely needed. The Queen herself, the <lb/>
elder Princesses, and her Majesty's ladies, made <lb/>
woollen comforters, mittens, and other warm <lb/>
coverings, which were sent out and distributed <lb/>
among the soldiers. Thousands of gentle hands <lb/>
throughout the country worked long hours <reg orig="un-|weariedly">unweariedly</reg> <lb/>
for the same praiseworthy purpose. On <lb/>
his part the Prince sent out great-coats to all his <lb/>
brother officers of the Brigade of Guards, and a <lb/>
liberal supply of tobacco to their men, and also <lb/>
to the men of the two Battalions of Rifles, and of <lb/>
the 11th Hussars."</p>
<p>Returning to the labours of Miss Nightingale, <lb/>
which demand relation in greater detail, it should <lb/>
be stated that she had already written to the War <lb/>
Secretary, offering to go out to the Crimea, and <lb/>
that by a curious coincidence Mr. Sidney Herbert's <lb/>
letter crossed her own. Miss Nightingale had <lb/>
also had an interview with the late Lady Maria <lb/>
Forester, whose brother, the Earl of Roden, was <lb/>
serving in the Guards before Sebastopol. Lady <lb/>
Maria had lost her husband, and having no <lb/>
children, she was anxious to do what she could <lb/>
to alleviate the sufferings of the sick and wounded. <lb/>
She therefore called upon Miss Nightingale, and <lb/>
was warmly received by her. Shortly after this <lb/>
interview, Florence Nightingale and her friends <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0077"/>
set forth upon their mission. So warmly did the <lb/>
French people admire Miss Nightingale's action, <lb/>
that when she crossed over the Channel with her <lb/>
band of nurses, the French hotel-keepers refused <lb/>
to accept payment for them, and the fisherwomen <lb/>
of Boulogne carried their luggage through the <lb/>
town. It has already been stated that when <lb/>
Miss Nightingale reached Scutari, she was in <lb/>
time to receive the sufferers in the glorious charge <lb/>
at Balaclava. On November 7, she further received <lb/>
600 soldiers wounded at Inkerman, and in three <lb/>
weeks the number had increased to 3000. The <lb/>
Lady-in-Chief&mdash;as Miss Nightingale was called&mdash; <lb/>
would stand twenty hours at a stretch, in order <lb/>
to see the wounded provided with accommodation <lb/>
and all the requisites of their condition, and a few <lb/>
months after her arrival, she had 10,000 sick men <lb/>
under her care. She was everywhere, and by her <lb/>
cheerful presence and thoughtful consideration she <lb/>
cheered the sick, and animated the nurses in their <lb/>
task. "S.G.O.," in describing her appearance, <lb/>
spoke of her as "just what you would expect in <lb/>
any other well-bred woman, who may have seen <lb/>
perhaps rather more than thirty years of life; her <lb/>
manner and countenance are prepossessing, and <lb/>
this without the possession of positive beauty; it <lb/>
is a face not easily forgotten, pleasing in its smile, <lb/>
with an eye betokening great self-possession, and <lb/>
giving, when she wishes, a quiet look of firm <lb/>
determination to every feature. Her general <lb/>
demeanour is quiet and rather reserved; still I <lb/>
am much mistaken if she is not gifted with a <lb/>
very lively sense of the ridiculous. &hellip; She has <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0078"/>
evidently a mind disciplined to restrain, under <lb/>
the principles of the action of the moment, every <lb/>
feeling which would interfere with it. She has <lb/>
trained herself to command, and learned the value <lb/>
of conciliation towards others and constraint over <lb/>
herself. I can conceive her to be a strict <reg orig="discipli-|narian">disciplinarian</reg>. <lb/>
She throws herself into a work&mdash;as its <lb/>
head&mdash;as she knows well how much success must <lb/>
depend upon literal obedience to her every order. <lb/>
&hellip; Her nerve is wonderful. &hellip; She has an <lb/>
utter disregard of contagion."</p>
<p>Miss Nightingale, with her clear and practised <lb/>
eye, quickly perceived in the bad sanitary <reg orig="arrange-|ments">arrangements</reg> <lb/>
of the hospitals the causes of the frightful <lb/>
mortality, and her incessant efforts were devoted to <lb/>
the removal of these causes, as well as to the <reg orig="miti-|gation">mitigation</reg> <lb/>
of their effects. Though labouring under <lb/>
grave discouragements, she soon made her hospital <lb/>
a model for thoroughness and perfection of <reg orig="arrange-|ments">arrangements</reg>, <lb/>
and all the other hospitals on the Bosphorus <lb/>
were placed under her superintendence. It should <lb/>
be noted that as the humble soldiers were likely <lb/>
to be the men most in want of care, the original <lb/>
instructions to the nurses were that they should <lb/>
not attend upon the officers, but devote themselves <lb/>
to those suffering soldiers who had neither <reg orig="advan-|tages">advantages</reg> <lb/>
nor friends. In his able and fascinating <lb/>
history, "The Invasion of the Crimea," Mr. <reg orig="King-|lake">Kinglake</reg> <lb/>
has devoted a chapter to the "Care of the <lb/>
Sick and Wounded," in which he tells the story of <lb/>
Miss Nightingale's mission. He observes that, <lb/>
"with all the rare attributes that made her gracious <lb/>
presence a blessing at the patient's bedside, this <lb/>
<pb n="76" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0079"/>
gifted woman, when learning how best to compass <lb/>
the objects of a largely extended benevolence, had <lb/>
become well-practised, well-versed in the business <lb/>
of hospital management; and none knew better <lb/>
than she did that, if kind, devoted attention will <lb/>
suffice to comfort one sufferer, or even, perhaps, <lb/>
four or five, it is powerless to benefit those who <lb/>
number by thousands, unless reinforced by method, <lb/>
by organization, by discipline. She knew that for <lb/>
affording due care to a prostrate soldiery, laid out <lb/>
before her in ranks so appallingly long as to bear <lb/>
being reckoned in miles, an administrative <reg orig="mecha-|nism">mechanism</reg>, <lb/>
both impelled and controlled by authority, <lb/>
was a condition of absolute need; and, far from <lb/>
being a spurner of rules, she had so deep a sense <lb/>
of their worth as to be seemingly much more in <lb/>
danger of proving too strict than too lax.</p>
<p>"She understood the dire exigencies of war; she <lb/>
knew what an army was, and&mdash;because <reg orig="distinguish-|ing">distinguishing</reg> <lb/>
measures which might be possibly feasible from <lb/>
such as lay out of reach&mdash;knew how to approach <lb/>
its commander. Springing up under circumstances <lb/>
of a novel kind, the private correspondence <reg orig="main-|tained">maintained</reg> <lb/>
between her and Lord Raglan was a very <lb/>
model of what such writing should be, being marked <lb/>
on each side by clear-sightedness, by ample <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
of subject, by care&mdash;ceaseless care&mdash;for the <lb/>
public service."</p>
<p>The Lady-in-Chief was unflinchingly supported <lb/>
by Mr. Sidney Herbert, who, for hospital purposes, <lb/>
was practically the Government. He weighed <lb/>
carefully the letters she addressed to him at Scutari, <lb/>
and by their aid he soon pierced through the haze <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0080"/>
surrounding the accounts from the Bosphorus. <lb/>
His instructions now to the military commandant, <lb/>
Lord William Paulet, and to the medical and other <lb/>
authorities, were found in accordance with the <lb/>
necessities pointed out by Miss Nightingale. In <lb/>
her turn, she was strongly supported by public <lb/>
opinion at home. Even martinets acknowledged <lb/>
her skill and her faculty for organization; and Sir <lb/>
George Brown&mdash;the hero of Inkerman, and the <lb/>
most unbending opponent of innovations&mdash;declared <lb/>
before the end of December, 1854, that something <lb/>
little short of perfection had even then been attained <lb/>
in the hospital under her sway. So great was her <lb/>
power over others that Dean Stanley ascribed to <lb/>
her nothing less than "commanding genius." <lb/>
"While she thus had great weight with the men <lb/>
in authority," proceeds Mr. Kinglake, "her <reg orig="ascen-|dant">ascendant</reg> <lb/>
held good with the orderlies and all other <lb/>
soldiers whose energies, whose patience, whose <lb/>
loyal devotion she often had to task hard. 'During <lb/>
all that dreadful period, no one of them failed her <lb/>
in obedience, in ready attention, in thoughtful, <reg orig="con-|siderate">considerate</reg> <lb/>
delicacy. For her sake, they toiled and <lb/>
endured beyond the measure of all that official <lb/>
words of command could well have sought to <reg orig="ex-|act">exact</reg>; <lb/>
yet never,' she gratefully wrote, 'came from <lb/>
any of them one word nor one look which a <reg orig="gentle-|man">gentleman</reg> <lb/>
would not have used; and while paying this <lb/>
humble tribute to humble courtesy, the tears come <lb/>
into my eyes as I think how, amidst scenes of <lb/>
loathsome disease and death, there arose above it <lb/>
all the innate dignity, gentleness, and chivalry of <lb/>
the men &lpar;for never, surely, was chivalry so strikingly <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0081"/>
exemplified&rpar; shining in the midst of what must <lb/>
be considered as the lowest sinks of human misery, <lb/>
and preventing instinctively the use of one <reg orig="ex-|pression">expression</reg> <lb/>
which could distress a gentlewoman.'</p>
<p>"But if those touching words truly rendered <lb/>
the bearing of the hospital orderlies and of the <lb/>
convalescents and other soldiers who were strong <lb/>
enough to be able to obey her, there was worship <lb/>
almost in the gratitude of the prostrate sufferer, <lb/>
who saw her glide into his ward, and at last <lb/>
approach his bedside. The magic of her power <lb/>
over men used often to be felt in the room&mdash;the <lb/>
dreaded, the blood-stained room&mdash;where '<reg orig="opera-|tions">operations</reg>' <lb/>
took place. There, perhaps, the maimed <lb/>
soldier, if not yet resigned to his fate, might at <lb/>
first be craving death rather than meet the knife <lb/>
of the surgeon; but, when such a one looked and <lb/>
saw that the honoured Lady-in-Chief was patiently <lb/>
standing beside him, and&mdash;with lips closely set and <lb/>
hands folded&mdash;decreeing herself to go through the <lb/>
pain of witnessing pain, he used to fall into the <lb/>
mood for obeying her silent command, <reg orig="and&mdash;find-|ing">and&mdash;finding</reg> <lb/>
strange support in her presence&mdash;bring himself <lb/>
to submit and endure."</p>
<p>From her very position, a beneficent dictatorship <lb/>
was thrust upon Florence Nightingale, which she <lb/>
wisely and tenderly used. But her hand was felt <lb/>
everywhere, and no one else had the ability or <lb/>
the courage to take the initiative. Yet merit in <lb/>
others, wherever she perceived it, was rewarded <lb/>
with generous phrase. "She reigned&mdash;painful, <lb/>
heart-rending empire!&mdash;in a spirit of thorough <lb/>
devotion to the objects of her care, and, upon the <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0082"/>
whole, with excellent wisdom." Among those <lb/>
who rendered her loyal and invaluable support was <lb/>
Mr. Macdonald, the administrator of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>' <lb/>
fund. When the authorities had assured Mr. <lb/>
Macdonald that nothing was wanted in the Scutari <lb/>
hospitals, she proved to him that the needs of the <lb/>
patients were dire in the extreme, and she pointed <lb/>
out the means for a wise distribution of the funds <lb/>
at his command. Red tape, for almost the first <lb/>
time in its history, suffered a severe overthrow. <lb/>
"It was thus that, under the sway of motives <lb/>
superbly exalted, a great lady came to the rescue <lb/>
of our prostrate soldiery, made good the default <lb/>
of the State, won the gratitude, the rapt <reg orig="admira-|tion">admiration</reg> <lb/>
of an enthusiastic people, and earned for the <lb/>
name she bears a pure, lasting renown.</p>
<p>"She even did more. By the power of her <lb/>
fame, but also, I believe, by the wisdom and the <lb/>
authority of her counsels, she founded, if so one <lb/>
may speak, a gracious dynasty that still reigns <lb/>
supreme in the wards where sufferers lie, and even <lb/>
brings solace, brings guidance, brings hope into <lb/>
those dens of misery that, until the blessing has <lb/>
reached them, seem only to harbour despair. When <lb/>
into the midst of such scenes the young high-bred <lb/>
lady now glides, she wears that same sacred <lb/>
armour&mdash;the gentle attire of the servitress which <lb/>
seemed 'heavenly' in the eyes of our soldiers at <lb/>
the time of the war, and finds strength to meet her <lb/>
dire task&mdash;because she knows by tradition what <lb/>
the first of the dynasty proved able to confront <lb/>
and vanquish in the wards of the Great Barrack <lb/>
Hospital."</p>
<pb n="80" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0083"/>
<p>Mr. Kinglake, who bears this striking testimony, <lb/>
mentions a typical instance of devotion on the <lb/>
part of those who were burning to do something <lb/>
in the cause of humanity, and who rejoiced to <lb/>
receive their orders from Miss Nightingale. It <lb/>
was the case of a self-sacrificing, enthusiastic young <lb/>
fellow, who, abandoning his life of ease, pleasure, <lb/>
and luxury in England, went out&mdash;as he probably <lb/>
phrased it&mdash;to "fag" for the Lady-in-Chief. <lb/>
"Whether fetching and carrying for her, or writing <lb/>
for her letters or orders, or orally conveying her <lb/>
wishes to public servants or others, he, for months <lb/>
and months, faithfully toiled, obeying in all <lb/>
things her words. There was grace&mdash;grace almost <lb/>
medi&aelig;val&mdash;in his simple yet romantic idea; and, <lb/>
if humbly, still not the less usefully, he aided the <lb/>
sacred cause, for it was one largely, mainly, <reg orig="de-|pendent">dependent</reg> <lb/>
on the power of the lady he served, so <lb/>
that, when by obeying her orders he augmented <lb/>
her means of action, and saved her precious time, <lb/>
there were unnumbered sufferers deriving sure <lb/>
benefit from his opportune, well-applied help. By <lb/>
no other kind of toil, however ambitiously aimed, <lb/>
could he well have achieved so much good."</p>
<p>While the authorities in England were consider <lb/>
ing what to do to remedy the disgraceful state of <lb/>
things at the seat of war, Miss Nightingale was <lb/>
educing order out of chaos. With a fearless spirit <lb/>
she faced the well-nigh overwhelming evils, and <lb/>
proceeded to lay them one by one. When soldiers <lb/>
were dying by hundreds, the Government fell <lb/>
back on that grandmotherly expedient, a <reg orig="Com-|mission">Commission</reg>, <lb/>
which, after months of inquiry, was to <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0084"/>
report home to the Duke of Newcastle. The <lb/>
Lady-in-Chief's method was better than that; she <lb/>
saw what wanted doing almost intuitively, and she <lb/>
did it. It is true that the Commissioners got <lb/>
through their investigations as quickly as they <lb/>
could, and duly made their report; but, knowing <lb/>
the value of time in such things, Mr. Sidney <lb/>
Herbert sent word out to correct the existing evils <lb/>
at once, wherever possible. Months before the <lb/>
report of the Commissioners could have been acted <lb/>
upon, womanly energy and womanly sympathy <lb/>
had secured order and efficiency in the hospitals.</p>
<p>Some idea of the hardships endured by the <lb/>
British troops in the Crimea may be gathered <lb/>
from a letter written by Miss Nightingale to a <lb/>
friend, and dated Balaclava, May 10, 1855. This <lb/>
letter was found among the Prince Consort's <lb/>
papers after his death. Said the writer: "Fancy <lb/>
working five nights out of seven in the trenches! <lb/>
Fancy being thirty-six hours in them at a stretch, <lb/>
as they were all December, lying down, or half <lb/>
lying down, often forty-eight hours, with no food <lb/>
but <hi rend="italic">raw</hi> salt pork sprinkled with sugar, rum, and <lb/>
biscuit; nothing hot, because the exhausted soldier <lb/>
could not collect his own fuel, as he was expected <lb/>
to do, to cook his own ration. And fancy through <lb/>
all this the army preserving their courage and <lb/>
patience as they have done, and being now eager <lb/>
&lpar;the old ones more than the young ones&rpar; to be led <lb/>
even into the trenches! There was something <lb/>
sublime in the spectacle." There was such a <lb/>
collapse in the Commissariat department that. <lb/>
with abundance of provisions a few miles off at <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0085"/>
Balaclava, men and horses were perishing for lack <lb/>
of food; and the survivors of Inkerman, after <lb/>
spending a day and night in the trenches, were often <lb/>
compelled to wade through mire to Balaclava, to <lb/>
bring up the rations, which the Commissariat were <lb/>
without the means of forwarding to the front.</p>
<p>During the spring of 1855, while engaged in <lb/>
organizing the nursing departments of the camp <lb/>
hospitals in the Crimea, Miss Nightingale was <lb/>
prostrated with fever, the result of unintermitting <lb/>
toil and anxiety; yet she refused to leave her post, <lb/>
and on her recovery remained at Scutari till <lb/>
Turkey was evacuated by the British on July 28, <lb/>
1856. She to whom many a soldier owed life <lb/>
and health, had expended her own health in the <lb/>
physical and mental strain to which she had <lb/>
subjected herself, and she was never afterwards <lb/>
restored to her former vigour.</p>
<p>When the Treaty of Peace came under the <reg orig="con-|sideration">consideration</reg> <lb/>
of the House of Lords, in May, 1856, <lb/>
Lord Ellesmere delivered a touching and eloquent <lb/>
speech. After paying a well-deserved tribute to <lb/>
the memory of Lord Raglan, he thus went on to <lb/>
speak of the army and of Miss Nightingale: "My <lb/>
lords, the agony of that time has become a matter <lb/>
of history. The vegetation of two successive <lb/>
springs has obscured the vestiges of Balaclava <lb/>
and Inkerman. Strong voices now answer to the <lb/>
roll-call, and sturdy forms now cluster round the <lb/>
colours. The ranks are full, the hospitals are <lb/>
empty. The angel of mercy still lingers to the <lb/>
last on the scene of her labours; but her mission <lb/>
is all but accomplished. Those long arcades of <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0086"/>
Scutari, in which dying men sat up to catch the <lb/>
sound of her footstep or the flutter of her dress, <lb/>
and fell back on the pillow content to have seen <lb/>
her shadow as it passed, are now comparatively <lb/>
deserted. She may probably be thinking how to <lb/>
escape, as best she may on her return, the <reg orig="demon-|strations">demonstrations</reg> <lb/>
of a nation's appreciation of the deeds <lb/>
and motives of Florence Nightingale." Mr. Sidney <lb/>
Herbert, also speaking of her in the House of <lb/>
Commons, said, "I have received not only from <lb/>
medical men, but from many others who have had <lb/>
an opportunity of making observations, letters <lb/>
couched in the highest possible terms of praise. <lb/>
I will not repeat the words, but no higher <reg orig="expres-|sions">expressions</reg> <lb/>
of praise could be applied to woman, for the <lb/>
wonderful energy, the wonderful tact, the <reg orig="wonder-|ful">wonderful</reg> <lb/>
tenderness, combined with the extraordinary <lb/>
self-devotion, which have been displayed by Miss <lb/>
Nightingale." Mr. Herbert's foresight in inviting <lb/>
Miss Nightingale to go out to the Crimea had <lb/>
been abundantly justified. His prediction also <lb/>
was destined to be fulfilled, when he affirmed that, <lb/>
if her enterprise succeeded, a prejudice would be <lb/>
broken through, and a precedent established which <lb/>
would multiply the good to all time.</p>
<p>Longfellow paid a beautiful tribute to Florence <lb/>
Nightingale in his exquisite poem entitled, "Santa <lb/>
Filomena." The idea was suggested by a picture <lb/>
in the church of St. Francis at Pisa, in which Saint <lb/>
Filomena is represented as a lovely figure, <reg orig="descend-|ing">descending</reg> <lb/>
from heaven, attended by two angels, while <lb/>
beneath her on the ground are the sick and the <lb/>
maimed, who were healed by her interposition. <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0087"/>
The poet has thus utilized the incident, and given <lb/>
it an immortal application to the deeds of Florence <lb/>
Nightingale&mdash; <lb/>

<p>Recognition of Miss Nightingale's labours was <lb/>
not wanting in exalted quarters. The Queen sent <lb/>
her a magnificent cross set with diamonds and an <lb/>
autograph letter of thanks. From the Sultan of <lb/>
Turkey she received a superb bracelet set with <lb/>
brilliants as "a mark of his estimation of her <lb/>
devotion." During the autumn of 1856 she was <lb/>
an honoured guest of her Majesty at Balmoral. <lb/>
On September 21, she was first introduced to the <lb/>
Queen and Prince by Sir James Clark, with whom <lb/>
she was then staying at Birkhall. "She put before <lb/>
us," says a brief entry in the Prince Consort's <lb/>
diary, "all the defects of our present military <lb/>
hospital system, and the reforms that are needed. <lb/>
We are much pleased with her; she is extremely <lb/>
modest." About a fortnight afterwards Miss <lb/>
Nightingale became the Queen's guest, the time <lb/>
of her visit being so fixed as to give Lord Panmure, <lb/>
who was then at Balmoral, an opportunity of <lb/>
learning from her own lips the story of what she <lb/>
had seen, and the conclusions she had drawn from <lb/>
her great and remarkable experiences in the East. <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0089"/>
Miss Nightingale steadily refused all public <reg orig="recog-|nition">recognition</reg> <lb/>
of herself apart from her work, and even <lb/>
declined to lay foundation stones or take part in <lb/>
any public ceremonies. It was significant of her <lb/>
that when she returned from the East, and it was <lb/>
proposed to give her a great ovation in London, <lb/>
she quietly escaped from what would have been <lb/>
to her an embarrassing ceremony, and retired <lb/>
unostentatiously to her country home.</p>
<p>A public subscription of &pound;50,000, raised in <lb/>
recognition of her noble services, was applied, at <lb/>
her own request, to the foundation of the <reg orig="Nightin-|gale">Nightingale</reg> <lb/>
Home, an institution for the training of <lb/>
nurses, connected with St. Thomas's Hospital and <lb/>
King's College Hospital, London. This proved <lb/>
the forerunner of many kindred organizations, and <lb/>
Miss Nightingale watched its development with <lb/>
the keenest interest, although her personal share <lb/>
in the work was very limited, as she became <lb/>
practically an invalid after the Crimean campaign. <lb/>
The Home turned out many admirable nurses, <lb/>
some of whom attained distinction for their services <lb/>
during the Franco-German war, while others have <lb/>
done noble work in England. Another movement <lb/>
which elicited Miss Nightingale's warm approval <lb/>
and pecuniary support was that for the erection <lb/>
of a central building, which should combine a <lb/>
labour registry office, a woman's friendly society, <lb/>
a large room for meetings, and good cheap <lb/>
lodgings for single working-women.</p>
<p>The experience which Miss Nightingale gained <lb/>
in the Crimea led her to turn her attention to the <lb/>
general question of army sanitary reform, and first <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0090"/>
to that of army hospitals. She was the chief <lb/>
mover in the measures initiated by Mr. Sidney <lb/>
Herbert and his colleagues to reduce the high <lb/>
rate of mortality in the British army; and she <lb/>
was much interested in the establishment of <lb/>
the Army Medical College at Chatham. At the <lb/>
request of the War Office, she drew up a <reg orig="volu-|minous">voluminous</reg> <lb/>
confidential report on the working of <lb/>
the army medical department in the Crimea. <lb/>
While confined to her house during the past <lb/>
thirty years by constant ill health, she has never <lb/>
ceased to labour for the welfare of our <reg orig="fellow-|subjects">fellow-subjects</reg> <lb/>
at home and abroad, in all matters <lb/>
affecting the improvement of their health, <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg>, <lb/>
and sanitary and social benefits. The <lb/>
regulations of hospitals and supply of nurses in <lb/>
different parts of the world, sanitary measures, <lb/>
and nursing arrangements for the army at home <lb/>
and on the Colonial stations have constantly <lb/>
occupied her time and thoughts. Her advice was <lb/>
frequently sought during the Civil War in America <lb/>
on questions affecting the health of the army and <lb/>
assistance for the wounded in the field. She was <lb/>
also similarly appealed to by the German <reg orig="authori-|ties">authorities</reg> <lb/>
during the Franco-German War, and her <lb/>
name evokes the same feeling of enthusiasm in <lb/>
the United States and Germany as it does in <lb/>
England.</p>
<p>The pen has been usefully employed by Miss <lb/>
Nightingale to further the causes which she has <lb/>
at heart. In 1858 she published her valuable <lb/>
"Notes on Nursing," which speedily attained a <lb/>
sale of a hundred thousand copies. In these <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0091"/>
"Notes," she showed what nursing is and what <lb/>
it is not. Useful hints were given to women who <lb/>
have personal charge of the health of others, <lb/>
and this of course embraces the vast majority of <lb/>
Englishwomen; for there are few women in this <lb/>
country who have not at some time or other <lb/>
charge of the personal health of relatives, invalids, <lb/>
or children; it is therefore essential that every <lb/>
woman should know how to nurse. The profession <lb/>
is quite distinct from that of the medical <reg orig="pro-|fession">profession</reg>. <lb/>
"We do not seek to make medical <lb/>
women," said Miss Nightingale, "but simply nurses <lb/>
acquainted with the principles which they are <lb/>
constantly required to apply at the bedside." The <lb/>
subjects on which hints were given in "Notes on <lb/>
Nursing" included the health of houses, ventilation <lb/>
and warming, petty management, food, variety, <lb/>
bed and bedding, light, cleanliness, quietude, etc. <lb/>
It was the writer's object to assist in putting the <lb/>
human constitution into such a state as that it <lb/>
should have no disease, or that it should have a <lb/>
power of recovery from disease. Here is a passage <lb/>
which should be studied by all who have to do <lb/>
with the sick:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In watching disease, both in private houses <lb/>
and public hospitals, the thing which strikes the <lb/>
experienced observer most forcibly is this, that <lb/>
the symptoms or the sufferings generally considered <lb/>
to be inevitable and incident to the disease are <lb/>
very often not symptoms of the disease at all, but <lb/>
of something quite different&mdash;of the want of fresh <lb/>
air, or of light, or of warmth, or of quiet, or of <lb/>
cleanliness, or of punctuality and care in the <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0092"/>
administration of diet, of each or of all of these. <lb/>
And this quite as much in private as in hospital <lb/>
nursing.</p>
<p>"The reparative process which Nature has <reg orig="in-|stituted">instituted</reg>, <lb/>
and which we call disease, has been <lb/>
hindered by some want of knowledge or attention, <lb/>
in one or in all of these things, and pain, suffering, <lb/>
or interruption of the whole process sets in.</p>
<p>"If a patient is cold, if a patient is feverish, if <lb/>
a patient is faint, if he is sick after taking food, <lb/>
if he has a bed-sore, it is generally the fault not <lb/>
of the disease, but of the nursing.</p>
<p>"I use the word 'nursing' for want of a better. <lb/>
It has been limited to signify little more than the <lb/>
administration of medicines and the application <lb/>
of poultices. It ought to signify the proper use <lb/>
of fresh air, light, warmth, cleanliness, quiet, and <lb/>
the selection and administration of diet&mdash;all at the <lb/>
least expense of vital power to the patient.</p>
<p>"It has been said and written scores of times <lb/>
that every woman makes a good nurse. I believe, <lb/>
on the contrary, that the very elements of nursing <lb/>
are all but unknown.</p>
<p>"By this I do not mean that the nurse is always <lb/>
to blame. Bad sanitary, bad architectural, and <lb/>
bad administrative arrangements often make it <lb/>
impossible to nurse. But the art of nursing ought <lb/>
to include such arrangements as alone make what <lb/>
I understand by nursing possible.</p>
<p>"The art of nursing, as now practised, seems to <lb/>
be expressly constituted to unmake what God had <lb/>
made disease to be, viz. a reparative process.</p>
<p>"To recur to the first objection. If we are <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0093"/>
asked, Is such or such a disease a reparative <lb/>
process? Can such an illness be unaccompanied <lb/>
by suffering? Will any care prevent such a <lb/>
patient from suffering this or that? I humbly <lb/>
say, I do not know. But when you have done <lb/>
away with all that pain and suffering, which in <lb/>
patients are the symptoms not of their disease, <lb/>
but of the absence of one or all of the <reg orig="above-|mentioned">above-mentioned</reg> <lb/>
essentials to the success of Nature's <lb/>
reparative processes, we shall then know what are <lb/>
the symptoms of and sufferings inseparable from <lb/>
the disease.</p>
<p>"Another and the commonest exclamation <lb/>
which will be instantly made is&mdash;Would you do <lb/>
nothing, then, in cholera, fever, etc.? So <reg orig="deep-|rooted">deep-rooted</reg> <lb/>
and universal is the conviction that to be <lb/>
giving medicine is doing something, or rather <lb/>
everything; to give air, warmth, cleanliness, etc., <lb/>
is to do nothing. The reply is, that in these and <lb/>
many other similar diseases the exact value of <lb/>
particular remedies and modes of treatment is by <lb/>
no means ascertained, while there is universal <lb/>
experience as to the extreme importance of careful <lb/>
nursing in determining the issue of the disease."</p>
<p>As to woman's true work in the world, Miss <lb/>
Nightingale wrote: "I would earnestly ask my <lb/>
sisters to keep clear of both the jargons now current <lb/>
everywhere &lpar;for they are equally jargons&rpar;; of the <lb/>
jargon, namely, about the 'rights' of women, which <lb/>
urges women to do all that men do, including the <lb/>
medical and other professions, merely because men <lb/>
do it, and without regard to whether this is the <lb/>
best that women can do; and of the jargon that <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0094"/>
urges women to do nothing that men do, merely <lb/>
because they are women, and should be 'recalled <lb/>
to a sense of their duty as women,' and because <lb/>
'this is women's work' and 'that is men's,' and <lb/>
'these are things which women should not do,' <lb/>
which is all assertion and nothing more. Surely <lb/>
woman should bring the best she has, <hi rend="italic">whatever</hi> <lb/>
that is, to the work of God's world, without <reg orig="attend-|ing">attending</reg> <lb/>
to either of these cries. As a wise man has <lb/>
said, no one has ever done anything great or useful <lb/>
by listening to the voices from without. Go your <lb/>
way straight to God's work, in simplicity and <lb/>
singleness of heart."</p>
<p>In 1858, Miss Nightingale contributed two papers <lb/>
to the National Association for the Promotion of <lb/>
Social Science, on Hospital Construction and <lb/>
Arrangement. Her "Notes on Hospitals," issued <lb/>
in 1859, are very valuable to the architect, the <lb/>
engineer, and the medical officer, from their <reg orig="clear-|ness">clearness</reg> <lb/>
of statement and minuteness of detail. In <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi>, for 1868, she paid a glowing tribute <lb/>
to the life and character of Miss Agnes Jones, the <lb/>
pioneer of reform in workhouse management and <lb/>
nursing, and who had received her training at the <lb/>
Nightingale Home. In 1871 appeared Miss <lb/>
Nightingale's "Notes on Lying-in Institutions," <lb/>
together with a proposal for organizing an <reg orig="institu-|tion">institution</reg> <lb/>
for training midwives and midwifery nurses; <lb/>
and she also published a pamphlet containing <lb/>
"Suggestions for the Arrangement and <reg orig="Manage-|ment">Management</reg> <lb/>
of Children's Hospitals." In 1873, "A Note <lb/>
of Interrogation," being an article from her pen <lb/>
which appeared in <hi rend="italic">Fraser's Magazine</hi>, attracted <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0095"/>
wide attention on account of the way in which she <lb/>
dealt with religious beliefs and life. "What will <lb/>
be our religion in 1999?" was the great question <lb/>
to which she addressed herself. It was her <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
that "there must be an ideal in God's mind <lb/>
for each man, woman, and child, for the work he, <lb/>
she, or it is put here to do;" and she earnestly <lb/>
contended that Christ's example must be closely <lb/>
followed in daily life. The right must be done, <lb/>
though it may sometimes be unpopular, and hard <lb/>
of achievement&mdash;such was the gist of her teaching.</p>
<p>India, and the condition of its teeming millions, <lb/>
has always been a subject near to the heart of <lb/>
Florence Nightingale. In the year 1863, the <lb/>
Report of the Commission on the Sanitary <reg orig="Con-|dition">Condition</reg> <lb/>
of the Army in India was issued. The <lb/>
documents had been sent in manuscript to Miss <lb/>
Nightingale, and in the first volume she incorporated <lb/>
her incisive and admirable "Observations" upon <lb/>
the immense mass of evidence adduced. At the <lb/>
meeting of the National Science Association, at <lb/>
Norwich, in 1873, a paper by her was read on <lb/>
"Life or Death in India," and this was published <lb/>
in the succeeding year, with an appendix on "Life <lb/>
or Death by Irrigation." At the time of the famine <lb/>
in India, she was deeply moved, and wrote strongly <lb/>
on the subject, not only pleading for instant relief, <lb/>
but for a policy of foresight in the future. Quite <lb/>
recently an interesting correspondence has taken <lb/>
place between Miss Nightingale and the Secretary <lb/>
of State for India on the sanitation of Indian <lb/>
villages. The unwearied worker on behalf of the <lb/>
neglected and the suffering has, during many years, <lb/>
<pb n="93" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0096"/>
made a study of the causes and the possible <lb/>
remedies of the unhealthiness of small Indian <lb/>
towns and hamlets. The evidence which she <lb/>
collected and submitted to the Secretary of State <lb/>
proved that the Bombay Village Sanitation Act of <lb/>
1889 had failed to produce the desired results, <lb/>
because&mdash;<hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>&mdash;it omitted to reserve a definite <lb/>
proportion of the village cesses to meet the cost of <lb/>
sanitation, while the rural inhabitants were too <lb/>
poor to bear further rates for the purpose. She <lb/>
referred to the debates on the Bombay Village <lb/>
Sanitation Bill to show that one main object of the <lb/>
measure was to constitute a good village <reg orig="organiza-|tion">organization</reg> <lb/>
for village sanitation; and she asked that a <lb/>
sufficient proportion of the money raised should be <lb/>
devoted to that object. Her views found support <lb/>
at the International Congress of Hygiene, over <lb/>
which the Prince of Wales presided; and a <reg orig="power-|ful">powerful</reg> <lb/>
memorandum, signed by the chairman of its <lb/>
Organizing Committee, by Sir George Birdwood, <lb/>
Sir Guyer Hunter, M.P., Surgeon-General Cornish, <lb/>
and other experts, was submitted to Lord Cross <lb/>
in support of her views. The matter has since <lb/>
been referred to the Local Government of Bombay, <lb/>
and it is understood that effective measures are in <lb/>
course of being taken. Meanwhile, Miss <reg orig="Night-|ingale">Nightingale</reg> <lb/>
once more earned the gratitude of the people <lb/>
of India by her temperate and convincing <reg orig="state-|ment">statement</reg> <lb/>
of a question which vitally affects the welfare <lb/>
of the rural population.</p>
<p>In 1890, Miss Nightingale wrote an excellent <lb/>
and comprehensive article on "Hospitals," for the <lb/>
new edition of "Chambers's Encyclop&aelig;dia." In <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0097"/>
addition to its historical character, this article dealt <lb/>
with three important principles in connection with <lb/>
hospitals, namely, construction, administration, <lb/>
and nursing. It also furnished information <reg orig="con-|cerning">concerning</reg> <lb/>
poor-law infirmaries, lying-in hospitals, <lb/>
children's hospitals, convalescent hospitals, <reg orig="hos-|pitals">hospitals</reg> <lb/>
for incurables. It may be mentioned that <lb/>
Miss Nightingale took a very active interest in the <lb/>
volunteer movement at the time of its inception, <lb/>
and she also assisted in founding the British Red <lb/>
Cross Society, the National Society formed for the <lb/>
aid of the sick and wounded in time of war. In <lb/>
1883, her Majesty the Queen instituted the <reg orig="decora-|tion">decoration</reg> <lb/>
of the Royal Red Cross. It is conferred on <lb/>
any ladies, English or foreign, recommended by <lb/>
the Secretary of State for War, for special exertions <lb/>
in providing for the nursing, or for attending to <lb/>
sick and wounded soldiers and sailors. The <reg orig="decora-|tion">decoration</reg> <lb/>
is a cross of crimson enamel gold-edged, <lb/>
attached to a dark-blue ribbon red-edged, one inch <lb/>
in width, tied in a bow, and worn on the left <lb/>
shoulder. In the autumn of 1887, while on a visit <lb/>
to her sister, Lady Verney, in Buckinghamshire, <lb/>
Miss Nightingale was the recipient of a gift which <lb/>
gave her special pleasure. It was a painting of her <lb/>
old home at Lea Hurst, subscribed for by the <lb/>
members of a working-men's club belonging to one <lb/>
of the Derbyshire villages; and it was presented to <lb/>
her in consideration of the interest she had taken in <lb/>
the institution.</p>
<p>Local sanitation is a question whose importance <lb/>
Miss Nightingale has never ceased to insist upon. <lb/>
At the age of seventy-two, she wrote a letter which <lb/>
<pb n="95" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0098"/>
was read at a meeting of the Bucks Town Council <lb/>
during a discussion as to the advisability of <reg orig="appoint-|ing">appointing</reg> <lb/>
a sanitary committee. "We must create a <lb/>
public opinion which must drive the Government," <lb/>
she observed, "instead of the Government having <lb/>
to drive us&mdash;an enlightened public opinion, wise in <lb/>
principles, wise in details. We hail the County <lb/>
Council as being or becoming one of the strongest <lb/>
engines in our favour, at once fathering and <reg orig="obey-|ing">obeying</reg> <lb/>
the great impulse for national health against <lb/>
national and local disease. For we have learnt <lb/>
that we have national health in our own hands&mdash; <lb/>
local sanitation, national health. But we have to <lb/>
contend against centuries of superstition and <reg orig="genera-|tions">generations</reg> <lb/>
of indifference. Let the County Council take <lb/>
the lead. Let it represent us, command us, instruct <lb/>
us by a sanitary committee in our struggle for <lb/>
health. We do not ask at present for County Council <lb/>
executive power. But what a moving power would <lb/>
such a sanitary committee, if wisely conducted, be! <lb/>
gathering experience every day, encouraging the <lb/>
true reports of able medical officers of health <lb/>
instead of quashing them, saying, 'We will not have <lb/>
cholera, we will not have fever, nor infantile <reg orig="com-|plaints">complaints</reg>, <lb/>
the true test of what is sanitary or insanitary <lb/>
&mdash;sickly children growing into sickly parents. We <lb/>
will have good water supply, good drainage, no <lb/>
overcrowding, pure air, pure water, pure earth; for <lb/>
disease is more expensive than sanitation. We <lb/>
will be able to say to cholera, if it comes, There is <lb/>
no room for you here, there is no place for you to <lb/>
plant your feet. Scarlet fever, typhoid, cannot <lb/>
come here. Bucks shall be a county of healthy <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0099"/>
villages.' The sanitary reform must be a work of <lb/>
years, not of a day. Other counties have <reg orig="under-|taken">undertaken</reg> <lb/>
it. But there must not be a day lost in <lb/>
beginning it. Cholera may be upon us next summer. <lb/>
Disease is always with us. Give us our sanitary <lb/>
committee. Good speed to you. God speed you."</p>
<p>Indefatigable in good works, Miss Nightingale <lb/>
started in 1892 a health crusade among the <reg orig="vil-|lagers">villagers</reg> <lb/>
of Buckinghamshire. At the instance, and <lb/>
with the aid of the County Council Technical <lb/>
Instruction Committee, and with the assistance of <lb/>
an experienced medical officer of the North Bucks <lb/>
district, a plan was formulated for sending teachers <lb/>
to the cottages well equipped with practical advice <lb/>
upon such points as ventilation, drainage, <reg orig="white-|washing">whitewashing</reg>, <lb/>
disinfection, cleanliness, and many other <lb/>
matters affecting the health of the cottagers. The <lb/>
teacher visits the homes of the poor, and gives <lb/>
addresses in the village schoolroom to the mothers <lb/>
of the neighbourhood. Three ladies, engaged <lb/>
by the County Council, were soon able to effect <lb/>
much good in this way. A description of the <lb/>
work accomplished was recently published by a <lb/>
local bookseller at Winslow, under the title of <lb/>
"Health at Home. Report of the Training of <lb/>
Rural Health Missioners, and of their Village <lb/>
Lecturing and Visiting under the North Bucks <lb/>
Technical Education Committee of the Bucks <lb/>
County Council." Miss Nightingale detailed in <lb/>
this publication her efforts to find educated women <lb/>
trained in such a way that they could personally <lb/>
bring their knowledge home to the cottagers' wives <lb/>
on a mission of health for rural districts. She <lb/>
<pb n="97" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0100"/>
deemed it possible, perhaps probable, that the <lb/>
health missioner in North Bucks might create a <lb/>
new work and a new profession for women, and <lb/>
make her efforts acceptable to women of the <reg orig="labour-|ing">labouring</reg> <lb/>
class. Being deeply impressed by the <reg orig="wide-|spread">widespread</reg> <lb/>
negligence of the elementary laws of health <lb/>
in our English villages, she drew up a list of <reg orig="in-|structions">instructions</reg> <lb/>
for the health missioners. A full diary <lb/>
was to be kept and sent on to the medical officer, <lb/>
giving information upon all sanitary points as <lb/>
affecting each cottage visited. The County Council <lb/>
would thus have the advantage of an intelligence <lb/>
department in connection with the homes of the <lb/>
rural population.</p>
<p>Miss Nightingale addressed the following useful <lb/>
and beautiful letter to the village mothers of North <lb/>
Bucks; but it may be read with advantage by <lb/>
mothers all over the country:&mdash;</p>
<q><text id="d11"><body><div1 type="quotation">
<opener>
<salute>"<hi rend="small-caps">Dear hard-working Friends,</hi></salute>
</opener>
<p>"I am a hard-working woman, too. <lb/>
May I speak to you? And will you excuse me, <lb/>
though not a mother?</p>
<p>"You feel with me, that every mother who <lb/>
brings a child into the world has the duty laid <lb/>
upon her of bringing up the child in such health <lb/>
as will enable him to do the work of his life.</p>
<p>"But though you toil all day for your children, <lb/>
and are so devoted to them, this is not at all an <lb/>
easy task.</p>
<p>"We should not attempt to practise <reg orig="dress-|making">dressmaking</reg>, <lb/>
or any other trade, without any training <lb/>
for it; but it is generally impossible for any woman <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0101"/>
to get any teaching about the management of <lb/>
health, yet health is to be learnt; and although <lb/>
you are more skilled in the practical work of <lb/>
everyday life, yet this lady lecturer has had <lb/>
special opportunities of studying the reasons why <lb/>
certain things are good or bad for health.</p>
<p>"But it depends very much more upon you <lb/>
than upon her that these lectures should be of <lb/>
any use to you. You must make use of her, and <lb/>
get out of her the particular knowledge that you <lb/>
want.</p>
<p>"The Cottage Homes of England are, after all, <lb/>
the most important of the homes of any class: <lb/>
they should be pure in every sense, pure in body <lb/>
and in mind.</p>
<p>"Boys and girls must grow up healthy, with clean <lb/>
minds, and clean bodies, and clean skins.</p>
<p>"And for this to be possible, the air, the earth, <lb/>
and the water that they grow up in and have <lb/>
around them must be clean. Fresh air, not bad <lb/>
air; clean earth, not foul earth; pure water, not <lb/>
dirty water; and the first teachings and impressions <lb/>
that they have at home must all be pure, and <lb/>
gentle, and firm. It is <hi rend="italic">home</hi> that teaches the child, <lb/>
after all, more than any other schooling. A child <lb/>
learns before it is three whether it shall obey its <lb/>
mother or not; and, before it is seven, wise men <lb/>
tell us that its character is formed.</p>
<p>"There is, too, another thing&mdash;Orderliness. We <lb/>
know your daily toil and love. May not the busiest <lb/>
and hardest life be somewhat lightened, the day <lb/>
mapped out, so that each duty has the same <lb/>
hours?</p>
<pb n="99" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0102"/>
<p>"Now you may compare this lady's inexperience <lb/>
and your practical knowledge of the things of <reg orig="every-|day">every-day</reg> <lb/>
life. But though she may be inexperienced <lb/>
in the things you have to do, yet she may by her <lb/>
knowledge in a humble, not patronizing, or <reg orig="posi-|tive">positive</reg>, <lb/>
or prying way, help you to help yourselves.</p>
<p>"This is not a lecture so much as a talk, a <lb/>
homely talk, about homes.</p>
<p>"If you would make a friend of her, and ask her <lb/>
questions, it would be far more possible for her <lb/>
to help.</p>
<p>"Then think what enormous extra trouble it <lb/>
entails on mothers when there is sickness. It is <lb/>
worth while to try to keep the family in health, to <lb/>
prevent the sorrow, the anxiety, the trouble of <lb/>
illness in the house, of which so much can be <lb/>
prevented.</p>
<p>"When a child has lost its health, how often the <lb/>
mother says: 'Oh, if I had only known, but there <lb/>
was no one to tell me!' And, after all, it is health <lb/>
and not sickness that is our natural state&mdash;the <lb/>
state that God intends for us. There are more <lb/>
people to pick us up when we fall than to enable <lb/>
us to stand upon our feet. God did not intend all <lb/>
mothers to be accompanied by doctors, but He <lb/>
meant all children to be cared for by mothers. <lb/>
God bless your work and labour of love."</p>
</div1></body></text></q>
<p>Should the movement to which Miss Nightingale <lb/>
thus gave her support spread through the rural <lb/>
districts, we may reasonably expect that some such <lb/>
useful sanitary reforms will extend to the towns, <lb/>
which, alas! still stand sadly in need of them.</p>
<pb n="100" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0103"/>
<p>In contemplating the long and valuable life of <lb/>
Florence Nightingale, we cannot but be grateful to <lb/>
Almighty God for putting into the heart of such <lb/>
noble women the determination to devote their <lb/>
time and energies to the service of mankind. So <lb/>
long as war exists between nations, and so long as <lb/>
squalor, disease, and penury continue to afflict the <lb/>
masses of the population, so long will there be <lb/>
urgent need for the gentle ministrations of <reg orig="bene-|volent">benevolent</reg> <lb/>
women&mdash;women animated by a feeling of <lb/>
pity and commiseration for their less fortunate <lb/>
brethren and sisters, and moved by an <reg orig="overpower-|ing">overpowering</reg> <lb/>
desire to render them practical aid in their <lb/>
misfortune and adversity.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> value of woman's ministry of personal service <lb/>
in the world is universally recognized, but it must <lb/>
not be forgotten that there is also a ministry of <lb/>
song in which she has always borne a conspicuous <lb/>
part. The sweet singers of Israel have had no <lb/>
mean share in lightening the burden of the world; <lb/>
and the musical cadences of Frances Ridley <lb/>
Havergal, breathing alike of Divine and human <lb/>
love, have cheered and strengthened many a weary <lb/>
soul in this latter half of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Miss Havergal was the youngest child of the <lb/>
Rev. William Henry Havergal, and was born on <lb/>
December 14, 1836, at the Rectory of Astley, <lb/>
Worcestershire. Mr. Havergal attained some <reg orig="dis-|tinction">distinction</reg> <lb/>
in the church, though ill health interfered <lb/>
with the full measure of his usefulness. He was <lb/>
educated at St. Edmund's Hall, Oxford, and took <lb/>
his B.A. and M.A. degrees respectively in 1815 <lb/>
and 1819. He became Rector of Astley, in <lb/>
Worcestershire, in 1829, and here all his six <lb/>
children were born. Their mother appears to <lb/>
have been a gentle and amiable woman, imbued <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0107"/>
with a spirit of fervent piety. Mr. Havergal was <lb/>
appointed Rector of St. Nicholas, Worcester, and <lb/>
Honorary Canon of Worcester Cathedral, in 1845, <lb/>
and Perpetual Curate of Shareshill, near <reg orig="Wolver-|hampton">Wolverhampton</reg>, <lb/>
in 1860; but he was compelled to resign <lb/>
this latter appointment on account of failing <lb/>
health. He was regarded as one of the first <lb/>
authorities of the time on sacred music; and <lb/>
much of his music is now in use in our cathedrals <lb/>
and churches. When prevented by illness from <lb/>
attending to the pastoral work which he so dearly <lb/>
loved, Mr. Havergal devoted his hours to musical <lb/>
composition. But he was also the author of various <lb/>
sermons preached in the early years of his <lb/>
ministry, including one on "Ordination," published <lb/>
in 1845, one on "Death for Murder," an assize <lb/>
sermon, delivered in 1847, and two volumes of <lb/>
"Historical Sermons," published in 1843. He died <lb/>
in 1870, in his seventy-seventh year.</p>
<p>The child Frances was baptized in Astley <lb/>
Church, in January, 1837, and she had for her <lb/>
godfather the Rev. W. H. Ridley, Vicar of <lb/>
Hambleden, whose name was given to her. She <lb/>
was always proud of that name, which she bore <lb/>
from one who was descended from the noble and <lb/>
godly martyr, Bishop Ridley. At the age of two <lb/>
she was a pretty child with fair complexion, light <lb/>
curling hair, and a bright expression. She could <lb/>
speak distinctly, with considerable variety of <lb/>
language, and could comprehend the little stories <lb/>
told to her. Her sister Miriam taught her reading, <lb/>
spelling, and patchwork, and when she was three <lb/>
she could read easy books, being often found <lb/>
<pb n="105" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0108"/>
hiding under a table with some engrossing story. <lb/>
At other times, with her sweet infantile voice, she <lb/>
would sing little hymns in imitation of her father. <lb/>
The day she was four, she was brought down after <lb/>
dinner to dessert, crowned with a wreath of bay <lb/>
leaves. "I shall never forget the picture!" wrote, <lb/>
years afterwards, the Rev. F. Jeffery, who was <lb/>
present. "She was her dear mother in miniature, <lb/>
especially in the brightness of her expression and <lb/>
the sparkle of her eye. A line from a classic poet <lb/>
was quoted exactly expressing this." When only <lb/>
four years old, Frances could both read and write, <lb/>
and French and music were gradually added to <lb/>
her studies. Her home surroundings were such as <lb/>
to bring out the best parts of her nature. Hymn <lb/>
singing on Sunday evening was a great feature <lb/>
in the Astley Rectory. Mr. Havergal being an <lb/>
invalid, he composed in his quiet study, cathedral <lb/>
services, and hundreds of chants and tunes. His <lb/>
first musical composition was a setting of Bishop <lb/>
Heber's hymn, "From Greenland's icy mountains." <lb/>
The proceeds amounted to &pound;180, which he very <lb/>
appropriately gave to the Church Missionary <lb/>
Society. The composer took the Gresham prize <lb/>
medal for a cathedral service in A, and a second <lb/>
gold medal for his anthem, "Give thanks."</p>
<p>Mr. Havergal resigned the living of Astley in <lb/>
1842, and for the next three years the family <lb/>
lived at Henwick House, in the parish of Hallow. <lb/>
Here Frances took delight in the gardens and <lb/>
long terrace walk, and here, also, began the <reg orig="com-|position">composition</reg> <lb/>
of her juvenile hymns and rhymes at the <lb/>
age of seven. She also made progress in the <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0109"/>
German language by hearing the lessons given to <lb/>
her sisters by a professor. Her recollections of <lb/>
her life from the age of six she threw into the <lb/>
form of an autobiography, in 1859. This has been <lb/>
incorporated in the "Memorials of Frances Ridley <lb/>
Havergal," compiled and published by her sister <lb/>
Maria. Frances dates the beginning of her <lb/>
religious life from a powerful sermon by Mr. <lb/>
&lpar;afterwards Archdeacon&rpar; Phillpotts, which she <lb/>
heard before she was eight years of age. She <lb/>
gives us this glimpse of her early experiences, and <lb/>
of her intense love of nature, even as a child.</p>
<p>"Every Sunday afternoon I went alone into a <lb/>
little room &lpar;at Henwick&rpar; over the hall, and there <lb/>
used to read a chapter in the Testament, and then <lb/>
knelt down and prayed for a few minutes, after <lb/>
which I usually felt soothed and less naughty. <lb/>
Once, when Marian P<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g2"/> was spending a few <lb/>
days with me, she being my only little visitor at <lb/>
Henwick, I did not like any omission, and so took <lb/>
her with me, saying a few words of prayer 'out of <lb/>
my head,' without any embarrassment at her <lb/>
presence.</p>
<p>"I think I had a far more vivid sense of the <lb/>
beauty of nature as a little child than I have even <lb/>
now; and its power over me was greater than <lb/>
any one would imagine. I have hardly felt <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
so intensely since, in the way of a sort of <lb/>
unbearable enjoyment. Especially, and I think <lb/>
more than anything else, the golden quiet of a <lb/>
bright summer's day used to enter into me and do <lb/>
me good. What only some great and rare musical <lb/>
enjoyment is to me now, the shade of a tree under <lb/>
<pb n="107" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0110"/>
a clear blue sky, with a sunbeam glancing through <lb/>
the boughs, was to me then. But I did not feel <lb/>
happy in my very enjoyment; I wanted <hi rend="italic">more</hi>. I <lb/>
do not think I was eight when I hit upon Cowper's <lb/>
lines, ending&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'My Father made them all!'</l>
</lg></q>
That was what I wanted to be able to say; and, <lb/>
after once seeing the words, I never saw a lovely <lb/>
scene again without being <hi rend="italic">teased</hi> by them. One <lb/>
spring &lpar;I think 1845&rpar; I kept thinking of them, and <lb/>
a dozen times a day said to myself, 'Oh, if God <lb/>
would but make me a Christian before the summer <lb/>
comes!' because I longed so to enjoy His works <lb/>
as I felt they could be enjoyed, and I could not <lb/>
bear to think of <hi rend="italic">another</hi> summer coming and <lb/>
going, and finding and leaving me still 'not a <lb/>
Christian.' I shall know some day <hi rend="italic">why</hi> my Father <lb/>
left me to walk thus alone in my early childhood, <lb/>
why such long years of dissatisfaction and <reg orig="restless-|ness">restlessness</reg> <lb/>
were apportioned me, while others fancied <lb/>
me a happy, thoughtless child. But He must <lb/>
have been teaching me, and 'who teacheth like <lb/>
Him?'"</p>
<p>She states that it was with great bitterness she <lb/>
bade adieu to her pleasant country life, when her <lb/>
father removed to St. Nicholas's Rectory, Worcester, <lb/>
in 1845. She became, as her father called her, "a <lb/>
caged lark," and it took years for her to acquire <lb/>
new interests in life. She was much troubled in <lb/>
spirit, and her sole desire was to become a happy <lb/>
and understanding Christian. Her mother's death, <lb/>
in 1848, was a great grief to her, and her child-life <lb/>
at this time has been described in her sketch of <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0111"/>
"Four Happy Days." Speaking of herself, under <lb/>
the name of Annie, she says: "The clouds had <lb/>
been her great friends since she had had no trees <lb/>
to sit in, and make up fancies about. Sometimes <lb/>
she watched the clouds, and wondered all sorts of <lb/>
things about them, and especially wished she could <lb/>
reach the splendid white ones, which looked like <lb/>
snow mountains that could be climbed and rested <lb/>
upon. But she found in a book that they were <lb/>
only vapour like the others, and that there would <lb/>
be nothing to rest upon and look down upon, only <lb/>
dismal thick mist and rain. Poor child! there are <lb/>
other bright things besides shining clouds, which, <lb/>
when reached, are only mist and tears!" Then <lb/>
there rose up in her soul her mother's dying wish, <lb/>
"Fanny, dear, pray to God to prepare you for all <lb/>
that He is preparing for you." She could not <lb/>
understand this for some time, but at length she <lb/>
drew peace and comfort from its realization. Once <lb/>
she saw a funeral pass out of the Rectory gate, <lb/>
and the memory of her dead mother filled her with <lb/>
anguish. She rushed to her little room, and <reg orig="fling-|ing">flinging</reg> <lb/>
herself on her bed, cried, "Oh, mamma, <lb/>
mamma!" until her heart was like to break. In <lb/>
the presence of others, however, she would <reg orig="ap-|parently">apparently</reg> <lb/>
be merry and light-hearted, but it was <lb/>
only to screen the heavy heart within.</p>
<p>The year 1850 marked a new departure in her <lb/>
life. She went to school to a Mrs. Teed, at <reg orig="Bel-|mont">Belmont</reg>, <lb/>
and here, partly through the medium of her <lb/>
girl friends, she first began to realize for herself the <lb/>
blessings of religion. In August, 1851, after her <lb/>
father's second marriage, she went to school to <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0112"/>
Powick Court, near Worcester. Towards <reg orig="Decem-|ber">December</reg>, <lb/>
when she had almost gained a number of <lb/>
prizes, she was attacked by erysipelas in the face <lb/>
and head. Returning home, she suffered severely <lb/>
for some weeks, and was almost blind, yet although <lb/>
she had a most restless temperament, she <reg orig="mani-|fested">manifested</reg> <lb/>
extraordinary patience. To her <reg orig="school-|fellow">schoolfellow</reg> <lb/>
and lifelong correspondent, Elizabeth Clay, <lb/>
she confided in her letters many of her deeper <lb/>
thoughts and aspirations. In November, 1852, <lb/>
she went to the "Louisenschule," at D&uuml;sseldorf, <lb/>
so called after the Queen of Prussia. Here she <lb/>
made excellent progress in music and drawing. <lb/>
In September, 1853, she left school for ever, being <lb/>
then seventeen years of age. "What a suffocating <lb/>
feeling it is," she exclaims, "leaving school <hi rend="italic">for <lb/>
ever</hi>&mdash;a period, an era completely passed and left <lb/>
behind! One feels that &cacute;hildhood is over now, <lb/>
and a sense of tenfold increased responsibility and <lb/>
independence is, so to speak, a weight upon the <lb/>
spirit. &hellip; One's spirit is a precious diamond; the <lb/>
rougher cutting work has been done by other <lb/>
hands. Now one must undertake its further <reg orig="beauti-|fying">beautifying</reg> <lb/>
one's self; the polishing and grinding needs <lb/>
care and diligence and attention, and if neglected, <lb/>
how shall we find an excuse with the Great Master <lb/>
Jeweller, who had given the costly stone into our <lb/>
care? Now a different place in life, in society, <lb/>
and in one's own family must be occupied; more <lb/>
is expected from one, many a little burden from <lb/>
which the child is exempt must now be taken up <lb/>
voluntarily." But in assuming life's fuller duties, <lb/>
she had a heart filled with thankfulness to God <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0113"/>
for the many blessings He had already showered <lb/>
on her path.</p>
<p>Owing to a severe affection of the eyes, Mr. <lb/>
Havergal went over to Germany to consult a clever <lb/>
oculist. While he was at Heidelberg with his <lb/>
wife, he left his daughter Frances at Obercassel, <lb/>
with the good pastor and his wife. This <reg orig="interest-|ing">interesting</reg> <lb/>
picture of her life at Obercassel is given in a <lb/>
letter to her friend Elizabeth Clay: "Obercassel <lb/>
is a pleasant village on the Rhine. We see the <lb/>
Drachenfels, with a peep into a narrow <reg orig="rock-|shut-in">rock-shut-in</reg> <lb/>
valley, through which the Rhine flows from <lb/>
Coblentz. That you may glance into my room, I <lb/>
send herewith a Raphaelistic sketch thereof! Busts <lb/>
of Goethe and Schiller, shelves and table covered <lb/>
with German and French books, etc. It will soon <lb/>
be dusk, and then I go down and take my place <lb/>
by the Pastor Schulze-Berge, who will read aloud, <lb/>
while the pleasant frau pastorin and Lottchen <lb/>
work or knit. Conversational interruptions, serious <lb/>
or amusing, will take their turn; and Goethe, whose <lb/>
life is the subject, will be criticized in every light. <lb/>
Now, is not this very pleasant? I like my quarters <lb/>
amazingly, and am very happy. I get up at five <lb/>
o'clock, breakfast at seven; then study four hours. <lb/>
Of course, my books are nearly all German, and I <lb/>
write abstracts. I also give one hour to French <lb/>
literature. How I do enjoy myself when I get to <lb/>
the German poets and Universal History, which I <lb/>
dive into with avidity! If anything strikes me, <lb/>
I can always refer to the good pastor. &hellip; I have <lb/>
opportunities here of seeing a little of German high <lb/>
life. Close by is the 'court' of the Count von <lb/>
<pb n="111" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0114"/>
Lippe, a family worthy of their rank and title. <lb/>
They live very simply, because they give more <lb/>
than half their income away. The Dowager <lb/>
Countess is a perfect pattern of a Christian noble <lb/>
lady, also her gentle, suffering daughter, Mathilde."</p>
<p>Pastor Schulze-Berge, writing after his pupil's <lb/>
death to her sister Maria, spoke of the great esteem <lb/>
in which he held the deceased, and added, "I <lb/>
learned to appreciate her rich talents and mental <lb/>
powers, so that my lessons were more pleasure <lb/>
than work. She showed from the first such <reg orig="appli-|cation">application</reg>, <lb/>
such rare talent, such depth of <reg orig="compre-|hension">comprehension</reg>, <lb/>
that I can only speak of her progress as <lb/>
extraordinary. She acquired such a knowledge <lb/>
of our most celebrated authors in a short time as <lb/>
even German ladies attain only after much longer <lb/>
study. They were precious moments when I <reg orig="un-|folded">unfolded</reg> <lb/>
to her the character of one of our noblest <lb/>
poets and thinkers, and let her have a glimpse into <lb/>
the splendour of his works. Stirred to the depths <lb/>
of her soul, she burst out enthusiastically, 'Oh, <lb/>
what mental giants! what gifted men these Germans <lb/>
are!' What imprinted the stamp of nobility upon <lb/>
her whole being, and influenced all her opinions, <lb/>
was her true piety, and the deep reverence she had <lb/>
for her Lord and Saviour, whose example <reg orig="pene-|trated">penetrated</reg> <lb/>
her young life through and through."</p>
<p>The Havergals returned to England in <reg orig="Decem-|ber">December</reg>, <lb/>
1853, and in the following July Frances was <lb/>
confirmed in Worcester Cathedral by Dr. Henry <lb/>
Pepys, Bishop of Worcester. The sealed papers <lb/>
which Miss Havergal left behind her, reveal the <lb/>
solemnity and the deep feeling with which she <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0115"/>
regarded the rite of confirmation. In the evening <lb/>
of the day, she wrote these lines in her manuscript <lb/>
book of poems&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Oh! 'Thine for ever,' what a blessed thing</l>
<l rend="indent">To be for ever His who died for me!</l>
<l>My Saviour, all my life Thy praise I'll sing,</l>
<l rend="indent">Nor cease my song throughout eternity."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>She now assiduously continued her studies in <lb/>
German, French, and Greek, at the same time <lb/>
systematically searching the Scriptures, and <reg orig="acquir-|ing">acquiring</reg> <lb/>
a great portion of them by heart, besides <lb/>
earnestly taking up parish work, teaching in the <lb/>
Sunday school, etc. With her father's aid, she <lb/>
acquired sufficient knowledge of Greek to enable <lb/>
her to enjoy the New Testament in that language. <lb/>
Then she would compose original German and <lb/>
English poems, poetical enigmas and charades, <lb/>
etc. These she frequently contributed to various <lb/>
pocket-books under the names of "Sabrina" and <lb/>
"Zoide," and the prize-money which she frequently <lb/>
obtained was invariably sent to the Church <reg orig="Mis-|sionary">Missionary</reg> <lb/>
Society. It was a blessed day for her in <lb/>
May, 1855, when she once more beheld her father <lb/>
&mdash;with his sight comparatively restored&mdash;ascend <lb/>
the reading-desk of St. Nicholas's Church, from <lb/>
which he had been absent for nearly four years.</p>
<p>Miss Havergal paid several visits to Ireland in <lb/>
1856&ndash;7, and she seems to have carried everything <lb/>
before her by her charming unsophisticated <reg orig="man-|ners">manners</reg>, <lb/>
her bright, cheerful spirit, and her exquisite <lb/>
singing. As one friend wrote: "She sang like a <lb/>
born angel. Oh, she's a real Colleen Bawn!"</p>
<p>During a pleasant expedition through County <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0116"/>
Wicklow, she rather discomfited a gentleman of <lb/>
the party&mdash;a reputed learned Hebrew scholar&mdash;by <lb/>
her attention, which "seemed deeper in <reg orig="investigat-|ing">investigating</reg> <lb/>
his knowledge of Hebrew psalms and grammar <lb/>
than in noting the surrounding geography of glens <lb/>
and passes. She had a wonderful knowledge of <lb/>
the Scriptures, and knew the whole of the Gospels, <lb/>
Epistles, Revelation, the Psalms, and Isaiah. The <lb/>
minor Prophets she learnt in later years. Her <lb/>
desire to lead a holy life struck every one." She <lb/>
was most sensitive on the subject of placing the <lb/>
very smallest stumbling-block in a fellow-creature's <lb/>
way, and she readily sacrificed any pleasure if she <lb/>
could render a useful service to others. When her <lb/>
sisters pressed her to go on a pleasant visit to <lb/>
Oakhampton, she would not leave her mother <lb/>
alone, adding, "If I can only go errands, it will be <lb/>
of some use."</p>
<p>In 1860, Mr. Havergal resigned the living of St. <lb/>
Nicholas, the bishop having promised him that his <lb/>
Successor should be his esteemed curate and friend, <lb/>
the Rev. Charles Bullock. The farewell gifts were <lb/>
numerous and most gratifying. The tributes to <lb/>
her father and mother touched Frances deeply, <lb/>
though she and her sister Maria were likewise the <lb/>
recipients of handsome presents. At the same <lb/>
time came a gratifying letter from the editor of <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi>, inviting the young poetess to <reg orig="con-|tribute">contribute</reg> <lb/>
to that periodical. Her well-known hymn, <lb/>
"I gave My life for thee," first appeared in <hi rend="italic">Good <lb/>
Words</hi>. It had been written in Germany, in 1858, <lb/>
and she had contemplated destroying it, when her <lb/>
father encouraged her to preserve it, and wrote <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0117"/>
specially for it the tune "Baca." It was <reg orig="charac-|teristic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
of Miss Havergal that when she received <lb/>
the first cheque for her poems, amounting to <lb/>
&pound;10 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., she apportioned &pound;10 of it to her <lb/>
father, for church alterations, or any pressing object; <lb/>
10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. went for the Scripture Readers' collection, and <lb/>
the balance of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was to be kept for any similar <lb/>
emergency. Her father wrote to her, however: <lb/>
"Thank you, dear child, for remembering me; I <lb/>
will keep all your love, but not the cheque. Our <lb/>
God send you His sweetest and choicest <reg orig="bless-|ings">blessings</reg>."</p>
<p>Methodical in all things, Frances Havergal kept <lb/>
a neat register of her Sunday scholars from 1846 <lb/>
to 1860. Like more than one Lord High <reg orig="Chan-|cellor">Chancellor</reg> <lb/>
of England, she was passionately attached <lb/>
to her Sunday school class. When called upon to <lb/>
leave the Rectory at Worcester, she wrote in her <lb/>
scholars' register: "Among all my St. Nicholas <lb/>
memories, none will be fonder or deeper than my <lb/>
class. I cannot tell any one how I loved them. I <lb/>
should hardly be believed; no one in the parish, <lb/>
either rich or poor, called forth the same love that <lb/>
they did, neither could I tell how bitter and grievous <lb/>
any misbehaviour among them was to me&mdash;no one <lb/>
knows the tears they have cost me; and because <lb/>
no one guessed at the depth of either the love or <lb/>
the sorrow, I had but little sympathy under <reg orig="disap-|pointments">disappointments</reg> <lb/>
with them. I am wrong in one thing, I <lb/>
know, but cannot help it; the feeling that, though <lb/>
I may have a very sincere love and interest in <lb/>
other children, yet I should never be able to give <lb/>
any future class the same intensity of affection <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0118"/>
which these have won and some of them have <lb/>
reciprocated. It has been to my own soul a <lb/>
means of grace. Often, when cold and lifeless in <lb/>
prayer, my nightly intercession for them has <reg orig="un-|sealed">unsealed</reg> <lb/>
the frozen fountain, and the blessings sought <lb/>
for them seemed to fall on myself."</p>
<p>Her father's life was a matter of the first concern <lb/>
with her, and his failing health had rendered <reg orig="neces-|sary">necessary</reg> <lb/>
the change to the little country parish of <lb/>
Shareshill. At first the change proved beneficial, <lb/>
and the parishioners gave their new minister a <lb/>
cordial and encouraging greeting. One of Mr. <lb/>
Havergal's first acts at Shareshill was to persuade <lb/>
the inhabitants to abolish the Sunday post. At <lb/>
the wish of her sister and brother-in-law &lpar;Mr. and <lb/>
Mrs. Henry Crane&rpar;, Miss Havergal undertook the <lb/>
instruction of their two youngest daughters, and in <lb/>
February, 1861, she made their residence at <reg orig="Oak-|hampton">Oakhampton</reg> <lb/>
her future home. Her father <reg orig="recom-|mended">recommended</reg> <lb/>
this because it detached her from severe <lb/>
studies prejudicial to her health. "The lesson <lb/>
hours were very short, owing to the temperament <lb/>
of both teacher and pupils, and she had many and <lb/>
long changes of scene, at the seaside, at home <lb/>
and abroad. She entered with zest into the <reg orig="recrea-|tions">recreations</reg> <lb/>
of her young companions, riding and <reg orig="scramb-|ling">scrambling</reg>, <lb/>
swimming and skating, croquet and chess, <lb/>
each in its turn, and excelled in them all. Her <lb/>
needlework was exquisite, from the often-despised <lb/>
darning to the most delicate lace-work and <reg orig="em-|broidery">embroidery</reg>." <lb/>
Yet even at Oakhampton she would <lb/>
pursue her own studies, learning Italian at odd <lb/>
snatches of time, while the old nurse complained <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0119"/>
that she would be at her Latin books long before <lb/>
breakfast.</p>
<p>Again and again, however, we find traces in her <lb/>
"Autobiography," that she frequently felt life to <lb/>
be dark and mysterious, notwithstanding her keen <lb/>
delight in natural objects and in the sympathy of <lb/>
friends. She longed for a more unreserved <reg orig="sur-|render">surrender</reg> <lb/>
of herself to God, and it was only <reg orig="occasion-|ally">occasionally</reg> <lb/>
that she could attain the Pisgah heights of <lb/>
happiness. "Oh, that He would indeed purify me <lb/>
and make me white at any cost!" is her constant <lb/>
aspiration. "No one professing to be a Christian <lb/>
at all could possibly have had a more cloudy, <lb/>
fearing, doubting, sinking, and wandering heart <lb/>
history than mine has been through many years." <lb/>
Yet few souls have ever sullied their garments <lb/>
less with the mire of the world, and her moments <lb/>
of rejoicing were as beautiful in their purity <lb/>
and strength as her periods of depression were <lb/>
heavy in their sadness and gloom. She found it <lb/>
difficult indeed, during the first part of 1865, to <lb/>
give up for health's sake all her favourite <reg orig="occupa-|tions&mdash;Sunday">occupations&mdash;Sunday</reg> <lb/>
school and Saturday evening class, <lb/>
visiting, music, etc. In the course of the ensuing <lb/>
winter, she revisited her German friends, and spent <lb/>
some time with her parents at Bonn. She sought <lb/>
out an interview with Ferdinand Hiller, the musical <lb/>
composer, who received her kindly, and examined <lb/>
her songs. When he found that she had had no <lb/>
regular training, he considered her songs were <lb/>
remarkable, and recommended her to study under <lb/>
Macfarren, if she could not study under himself <lb/>
at Cologne. Her melodies, he said, like most <lb/>
<pb n="117" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0120"/>
English melodies, had the stamp of talent, but not <lb/>
of genius. But they showed such grasp of subject, <lb/>
and such power of harmonization, that there was <lb/>
quite enough in them to justify her in taking up <lb/>
music as a life-work. In her rendering of Handel's <lb/>
music, Miss Havergal exhibited singular freedom <lb/>
and skill. Many of this great composer's works <lb/>
she could play through without notes, as well as <lb/>
compositions by Beethoven and Mendelssohn. <lb/>
Her playing of the "Moonlight Sonata" was <reg orig="re-|garded">regarded</reg> <lb/>
as perfect, "her touch was instinct with <lb/>
soul, as also was her singing." After her return to <lb/>
England, she attended the meetings of the <reg orig="Philhar-|monic">Philharmonic</reg> <lb/>
Society at Kidderminster, and became a <lb/>
valued solo singer. Her rendering of some of <lb/>
Handel's sacred airs was peculiarly effective, as <lb/>
also was her rendering of Mendelssohn's "Woe <lb/>
unto them," and the exquisite, "But the Lord is <lb/>
mindful of His own."</p>
<p>She suffered much from ill health in 1866, and <lb/>
wondered whether the check was sent to teach her <lb/>
to consecrate herself more fully to the higher life <lb/>
in all that she did. In her own recorded words, <lb/>
we get this glimpse of her inner nature:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I suppose that God's crosses are often made of <lb/>
most unexpected and strange material. Perhaps <lb/>
trial must be felt keenly, or it would not be powerful <lb/>
enough as a medicine in the hands of our beloved <lb/>
Healer; and I think it has been a medicine to me <lb/>
latterly. You may wonder that I write thus, <lb/>
when I was so merry with you at L<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g3"/>; but, <lb/>
among the best gifts of God to me, I count a <lb/>
certain stormy petrelism of nature, which seems <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0121"/>
to enable me to skim any waves when I am not <lb/>
actually under them. I have an elasticity which <lb/>
often makes me wonder at myself, a power of <lb/>
throwing myself into any present interest or <reg orig="en-|joyment">enjoyment</reg>, <lb/>
though the sorrow is only suspended, not <lb/>
removed.</p>
<p>"But once I seemed permitted to suffer mentally <lb/>
in an unmitigated sort of way, which I never knew <lb/>
before. Perhaps to teach me how to feel for <lb/>
others who have not that stormy petrelism which <lb/>
bears me through most things. For that forsook <lb/>
me utterly, and I felt crushed and forsaken of all <lb/>
or any help or cheer to an extent I never felt <lb/>
before."</p>
<p>After completing the tuition of her nieces in 1867, <lb/>
Miss Havergal returned permanently to her own <lb/>
home. In September, 1867, she joined the Young <lb/>
Women's Christian Association, and in course of <lb/>
time she brought many others into its helpful <reg orig="com-|panionship">companionship</reg>. <lb/>
She likewise never relaxed her efforts <lb/>
to interest others in the Church Pastoral Aid <lb/>
Society, the Jews' Society, and the Bible Society. <lb/>
On a bitter winter's night, only four months before <lb/>
her death, she led a number of Welsh neighbours <lb/>
and youths for the first time in their lives to a <lb/>
Bible Society meeting at the Mumbles.</p>
<p>During the winter of 1867&ndash;68, Miss Havergal <lb/>
took lessons in singing from Signor Randegger. <lb/>
He found that she had many mechanical difficulties <lb/>
to overcome, but gave her credit for "talent, taste, <lb/>
feeling, and brains." He also consoled her by the <lb/>
assurance that she might always calculate on <lb/>
expressive singing. The early summer of 1869 <lb/>
<pb n="119" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0122"/>
she spent abroad, accompanying Mr. and Mrs. <lb/>
Crane, and their daughter Miriam, to Switzerland. <lb/>
They travelled by the Rhine route to Heidelberg, <lb/>
Freiburg, Basle, and Schaffhausen; and the entries <lb/>
in her diary show how she revelled in the grandeur <lb/>
of the Rhine Falls and the magnificent scenery <lb/>
of the Bernese Oberland mountains. The snow <lb/>
mountains realized her wildest dreams. "I never <lb/>
saw anything material and earthly," she wrote, <lb/>
"which so suggested the ethereal and heavenly, <lb/>
which so seemed to lead up to the unseen, to be <lb/>
the very steps of the throne; and one could better <lb/>
fancy them to be the visible foundations of the <lb/>
invisible celestial city, bearing some wonderful <lb/>
relation to its transparent gold and crystal sea, <lb/>
than only snow and granite, rising out of this <lb/>
same everyday earth we are treading, dusty and <lb/>
stony!" Before the year closed, she enjoyed <lb/>
another great scenic treat among the Highlands <lb/>
of Scotland.</p>
<p>But a few months more, and the shadow of <lb/>
death fell across her home. On Easter Eve, 1870, <lb/>
Mr. Havergal seemed unusually well, and took <lb/>
a lengthy walk. In the evening he sat down at <lb/>
his harmonium, and played and sang a tune which <lb/>
he had composed in the morning. He rose early <lb/>
on Easter Day, as usual, but he was seized with <lb/>
a stroke of apoplexy, and, after forty-eight hours <lb/>
of unconsciousness, passed away in his <reg orig="seventy-|eighth">seventy-eighth</reg> <lb/>
year. He was laid to rest in Astley <lb/>
Churchyard, and when the grief of his daughter <lb/>
Frances had somewhat abated, she undertook the <lb/>
preparation for the press of "Havergal's Psalmody," <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0123"/>
which was afterwards largely used in connection <lb/>
with the Rev. C. B. Snepp's Hymnal, "Songs of <lb/>
Grace and Glory." For this latter work she wrote <lb/>
several devotional hymns, which were much <lb/>
blessed to the help and comfort of others. A <lb/>
number of tunes which she composed and <reg orig="harmon-|ized">harmonized</reg> <lb/>
drew forth the emphatic approval of Sir <lb/>
Frederick G. Ouseley. As her hymns and tunes <lb/>
came into congregational use, she rejoiced with <lb/>
trembling that her gifts had been found serviceable <lb/>
to others.</p>
<p>In June and July, 1871, she made a Swiss tour <lb/>
with her friend, Elizabeth Clay. They travelled <lb/>
only with carpet bags and knapsacks, frequently <lb/>
diverged from the beaten tracks, and found the <lb/>
excursion most delightful. They secured the <lb/>
guide Anton Walden for the ascent of the <reg orig="Spar-|renhorn">Sparrenhorn</reg>, <lb/>
which is nearly ten thousand feet high. <lb/>
They began the ascent at 4 a.m., and afterwards, <lb/>
in describing the magnificent sunrise which they <lb/>
witnessed, Miss Havergal wrote: "Now I have <lb/>
seen it at last, a real Alpine dawn and sunrise to <lb/>
perfection! When we came out, we saw the <lb/>
'daffodil sky,' which Tyndall describes, in the <lb/>
east a calm glory of expectant light, as if <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
positively celestial must come next, instead <lb/>
of merely the usual sun. In the south-west the <lb/>
grand mountains stood, white and perfectly clear, <lb/>
as if they might be waiting for the resurrection, <lb/>
with the moon shining pale and radiant over them, <lb/>
the deep Rhone valley dark and grave-like in <lb/>
contrast below. As we got higher, the first rose <lb/>
flush struck the Miscabel and Weisshorn, and <lb/>
<pb n="121" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0124"/>
Monte Leon came to life too; it was <hi rend="italic">real</hi> rose-fire, <lb/>
delicate yet intense. The Weisshorn was in its <lb/>
full glory, looking more perfectly lovely than any <lb/>
earthly thing I ever saw. When the top of the <lb/>
Matterhorn caught the red light on its evil-looking <lb/>
rocky peak, it was just like a volcano, and looked <lb/>
rather awful than lovely, giving one the idea of an <lb/>
evil angel, impotently wrathful, shrinking away <lb/>
from the serene glory and utter purity of a holy <lb/>
angel, which that Weisshorn at dawn might <reg orig="repre-|sent">represent</reg> <lb/>
if anything earthly could. The eastern ridges <lb/>
were almost jet, in front of the great golden glow <lb/>
into which the daffodil sky brightened. By 4.30 <lb/>
a.m. it was all over, and thenceforth we devoted <lb/>
ourselves to getting up the Sparrenhorn."</p>
<p>Numerous excursions were made through the <lb/>
valleys and mountains, and the travellers were <lb/>
greatly struck by the majesty of Mont Blanc. <lb/>
Miss Havergal had seen it before, but it seemed <lb/>
more supreme than ever to her, completely <reg orig="over-|shadowing">overshadowing</reg> <lb/>
Monte Rosa, which is disappointing <lb/>
and unimposing, though only five hundred feet <lb/>
lower. The friends were back in England in <lb/>
September, and the following Christmas was spent <lb/>
by Miss Havergal at Leamington. The happy <lb/>
season brought some regrets with it, for in <reg orig="con-|sequence">consequence</reg> <lb/>
of ill health she was obliged to give up <lb/>
some of the work which she so dearly loved, <lb/>
including the training of the St. Paul's Voluntary <lb/>
Choir, which had been committed to her.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1872, she went with her sister <lb/>
Maria to North Wales for several weeks. At <reg orig="Bar-|mouth">Barmouth</reg>, <lb/>
she soon recovered her health and buoyancy <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0125"/>
of spirits. The rest was most refreshing to <lb/>
her; indeed, she wrote to a friend, "I think Wales <lb/>
will put me out of conceit of Switzerland. One <lb/>
gets so very much beauty and enjoyment with so <lb/>
much less expense or fatigue." Again, "we have <lb/>
been two nights at Dolgelly; it is lovely, and so <lb/>
different in character, that it no more suffers after <lb/>
Switzerland than a forget-me-not beside a rose." <lb/>
Rest and leisure at Harlech were next greatly <reg orig="en-|joyed">enjoyed</reg>, <lb/>
and then, writing on July 16, at Pen-y-Guryd, <lb/>
she said, "I am finishing this at the top of <reg orig="Snow-|don">Snowdon</reg>; <lb/>
the ascents are all so easy"&mdash;this is not quite <lb/>
correct so far as the Capel Curig side is <reg orig='con-|cerned&mdash;"no'>concerned&mdash;"no</reg> <lb/>
need of ponies or guides, when we <lb/>
can walk twelve to fifteen miles. We shall run <lb/>
down from this the Llanberis side, and camp for a <lb/>
week, halfway down, with one of my sister's <reg orig="charm-|ing">charming</reg> <lb/>
old women."</p>
<p>By way of once more showing her intense <lb/>
delight in mountain scenery, we give the <reg orig="follow-|ing">following</reg> <lb/>
extract: "From Moel Siabod we had a <lb/>
series of glimpses of the sunny world below, <lb/>
and magnificent veilings and unveilings of <reg orig="Snow-|don">Snowdon</reg>, <lb/>
soft white wreaths folding and unfolding <lb/>
among the massive heights. In Llyn Dinas I saw <lb/>
an effect quite new to me. The slanting sunlight <lb/>
took the ripples at such an angle that an exquisite <lb/>
gold network, waving and gleaming upon the dark <lb/>
brown stones, was produced, in some places <reg orig="con-|centrating">concentrating</reg> <lb/>
like a golden web, in others like open <lb/>
trellis-work. The harmony of colour, the rich <lb/>
warm brown of the stones with the intense gold, <lb/>
was not a combination <hi rend="italic">we</hi> should have struck out. <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0126"/>
My favourite mountain verse is, 'Unto Thee, <lb/>
O Lord, do we give thanks, for that Thy name is <lb/>
near Thy wondrous works declare.'"</p>
<p>Miss Havergal paid another visit to Switzerland <lb/>
in 1873, in company with her friends Mr. and Mrs. <lb/>
Snepp and their daughter Emily. She made the <lb/>
ascent to the Grands Mulets on Mont Blanc, "<reg orig="arriv-|ing">arriving</reg> <lb/>
at its desolate rocks in the midst of an ocean of <lb/>
snow." Her fondness for glissading led to perilous <lb/>
and imminent danger, from which she was once <lb/>
rescued by the presence of mind of Mr. Snepp. She <lb/>
had nearly lost her life, and also the life of one of <lb/>
the guides, when Mr. Snepp instantaneously threw <lb/>
himself on his back, and, by checking the impetus, <lb/>
saved them from falling headlong over a precipice.</p>
<p>On returning to England, Miss Havergal went <lb/>
to Oakhampton, and here began most indefatigable <lb/>
labours. Her sister remarks that she had no <lb/>
intervals of dreamy enjoyment, for besides cottage <lb/>
visitations, she had four Bible-classes weekly, <lb/>
and the preparation for these and other useful <lb/>
occupations entailed unwearied exertions. Then <lb/>
came crowded attendances in the servants' hall, <lb/>
while she also assisted in preparatory work for a <lb/>
mission at Bewdley. Though delicate in health, <lb/>
she gave much help in the choir, as well as took <lb/>
a share in other departments of work. Then, in <lb/>
October, she had a mission week at Liverpool. <lb/>
Before the year 1873 drew to a close, and while <lb/>
she was visiting her sister, Mrs. Shaw, at <reg orig="Winter-|dyne">Winterdyne</reg>, <lb/>
near Bewdley, she received from a friend a <lb/>
small book entitled, "All for Jesus," which made <lb/>
a great impression upon her. It stirred the deepest <lb/>
<pb n="124" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0127"/>
feelings in her, and as the result of these new <reg orig="ex-|periences">experiences</reg>, <lb/>
her sister states that the "sunless <lb/>
ravines" were now for ever passed, and that <reg orig="hence-|forth">henceforth</reg> <lb/>
her peace and joy flowed onwards, deepening <lb/>
and widening under the teaching of the Holy <lb/>
Spirit. As she herself expressed it, the blessing <lb/>
she had received "lifted her whole life into <reg orig="sun-|shine">sunshine</reg>, <lb/>
of which all she had previously experienced <lb/>
was but as pale and passing April gleams, <reg orig="com-|pared">compared</reg> <lb/>
with the fulness of summer glory." She <lb/>
confided to her sister that it was on Advent <lb/>
Sunday, December 2, 1873, that she first saw <lb/>
clearly the blessedness of true consecration. It <lb/>
was "as a flash of electric light, and what you see <lb/>
you can never unsee." The practical effect of this <lb/>
blissful light "was most evident in her daily, <reg orig="true-|hearted">true-hearted</reg>, <lb/>
whole-hearted service for her King, and <lb/>
also in the increased joyousness of the unswerving <lb/>
obedience of her home life, the surest test of all." <lb/>
In detailing the circumstances which attended the <lb/>
composition of that simple but beautiful hymn, <lb/>
"Take my life"&mdash;which has stirred many a soul <lb/>
to its depths&mdash;Miss Havergal wrote: "Perhaps <lb/>
you will be interested to know the origin of the <lb/>
consecration hymn, 'Take my life.' I went for <lb/>
a little visit of five days. There were ten persons <lb/>
in the house, some unconverted and long prayed <lb/>
for, some converted but not rejoicing Christians. <lb/>
He gave me the prayer,' Lord, give me <hi rend="italic">all</hi> in this <lb/>
house!' And He just <hi rend="italic">did!</hi> Before I left the <lb/>
house, every one had got a blessing. The last <lb/>
night of my visit I was too happy to sleep, and <lb/>
passed most of the night in praise and renewal of <lb/>
<pb n="125" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0128"/>
my own consecration, and these little couplets <lb/>
formed themselves, and chimed in my heart one <lb/>
after another, till they finished with, "<hi rend="italic">Ever</hi>, only, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">All</hi> for Thee."</p>
<p>Troubles now fell lightly upon her, and even <lb/>
when she lost money and everything in the shape <lb/>
of influence and fame in the United States, through <lb/>
the failure of her publisher there, she had so much <lb/>
happiness in her revivified faith that it did not <lb/>
touch her at all. "I think if it had been all my <lb/>
English footing," she said, "present and <reg orig="pros-|pective">prospective</reg>, <lb/>
as well as the American, that I thus found <lb/>
suddenly gone, it would have been worth it, for <lb/>
the joy it has been to find my Lord so faithful and <lb/>
true to His promises. I have not a fear, or a <lb/>
doubt, or a care, or a shadow upon the sunshine of <lb/>
my heart."</p>
<p>Hymns and poems were never written by Miss <lb/>
Havergal at pleasure. All were the outcome of <lb/>
some momentary inspiration, and could never be <lb/>
forced. It was so with such hymns as "Daily <lb/>
strength," "Golden harps are sounding," and <lb/>
"This same Jesus." The hymn beginning, "O <lb/>
Master, at Thy feet I bow in rapture sweet," was <lb/>
written on the last day of 1866, in the cold and <lb/>
twilight in a little back room at Shareshill <reg orig="Parson-|age">Parsonage</reg>. <lb/>
The missionary hymn, "Tell it out among <lb/>
the heathen," was written at Winterdyne, when <lb/>
she was unable to go to Church one snowy Sunday <lb/>
morning. She also composed the melody, rapidly <lb/>
writing out the verses first, and then the music <lb/>
and harmonies. She wrote a good many hymns, <lb/>
songs, and prose papers in 1874, and planned her <lb/>
<pb n="126" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0129"/>
"Little Pillows," being thirty-one short papers, as <lb/>
a book for children of about twelve years of age. <lb/>
There was a short, easily recollected text, to go to <lb/>
sleep upon for each night of the month, with a <lb/>
page or two of simple, practical thoughts about it. <lb/>
See also compiled a charming little companion <lb/>
volume to this, called "Morning Bells."</p>
<p>In the latter part of the year 1874, she <reg orig="unfortu-|nately">unfortunately</reg> <lb/>
contracted typhoid fever, all that motherly <lb/>
nursing and medical skill could do failing to arrest <lb/>
its development, from what was apparently only <lb/>
a feverish cold. Neuralgia being added to the <lb/>
fever, she endured great agony for a time; yet on <lb/>
the first day that she was seriously ill she dictated <lb/>
the hymn, "Just as Thou wilt, O Master, call!" <lb/>
She recovered sufficiently to be moved to <reg orig="Winter-|dyne">Winterdyne</reg>, <lb/>
in January, 1875, but soon suffered a severe <lb/>
relapse. At one time she was very much exhausted, <lb/>
and moaned with pain; yet her spirit was bright <lb/>
and patient as ever. Her recovery was extremely <lb/>
slow, but her room was always the most cheerful <lb/>
in the house. As soon as she was able to be <lb/>
moved, she was conveyed to Oakhampton for a <lb/>
change. It is characteristic of her that she never <lb/>
rested in her sister's house until every servant had <lb/>
joined the Christian Progress Union. When health <lb/>
came back, she returned heartily and lovingly <lb/>
to her work. In the autumn of 1875, she visited <lb/>
York and Whitby. At York Minster she had a <lb/>
pleasant interview with Dr. Dykes. While at <lb/>
Whitby, she heard in the petitions of a working <lb/>
man at a noon prayer-meeting, the words, "Father, <lb/>
we know the reality of Jesus Christ." The words <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0130"/>
haunted her until late in the evening, when she <lb/>
wrote her poem, "Reality, reality, Lord Jesus <lb/>
Christ, Thou art to me." For the International <lb/>
Women's Christian Association Conference at New <lb/>
York&mdash;which she could not attend, though invited&mdash; <lb/>
she wrote the poem, "Without Carefulness."</p>
<p>Frances Havergal's patience was tested in a <lb/>
variety of ways. On one occasion she had <reg orig="care-|fully">carefully</reg> <lb/>
prepared for press many sheets of manuscript <lb/>
music in connection with the Appendix to the <lb/>
"Songs of Grace and Glory." She had despatched <lb/>
her work to the printers, glad that she was now <lb/>
free to write a new book, when in the course of <lb/>
a week, the disastrous news arrived that the <reg orig="print-|ing">printing</reg> <lb/>
works had been burned down, and that the <lb/>
whole of this musical edition, together with the <lb/>
paper sent for printing it, had been totally <reg orig="de-|stroyed">destroyed</reg>. <lb/>
This entailed six months' fresh labour, <lb/>
for she had kept no copy of the work, and every <lb/>
chord of her own had to be reproduced, while <lb/>
every chord by any one else had to be re-examined <lb/>
and revised. Yet this is how she dealt with the <lb/>
loss and disappointment in a letter to her sisters: <lb/>
"I am suddenly shut off from the bright stream <lb/>
of successful writing, and stopped in all my own <lb/>
plans for this spring, and bid work a few months <lb/>
longer in the shade at what is to me special <lb/>
exercise of quiet patience &hellip; I have thanked <lb/>
Him for it more than I have prayed about it. It <lb/>
is just what he did with me last year; it is another <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">turned lesson.</hi> I had mourned over not bearing <lb/>
pain in my first illness, and so He gave me <lb/>
another opportunity of learning the lesson, by <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0131"/>
sending me another painful illness, at Winterdyne, <lb/>
instead of giving me up as a hopeless pupil; and <lb/>
now I have been eager to get done with 'Songs <lb/>
of Grace and Glory,' that I might hurry on to <lb/>
begin work of my own choosing and planning, <lb/>
and so He is giving me the opportunity <hi rend="italic">over again</hi> <lb/>
of doing it more practically, and of making it <lb/>
the 'willing service,' which I don't think it was <lb/>
before. If I could not rejoice in letting Him do <lb/>
what He will with me, when He thus sends me <lb/>
such very marked and individual dealing, I should <lb/>
feel that my desire for sanctification, for his will <lb/>
to be done in me, had been merely nominal, or <lb/>
fancied and not real."</p>
<p>In the summer of 1876, she went on a visit to <lb/>
her brother Frank at Upton Bishop Vicarage. <lb/>
She soon endeared herself by her interest in the <lb/>
schools and cottages, and every day she went <lb/>
about from house to house, sometimes conversing <lb/>
and sometimes singing. After service on Sunday <lb/>
evening, she sang from Handel's "Messiah," <reg orig="ac-|companying">accompanying</reg> <lb/>
herself on her brother's organ, and <lb/>
the listeners were deeply moved. She initiated <lb/>
a fund for the erection of a new vestry, which <lb/>
was eventually completed, "In memory of F. R. H." <lb/>
Proceeding to Newport, she attended the meetings <lb/>
of the Young Women's Christian Association, and <lb/>
likewise visited the Infirmary, where she read, <lb/>
prayed, and sang in the women's ward, and then <lb/>
spoke to each inmate alone. Her labours were <lb/>
much blessed. She had a mission week amongst <lb/>
boys, many of whom she persuaded to work for <lb/>
the King. Next she visited Ashley Moor, and <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0132"/>
after enjoying breezy rides and drives, as well as <lb/>
delightful friendships, "she left a sunbeam track <lb/>
in many cottages in that neighbourhood."</p>
<p>In July, 1876, she left England with her sister <lb/>
Maria for a long rest in the South of Europe. <lb/>
They proceeded to Lausanne, and then to <reg orig="Mon-|treux">Montreux</reg>, <lb/>
near which place Frances visited her friend, <lb/>
Miss E. J. Whately. They next went to Vernayaz, <lb/>
and subsequently to Argenti&egrave;re, and through the <lb/>
Chamounix to the great St. Bernard Hospice, <lb/>
where they took diligence for Orsi&egrave;re. On many <lb/>
occasions at the Hospice and elsewhere, Frances <lb/>
sang before gatherings in which many nationalities <lb/>
were represented, such sacred solos as "Comfort <lb/>
ye," "He shall feed His flock," and "Rest in the <lb/>
Lord." From the Hospice they diverged to Lac <lb/>
de Champ&egrave;, thence to Martigny and Champ&egrave;ry. <lb/>
At the latter place, Frances saw her friend Mr. <lb/>
Rogers, who was summer chaplain at Champ&egrave;ry. <lb/>
It was here, also, that she formed a friendship with <lb/>
the Baroness Helga von Cramm, which she has <lb/>
thus described: "One of my Champ&egrave;ry gains <lb/>
was the Baroness Helga von Cramm; such an <lb/>
artist, every picture is a poem, such a soul in all <lb/>
she paints; her two specialities are Alpine scenery, <lb/>
with the weirdest effects of snow and clouds, and <lb/>
the marvellous beauty of the little Alpine flowers. <lb/>
Well, now, of course she wants to paint for Jesus <lb/>
somehow. So I suggested that we might do <lb/>
something together, and we would first ask Him <lb/>
to give <hi rend="italic">me</hi> half a dozen nice little Easter verses <lb/>
&lpar;new ground to me&rpar;, and then that He would hold <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">her</hi> hand, and make her do some exquisite flowers. <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0133"/>
So, the verses all came tumbling in that evening. <lb/>
Such was the origin of the varied series of lovely <lb/>
'Alpine Cards,' subsequently published by Caswell."</p>
<p>The travellers next went to the Bernese <reg orig="Ober-|land">Oberland</reg>, <lb/>
and stayed for a considerable time at the <lb/>
Pension Wengen, above Lauterbrunnen, where <lb/>
they had in view the full range of the Jungfrau <lb/>
and Silberhorn. Through a chill caught in a <lb/>
heavy thunderstorm, Frances became seriously ill, <lb/>
and was laid aside for a month. As they had the <lb/>
pension to themselves, however, and were favoured <lb/>
with brilliant weather, the patient eventually <reg orig="re-|covered">recovered</reg>. <lb/>
To her friend, Miss Whately, she wrote <lb/>
in October: "I was splendidly better till the end <lb/>
of August, and meant to have settled down to a <lb/>
delicious month or so of leisurely writing out here, <lb/>
and then gone home to dear mamma, and begun <lb/>
almost a new era of life. However, God has chosen <lb/>
otherwise for me; I am just where I was this time <lb/>
last year, and my book-writing is indefinitely <reg orig="post-|poned">postponed</reg>. <lb/>
&hellip; How glad I am that our work is not <lb/>
measured by quantity, and that its results depend <lb/>
neither on quantity nor quality, but only on the <lb/>
sovereignty of His blessing."</p>
<p>Before October closed, the sisters returned to <lb/>
England; and on the way from Oxford to <reg orig="Winter-|dyne">Winterdyne</reg>, <lb/>
the idea suddenly came to Miss Havergal <lb/>
for her little book, "My King." The thirty-one <lb/>
chapters she sketched out at once, and although <lb/>
illness intervened, the book was quickly written <lb/>
and published, so that the enforced rest from <lb/>
composition in Switzerland was not lost, but <lb/>
was regarded only as another "turned lesson." <lb/>
<pb n="131" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0134"/>
Sometimes she was obliged to use the pecuniary <lb/>
proceeds of her labours in paying doctors and <lb/>
nurses, and this was a trial to her, as she always <lb/>
wished to give the money in some form to God's <lb/>
cause. Her own views as to her best work were <lb/>
frequently not those of the public. For example, <lb/>
she regarded the poem on "The Thoughts of <lb/>
God," as her very best piece of writing, yet readers <lb/>
thought little of it as compared with the stanzas, <lb/>
"I did this for thee," or, "Take my life."</p>
<p>Her friend, Elizabeth Clay, went out to India in <lb/>
1877 for mission work. This accentuated her own <lb/>
longing for active service of some kind, but the <lb/>
physical strength for it seemed withheld from her <lb/>
for some wise purpose. The Mildmay Conference, <lb/>
however, in which she always manifested a warm <lb/>
interest, she was sometimes able to attend. Some <lb/>
one having written to Miss Havergal to ask whether <lb/>
the couplet in her consecration hymn, "Take my <lb/>
silver and my gold, Not a mite would I withhold," <lb/>
was to be interpreted literally, she replied that it <lb/>
"does not mean that, because we have ten shillings <lb/>
in our purse, we are pledged to put it all into the <lb/>
next collecting-plate, else we should have none for <lb/>
the next call! But it does mean that every shilling <lb/>
is to be, and I think I might say <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, held at my <lb/>
Lord's disposal, and is distinctly not my own; but, <lb/>
as He has entrusted to me a body for my special <lb/>
charge, I am bound to clothe that body with His <lb/>
silver and gold, so that it shall neither suffer from <lb/>
cold, nor bring discredit upon His cause." In the <lb/>
same common-sense spirit, she explained her views <lb/>
as to women being well and tastefully dressed. <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0135"/>
"The outer should be the expression of the inner, <lb/>
not an ugly mask or disguise. If the King's <lb/>
daughter is to be 'all glorious within,' she must not <lb/>
be outwardly a fright! I must dress both as a lady <lb/>
and as a Christian. The question of cost I see <lb/>
very strongly, and do not consider myself at liberty <lb/>
to spend on dress that which might be spared for <lb/>
God's work; but it costs no more to have a thing <lb/>
well and prettily made, and I should only feel <lb/>
justified in getting a costly dress if it would last <lb/>
proportionately longer." Dressing was a matter <lb/>
for suitability and appearance, and requirements <lb/>
differed according to circumstances. She very <lb/>
truly and amusingly added that it would scarcely <lb/>
be right to appear among wedding guests in a <lb/>
dress which would be perfectly suitable for wearing <lb/>
in an infirmary.</p>
<p>Writing to one correspondent, as to her own busy <lb/>
life, Miss Havergal said: "Your letter would take <lb/>
two hours to answer, and I have not ten minutes; <lb/>
fifteen to twenty letters to write every morning, <lb/>
proofs to correct, editors waiting for articles, poems <lb/>
and music I cannot touch, American publishers <lb/>
clamouring for poems or <hi rend="italic">any</hi> manuscripts, four <lb/>
Bible readings or classes weekly, many anxious <lb/>
ones waiting for help, a mission week coming, and <lb/>
other work after that."</p>
<p>In October, 1877, we find her staying with Mrs. <lb/>
Pennefather, at the Mildmay Orphanage, where she <lb/>
was so delighted with all she saw, and with the <lb/>
happiness of the inmates of Clapton House, that <lb/>
she wished every girl she cared for could be in <lb/>
such a beautiful Christian school. She took the <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0136"/>
Bible-class for the principal, and was struck by the <lb/>
intelligence and earnestness of the pupils. She <lb/>
early joined the Christian Progress Scripture <lb/>
Reading Union, and became one of its most active <lb/>
members, on one occasion taking for a time the <lb/>
editor's duties with the Magazine.</p>
<p>Mrs. Havergal suffered greatly in the winter and <lb/>
spring of 1877&ndash;8, although with wonderful energy <lb/>
she still carried on her Zenana meetings, and those <lb/>
of the American Freed Women's Society. At <lb/>
length, on Sunday, the 26th of May, 1878, the end <lb/>
came. She had been unconscious for hours when <lb/>
she momentarily recovered from this, and <reg orig="recog-|nizing">recognizing</reg> <lb/>
her daughter Frances kneeling by her bed, <lb/>
she gave her a heavenly smile and passed away. <lb/>
She was laid to rest beside her husband in Astley <lb/>
Churchyard. The home at Leamington was now <lb/>
broken up, and the sisters Maria and Frances <lb/>
resolved to reside at the Mumbles, the South <lb/>
Wales resort which they had found so pleasant <lb/>
before, and here they were joined for a time by <lb/>
their brother. Before finally settling down at the <lb/>
Mumbles, however, they went into Herefordshire <lb/>
on a visit, staying at the Highlands Farm, near <lb/>
Titley. Then they returned to Leamington for <lb/>
painful farewells. Visits into Somersetshire and <lb/>
Devonshire followed, and in October, Frances joined <lb/>
her sister in their Welsh retreat. Maria writes of <lb/>
her at this point: "She was so very tired, that <lb/>
even the sea-air and perfect rest failed to refresh <lb/>
her for some time. Afterwards, she thoroughly <lb/>
enjoyed the walks and scrambles on the cliffs; at <lb/>
low tide springing lightly over boulders to beds <lb/>
<pb n="134" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0137"/>
of sea-weeds, and rocky pools bright with sea <lb/>
anemones, and then calling to me to watch the <lb/>
white-crested waves, 'the wind dashing them back <lb/>
like confirmation veils.' Or, watching the vessels <lb/>
with all sails up entering the harbour, she would <lb/>
speak of the 'abundant entrance into the <reg orig="ever-|lasting">everlasting</reg> <lb/>
kingdom.' Delighting in all knowledge, <lb/>
she studied the 'Nautical Almanac,' and at the <lb/>
top of the Mumbles Lighthouse learnt all that the <lb/>
keeper could tell her. Her tastes were so simple, <lb/>
delighting in wild flowers, and in animals, from the <lb/>
great St. Bernard dogs to her pet kittens."</p>
<p>A study was fitted up for her, with home <reg orig="com-|forts">comforts</reg>. <lb/>
She arranged her own pictures, placing by <lb/>
the door her motto, "For Jesus' sake only," and <lb/>
her Temperance pledge-card. Her father's portrait, <lb/>
sketches of Astley Church and Rectory, scenes in <lb/>
Switzerland, etc., adorned the walls. Her library <lb/>
was small but choice, and it embraced classical, <lb/>
poetical, theological, and foreign works, with works <lb/>
on science, geology, etc. The last works she read <lb/>
were, "The Earth's Formation on Dynamical <lb/>
Principles," by Professor Ritchie; Goodwin's <lb/>
"Works;" and the Rev. W. Pennefather's "Life <lb/>
and Letters." Her habits of reading and writing <lb/>
were most methodical, and nothing was ever found <lb/>
out of its place. She was in her study by seven <lb/>
o'clock in the summer and eight in the winter, <lb/>
reading her Bible. Her harp-piano occupied a <lb/>
stand by her side always, and it was on this <reg orig="instru-|ment">instrument</reg> <lb/>
that she composed her last sacred song, <lb/>
"Loving all along," and numerous other melodies <lb/>
to her hymns in "Loyal Responses." From the <lb/>
<pb n="135" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0138"/>
south window of her room she could enjoy a fine <lb/>
view stretching away to Ilfracombe, and from the <lb/>
west window another of Caswell Bay and its rocks, <lb/>
often illumined by magnificent sunsets. "It may <lb/>
be useful to young readers," observes her sister, <lb/>
"to mention how resolutely she refrained from late <lb/>
hours, and frittering talks at night, instead of <lb/>
Bible searching and holy communings. Early <lb/>
rising and early studying were her rule through <lb/>
life, while punctuality, and bright, quick cheeriness <lb/>
characterized all she did."</p>
<p>But rest did not come to her, even in her <lb/>
beautiful retreat. The penny post found her out <lb/>
at the Mumbles, and it is startling to hear of the <lb/>
vast variety of communications which reached her <lb/>
in the course of one short week. She was ever <lb/>
cheery and considerate with it all, but it is to be <lb/>
feared that for her health's sake she responded <lb/>
only too readily to requests for poems, cards, <lb/>
articles, advice, etc. Then she did work amongst <lb/>
the cottagers, and even went out to villages five or <lb/>
six miles away to lighten the burden of existence <lb/>
for others, and to make their lives more happy. <lb/>
When her last Christmas season came, she was in <lb/>
great pain, and was very ill for some days. But <lb/>
her bright, cheery feelings never left her, and <lb/>
although nearly borne down by weakness, she yet <lb/>
wrote whenever she could. She never kept a <lb/>
regular diary, but in a little "Journal of Mercies <lb/>
for 1879," sent her by her friend, Mrs. Charles <lb/>
Bullock, she made a brief entry for each day in <lb/>
the month. She also delighted in annotating and <lb/>
collating her Bible and Testament, and in making <lb/>
<pb n="136" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0139"/>
notes of special subjects for prayer. She further <lb/>
planned out a considerable programme of work <lb/>
for 1879, appending a note thereto&mdash;"if the Lord <lb/>
will."</p>
<p>In January, 1879, she went to London, and <lb/>
visited her friends, Mr. and Mrs. Watson, and the <lb/>
Rev. Charles and Mrs. Bullock. Owing to <reg orig="infec-|tious">infectious</reg> <lb/>
illness in the latter family, however, she soon <lb/>
returned to Wales. Engagements now increased <lb/>
with her, instead of diminishing, as they ought to <lb/>
have done; but she gave up all her strength and <lb/>
energies to the claims upon her, and laboured <lb/>
assiduously in temperance and Bible mission work, <lb/>
as well as in the village school. In March, she <reg orig="re-|wrote">rewrote</reg> <lb/>
her last book, "Kept," and composed a <lb/>
series of papers called "Morning Stars." She was <lb/>
delighted by the publication of her music to Mr. <lb/>
Prout's words, "Loving all along," and wrote to <lb/>
the author: "I hope to sing it in many <reg orig="drawing-|rooms">drawing-rooms</reg>; <lb/>
it is delightful to do the King's business <lb/>
there, and singing often opens the door for quiet <lb/>
conversations. I do so pray the words may touch <lb/>
some weary hearts under silks and satins, and <lb/>
dress-coats too, maybe."</p>
<p>Miss Havergal was indefatigable in her work <lb/>
for the Irish Society. This society was established <lb/>
for promoting the Scriptural education and <reg orig="re-|ligious">religious</reg> <lb/>
instruction of the Irish-speaking <reg orig="popula-|tion">population</reg>, <lb/>
chiefly through the medium of their own <lb/>
language. Its head-office is in Upper Sackville <lb/>
Street, Dublin. F. R. H.'s brother-in-law, Mr. <lb/>
Shaw, resided near Dublin, and it was his custom <lb/>
to drive into the city every Tuesday morning, to <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0140"/>
attend the Committees of the Hibernian Bible <lb/>
Society and the Irish Society. When on her visits <lb/>
to Ireland, Frances often accompanied him. It <lb/>
was in this way that she got interested in the <lb/>
work of the Irish Society, and hearing stirring <lb/>
details concerning it, she took up her first <reg orig="collect-|ing-card">collecting-card</reg>. <lb/>
The result was that from collecting &pound;1 <lb/>
in 1856, she had in March, 1879, sent in more than <lb/>
&pound;900 to this Society. In 1859, she organized a <lb/>
branch society in Worcester, and her first collector <lb/>
was a little girl named "Bruey." Her book of that <lb/>
name was written after her death; one of her <lb/>
names was Bruce, hence her pet name of Bruey; <lb/>
and the sketch of her character was founded on <lb/>
recollections and incidents. As Bruey was the <lb/>
first collector at Worcester, the branch society was <lb/>
called the "Bruey Branch." The branch was so <lb/>
successful that in course of time hundreds of <lb/>
Bruey cards were being taken all over the <reg orig="king-|dom">kingdom</reg>. <lb/>
Its founder also prosecuted with vigour her <lb/>
temperance crusade, and founded the Newton <lb/>
Temperance Regiment for the youths of Newton, <lb/>
a village near the Mumbles. This undertaking <lb/>
also had great success.</p>
<p>At Easter, 1879, Miss Havergal's friend, <reg orig="Eliza-|beth">Elizabeth</reg> <lb/>
Clay, arrived at the Mumbles from India. <lb/>
Although now comparatively an invalid, "Frances <lb/>
was deeply interested in the details of her Indian <lb/>
journeys and Zenana work, and consulted with her <lb/>
as to the possibility of eventually going to India <lb/>
herself, that she might be able to write for her <lb/>
King in Oriental languages." Other visitors <reg orig="in-|cluded">included</reg> <lb/>
Mr. Sankey &lpar;Moody and Sankey&rpar; and his <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0141"/>
wife, and the Baroness Helga von Cramm. They <lb/>
had pleasant interchanges of thought and <reg orig="experi-|ence">experience</reg> <lb/>
together. Miss Havergal was much affected <lb/>
on May 1, by the death of her first collector in the <lb/>
Bruey Branch, a child known by the name of <lb/>
Little Nony. She was a loving, beautiful, ethereal <lb/>
creature, of whose brief and suffering life touching <lb/>
memorials were afterwards published. Writing <lb/>
to her friend, the Rev. C. B. Snepp, from the <lb/>
Mumbles, on May 17, Miss Havergal said: "I <lb/>
begin my Irish campaign, please God, on June 4; <lb/>
I stay first with the good Bishop of Cashel. Really <lb/>
a wonderful little temperance work here; all the <lb/>
rising generation have joined the pledge except <lb/>
about twelve, and now the men want to speak to <lb/>
me, and I am to meet them to-night, at the corner <lb/>
of the village &lpar;open air, having no place else&rpar;, with <lb/>
my pledge-book. I have got 118 pledged, and <lb/>
each with prayer over it, and personal talk about <lb/>
better things."</p>
<p>The projected Irish visit was never carried out. <lb/>
On May 21, Miss Havergal caught a severe chill <lb/>
while addressing a number of men and boys <lb/>
on Newton village bank, the atmosphere being <lb/>
damp from mist and small rain. On May 22 <lb/>
being Ascension Day, she went to church, but <lb/>
for communion only. Her journey home was the <lb/>
last occasion on which she spoke for the Master. <lb/>
Her pleadings were successful in several instances, <lb/>
and those whom she helped to a better life never <lb/>
forgot the loving earnestness of her appeals. She <lb/>
was now confined to the house, suffering from <lb/>
feverishness, but for several days no serious result <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0142"/>
was apprehended. On the 23rd and 24th, she <lb/>
penned two letters, the last she ever wrote, in <lb/>
pencil, but on the 26th she corrected the proof of <lb/>
"Morning Stars," on the text, "I am the bright <lb/>
and morning Star." Then she laid down the pen, <lb/>
never to take it up again; she was not suffering, <lb/>
but lying quietly in bed, with her little pet kittens, <lb/>
Trot and Dot, near her. She astonished her doctor <lb/>
by asking, "Do you think I've a chance of going?" <lb/>
for he did not regard his patient as being <reg orig="danger-|ously">dangerously</reg> <lb/>
ill. He asked her if she liked lying there, <lb/>
and in pain, and she replied, "Yes, I do; it is as <lb/>
if an errand-boy were told to take a message, and <lb/>
afterwards the master bids him <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to go. I was <lb/>
going to Ireland next week, hoping to write for <lb/>
the Irish Society; but God has upset all my plans, <lb/>
and it's all right."</p>
<p>Fever and internal inflammation rapidly set in, <lb/>
with all the symptoms and agony of peritonitis. <lb/>
All remedies failed, but her face shone with peace <lb/>
and joy, and when her friends appeared distressed, <lb/>
she smilingly said, "It's home the faster!" Once <lb/>
she turned to her sister and whispered, "Let my <lb/>
own Text, 'The blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, <lb/>
cleanseth us from all sin,' be on my tomb; <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the <lb/>
verse, if there is room." The pain now increased, <lb/>
but her resignation and endurance kept pace with <lb/>
it. When told at length that she was seriously <lb/>
ill, and that the inflammation was increasing, she <lb/>
said, "I thought so, but if I am going, it is too <lb/>
good to be true!" In the early dawn of Whit <lb/>
Monday she observed to her sister, "'Spite of the <lb/>
breakers, Marie, I am so happy; God's promises <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0143"/>
are so true. Not a fear." Then she requested her <lb/>
brother to conduct a sacramental service, and <lb/>
afterwards she asked for "Jerusalem, my happy <lb/>
home," to be sung to her father's tune, "<reg orig="Chry-|sostom">Chrysostom</reg>," <lb/>
played on her harp-piano. Recovering <lb/>
a little, she saw the Vicar of Swansea, to whom <lb/>
she spoke of her blessed state, adding, "Ask Mr. <lb/>
A<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g4"/> to speak plainly about Jesus. I want all <lb/>
young clergymen to be faithful ambassadors, and <lb/>
win souls. Oh, I want all of you to speak <hi rend="italic">bright, <lb/>
bright</hi> words about Jesus, oh do, <hi rend="italic">do!</hi> It is all <lb/>
perfect peace, I am only waiting for Jesus to take <lb/>
me in."</p>
<p>On Whit Tuesday the change came, and to one <lb/>
of her sisters, who repeated, "When thou passest <lb/>
through the waters, I will be with thee," she said <lb/>
with emphasis, "He <hi rend="italic">must</hi> keep his word." After <lb/>
a short doze, she was able to speak of Miss Leigh's <lb/>
work in Paris, and one of her own friends there. <lb/>
Then she whispered the names of many dear ones, <lb/>
saying yearningly that she wanted <hi rend="italic">all</hi> to come to <lb/>
her in heaven. After this, she sang the whole <lb/>
verse through, beginning, "Jesus, I will trust Thee," <lb/>
to her own tune, "Hermas." The closing scene <lb/>
of all is thus movingly described by her sister:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Then came a rush of convulsive sickness. It <lb/>
ceased; the nurse gently assisting her, she nestled <lb/>
down in the pillows, folded her hands on her breast, <lb/>
saying, 'There, now it is all over! Blessed rest!'</p>
<p>"And now she looked up steadfastly as if she <lb/>
saw the Lord; and, surely, nothing less heavenly <lb/>
could have reflected such a glorious radiance upon <lb/>
her face. For ten minutes we watched that almost <lb/>
<pb n="141" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0144"/>
visible meeting with her King, and her countenance <lb/>
was so glad, as if she were already talking to Him. <lb/>
Then she tried to sing, but after one sweet high <lb/>
note,'He<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g5"/>' her voice failed, and, as her brother <lb/>
commended her soul into her Redeemer's hand, <lb/>
she passed away. Our precious sister was gone, <lb/>
satisfied, glorified, within the palace of her King."</p>
<p>The remains of Frances Ridley Havergal were <lb/>
conveyed to Astley, and laid in the churchyard <lb/>
beside those of her father, many tributes being <lb/>
paid to the dead. Hers was not a long life&mdash;she <lb/>
was only forty-two years of age&mdash;but it was <reg orig="pre-|eminently">preeminently</reg> <lb/>
a noble and a full life. As the <reg orig="inscrip-|tion">inscription</reg> <lb/>
on her tomb says, "By her writings in prose <lb/>
and verse, she 'being dead, yet speaketh.'" She <lb/>
needed nothing to keep her memory green; but <lb/>
the "Frances Ridley Havergal Church Missionary <lb/>
Memorial Fund" worthily carries forward her <lb/>
spirit and traditions.</p>
<p>It is beautiful to reflect upon the utter <reg orig="absorp-|tion">absorption</reg> <lb/>
of this loving and gifted woman in deeds of <lb/>
Christian charity and human amelioration. In her, <lb/>
the service of song and the service of the daily <lb/>
life were harmoniously blended. The published <lb/>
records of her sex furnish no finer examples of <lb/>
complete and perfect surrender of heart and <lb/>
faculties to the Master's work, and to but few are <lb/>
given such shining talents. But her life and works <lb/>
are doubtless already stimulating hundreds of <lb/>
women to Christ-like, if unobtrusive service in the <lb/>
streets and alleys of our densely populated towns <lb/>
and cities, as well as stirring them to active <lb/>
sympathy with Christian efforts in foreign lands.</p>

HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Harriet Elizabeth Beecher Stowe</hi>, the friend <lb/>
and champion of the slave, belongs to one of the <lb/>
most remarkable families which the American <lb/>
Continent has yet produced. Its founder went out <lb/>
from England, and settled, in 1638, at New Haven, <lb/>
Connecticut. One of his descendants, the eminent <lb/>
divine, Dr. Lyman Beecher, was born there in <lb/>
1775. He was educated for the Presbyterian <lb/>
ministry, and became one of the most distinguished <lb/>
leaders in that body. He was twice married, and <lb/>
had no fewer than thirteen children&mdash;six daughters <lb/>
and seven sons&mdash;and it is a singular, and probably <lb/>
unprecedented fact, that all the latter became <lb/>
clergymen.</p>
<p>All the children who made their mark upon the <lb/>
time were the offspring of Dr. Beecher's first wife, <lb/>
Roxana Foote. Three in particular stood out <lb/>
from the rest&mdash;Catherine, Harriet, and Henry <lb/>
Ward Beecher. Catherine, the eldest, was born <lb/>
in 1800. She was engaged in early life to <reg orig="Pro-|fessor">Professor</reg> <lb/>
Fisher, of Yale College, who was lost by <lb/>
shipwreck. Catherine Beecher remained true to <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0149"/>
his memory, and never married, and her long life <lb/>
and energies were devoted to advocating the <reg orig="edu-|cational">educational</reg> <lb/>
and other claims of women, both by speech <lb/>
and pen. She died at the age of seventy-eight. <lb/>
Henry Ward Beecher occupied so large a space <lb/>
in the world's eye that it is not necessary here to <lb/>
recapitulate his career. He died after an active <lb/>
religious, political, and literary career&mdash;through <lb/>
which he was an uncompromising opponent of <lb/>
slavery&mdash;in 1887, at the age of seventy-four.</p>
<p>Harriet Elizabeth Beecher, the subject of our <lb/>
biographical sketch, was born in the pleasant New <lb/>
England town of Litchfield, Connecticut, on June <lb/>
14, 1812, so that her existence has been prolonged <lb/>
for many years beyond the proverbial span of <lb/>
human life. Mrs. Stowe long cherished the <reg orig="pro-|ject">project</reg> <lb/>
of writing her own Recollections, but, as <lb/>
failing strength and increasing infirmities rendered <lb/>
this impossible, her son, the Rev. Charles Edward <lb/>
Stowe, compiled, at her request, a biography from <lb/>
her letters and journals. It was published in 1889, <lb/>
and in a prefatory note thereto, Mrs. Stowe said: <lb/>
"It is perhaps much more accurate as to detail <lb/>
and impression than is possible with any <reg orig="auto-|biography">autobiography</reg> <lb/>
written late in life. If these pages <lb/>
shall lead those who read them to a firmer trust <lb/>
in God, and a deeper sense of His fatherly <reg orig="good-|ness">goodness</reg> <lb/>
throughout the days of our earthly pilgrimage, <lb/>
I can say, with Valiant-for-Truth, in the 'Pilgrim's <lb/>
Progress,' 'I am going to my Father's, and, though <lb/>
with great difficulty I am got hither, yet now I do <lb/>
not repent me of all the troubles I have been at <lb/>
to arrive where I am. My sword I give to him <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0150"/>
that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage, and my <lb/>
courage and skill to him that can get it.'"</p>
<p>The most sacred memory attached to Harriet <lb/>
Beecher's childhood was the loss of her mother <lb/>
when Harriet was only four years old. She seems <lb/>
to have had one of those strong, useful, yet widely <lb/>
sympathetic natures, in which all around could <lb/>
find comfort and repose. There was no human <lb/>
mind in whose decisions Dr. Lyman Beecher had <lb/>
greater confidence, and both intellectually and <lb/>
morally he regarded her as the better and stronger <lb/>
portion of himself. So records her daughter, whose <lb/>
own reminiscences of her mother were necessarily <lb/>
somewhat limited. Her death and funeral, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
she remembered vividly. The children were <lb/>
told at one time that their mother had been laid <lb/>
in the ground, and at another that she had gone <lb/>
to heaven. Putting these two things together, <lb/>
Henry, a curly-headed little fellow of two, was <lb/>
one day found digging vigorously in the garden, <lb/>
and being asked what he was doing, he replied, <lb/>
"Why, I'm going to heaven to find mamma!" <lb/>
Mrs. Beecher's influence after death was as great <lb/>
over her children as though she were alive. "<reg orig="Al-|though">Although</reg> <lb/>
our mother's bodily presence disappeared <lb/>
from our circle," said Mrs. Stowe, "I think her <lb/>
memory and example had more influence in <reg orig="mould-|ing">moulding</reg> <lb/>
her family, in deterring from evil and inciting <lb/>
to good, than the living presence of many mothers. <lb/>
It was a memory that met us everywhere, for <lb/>
every person in the town, from the highest to the <lb/>
lowest, seemed to have been so impressed by her <lb/>
character and life that they constantly reflected <lb/>
<pb n="148" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0151"/>
some portion of it back upon us. The passage in <lb/>
'Uncle Tom,' where Augustine St. Clair describes <lb/>
his mother's influence, is a simple reproduction <lb/>
of my own mother's influence as it has always <lb/>
been felt in her family."</p>
<p>After Mrs. Beecher's death, Harriet and her <lb/>
sisters spent some time with an aunt at Nut Plains, <lb/>
a beautiful rural district in Connecticut. Harriet <lb/>
went to school, and had the character of being a <lb/>
good girl. Her memory was a most retentive <lb/>
one, and, during her fifth year, she committed to <lb/>
memory in the course of two or three months <lb/>
twenty-seven hymns and two long chapters in the <lb/>
Bible. She was also able to read, and studied <lb/>
diligently in various branches of knowledge. <lb/>
During her search on one occasion amid parcels <lb/>
of old sermons and pamphlets in her father's <lb/>
garret, she came upon a copy of "The Arabian <lb/>
Nights," which proved a mine of wonderment and <lb/>
enjoyment for her. Then she had another treat <lb/>
when her father brought home a new edition of <lb/>
Cotton Mather's "Magnalia." These wonderful <lb/>
stories about her own country never palled upon <lb/>
her. Her sensations on first hearing the <reg orig="Declara-|tion">Declaration</reg> <lb/>
of Independence read, she has thus described: <lb/>
"I had never heard it before, and even now had <lb/>
but a vague idea of what was meant by some parts <lb/>
of it. Still I gathered enough from the recital <lb/>
of the abuses and injuries that had driven my <lb/>
nation to this course to feel myself swelling with <lb/>
indignation, and ready with all my little mind <lb/>
and strength to applaud the concluding passage <lb/>
which Colonel Talmadge rendered with resounding <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0152"/>
majesty. I was as ready as any of them to pledge <lb/>
my life, fortune, and sacred honour for such a <lb/>
cause. The heroic element was strong in me, <lb/>
having come down by ordinary generation from <lb/>
a long line of Puritan ancestry, and just now it <lb/>
made me long to do something&mdash;I knew not what&mdash; <lb/>
to fight for my country, or to make some <reg orig="declara-|tion">declaration</reg> <lb/>
on my own account."</p>
<p>In 1818, Dr. Beecher married Miss Harriet <lb/>
Porter, of Portland, Maine, a beautiful and refined <lb/>
woman, and one who "was distinguished for a <lb/>
most unfaltering Christ-worship." To the children, <lb/>
the new mother proved all that that sacred name <lb/>
implies, and they never had cause to regard life <lb/>
as aught other than blessed. A sketch of Harriet's <lb/>
happy child-life shows her tramping through the <lb/>
woods, or going on fishing-excursions with her <lb/>
brothers, sitting thoughtfully in her father's study, <lb/>
listening eagerly to the animated theological <reg orig="dis-|cussions">discussions</reg> <lb/>
of the day, visiting her grandmother at <lb/>
Nut Plains, or figuring as one of the brightest <lb/>
scholars in the Litchfield Academy. When she <lb/>
was eleven, she read everything she could lay her <lb/>
hands on, but she could also sew and knit <reg orig="beauti-|fully">beautifully</reg>. <lb/>
When lessons were being given to the <lb/>
older classes in school by her able master, she <lb/>
would listen with eager ears to historical criticisms <lb/>
and discussions, or to recitations in such works as <lb/>
Paley's "Moral Philosophy," Blair's "Rhetoric," <lb/>
Alison's essay on "Taste," etc. Under these <lb/>
circumstances it is not surprising to find that she <lb/>
early developed a fondness for writing&mdash;frequently <lb/>
on the most abstruse subjects&mdash;which amounted <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0153"/>
almost to a passion. When twelve years of age, <lb/>
she produced, for the annual examination in the <lb/>
Academy, an essay on the negative side of the <lb/>
question, "Can the Immortality of the Soul be <lb/>
proved by the Light of Nature?" Her son <reg orig="re-|prints">reprints</reg> <lb/>
this paper, and it certainly exhibits a <lb/>
singular maturity of thought and expression. The <lb/>
youthful essayist examined the various arguments <lb/>
adduced for a natural immortality, and showed <lb/>
that without Revelation, the destiny of man&mdash;the <lb/>
noblest of all the works of God&mdash;would have been <lb/>
left in obscurity.</p>
<p>On leaving the Academy in her thirteenth year, <lb/>
she joined her sister Catherine at her school in <lb/>
Hartford&mdash;first as pupil, and afterwards as teacher. <lb/>
The death of Professor Fisher, by the loss of the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Albion</hi> packet, on the coast of Ireland, in 1822, had <lb/>
for a time a terrible effect on Catherine Beecher. <lb/>
It is stated that without this incident, "The <lb/>
Minister's Wooing" would never have been written, <lb/>
for both Mrs. Marvyn's fearful soul-struggles and <lb/>
old Candace's direct and effective solution of all <lb/>
religious difficulties find their origin in this <lb/>
stranded, storm-beaten ship on the coast of Ireland, <lb/>
and the awful mental conflicts through which <lb/>
Catherine afterwards passed. Ultimately she <lb/>
came to realize that God was a being of infinite <lb/>
tenderness, patience, and love, though His ways <lb/>
were sometimes past finding out.</p>
<p>At fourteen, it was Harriet's dream to be a poet, <lb/>
and she began a drama called <hi rend="italic">Cleon</hi>. It dealt with <lb/>
the time of the Emperor Nero, and Cleon was a <lb/>
Greek lord residing at Nero's court, who, after <lb/>
<pb n="151" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0154"/>
much searching and doubting, at last came to a <lb/>
knowledge of Christianity. She had filled several <lb/>
manuscript books with this drama, when her sister <lb/>
discovered her occupation, and told her she must <lb/>
no longer trifle with poetry, but discipline her <lb/>
mind by a study of Butler's "Analogy." She <lb/>
wrote out abstracts from the work, and coming <lb/>
also at this time upon Baxter's "Saint's Rest," she <lb/>
was powerfully affected by it. In 1825, while <lb/>
spending the summer vacation at home, in <reg orig="Litch-|field">Litchfield</reg>, <lb/>
Harriet heard a sermon by her father, on <lb/>
the text, "Behold, I call you no longer servants, <lb/>
but friends," which caused her to give herself <lb/>
henceforth to Christ. A vision had been given to <lb/>
her of His great love, and He had been pictured <lb/>
to her as patient with our human errors, <reg orig="com-|passionate">compassionate</reg> <lb/>
with our weaknesses, and sympathetic <lb/>
for our sorrows. What followed is thus detailed:&mdash;</p>
<p>"As soon as father came home, and was seated <lb/>
in his study, I went up to him and fell in his arms, <lb/>
saying, 'Father, I have given myself to Jesus, and <lb/>
He has taken me.' I shall never forget the <reg orig="ex-|pression">expression</reg> <lb/>
of his face as he looked down into my <lb/>
earnest, childish eyes; it was so sweet, so gentle, <lb/>
and like sunlight breaking out upon a landscape. <lb/>
'Is it so?' he said, holding me silently to his heart, <lb/>
as I felt the hot tears fall on my head. 'Then <lb/>
has a new flower blossomed in the kingdom this <lb/>
day.'"</p>
<p>If she could have been let alone, and taught <lb/>
"to look up and not down, forward and not back, <lb/>
out and not in," this religious experience might <lb/>
have gone on as sweetly and naturally as the <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0155"/>
opening of a flower in the gentle rays of the sun. <lb/>
But, unfortunately, this was not possible at that <lb/>
time, when self-examination was carried to an <lb/>
extreme that was calculated to drive a nervous <lb/>
and sensitive mind well-nigh distracted. First, <lb/>
even her sister Catherine was afraid that there <lb/>
might be something wrong in the case of a lamb <lb/>
that had come into the fold without being first <lb/>
chased all over the lot by the shepherd; great <lb/>
stress being laid, in those days, on what was called, <lb/>
"being under conviction." Then, also, the pastor <lb/>
of the First Church in Hartford, a bosom friend of <lb/>
Dr. Beecher, looked with melancholy and <reg orig="suspi-|cious">suspicious</reg> <lb/>
eyes on this unusual and doubtful path to <lb/>
heaven.</p>
<p>In April, 1826, Dr. Beecher resigned his pastorate <lb/>
in Litchfield to accept a call to the Hanover <lb/>
Street Church, Boston, Massachusetts. It was, <lb/>
therefore, deemed advisable for Harriet to join <lb/>
the First Church of Hartford, which she <reg orig="accord-|ingly">accordingly</reg> <lb/>
did. Her recollections of this time show <lb/>
that she was passing through a period of deep <lb/>
spiritual conflict for one so young; she longed for <lb/>
the perfect life, but found it so difficult to make <lb/>
even the first approaches towards it. This went <lb/>
on for months, and in order to restore her to a <lb/>
more tranquil and healthful frame of mind, in the <lb/>
spring of 1827 she was sent on a visit to her <lb/>
grandmother Foote at Nut Plains. Here she <lb/>
came to have less of that almost overwhelming <lb/>
fear of God she had previously felt, and her mind <lb/>
acquired greater calm and restfulness.</p>
<p>Dr. Beecher remained for six years in Boston <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0156"/>
and then accepted an urgent call to the Presidency <lb/>
of Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati. The <lb/>
chief town of Ohio, Cincinnati was then regarded <lb/>
as the capital city in the West. The two sisters, <lb/>
Catherine and Harriet, established a female <lb/>
college at Cincinnati, and as the city adjoined the <lb/>
slave-state of Kentucky, Harriet witnessed much <lb/>
of the practical workings of the institution of <lb/>
slavery, and became acquainted with many of the <lb/>
scenes and incidents which she subsequently so <lb/>
vividly described in her anti-slavery writings. For <lb/>
the next eighteen years of her life, this was Mrs. <lb/>
Stowe's field of labour. It was a great wrench for <lb/>
this New England family to sever the ties of a <lb/>
lifetime, and go out into the far distant West, but <lb/>
it was clearly borne in upon Dr. Beecher as his <lb/>
duty. The sisters were much engaged, what with <lb/>
their home and social duties, and their school, <lb/>
which was known as the Western Female Institute. <lb/>
Yet times of severe depression would return for <lb/>
Harriet, and it is not a little strange to find a <lb/>
young woman of twenty-two thus writing to a <lb/>
friend: "Recently I have been reading the life of <lb/>
Madame de Sta&euml;l, and 'Corinne.' I have felt <lb/>
an intense sympathy with many parts of that <lb/>
book and with many parts of her character. But <lb/>
in America, feelings vehement and absorbing like <lb/>
hers, become still more deep, morbid, and <reg orig="im-|passioned">impassioned</reg> <lb/>
by the constant habits of <reg orig="self-govern-|ment">self-government</reg> <lb/>
which the rigid forms of our society demand. <lb/>
They are repressed, and they burn inward till <lb/>
they burn the very soul, leaving only dust and <lb/>
ashes. It seems to me, the intensity with which <lb/>
<pb n="154" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0157"/>
my mind has thought and felt on every subject <lb/>
presented to it, has had this effect. It has <lb/>
withered and exhausted it, and though young, I <lb/>
have no sympathy with the feelings of youth. All <lb/>
that is enthusiastic, all that is impassioned in <lb/>
admiration of nature, of writing, of character, in <lb/>
devotional thought and emotion, or in the emotions <lb/>
of affection, I have felt with vehement and <reg orig="absorb-|ing">absorbing</reg> <lb/>
intensity&mdash;felt till my mind is exhausted, and <lb/>
seems to be sinking into deadness. Half of my <lb/>
time I am glad to remain in a listless vacancy, to <lb/>
busy myself with trifles, since thought is pain, and <lb/>
emotion is pain."</p>
<p>But she roused herself from her lethargy, and in <lb/>
1834 took a prize of fifty dollars offered by the <lb/>
editor of the <hi rend="italic">Western Monthly</hi> for the best short <lb/>
story. She also became a prominent member of <lb/>
a little society known as the Semi-Colon Club, <lb/>
which originated thus: In Spanish, Columbus is <lb/>
called "Colon," and as he who discovers a new <lb/>
pleasure is certainly half as great as he who <reg orig="dis-|covers">discovers</reg> <lb/>
a new continent, this consideration gave <lb/>
rise to the name of the Semi-Colons. Some of <lb/>
the original members of the club afterwards <lb/>
became well known in public and literary circles. <lb/>
Before the society Harriet Beecher read <reg orig="communi-|cations">communications</reg> <lb/>
purporting to come from Bishop Butler, <lb/>
Dr. Johnson, etc., as well as a clever piece of satire <lb/>
on members who would persist in joking on such <lb/>
worn-out subjects as matrimony and old-maidism <lb/>
and old-bachelorism.</p>
<p>In 1833, Mrs. Stowe first had the subject of <lb/>
slavery brought to her personal notice by taking <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0158"/>
a trip across the river from Cincinnati into <reg orig="Ken-|tucky">Kentucky</reg>, <lb/>
in company with Miss Dutton, one of the <lb/>
associate teachers in the Western Institute. They <lb/>
visited an estate that afterwards figured as that <lb/>
of Colonel Shelby, in "Uncle Tom's Cabin," and <lb/>
here the young authoress first came into personal <lb/>
contact with the negro slaves of the south. In <lb/>
speaking many years afterwards of this visit, Miss <lb/>
Dutton said: "Harriet did not seem to notice <lb/>
anything in particular that happened, but sat <lb/>
much of the time as though abstracted in thought. <lb/>
When the negroes did funny things and cut up <lb/>
capers, she did not seem to pay the slightest <lb/>
attention to them. Afterwards, however, in <reg orig="read-|ing">reading</reg> <lb/>
'Uncle Tom,' I recognized scene after scene <lb/>
of that visit portrayed with the most minute <lb/>
fidelity, and knew at once where the material for <lb/>
that portion of the story had been gathered."</p>
<p>But education even more than slavery engrossed <lb/>
her thoughts at this time, and she formulated <lb/>
plans for model schools in the West&mdash;primary <lb/>
schools for boys and girls, and more advanced <lb/>
schools for older girls, the work of tuition to be <lb/>
committed to female teachers. In the government <lb/>
and training of boys, she relied rather on the <lb/>
moral influences wielded by woman than on <lb/>
masculine oversight and discipline. In the summer <lb/>
of 1834, she was present at the graduation of her <lb/>
favourite brother, Henry Ward Beecher, at Amherst <lb/>
College, Massachusetts. On this occasion she <lb/>
visited Niagara, and recorded in poetic language <lb/>
the solemn and sublime thoughts with which this <lb/>
wondrous marvel of Nature inspired her. In the <lb/>
<pb n="156" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0159"/>
year 1836, Harriet Beecher married the Rev. <lb/>
Calvin E. Stowe, theological professor in Lane <lb/>
Seminary. His first wife, a daughter of Dr. <lb/>
Bennett Tyler, had been for years Harriet's most <lb/>
intimate friend, and her sympathy for the childless <lb/>
widower soon ripened into love. Their marriage <lb/>
was in all respects a very happy one. Six months <lb/>
after their union, Professor Stowe was sent to <lb/>
Europe by the Ohio State Legislature, for the <lb/>
purpose of investigating and reporting upon the <lb/>
common school systems of Europe, and especially <lb/>
those of Prussia. During his absence, Mrs. Stowe <lb/>
kept a daily journal, and she also wrote short <lb/>
stories, articles, and essays in various periodicals.</p>
<p>Pro-slavery riots broke out in Cincinnati, where <lb/>
the abolition movement had already begun to <lb/>
make rapid progress. The offices of the chief <lb/>
abolitionist paper were completely wrecked, and <lb/>
the plant destroyed. Other outrages also were <lb/>
committed; but these acts led to a wholesale <lb/>
change in the public sentiment, which at first <lb/>
seemed inclined to condone these excesses. <reg orig="Mean-|while">Meanwhile</reg>, <lb/>
amid many vicissitudes, there was deep <lb/>
domestic happiness in the Stowe family as children <lb/>
were born to them, and the proud wife and mother <lb/>
wrote to an intimate friend: "I think myself a <lb/>
fortunate woman both in husband and children. <lb/>
My children I would not change for all the ease, <lb/>
leisure, and pleasure that I could have without <lb/>
them. They are money on interest, whose value <lb/>
will be constantly increasing."</p>
<p>The question of slavery was already beginning <lb/>
to be a living one to the Stowes. In 1839, Mrs. <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0160"/>
Stowe received into her family as a servant a <lb/>
coloured girl from Kentucky. By the laws of <lb/>
Ohio, she was free, having been brought into the <lb/>
State, and left there, by her mistress. In spite <lb/>
of this, Professor Stowe received an intimation, <lb/>
after she had lived with them some months, that <lb/>
the girl's master was in the city looking for her, <lb/>
and that if she were not careful she would be <lb/>
seized and conveyed back into slavery. Finding <lb/>
that this could be accomplished with boldness, <lb/>
perjury, and the connivance of some unscrupulous <lb/>
justice, Professor Stowe determined to remove the <lb/>
girl to some place of security where she might <lb/>
remain until the search for her should be given up. <lb/>
Accordingly, he and his brother-in-law, Henry <lb/>
Ward Beecher, both armed, drove the fugitive, in <lb/>
a covered waggon at night, by unfrequented roads, <lb/>
twelve miles back into the country, and left her <lb/>
in safety with the family of old John Van Zandt, <lb/>
the fugitive's friend. It is from this incident of <lb/>
real life and personal experience that Mrs. Stowe <lb/>
conceived the thrilling episode of the fugitive's <lb/>
escape from Tom Loker and Marks in "Uncle <lb/>
Tom's Cabin."</p>
<p>In May, 1840, Mrs. Stowe's fourth child and <lb/>
second son was born, and he was named Frederick <lb/>
William, after the Prussian king, for whom <reg orig="Pro-|fessor">Professor</reg> <lb/>
Stowe cherished an unbounded admiration. <lb/>
Mrs. Stowe fell ill at this time, and suffered from <lb/>
a severe neuralgic complaint which settled in the <lb/>
eyes. Then, in the winter of 1842, typhoid fever <lb/>
broke out in the Seminary, the house of the <lb/>
President being converted into a hospital. In <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0161"/>
July, 1843&mdash;shortly before the birth of her third <lb/>
daughter, Georgiana May&mdash;a still more terrible <lb/>
trial befell Mrs. Stowe by the death of her brother, <lb/>
the Rev. George Beecher, who accidentally shot <lb/>
himself in his own orchard. Ill health and <lb/>
pecuniary troubles followed, Professor Stowe being <lb/>
barely able to collect half his accustomed salary. <lb/>
Mrs. Stowe found the strain of her increasing <lb/>
family very great indeed&mdash;in fact, her whole <lb/>
situation was excessively painful and harassing, <lb/>
while her husband was frequently called away on <lb/>
ministerial and educational duties. As she began <lb/>
seriously to fail in health, funds were provided, <lb/>
and she spent the summer of 1845 in Hartford, <lb/>
Natick, and Boston. Still, her debility increased, <lb/>
and there was no salutary change until she had <lb/>
undergone the water cure at Brattleboro', <reg orig="Ver-|mont">Vermont</reg>. <lb/>
The anxious mother wrote at this juncture: <lb/>
"Money is as plentiful with God now as it has <lb/>
always been, and if He sees it is really best, He <lb/>
will doubtless help me." Strange to say, without <lb/>
any prompting, liberal cheques came in from <lb/>
friends one after another.</p>
<p>After a long exile, Mrs. Stowe returned to her <lb/>
Cincinnati home in the spring of 1847, only to <lb/>
find her husband's health seriously impaired by <lb/>
his many anxieties. He was himself now obliged <lb/>
to visit the establishment at Brattleboro', and to <lb/>
remain there from June, 1848, until September, <lb/>
1849. "During this period, Mrs. Stowe remained <lb/>
in Cincinnati, caring for her six children, eking <lb/>
out her slender income by taking boarders, and <lb/>
writing, when she found time, confronting a <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0162"/>
terrible epidemic of cholera, that carried off one <lb/>
of her little flock, and in every way showing <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
to be a brave woman, possessed of a spirit <lb/>
that could rise superior to all adversity." People <lb/>
perished by hundreds during this cholera <reg orig="visita-|tion">visitation</reg>, <lb/>
and in the city of Cincinnati, as in the land of <lb/>
Egypt, there was scarcely a house without its dead.</p>
<p>When Professor Stowe returned from <reg orig="Brattle-|boro">Brattleboro</reg>', <lb/>
in September, 1849, he was offered the <lb/>
Collins Professorship of Natural and Revealed <lb/>
Religion at Bowdoin College, in Brunswick, Maine, <lb/>
and this post he accepted. The worst of the <lb/>
troubles, personal and pecuniary, were now over, <lb/>
and the family removed to Brunswick early in <lb/>
1850. As Bowdoin was the college from which <lb/>
Mr. Stowe graduated, and in which he had spent <lb/>
some of the happiest years of his life, the <reg orig="appoint-|ment">appointment</reg> <lb/>
was an especially gratifying one to him. As <lb/>
one result of her closing experiences at Cincinnati <lb/>
during a trying period, Mrs. Stowe wrote a little <lb/>
tract, which has brought comfort to thousands of <lb/>
other sufferers since, "Earthly Care a Heavenly <lb/>
Discipline." She had already published, about a <lb/>
year before, her first important work, "The <reg orig="May-|flower">Mayflower</reg>," <lb/>
which consisted of a series of sketches of <lb/>
the descendants of the New England Pilgrims.</p>
<p>The year 1850 marked an epoch in the history <lb/>
of slavery. In that year, the Fugitive Slave Act <lb/>
was passed, and the great orator, Daniel Webster, <lb/>
stultified his glorious past by voting for it, as a <lb/>
means of pacifying the South. The abolitionists of <lb/>
the North were filled with indignation, which found <lb/>
vent in Whittier's poem, "Ichabod." Soon after <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0163"/>
the Act became law, Mrs. Stowe received many <lb/>
letters in Brunswick, describing heart-rending <lb/>
scenes, which were the inevitable outcome of this <lb/>
legislation. Even Boston, the supposed home of <lb/>
freedom, opened its gates to allow slave-hunters <lb/>
to pounce upon those who had once been their <lb/>
victims. Indescribable sorrow and suffering ensued <lb/>
for the poor slaves, who had been rejoicing in their <lb/>
freedom. In a letter, written by Mrs. Edward <lb/>
Beecher to Mrs. Stowe, the former said, "If I could <lb/>
use a pen as you can, I would write something <lb/>
that would make this whole nation feel what an <lb/>
accursed thing slavery is." Mrs. Stowe, whose <lb/>
soul was moved to its depths by the slavery <lb/>
horrors, resolved that, if possible, she would <reg orig="pro-|duce">produce</reg> <lb/>
such a work, and "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was <lb/>
the result.</p>
<p>In the month of February, 1851, she was seated <lb/>
at Communion service in the college church at <lb/>
Brunswick, when there passed suddenly through her <lb/>
mind, like the unrolling of a picture, the scene of <lb/>
the death of Uncle Tom. She was so affected <lb/>
that she could scarcely refrain from weeping <lb/>
aloud. On returning home, she wrote out the <lb/>
vision which had swept over her like the rushing <lb/>
of a mighty wind; and when the description was <lb/>
read over to her children, one of them exclaimed <lb/>
"Oh, mamma! slavery is the most cruel thing in <lb/>
the world!" With her babes around her, the <lb/>
sensitive mother felt keenly the anguish of those <lb/>
slave parents whose children were ruthlessly torn <lb/>
from them.</p>
<p>Frederick Douglass, the famous negro orator, <lb/>
<pb n="161" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0164"/>
complained in his journal, the <hi rend="italic">North Star</hi>, that the <lb/>
American Church was pro-slavery, and the buttress <lb/>
of the hateful system. In a remarkable letter to <lb/>
Douglass, Mrs. Stowe sorrowfully admitted that <lb/>
in the sense that the Church had the power to put <lb/>
an end to the evil and did not do it, it was <reg orig="pro-|slavery">pro-slavery</reg>; <lb/>
but, on the other hand, a majority of all <lb/>
the abolitionists to be found in the country were <lb/>
in the Church, and those the most influential and <lb/>
efficient. Then, eloquently and prophetically, she <lb/>
went on to say&mdash;</p>
<p>"I am a minister's daughter, and a minister's <lb/>
wife, and I have had six brothers in the ministry <lb/>
&lpar;one is in heaven&rpar;, and I certainly ought to know <lb/>
something of the feelings of ministers on this <lb/>
subject. I was a child in 1820, when the Missouri <lb/>
question was agitated, and one of the strongest <lb/>
and deepest impressions on my mind was that <lb/>
made by my father's sermons and prayers, and the <lb/>
anguish of his soul for the poor slave at that time. <lb/>
I remember his preaching drawing tears down the <lb/>
hardest faces of the old farmers in his congregation.</p>
<p>"I well remember his prayers, morning and <lb/>
evening, in the family, for 'poor, oppressed, <reg orig="bleed-|ing">bleeding</reg> <lb/>
Africa,' that the time of her deliverance might <lb/>
come; prayers offered with strong crying and tears, <lb/>
and which indelibly impressed my heart, and made <lb/>
me what I am from my very soul, the enemy of <lb/>
all slavery. Every brother I have has been in his <lb/>
sphere a leading anti-slavery man. One of them <lb/>
was to the last the bosom friend and counsellor of <lb/>
Lovejoy. As for myself and husband, we have for <lb/>
the last seventeen years lived on the border of a <lb/>
<pb n="162" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0165"/>
slave State, and we have never shrank from the <lb/>
fugitives, and we have helped them with all we <lb/>
had to give. I have received the children of <lb/>
liberated slaves into a family school, and taught <lb/>
them with my own children; and it has been the <lb/>
influence that we found in the Church and by the <lb/>
altar that has made us do all this. Gather up all <lb/>
the sermons that have been published on this <lb/>
offensive and unchristian Fugitive Slave Law, and <lb/>
you will find that those against it are numerically <lb/>
more than those in its favour; and yet some of <lb/>
the strongest opponents have not published their <lb/>
sermons. Out of thirteen ministers who meet with <lb/>
my husband weekly for discussion of moral <reg orig="sub-|jects">subjects</reg>, <lb/>
only three are found who will acknowledge <lb/>
or obey this law in any shape.</p>
<p>"After all, my brother, the strength and hope of <lb/>
your oppressed race does lie in the Church&mdash;in <lb/>
hearts united to Him, of whom it is said, 'He <lb/>
shall spare the souls of the needy, and precious <lb/>
shall their blood be in His sight.' Everything is <lb/>
against you, but Jesus Christ is for you, and He has <lb/>
not forgotten His Church, misguided and erring <lb/>
though it be. I have looked all the field over with <lb/>
despairing eyes; I see no hope but in Him. This <lb/>
movement must and will become a purely <reg orig="re-|ligious">religious</reg> <lb/>
one. The light will spread in Churches, <lb/>
the tone of feeling will rise. Christians North and <lb/>
South will give up all connection with, and take up <lb/>
their testimony against, slavery, and thus the work <lb/>
will be done."</p>
<p>But Mrs. Stowe was not content with this. She <lb/>
went on to write that book from the heart which <lb/>
<pb n="163" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0166"/>
eventually thrilled the world. Some years after <lb/>
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" appeared, Mrs. Stowe <lb/>
wrote:&mdash;"This story is to show how Jesus Christ, <lb/>
who liveth and was dead, and is now alive and <lb/>
for evermore, has still a brother's love for the poor <lb/>
and lowly, and that no man can sink so low but <lb/>
that Jesus Christ will stoop to take his hand. <lb/>
Who so low, who so poor, who so despised as the <lb/>
American slave? The law almost denies his <lb/>
existence as a person, and regards him for the <lb/>
most part as less than a man&mdash;a mere thing, the <lb/>
property of another. The law forbids him to read <lb/>
or write, to hold property, to make a contract, or <lb/>
even to form a legal marriage. It takes from him <lb/>
all legal right to the wife of his bosom, the children <lb/>
of his body. He can do nothing, possess nothing, <lb/>
acquire nothing but what must belong to his <lb/>
master. Yet, even to this slave, Jesus Christ <lb/>
stoops, from where He sits at the right hand of <lb/>
the Father, and says, 'Fear not, thou whom man <lb/>
despiseth, for I am thy brother. Fear not, for I <lb/>
have redeemed thee; I have called thee by thy <lb/>
name, thou art mine.'"</p>
<p>"'Uncle Tom's Cabin,'" remarks Mrs. Stowe's <lb/>
biographer, "is a work of religion; the <reg orig="funda-|mental">fundamental</reg> <lb/>
principles of the gospel applied to the <lb/>
burning question of negro slavery. It sets forth <lb/>
those principles of the Declaration of Independence <lb/>
that made Jefferson, Hamilton, Washington, and <lb/>
Patrick Henry anti-slavery men &mdash; not in the <lb/>
language of the philosopher, but in a series of <lb/>
pictures. Mrs. Stowe spoke to the understanding <lb/>
and moral sense through the imagination.</p>
<pb n="164" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0167"/>
<p>"'Uncle Tom's Cabin' made the enforcement <lb/>
of the Fugitive Slave Law an impossibility. It <lb/>
aroused the public sentiment of the world by <lb/>
arousing in the concrete that which had been a <lb/>
mere series of abstract propositions. It was, as we <lb/>
have already said, an appeal to the imagination <lb/>
through a series of pictures. People are like <lb/>
children, and understand pictures better than <lb/>
words. Some one rushes into your dining-room <lb/>
while you are at breakfast, and cries out, 'Terrible <lb/>
railroad accident! forty killed and wounded! six <lb/>
were burned alive!'</p>
<p>"'Oh, shocking! dreadful!' you exclaim, and <lb/>
yet go quietly on with your rolls and coffee. But <lb/>
suppose you stood at that instant by the wreck, <lb/>
and saw the mangled dead, and heard the piercing <lb/>
shrieks of the wounded, you would be faint and <lb/>
dizzy with the intolerable spectacle.</p>
<p>"So 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' made the crack of <lb/>
the slave-driver's whip, and the cries of the tortured <lb/>
blacks, ring in every household in the land, till <lb/>
human hearts could endure it no longer."</p>
<p>In the city of Washington, the seat of <reg orig="govern-|ment">government</reg>, <lb/>
there was published an anti-slavery paper, <lb/>
called the <hi rend="italic">National Era</hi>. It had Dr. Gamaliel <lb/>
Bailey as editor, and John Greenleaf Whittier as <lb/>
corresponding editor, and its contributors included <lb/>
Mrs. Southworth, Alice and Ph&oelig;be Cary, Grace <lb/>
Greenwood, and others. Last in its prospectus <lb/>
for 1851 came the name of Mrs. Stowe. She <lb/>
began the publication of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" <lb/>
in the columns of the <hi rend="italic">National Era</hi> on June 5, <lb/>
1851, and it was announced to run for about three <lb/>
<pb n="165" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0168"/>
months only. But as the story grew upon the <lb/>
author, it could no more be controlled than the <lb/>
waters of the Mississippi, and it was not completed <lb/>
until April 1, 1852. Mrs. Stowe said repeatedly <lb/>
afterwards, "I could not control the story; it <lb/>
wrote itself;" and, again, "I the author of 'Uncle <lb/>
Tom's Cabin'? No, indeed. The Lord Himself <lb/>
wrote it, and I was but the humblest of <reg orig="instru-|ments">instruments</reg> <lb/>
in His hand. To Him alone should be <lb/>
given all the praise." Probably no work except <lb/>
the "Pilgrim's Progress" was ever written under <lb/>
such a white heat of conviction. Before the serial <lb/>
issue had been completed, a Boston publisher, Mr. <lb/>
John P. Jewett, made arrangements for its <reg orig="publi-|cation">publication</reg> <lb/>
in book form, giving the author a royalty <lb/>
upon all the sales. It is not the fact, as frequently <lb/>
stated, that after it had run its course in the <reg orig="news-|paper">newspaper</reg>, <lb/>
the author sought for a publisher long, and <lb/>
in vain. Still, it is equally true that no one for <lb/>
a moment contemplated the astounding results of <lb/>
the issue of the story in book form.</p>
<p>Just before the volume was issued, Mrs. Stowe <lb/>
was much troubled by the fact that slavery was <lb/>
pursuing its victims more relentlessly than ever <lb/>
into the free States, and that Canada was even <lb/>
threatened by them. To avert the possible <reg orig="con-|tingency">contingency</reg> <lb/>
of the closing of Canada as a haven of <lb/>
refuge for the oppressed, she wrote earnest letters <lb/>
to Prince Albert, to the Duke of Argyll, to the <lb/>
Earls of Carlisle and Shaftesbury, to Macaulay, <lb/>
Dickens, and others, whom she knew to be friendly <lb/>
to the cause of the slaves. With these letters were <lb/>
despatched early copies of her forthcoming story. <lb/>
<pb n="166" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0169"/>
On the day "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was published, <lb/>
three thousand copies were sold, a second edition <lb/>
was issued the following week, a third very shortly <lb/>
afterwards, and within a year no fewer than a <lb/>
hundred and twenty editions, or upwards of three <lb/>
hundred thousand copies, were sold in the United <lb/>
States alone. In an incredibly short space of <lb/>
time the poor professor's wife had become the <lb/>
most widely canvassed woman in the world, and <lb/>
in addition to her delight at the influence of the <lb/>
book&mdash;which had ever been her first thought&mdash;she <lb/>
and her family had conquered for ever in the long <lb/>
and weary struggle with poverty.</p>
<p>Whittier wrote respecting this "glorious work" <lb/>
to Garrison, and even thanked the Fugitive Slave <lb/>
Law for drawing it forth. Longfellow spoke of it <lb/>
as "one of the greatest triumphs recorded in <lb/>
literary history," to say nothing of the higher <lb/>
triumph of its moral effect. Seward pronounced <lb/>
it the greatest book of the times; and T. <reg orig="Went-|worth">Wentworth</reg> <lb/>
Higginson wrote: "To have written at once <lb/>
the most powerful of contemporary fiction and <lb/>
the most efficient of anti-slavery tracts is a double <lb/>
triumph in literature and philanthropy, to which <lb/>
this country has heretofore seen no parallel." <lb/>
Letters from eminent Englishmen reached the <lb/>
author by every mail. Lord Carlisle wrote: "I <lb/>
return my deep and solemn thanks to Almighty <lb/>
God, who has led and enabled you to write such <lb/>
a book. I do feel, indeed, the most thorough <lb/>
assurance that in His good providence such a book <lb/>
cannot have been written in vain." Mrs. Stowe <lb/>
rejoiced that England was being moved, because <lb/>
<pb n="167" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0170"/>
she would be able to influence America, and even <lb/>
in the Northern States there was a terrible <reg orig="dead-|ness">deadness</reg> <lb/>
of moral sense on this question in clergymen <lb/>
and statesmen. The Earl of Shaftesbury wrote <lb/>
in a similar sense to Lord Carlisle, adding, "None <lb/>
but a Christian believer could have produced such <lb/>
a book as yours, which has absolutely startled the <lb/>
whole world, and impressed many thousands by <lb/>
revelations of cruelty and sin that give us an idea <lb/>
of what would be the uncontrolled dominion of <lb/>
Satan on this fallen earth."</p>
<p>In replying to Lord Shaftesbury, Mrs. Stowe <lb/>
spoke of the influence already wielded by the <lb/>
book at home and abroad, but also referred to <lb/>
the reaction of fear which had sprung up in the <lb/>
Southern States. As soon as it began to be seen <lb/>
that the work had a direct tendency to awaken <lb/>
conscience in the slave-holding States and lead to <lb/>
emancipation, both story and author were assailed <lb/>
with extraordinary bitterness. The book was as <lb/>
much under an interdict in some parts of the <lb/>
South as the Bible in Italy, and so revengeful were <lb/>
the feelings indulged towards Mrs. Stowe, that a <lb/>
lady cousin of hers in Georgia did not venture to <lb/>
let her name appear on the outside of her letters. <lb/>
Respectable religious journals also turned round, <lb/>
and began to attack the work as unchristian, <lb/>
heretical, etc. The truth was that it had found <lb/>
out the dishonouring plague spot of the land, and <lb/>
the truth was so painful as to be unendurable.</p>
<p>Many poor old coloured people appealed to the <lb/>
Beecher family to help them to redeem their <lb/>
children from bondage, and they did not appeal <lb/>
<pb n="168" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0171"/>
to them in vain. In one touching case an aged <lb/>
mother journeyed all the way to New York to <lb/>
beg funds to save herself and her children, and <lb/>
Mrs. Stowe promised to redeem them herself if <lb/>
she could get no assistance. But it is delightful <lb/>
to read that the first name which headed her <reg orig="sub-|scription-list">subscription-list</reg> <lb/>
was that of the noble-hearted Jenny <lb/>
Lind, who with her husband gave one hundred <lb/>
dollars. Others followed, and Mrs. Stowe held <lb/>
meetings in New Haven, Boston, and Portland, to <lb/>
further the object. She wrote to her husband, <lb/>
"When I see this Christ-like soul standing so <lb/>
patiently pleading, yet forgiving, I feel a sacred <lb/>
call to be the helper of the helpless, and it is <lb/>
better that my own family do without me for a <lb/>
while longer than that this mother should lose all. <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">I must redeem her</hi>." And she did. Jenny Lind, <lb/>
in writing to Mrs. Stowe, said: "You must feel <lb/>
and know what a deep impression 'Uncle Tom's <lb/>
Cabin' has made upon every heart that can feel <lb/>
for the dignity of human existence; so I with my <lb/>
miserable English would not even try to say a word <lb/>
about the great excellency of that most beautiful <lb/>
book, but I must thank you for the great joy I <lb/>
have felt over it. I have the feeling that great <lb/>
changes will take place by-and-by from the <reg orig="im-|pressions">impressions</reg> <lb/>
people receive out of it, and that the <lb/>
writer of that book can fall asleep to-day or <reg orig="to-|morrow">to-morrow</reg> <lb/>
with the bright, sweet consciousness of <lb/>
having been a strong means in the Creator's <lb/>
hand of operating essential good in one of the <lb/>
most important questions for the welfare of our <lb/>
black brethren. God bless and protect you and <lb/>
<pb n="169" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0172"/>
yours, dear madam, and certainly God's hand will <lb/>
remain with a blessing over your head."</p>
<p>In April, 1852, "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was first <lb/>
brought out in England, and edition after edition <lb/>
followed each other with great rapidity. From <lb/>
April to December, twelve different editions were <lb/>
published, and within the twelve months of its first <lb/>
appearance eighteen different London publishing <lb/>
houses were engaged in supplying the immense <lb/>
demand that had set in, the total number of editions <lb/>
being forty, the price varying from a fine <reg orig="art-|illustrated">art-illustrated</reg> <lb/>
edition at fifteen shillings to a popular <lb/>
edition at sixpence. The aggregate number of <lb/>
copies circulated in a short time in Great Britain <lb/>
and the Colonies exceeded one and a half millions. <lb/>
The library of the British Museum contains copies <lb/>
of about forty different editions in English. But <lb/>
while English editions were being issued with <lb/>
illustrations by Cruikshank, introductions by Elihu <lb/>
Burritt, Lord Carlisle, etc., the work was also <lb/>
making its way upon the Continent. For the French <lb/>
edition, translated by Madame Belloc, Mrs. Stowe <lb/>
wrote a stirring preface. Ultimately, the story <lb/>
was translated into the following twenty-two <lb/>
languages:&mdash;Arabic, Armenian, Bohemian, Chinese, <lb/>
Danish, Flemish, French, German, Hungarian, <lb/>
Illyrian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, <lb/>
Romaic or Modern Greek, Russian, Servian, <lb/>
Spanish, Wallachian, and Welsh. One <reg orig="distin-|guished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
German critic affirmed that in the whole <lb/>
modern romance literature of Germany, England, <lb/>
and France, there was no novel equal to this. It <lb/>
was absolutely real, and marvellously eloquent. <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0173"/>
Such different people as George Sand and Charles <lb/>
Kingsley were united in their warmth of <reg orig="admira-|tion">admiration</reg>. <lb/>
It is unquestionably the most famous novel <lb/>
that has ever been written in the United States.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stowe prepared an edition of the novel for <lb/>
the young, under the title of "A Peep into Uncle <lb/>
Tom's Cabin for Children." She also dramatized <lb/>
it for the stage, with the name of the <hi rend="italic">Christian <lb/>
Slave</hi>, and this and other dramatic renderings <lb/>
were repeatedly represented upon the stage with <lb/>
great success.</p>
<p>In April, 1853, Mrs. Stowe, accompanied by her <lb/>
husband and her brother, Charles Beecher, sailed <lb/>
from New York for Liverpool, for the purpose of <lb/>
making a tour through England and Europe. <lb/>
From the moment they arrived at Liverpool, Mrs. <lb/>
Stowe states that their hearts were tremulous and <lb/>
excited by the vibration of an atmosphere of <lb/>
universal sympathy and kindness. Glasgow was <lb/>
the first point in their tour, whither they had been <lb/>
invited by the anti-slavery society of that city. <lb/>
Calls, invitations, and deputations followed each <lb/>
other in rapid succession, but the visitors managed <lb/>
to see something of the beautiful Scottish scenery. <lb/>
Edinburgh, and its many attractions, succeeded. <lb/>
Here was presented the "National Penny <reg orig="Anti-|slavery">Antislavery</reg> <lb/>
Offering," which consisted of a thousand <lb/>
sovereigns on a magnificent silver salver. The <lb/>
money was all subscribed by the poorer classes. <lb/>
Aberdeen and Dundee were next visited, and then <lb/>
they went south, being received at Birmingham by <lb/>
the venerable Joseph Sturge. On reaching London, <lb/>
the next day, they were welcomed at Euston by the <lb/>
<pb n="171" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0174"/>
Rev. Thomas Binney and the Rev. James Sherman. <lb/>
They went to the Lord Mayor's dinner in the <lb/>
evening, and Lord Chief Baron Pollock&mdash;"a very <lb/>
dignified gentleman, dressed in black velvet, and <lb/>
with a fine head"&mdash;introduced himself to Mrs. <lb/>
Stowe, and told her that he had just been reading <lb/>
the legal portion of her new book, the "Key to <lb/>
Uncle Tom's Cabin," which had impressed him <lb/>
deeply. At the dinner, Mrs. Stowe sat opposite <lb/>
to Charles Dickens and Mr. Justice Talfourd, and <lb/>
afterwards she had some sympathetic conversation <lb/>
with the celebrated novelist.</p>
<p>During the next few days the visitors were <hi rend="italic">f&ecirc;ted</hi> <lb/>
everywhere, their hosts and hostesses including the <lb/>
Duke and Duchess of Argyll, the Duke and Duchess <lb/>
of Sutherland, the Earl of Carlisle, etc. Among <lb/>
others whom they met were Lord and Lady <lb/>
Hatherton, Sir Charles and Lady Trevelyan, Lord <lb/>
and Lady Blantyre, Mary Howitt, Arthur Helps, <lb/>
and Martin F. Tupper. They were astonished at <lb/>
the knowledge displayed of American authors, and <lb/>
Mrs. Stowe wrote home: "I felt at the moment <lb/>
that we never value our own literary men so much <lb/>
as when we are placed in a circle of intelligent <lb/>
foreigners."</p>
<p>On the 8th of May, a grand reception was <lb/>
given to Mrs. Stowe at Stafford House, the <lb/>
residence of the Duke of Sutherland. She thus <lb/>
described the function in one of her letters: "The <lb/>
Duchess received us with the same warm and <lb/>
simple kindness which she had shown before. We <lb/>
were presented to the Duke of Sutherland. He <lb/>
is a tall, slender man, with rather a thin face, <lb/>
<pb n="172" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0175"/>
light-brown hair, and a mild blue eye, with an <lb/>
air of gentleness and dignity.</p>
<p>"Among the first that entered were the members <lb/>
of the family, the Duke and Duchess of Argyll, <lb/>
Lord and Lady Blantyre, the Marquis and <reg orig="Mar-|chioness">Marchioness</reg> <lb/>
of Stafford, and Lady Emma Campbell. <lb/>
Then followed Lord Shaftesbury, with his beautiful <lb/>
lady, and her father and mother, Lord and Lady <lb/>
Palmerston. Lord Palmerston is of middle height, <lb/>
with a keen dark eye and black hair streaked with <lb/>
grey. There is something peculiarly alert and <lb/>
vivacious about all his movements; in short, his <lb/>
appearance perfectly answers to what we know of <lb/>
him from his public life. One has a strange, <lb/>
mythological feeling about the existence of people <lb/>
of whom one hears for many years without ever <lb/>
seeing them. While talking with Lord Palmerston, <lb/>
I could but remember how often I had heard father <lb/>
and Mr. S. exulting over his foreign despatches by <lb/>
our own fireside. There were present, also, Lord <lb/>
John Russell, Mr. Gladstone, and Lord Granville. <lb/>
The latter we all thought very strikingly resembled <lb/>
in his appearance the poet Longfellow.</p>
<p>"After lunch, the whole party ascended to the <lb/>
picture-gallery, passing on our way the grand <reg orig="stair-|case">staircase</reg> <lb/>
and hall, said to be the most magnificent in <lb/>
Europe. The company now began to assemble <lb/>
and throng the gallery, and very soon the vast <lb/>
room was crowded. Among the throng I <reg orig="re-|member">remember</reg> <lb/>
many presentations, but, of course, must <lb/>
have forgotten many more. Archbishop Whately <lb/>
was there, with Mrs. and Miss Whately; Macaulay, <lb/>
with two of his sisters; Milman, the poet and <lb/>
<pb n="173" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0176"/>
historian; the Bishop of Oxford, Chevalier Bunsen <lb/>
and lady, and many more.</p>
<p>"When all the company were together, Lord <lb/>
Shaftesbury read a very short, kind, and considerate <lb/>
address in behalf of the ladies of England, <reg orig="expres-|sive">expressive</reg> <lb/>
of their cordial welcome.</p>
<p>"This Stafford House meeting, in any view of it, <lb/>
is a most remarkable fact. Kind and gratifying as <lb/>
its arrangements have been to me, I am far from <lb/>
appropriating it to myself individually as a personal <lb/>
honour. I rather regard it as the most public <lb/>
expression possible of the feelings of the women <lb/>
of England on one of the most important questions <lb/>
of our day: that of individual liberty considered in <lb/>
its religious bearings."</p>
<p>A superb gold bracelet, formed as a slave's <lb/>
shackle, and presented by the Duchess to Mrs. <lb/>
Stowe, bore the inscription, "We trust it is a <lb/>
memorial of a chain that is soon to be broken." <lb/>
On two of the links were inscribed the dates of the <lb/>
abolition of the slave-trade and of slavery in <reg orig="Eng-|ish">Engish</reg> <lb/>
territory; and years after the presentation <lb/>
Mrs. Stowe was able to have engraved on the clasp <lb/>
of the bracelet: "Constitutional amendment for <lb/>
ever abolishing slavery in the United States."</p>
<p>A breakfast at Sir Charles Trevelyan's gave <lb/>
Mrs. Stowe especial pleasure, though she was <lb/>
somewhat embarrassed at sitting between two <lb/>
such brilliant talkers as Macaulay and Dean <reg orig="Mil-|man">Milman</reg>, <lb/>
both of whom she wished to hear at the same <lb/>
time. Hallam the historian, and other celebrities, <lb/>
were also present. On May 18 she and her friends <lb/>
went over Windsor, and on the succeeding day <lb/>
<pb n="174" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0177"/>
drove out to see Kossuth, in an obscure lodging on <lb/>
the outskirts of London. "I would that some of <lb/>
the editors in America," she remarked, "who have <lb/>
thrown out insinuations about his living in luxury, <lb/>
could have seen the utter bareness and plainness <lb/>
of the reception-room, which had nothing in it <lb/>
beyond the simplest necessaries. He entered into <lb/>
conversation with us with cheerfulness, speaking <lb/>
English well, though with the idioms of foreign <lb/>
languages. When we parted, he took my hand <lb/>
kindly, and said, 'God bless you, my child!'" <lb/>
Another affectionate meeting with the Duchess of <lb/>
Sutherland is recorded; then a visit with Lord <lb/>
Shaftesbury,to St. Paul's, to see the charity children, <lb/>
with luncheon at Dean Milman's afterwards; next <lb/>
a meeting at the house of a friend with Lady <lb/>
Byron, by whom she was deeply impressed; and <lb/>
finally a presentation of an inkstand to Mrs. Stowe <lb/>
by the ladies of Surrey Chapel, and a gold pen by <lb/>
a band of beautiful children. The inkstand was <lb/>
an elaborate specimen of silver-work eighteen <lb/>
inches long, with a group of silver figures on it <lb/>
representing Religion, with the Bible in her hand, <lb/>
giving liberty to the slave.</p>
<p>On June 4, Mrs. Stowe and her friends arrived <lb/>
in Paris, where they remained for nearly three <lb/>
weeks, and then passed on to Chalons, Lyons, and <lb/>
Geneva. A tour of the Swiss Alps was made, and <lb/>
the party then crossed the Wengern Alps to <lb/>
Grindelwald. They returned through Germany, <lb/>
Belgium, and Holland, to Paris. London was <lb/>
once more reached on August 28, and after visits <lb/>
to York and Leeds, the visitors left Liverpool in <lb/>
<pb n="175" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0178"/>
the <hi rend="italic">Arctic</hi>, on September 7. "Thus," writes Mrs. <lb/>
Stowe, "almost sadly as a child might leave its <lb/>
home, I left the shores of kind, strong Old <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg>, <lb/>
the mother of us all."</p>
<p>As soon as she reached the United States, she <lb/>
threw herself heart and soul into the struggle <lb/>
against slavery, not neglecting literature <reg orig="mean-|while">meanwhile</reg>. <lb/>
Early in 1854 she issued her volume, <lb/>
"Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands," being a <lb/>
collection of delightful letters describing her tour <lb/>
in Europe, with sketches of the celebrated people <lb/>
whom she had met. Then she wrote an open <lb/>
letter to the Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society of <reg orig="Glas-|gow">Glasgow</reg>, <lb/>
showing that the recent demonstrations in <lb/>
Great Britain had done much good to the cause in <lb/>
America. The support of the higher classes had <lb/>
been especially valuable, as it had been asserted <lb/>
they were opposed to the movement. The writer <lb/>
demonstrated the gratifying social, moral, and <lb/>
intellectual improvement which was being made <lb/>
by the coloured people of America. Then, in <lb/>
consequence of the perils to the cause which had <lb/>
arisen by the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, <lb/>
she wrote an impassioned appeal to the women of <lb/>
America to support the abolitionist party. She <lb/>
showed that while all the nations of Europe were <lb/>
moved to the heart on the subject of American <lb/>
slavery, thousands of Christian American women <lb/>
remained untouched.</p>
<p>In 1856 Mrs. Stowe published "Dred: a Tale of <lb/>
the Dismal Swamp." Had it not been preceded <lb/>
by "Uncle Tom," it would almost have been <lb/>
an epoch-making book, but everything on this <lb/>
<pb n="176" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0179"/>
subject must naturally pall after the appearance of <lb/>
its predecessor. The story was suggested by the <lb/>
negro insurrection led by Nat Turner in Eastern <lb/>
Virginia, in 1831. One of the principal participators <lb/>
in it was named Dred. The author stated that <lb/>
her object in this book is "to show the general effect <lb/>
of slavery on society; the various social <reg orig="disad-|vantages">disadvantages</reg> <lb/>
which it brings, even to its most favoured <lb/>
advocates; the shiftlessness and misery and <reg orig="back-|ward">backward</reg> <lb/>
tendency of all the economical arrangements <lb/>
of slave States; the retrograding of good families <lb/>
into poverty; the deterioration of land; the sure <lb/>
demoralization of all classes, from the aristocratic, <lb/>
tyrannical planter to the oppressed and poor white, <lb/>
which is the result of the introduction of slave <lb/>
labour.</p>
<p>"It is also an object to display the corruption of <lb/>
Christianity which arises from the same source; a <lb/>
corruption that has gradually lowered the standard <lb/>
of the Church, North and South, and been <reg orig="pro-|ductive">productive</reg> <lb/>
of more infidelity than the works of all the <lb/>
encyclop&aelig;dists put together."</p>
<p>In August, 1856, Mrs. Stowe made a second trip <lb/>
to Europe, accompanied by her husband, her two <lb/>
eldest daughters, her son Henry, and her sister <lb/>
Mrs. Perkins. On reaching London, arrangements <lb/>
were made for the English edition of "Dred," for <lb/>
which there was an enormous demand. Then, <lb/>
having received from the Duke and Duchess of <lb/>
Argyll a special invitation to Inveraray Castle, the <lb/>
party went north. From Glasgow, Professor Stowe <lb/>
wrote to a friend on August 29, "Yesterday we <lb/>
had just the very pleasantest little interview with <lb/>
<pb n="177" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0180"/>
the Queen that ever was. None of the formal, <lb/>
drawing-room, breathless receptions, but just an <lb/>
accidental, done-on-purpose meeting at a railway <lb/>
station, while on our way to Scotland. The Queen <lb/>
seemed really delighted to see my wife, and <reg orig="re-|markably">remarkably</reg> <lb/>
glad to see me for her sake. She pointed <lb/>
us out to Prince Albert, who made two most <lb/>
gracious bows to my wife and two to me, while <lb/>
the four Royal children stared their big blue eyes <lb/>
almost out looking at the authoress of 'Uncle <lb/>
Tom's Cabin.' Colonel Grey handed the Queen, <lb/>
with my wife's compliments, a copy of the new <lb/>
book, 'Dred.' She took one volume herself, and <lb/>
handed the other to Prince Albert, and they were <lb/>
soon both very busy reading. She is a real nice <lb/>
little body, with exceedingly pleasant, kindly <lb/>
manners." Mr. Stowe was obliged to return to <lb/>
America, but Mrs. Stowe and the others visited <lb/>
the Highlands. Nearly a week was spent at <lb/>
Inveraray Castle, and then they went by way of <lb/>
the Caledonian Canal and Inverness to Dunrobin <lb/>
Castle, the seat of the Duke of Sutherland. Here, <lb/>
as at Inveraray, they found "the most perfect <reg orig="com-|bination">combination</reg> <lb/>
of architectural and poetic romance, with <lb/>
home comfort." But Mrs. Stowe further said, "I <lb/>
do observe that, compared with any other part of <lb/>
the Highlands, Sutherland is a garden. I observe <lb/>
well-clothed people, thriving lands, healthy <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg>, <lb/>
fine school-houses, and all that." With the <lb/>
Duchess&mdash;who will be remembered as the attached <lb/>
friend of the Queen&mdash;she was enraptured. "She <lb/>
is, taking her all in all, one of the noblest-appointed <lb/>
women I ever saw; real, old, genuine English, such <lb/>
<pb n="178" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0181"/>
as one reads of in history; full of nobility, courage, <lb/>
tenderness, and zeal. It does me good to hear her <lb/>
read prayers daily, as she does, in the midst of her <lb/>
servants and guests, with a manner full of grand <lb/>
and noble feeling."</p>
<p>Going southward, Henry Stowe was obliged to <lb/>
leave England in October, to resume his studies at <lb/>
Dartmouth College, but Mrs. Stowe had again a <lb/>
pleasant time in London, seeing many famous <lb/>
Englishmen and Englishwomen. She also went <lb/>
on a visit to Charles Kingsley, who, like Arthur <lb/>
Helps and others, was full of the deepest anxiety <lb/>
over American affairs. Then the travellers crossed <lb/>
the Channel, and visited Paris, Genoa, Rome, <lb/>
Venice, and Naples. They made the ascent of <lb/>
Vesuvius, which Mrs. Stowe graphically described <lb/>
in her letters. Before leaving Europe, Mrs. Stowe <lb/>
established her daughters in a Protestant boarding <lb/>
school in Paris, and then returned to London, <lb/>
where she was highly gratified by receiving letters <lb/>
from Harriet Martineau and Prescott, the historian, <lb/>
extolling "Dred" as a far finer work in the literary <lb/>
sense than "Uncle Tom's Cabin." Queen Victoria <lb/>
likewise took the same view. Some of the leading <lb/>
English journals, however, severely attacked it; <lb/>
but notwithstanding their disparaging criticism, <lb/>
120,000 copies of the work were sold in England <lb/>
in a few weeks.</p>
<p>In July, 1857, not long after her return from <lb/>
England, a crushing sorrow fell upon Mrs. Stowe, <lb/>
through the drowning of her eldest son, Henry <lb/>
Ellis, while bathing in the Connecticut River at <lb/>
Hanover. The calamity seemed doubly severe, as <lb/>
<pb n="179" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0182"/>
she had not seen him since her arrival in America. <lb/>
The time for the summer vacation at Dartmouth <lb/>
College was at hand, and mother and son were <lb/>
eagerly looking forward to a joyful meeting. There <lb/>
had always been a peculiar union, and a singular <lb/>
tenderness between them, and now this sweet <lb/>
earthly tie was suddenly snapped. Writing to her <lb/>
friend the Duchess of Sutherland, Mrs. Stowe said <lb/>
she was thankful she had taken her son with her <lb/>
to Dunrobin, and that he returned from England <lb/>
full of high resolves and manly purposes. "I may <lb/>
not be what the world calls a Christian," he <lb/>
wrote, "but I will live such a life as a Christian <lb/>
ought to live, such a life as every true man ought <lb/>
to live." Alas! the battle was over for him sooner <lb/>
than he thought.</p>
<p>That Mrs. Stowe drew noble lessons of patience <lb/>
and resignation from her great grief, however, is <lb/>
apparent from this passage in her letter to the <lb/>
Duchess: "Dunrobin will always be dearer to <lb/>
me now, and I have felt towards you and the <lb/>
Duke a turning of spirit, because I remember <lb/>
how kindly you always looked on and spoke to <lb/>
him. I knew then it was the angel of your lost <lb/>
one that stirred your hearts with tenderness when <lb/>
you looked on another so near his age. The plaid <lb/>
that the Duke gave him, and which he valued as <lb/>
one of the chief of his boyish treasures, will hang in <lb/>
his room&mdash;for we still have a room that we call his.</p>
<p>"You will understand, you will feel this sorrow <lb/>
with us as few can. My poor husband is much <lb/>
prostrated. I need not say more; you know what <lb/>
this must be to a father's heart. But still I repeat <lb/>
<pb n="180" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0183"/>
what I said when I saw you last. Our dead are <lb/>
ministering angels; they teach us to love, they fill <lb/>
us with tenderness for all that can suffer. These <lb/>
weary hours, when sorrow makes us for the time <lb/>
blind and deaf and dumb, have their promise. <lb/>
These hours come in answer to our prayers for <lb/>
nearness to God. It is always our treasure that <lb/>
the lightning strikes. &hellip; I have poured out my <lb/>
heart to you because yon can understand. While <lb/>
I was visiting in Hanover, where Henry died, a <lb/>
poor, deaf old slave woman, who had still five <lb/>
children in bondage, came to comfort me. 'Bear <lb/>
up, dear soul,' she said; 'you must bear it, for the <lb/>
Lord loves ye.' She said further, 'Sunday is a <lb/>
heavy day to mo, 'cause I can't work, and can't <lb/>
hear preaching, and can't read, so I can't keep my <lb/>
mind off my poor children. Some on 'em the <lb/>
blessed Master's got, and they's safe; but oh, <lb/>
there are five that I don't know where they are.'"</p>
<p>Literary work was turned to with avidity in <lb/>
1858, when Mrs. Stowe began the publication of <lb/>
"The Minister's Wooing," in the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi>, <lb/>
and "The Pearl of Orr's Island" simultaneously <lb/>
in the <hi rend="italic">Independent</hi>. The former story was more <lb/>
profound in thought, the latter more delicate and <lb/>
poetic in style. Whittier said that when he was <lb/>
in the mood for thinking deeply, he read "The <lb/>
Minister's Wooing," but "The Pearl of Orr's <lb/>
Island" was his favourite, being, indeed, the most <lb/>
charming New England idyl ever written. Mr. <lb/>
Russell Lowell rejoiced that for the first time a <lb/>
full appreciation of Mrs. Stowe's remarkable genius <lb/>
might be discovered in "The Minister's Wooing," <lb/>
<pb n="181" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0184"/>
by those who thought she owed her position <reg orig="en-|tirely">entirely</reg> <lb/>
to her philanthropic anti-slavery novels; and <lb/>
Mr. Ruskin wrote to the effect that nothing could <lb/>
be nobler than the noble parts of this new work, <lb/>
nothing wiser than the wise parts of it, nothing <lb/>
more delightful than the delightful parts, and <lb/>
nothing more edged than the edged <reg orig="parts&mdash;Can-|dace's">parts&mdash;Candace's</reg> <lb/>
sayings and doings, to wit.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1859 Mrs. Stowe made her <lb/>
third and last visit to Europe, accompanied by all <lb/>
her family except her youngest son. At Rome <lb/>
she saw a good deal of the Brownings, with whom <lb/>
she formed a warm friendship, and afterwards <lb/>
maintained a correspondence. Mrs. Browning, <reg orig="re-|ferring">referring</reg> <lb/>
in 1861 to the crisis through which America <lb/>
was passing, wrote to Mrs. Stowe, "If the North is <lb/>
found noble enough to stand fast on the moral <lb/>
question, whatever the loss or diminution of <reg orig="terri-|tory">territory</reg>, <lb/>
God and just men will see you greater and <lb/>
more glorious as a nation." After Mrs. Stowe's <lb/>
return on the last occasion from Europe, began her <lb/>
friendship with Oliver Wendell Holmes, which grew <lb/>
warmer with years.</p>
<p>The American Civil War broke out in 1861, and <lb/>
Mrs. Stowe's son Frederick was one of the earliest <lb/>
to join the muster of the First Massachusetts <lb/>
Volunteers. He soon won his promotion as <reg orig="Lieu-|tenant">Lieutenant</reg> <lb/>
Stowe, by bravery on more than one <reg orig="hard-|fought">hard-fought</reg> <lb/>
field. At the battle of Gettysburg, being <lb/>
now captain, he was wounded in the head by a <lb/>
shell, but happily the wound did not prove fatal. <lb/>
In the year 1863 the Stowes removed to Hartford, <lb/>
Connecticut, to a house built by Mrs. Stowe on <lb/>
<pb n="182" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0185"/>
the bank of Park River. The new home, which <lb/>
became their permanent abode, was surrounded by <lb/>
beautiful and extensive groves. During the same <lb/>
year Mrs. Stowe published her Italian story, "Agnes <lb/>
of Sorrento," which was suggested to her on her <lb/>
last tour in Italy. But the most important event <lb/>
of the year was the publication in the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic <lb/>
Monthly</hi> of Mrs. Stowe's reply to "The Affectionate <lb/>
and Christian Address of many thousands of <lb/>
Women of Great Britain and Ireland to their <lb/>
Sisters, the Women of the United States of <lb/>
America." Among the signatories to the English <lb/>
address were the Duchesses of Bedford, <reg orig="Suther-|land">Sutherland</reg>, <lb/>
and Argyll; the Countesses Cowley, <reg orig="Gros-|venor">Grosvenor</reg>, <lb/>
Fortescue, Ducie, and Shaftesbury; Ladies <lb/>
Hatherton, Ruthven, Parke, Ebrington, Hill, and <lb/>
Palmerston; the wives of the Bishop of Jerusalem, <lb/>
Dean of St. Paul's, the Lord Mayor of London, Sir <lb/>
T. Fowell Buxton, Professor Owen, etc., etc. The <lb/>
address had been presented to Mrs. Stowe eight <lb/>
years before, accompanied by twenty-six folio <lb/>
volumes, containing considerably more than half <lb/>
a million signatures of British women, These <lb/>
signatures formed the most remarkable part of the <lb/>
address. Beginning at the very steps of the Throne, <lb/>
they went down to the names of women in the very <lb/>
humblest conditions of life, and represented all that <lb/>
was highest, wisest, and best in Great Britain. <lb/>
Names of wives of Cabinet Ministers appeared on <lb/>
the same page with the names of wives of humble <lb/>
labourers&mdash;names of duchesses and countesses, of <lb/>
wives of generals, ambassadors, savants, and men <lb/>
of letters, mingled with names traced in trembling <lb/>
<pb n="183" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0186"/>
characters by hands evidently unused to hold the <lb/>
pen, and stiffened by lowly toil.</p>
<p>A great crisis having now arisen on the slavery <lb/>
question in the United States, Mrs. Stowe indited <lb/>
an earnest and most powerful appeal to her sisters <lb/>
in Great Britain to stand true to the cause of the <lb/>
North and of human freedom. She first recited <lb/>
the history of the conflict down to the time of <lb/>
Abraham Lincoln's election as President, and the <lb/>
rise of the Southern Confederacy. Then she <lb/>
showed that the Republican administration had <lb/>
done all it possibly could to overthrow slavery by <lb/>
constitutional measures, its action culminating in <lb/>
a legislative enactment declaring slavery to be for <lb/>
ever excluded from the territories of the United <lb/>
States. Then she sketched the action of the <lb/>
Northern army in the field, and cited the great <lb/>
decisive measure of the war, the President's <reg orig="Procla-|mation">Proclamation</reg> <lb/>
of Emancipation. But the Southern States <lb/>
were making almost superhuman efforts to uphold <lb/>
slavery, resorting to the basest devices, and <reg orig="appeal-|ing">appealing</reg> <lb/>
for the support of England under false <reg orig="pre-|tences">pretences</reg>. <lb/>
Finally, Mrs. Stowe closed with this <lb/>
eloquent adjuration:&mdash;</p>
<p>"This very day the writer of this has been <lb/>
present at a solemn religious festival in the national <lb/>
capital, given at the house of a portion of those <lb/>
fugitive slaves who have fled to our lines for <reg orig="pro-|tection">protection</reg>, <lb/>
who, under the shadow of our flag, find <lb/>
sympathy and succour. The national day of <lb/>
thanksgiving was there kept by over a thousand <lb/>
redeemed slaves, and for whom Christian charity <lb/>
had spread an ample repast. Our sisters, we wish <lb/>
<pb n="184" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0187"/>
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> could have witnessed the scene! We wish <lb/>
you could have heard the prayer of a blind old <lb/>
negro, called among his fellows John the Baptist, <lb/>
when, in touching broken English, he poured forth <lb/>
his thanksgivings. We wish you could have heard <lb/>
the sound of that strange rhythmical chant which <lb/>
is now forbidden to be sung on Southern <reg orig="planta-|tions&mdash;the">plantations&mdash;the</reg> <lb/>
psalm of this modern exodus&mdash;which <lb/>
combines the barbaric fire of the Marseillaise with <lb/>
the religious fervour of the old Hebrew prophet&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'Oh, go down, Moses,</l>
<l>Way down into Egypt's land!</l>
<l>Tell King Pharaoh</l>
<l>To let my people go!</l>
<l>Stand away dere,</l>
<l>Stand away dere,</l>
<l>And let my people go!'</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>"As we were leaving, an aged woman came and <lb/>
lifted up her hands in blessing, 'Bressed be de <lb/>
Lord dat brought me to see dis first happy day <lb/>
of my life! Bressed be de Lord!' In all <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg> <lb/>
is there no Amen?</p>
<p>"We have been shocked and saddened by the <lb/>
question asked in an association of Congregational <lb/>
ministers in England, the very blood-relations of <lb/>
the liberty-loving Puritans, 'Why does not the <lb/>
North let the South go?'</p>
<p>"What! give up the point of emancipation for <lb/>
these four million slaves? Turn our backs on <lb/>
them, and leave them to their fate? What! leave <lb/>
our white brothers to run a career of oppression <lb/>
and robbery, that, as sure as there is a God that <lb/>
ruleth in the armies of heaven, will bring down a <lb/>
<pb n="185" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0188"/>
day of wrath and doom? Remember that <reg orig="wish-|ing">wishing</reg> <lb/>
success to this slavery-establishing effort is <lb/>
only wishing to the sons and daughters of the <lb/>
South all the curses that God has written against <lb/>
oppression. <hi rend="italic">Mark our words!</hi> If we succeed, <lb/>
the children of these very men who are now <reg orig="fight-|ing">fighting</reg> <lb/>
us will rise up to call us blessed. Just as <lb/>
surely as there is a God who governs in the world, <lb/>
so surely all the laws of national prosperity follow <lb/>
in the train of equity, and if we succeed, we shall <lb/>
have delivered the children's children of our <reg orig="mis-|guided">misguided</reg> <lb/>
brethren from the wages of sin, which is <lb/>
always and everywhere death.</p>
<p>"And now, sisters of England, think it not <lb/>
strange if we bring back the words of your letter, <lb/>
not in bitterness, but in deepest sadness, and lay <lb/>
them down at your feet. We say to you, 'Sisters, <lb/>
you have spoken well; we have heard you; we <lb/>
have heeded; we have striven in the cause, even <lb/>
unto death. We have sealed our devotion by <lb/>
desolate hearth and darkened homestead, by the <lb/>
blood of sons, husbands, and brothers. In many <lb/>
of our dwellings the very light of our lives has <lb/>
gone out, and yet we accept the life-long darkness <lb/>
as our own part in this great and awful expiation, <lb/>
by which the bonds of wickedness shall be loosed, <lb/>
and abiding peace established upon the foundation <lb/>
of righteousness.' Sisters, what have <hi rend="italic">you</hi> done, and <lb/>
what do you mean to do?</p>
<p>"We appeal to you as sisters, as wives, and as <lb/>
mothers, to raise your voices to your fellow-citizens, <lb/>
and your prayers to God for the removal of this <lb/>
affliction and disgrace upon the Christian world."</p>
<pb n="186" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0189"/>
<p>Mrs. Stowe's "noble letter," as Mr. John Bright <lb/>
called it, had an immediate effect in England <lb/>
among those who had hitherto failed to understand <lb/>
the position of the North. In writing to Mrs. <lb/>
Stowe, Mr. Bright said, "Before this reaches you, <lb/>
you will have seen what large and earnest <reg orig="meet-|ings">meetings</reg> <lb/>
have been held in all our towns in favour of <lb/>
abolition and the North." Happily the fratricidal <lb/>
strife in the United States came to an end in 1865, <lb/>
and the cause of the union and of emancipation <lb/>
triumphed.</p>
<p>The war having closed, Mrs. Stowe desired to <lb/>
make a winter home for her family in the South. <lb/>
In this she had several objects in view; she wished <lb/>
to escape the severity of the Northern winters, to <lb/>
find a place where her afflicted son Roderick could <lb/>
enjoy outdoor life at all seasons, and she was also <lb/>
most anxious to do her share towards educating <lb/>
and leading to a higher life those coloured people <lb/>
whom she had helped so largely to set free. <lb/>
Florida was selected as the best field, and she <lb/>
bought a place at Mandarin. Mrs. Stowe had <lb/>
now joined the Episcopal Church, in which her <lb/>
daughters were already communicants, and with <lb/>
the aid of the Bishop of Florida she established a <lb/>
number of churches along the St. John's River. <lb/>
In 1869 Mrs. Stowe published her "Old Town <lb/>
Folks," a story of New England life; and during <lb/>
this and the next few years, while her husband <lb/>
preached in a little church on the Florida property, <lb/>
she conducted Sunday schools, sewing-classes, <lb/>
singing-classes, and various other gatherings for <lb/>
instruction and amusement, all of which were well <lb/>
<pb n="187" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0190"/>
attended and highly appreciated by both the <lb/>
white and coloured residents of the neighbourhood. <lb/>
In 1870 Mrs. Stowe published her volume entitled, <lb/>
"Lady Byron Vindicated," the substance of which <lb/>
had appeared in <hi rend="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</hi> and the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi>. It was practically a reply to <lb/>
the "Recollections of Lord Byron," by the Countess <lb/>
Guiccioli, and it was understood to have been <lb/>
based on information supplied to Mrs. Stowe by <lb/>
her friend Lady Byron. Serious charges were <lb/>
made against Lord Byron, for which there does <lb/>
not appear to have been sufficient foundation, and <lb/>
even if the charges had been true, the publication <lb/>
of the work was a grievous mistake. No doubt, <lb/>
as she said, her friend, Lady Byron, had been most <lb/>
bitterly and unjustly assailed, and her work was <lb/>
intended in the first instance to vindicate her, and <lb/>
to show where the real blame lay as between Lord <lb/>
and Lady Byron; but even some of Mrs. Stowe's <lb/>
best friends regarded her action as unadvisable, <lb/>
and we can, therefore, well allow this one <reg orig="unfor-|tunate">unfortunate</reg> <lb/>
incident in an otherwise noble career to <lb/>
sink into oblivion.</p>
<p>Among Mrs. Stowe's most charming works in <lb/>
later life were, "The Chimney Corner," issued in <lb/>
1869; "My Wife and I," published in 1871; and <lb/>
"Palmetto Leaves," a series of Florida sketches, <lb/>
which appeared in 1873. Then she wrote "Poganuc <lb/>
People," her last undertaking of any length in <lb/>
volume form. It consisted of a series of delightful <lb/>
reminiscences of New England life, as it appeared <lb/>
at the time of her youth, and for some years <reg orig="pre-|ceding">preceding</reg>. <lb/>
These recollections of a bygone era were <lb/>
<pb n="188" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0191"/>
warmly welcomed for their evident truthfulness, <lb/>
both of character and scenery. Professor Stowe <lb/>
was the original of "Harry, the Visionary boy," <lb/>
in "Oldtown Folks." His spirit lore was very <lb/>
great, and his wife gave form to many of his <lb/>
spiritual visions. Among English friends with <lb/>
whom Mrs. Stowe conducted a lengthy and <reg orig="sympa-|thetic">sympathetic</reg> <lb/>
correspondence was George Eliot. Although <lb/>
their mental characteristics were very diverse, <lb/>
there must have been some strong affinity of <lb/>
feeling somewhere, and it comes out ever and <lb/>
again, in the letters of the eminent English novelist. <lb/>
George Eliot deeply rejoiced in the humanitarian <lb/>
work which her friend was able to accomplish, <lb/>
and of which "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was the <reg orig="pre-|cursor">precursor</reg>.</p>
<p>Of literary works by Mrs. Stowe beyond those <lb/>
already mentioned we may cite, "We and Our <lb/>
Neighbours," which appeared in 1875; "Betty's <lb/>
Bright Idea," 1876; "Footsteps of the Master," <lb/>
1877; "Bible Heroines," 1878; and "A Dog's <lb/>
Mission," 1881. In earlier stages of her literary life <lb/>
she had prepared "An Elementary Geography," <lb/>
and had also written "Our Charley," "House and <lb/>
Home Papers," "Little Foxes," "Religious Poems," <lb/>
"Queer Little People," "Men of our Times," "Little <lb/>
Pussy Willow," and "Pink and White Tyranny." <lb/>
In 1872 she carried through a successful campaign <lb/>
for the American Literary &lpar;Lecture&rpar; Bureau of <lb/>
Boston, when she delivered a course of forty <lb/>
readings from her own works in the principal cities <lb/>
of the New England States. In the following <lb/>
year, she made another reading tour in the West, <lb/>
<pb n="189" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0192"/>
but she would never undertake a third, although <lb/>
she frequently read on behalf of charitable objects.</p>
<p>The seventieth anniversary of her birthday was <lb/>
celebrated by a garden party held on June 14, <lb/>
1882, at the Old Elms, the home of Ex-Governor <lb/>
Chaplin in one of the most beautiful suburbs of <lb/>
Boston. Two hundred of the most distinguished <lb/>
literary men and women of the day assembled in <lb/>
honour of the occasion. Mr. H. O. Houghton, the <lb/>
well-known publisher, was host, and the speakers <lb/>
included Henry Ward Beecher, Oliver Wendell <lb/>
Holmes, and Judge Albion W. Tourgee. Poems <lb/>
were read by J. G. Whittier, O. W. Holmes, A. D. <lb/>
T. Whitney, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, and others, <lb/>
and Mrs. Stowe made a brief but touching reply. <lb/>
The celebration of her eightieth birthday was <lb/>
also observed in 1892, but Mrs. Stowe was now <lb/>
in infirm health.</p>
<p>Professor Stowe died in 1886, but Mrs. Stowe <lb/>
still survives, having attained the venerable age of <lb/>
eighty-two years. Whenever the time arrives for <lb/>
her to cross the narrow river which divides time <lb/>
from eternity, she will pass from earth with the <lb/>
consciousness that she did all in her power to <lb/>
lighten and remove one of the greatest evils which <lb/>
ever afflicted the human race. A true <reg orig="philanthro-|pist">philanthropist</reg> <lb/>
in life as well as in written speech, she became <lb/>
a strong tower and a bulwark for the down-trodden <lb/>
and the oppressed, while her literary genius has <lb/>
given her a high and honourable place among the <lb/>
native writers of the New World.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Dorothy Wyndlow Pattison</hi>, known to all <lb/>
generations to come as Sister Dora, was one of <lb/>
the voluntary Christian martyrs of the nineteenth <lb/>
century. Her enthusiasm for humanity was first <lb/>
kindled by a lady whose career has already been <lb/>
sketched in this volume&mdash;Florence Nightingale&mdash; <lb/>
and though her work differed somewhat in kind, it <lb/>
was imbued by the same spirit of heroic devotion. <lb/>
No one ever exercised a greater influence upon <lb/>
those with whom she came into contact, and her <lb/>
life demonstrates the overwhelming influence which <lb/>
a noble example must ever wield as compared with <lb/>
that which follows the inculcation of the most <lb/>
perfect precepts.</p>
<p>Sister Dora was born at Hauxwell, near <reg orig="Rich-|mond">Richmond</reg>, <lb/>
in the North Riding of Yorkshire, on <lb/>
January 16, 1832. Her father was the Rev. Mark <lb/>
James Pattison, Rector of Hauxwell, who married <lb/>
a lady named Winn, daughter of a Richmond <lb/>
banker. They had no fewer than twelve children, <lb/>
of whom Dorothy was the youngest but one. It <lb/>
is stated that she inherited beauty of feature <lb/>
from her mother, and from her father a <reg orig="well-|proportioned">well-proportioned</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="194" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0197"/>
figure and fine bearing. Although <lb/>
delicate in early life, and requiring constant care, <lb/>
she eventually grew up, amid her native Yorkshire <lb/>
moors, a handsome and healthy girl of remarkable <lb/>
humour, spirit, and vigour. She was not allowed <lb/>
as a child to take up systematic lessons like her <lb/>
sisters, but having remarkable powers of <reg orig="observa-|tion">observation</reg> <lb/>
and a retentive memory, "she learnt as if <lb/>
by instinct, and gathered experience and <reg orig="judg-|ment">judgment</reg> <lb/>
from everyday life." At the age of fourteen <lb/>
she had the most serious of all her attacks of <lb/>
illness. It was accompanied by great internal <lb/>
pain, but it seems to have developed in her that <lb/>
extraordinary fortitude in bearing pain and <reg orig="weari-|ness">weariness</reg> <lb/>
which afterwards distinguished her, as well as <lb/>
her characteristic aptitude for always looking on <lb/>
the bright side of everything. There was nothing, <lb/>
however, to indicate her future bent, nor did she <lb/>
take a more prominent part in parish work than <lb/>
any of her sisters. But there was one beautiful <lb/>
trait in all of them, which is thus described by Miss <lb/>
Margaret Lonsdale, Sister Dora's biographer:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Not merely charity, but hospitality to the poor <lb/>
as well as to the rich, was their habit through life. <lb/>
Comforts abounded in their home; but these seem <lb/>
chiefly to have been valued because they furnished <lb/>
the means of bringing happiness into the lives of <lb/>
others. The girls were always planning how to <lb/>
save their money to give it away, and they made <lb/>
a rule of carefully mending and remaking their old <lb/>
clothes, in order that they might not have to <lb/>
buy new ones&mdash;their mother rightly requiring that <lb/>
they should be neatly and properly dressed. Giving <lb/>
<pb n="195" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0198"/>
away their dinners, and dining on bread and cheese <lb/>
themselves, seems to have been an ordinary <lb/>
occurrence. It could not, of course, have been <lb/>
necessary, but they chose to do it, because it was <lb/>
no pleasure to them to give away to others what <lb/>
cost them nothing. In fact, giving to others, <reg orig="in-|stead">instead</reg> <lb/>
of spending on themselves, seems to have <lb/>
been the rule and delight of their lives; for not <lb/>
only did they liberally bestow money, but time, <lb/>
instruction, powers of mind and body, and, above <lb/>
all, love and pity to those around them; and they <lb/>
reaped the sure reward in the devotion of the <lb/>
people to them and their interests."</p>
<p>One anecdote is told of her as a girl, which <lb/>
showed the future bias of her mind, but it seems <lb/>
to have been the only instance of the kind. While <lb/>
she was abroad, a youth in her native village, who <lb/>
regarded her with a deep feeling of devotion, fell <lb/>
ill of rheumatic fever. He longed and prayed <lb/>
for her return, and on the day she was expected <lb/>
sat up on his pillow intently listening. His quick <lb/>
ears caught the sound of wheels long before any <lb/>
one else, and he exclaimed, "There she is! There's <lb/>
Miss Dora!" She soon appeared at his bedside, <lb/>
and nursed him until he died. One work she was <lb/>
especially fond of&mdash;training the village choir; and <lb/>
as most Yorkshire people have an innate love of <lb/>
music, she soon brought the choir to a high state <lb/>
of perfection. Riding across the wild Yorkshire <lb/>
moorlands was a favourite pastime with her. She <lb/>
was a bold and adventurous horsewoman, and <lb/>
acquitted herself well when she went to the meets <lb/>
with her brothers. When she was not able to do <lb/>
<pb n="196" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0199"/>
this, she delighted to drive herself about in a <lb/>
pony-carriage. She was an adept in running, <lb/>
jumping, and any kind of outdoor games. By the <lb/>
time she was twenty, she had become strong and <lb/>
active, with a great flow of animal spirits, and a <lb/>
keen sense of humour. Her merry laugh seemed <lb/>
to penetrate everywhere, and she was spoken of <lb/>
as "the bright bonnie maiden singing about the <lb/>
house."</p>
<p>Of systematic education, and of the outside <lb/>
world, she knew little; but she learnt a great <lb/>
deal indirectly from her sisters, and still more <lb/>
from her elder brother, Mark Pattison, the <reg orig="dis-|tinguished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford, who <lb/>
occasionally employed her to copy for him, and <lb/>
to write at his dictation.</p>
<p>About the time she came of age, Dora Pattison <lb/>
was very beautiful, being tall and slender, about <lb/>
five feet seven inches in height, and with a perfect <lb/>
figure. Her hands were small and exquisitely <lb/>
formed, her features regular, and her forehead <lb/>
singularly wide and high. She had a small mouth <lb/>
with full, red lips, a row of white teeth which <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
perfect till her death, and brilliant <reg orig="dark-|brown">dark-brown</reg> <lb/>
eyes, which could either kindle with <lb/>
sympathy, or twinkle with a merry humour. She <lb/>
had dark, tightly curling brown hair, which could <lb/>
never be subjugated, and which waved all over <lb/>
her head. All these attractions, with her softness <lb/>
and roundness of form, and her extreme delicacy <lb/>
of colouring and complexion, made her a <reg orig="fasci-|nating">fascinating</reg> <lb/>
creature to look upon, and a favourite <lb/>
with all classes. Yet with so much beauty, wit, and <lb/>
<pb n="197" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0200"/>
originality, she had also the proverbial Yorkshire <lb/>
shrewdness of character, together with "the faculty <lb/>
for hitting the right nail on the head, and for <lb/>
seeing to the bottom of a well." But her strongest <lb/>
natural inclination was the desire to aid others, <lb/>
both by giving and by helpful personal aid. <lb/>
Having thus sketched Sister Dora, her biographer <lb/>
goes on to observe:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It will be said that a perfect character, with <lb/>
human sympathies indeed, but with no human <lb/>
failings, is here described; but there will be found <lb/>
in the history of Dorothy Pattison's laborious life, <lb/>
together with the gradual development of her <lb/>
vigorous and healthy moral nature, her vivid <lb/>
imagination and power of realizing things unseen <lb/>
and immortal, the record also of human <reg orig="weak-|nesses">weaknesses</reg> <lb/>
and infirmities not few or small, of struggles <lb/>
and grapplings with moral disease and temptation <lb/>
in some of their most dangerous forms; battles in <lb/>
which she by no means always came off victorious, <lb/>
and of some of which she bore the scars to her <lb/>
death-bed.</p>
<p>"Her indomitable will, which no earthly power <lb/>
could subdue or master, though it was one of her <lb/>
greatest gifts, and enabled her to accomplish an <lb/>
almost superhuman work, yet became to her, <lb/>
on several occasions, the cause of her greatest <lb/>
difficulties.</p>
<p>"Her strong power of personal influence&mdash;that <lb/>
subtle, many-sided, most doubtful of blessings to <lb/>
the possessor&mdash;was not without its snares for her; <lb/>
and were any illustration needed to prove that <lb/>
signal gifts, whether physical, mental, or moral, <lb/>
<pb n="198" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0201"/>
bring with them such heavy responsibilities that <lb/>
they must have their counterbalancing <reg orig="disadvan-|tages">disadvantages</reg>, <lb/>
that illustration would be furnished by the <lb/>
life of Dorothy Pattison."</p>
<p>Miss Pattison was twenty-two when the Crimean <lb/>
War broke out, and her imagination was greatly <lb/>
stirred when she learned that Florence Nightingale <lb/>
was going out at the head of a band of devoted <lb/>
nurses She implored her father to allow her to <lb/>
accompany them, but he declined to do so on the <lb/>
ground that she could not be of service, untrained <lb/>
and undisciplined as she was, while there was <lb/>
plenty of useful work to employ her at home. <lb/>
Dora unwillingly acquiesced in the decision, but, <lb/>
once having been taken, she made the best of it, <lb/>
and fulfilled her home duties, likewise nursing her <lb/>
mother, who was an invalid. Her powerful <reg orig="imagi-|nation">imagination</reg>, <lb/>
aided by the Yorkshire folk-lore and <lb/>
superstitions, imbued her with a strong belief in the <lb/>
supernatural. A strange anecdote is given <reg orig="respect-|ing">respecting</reg> <lb/>
this. Once when on a visit to her brother, she <lb/>
had a dream, in which her mother drew back the <lb/>
curtain of her bed, and called, "Dora, Dora, Dora!" <lb/>
She told her old servant about the vision in the <lb/>
morning, but would not tell her brother, for fear <lb/>
he should say as usual, "Oh, it is only one of your <lb/>
silly North-country superstitions." However, there <lb/>
was no letter from Hauxwell that day, and at <lb/>
night the dream was repeated. Being now seriously <lb/>
disturbed, next day she insisted on going into the <lb/>
neighbouring town for letters, where she found one <lb/>
containing news of her mother's dangerous illness. <lb/>
She went home at once, and found her mother on <lb/>
<pb n="199" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0202"/>
her death-bed, and Mrs. Pattison expired shortly <lb/>
afterwards.</p>
<p>Having now no occupation at home, Dora <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
very restless, and longed to find work which <lb/>
she could do for others. She had already heard <lb/>
of the Sisterhood of the Good Samaritans at <lb/>
Coatham, near Redcar, whose works of mercy were <lb/>
known in different parts of England, but there <lb/>
was no present opportunity of joining them. <reg orig="How-|ever">However</reg>, <lb/>
against her father's wish, she resolved to go <lb/>
out into the world somewhere; but while her <lb/>
desire to be of service was praiseworthy, it is to <lb/>
be noted that she never forgave herself for her <lb/>
wilfulness in opposing her father's wishes. Indeed, <lb/>
when on her death-bed, she said, "I was very <lb/>
wilful, I did very wrong; let no one take me <lb/>
for an example." In October, 1861, she finally <lb/>
left her home and became village schoolmistress <lb/>
at Little Woolston, near Bletchley, on the borders <lb/>
of Buckinghamshire. Her father still gave her the <lb/>
little allowance to which she had been accustomed, <lb/>
and this with a very moderate salary was all she <lb/>
had to rely upon. She seems to have lived <lb/>
happily, nevertheless, in her tiny cottage, though <lb/>
she was alone and kept no servant. Owing to <lb/>
her strong but beautiful character, her attractive <lb/>
personal presence, and her superior manners, she <lb/>
speedily acquired great influence over the villagers. <lb/>
She could enter into all that concerned them, and <lb/>
"she not only taught her children at school, but <lb/>
followed them to their homes, nursed them when <lb/>
they were sick, and visited their parents, and <lb/>
others also of the poor and sick in the village." <lb/>
<pb n="200" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0203"/>
She managed children well, and was a first-class <lb/>
hand at telling them stories. Humble as her <lb/>
worldly store was, she was not without her trials. <lb/>
On one occasion, after she had sat up with a man <lb/>
who was dangerously ill until one o'clock in the <lb/>
morning, she returned home through the fields <lb/>
just in time to see a burglar disappearing from <lb/>
her cottage with all her small collection of silver <lb/>
spoons and forks which she had brought from <lb/>
home, and a teapot which she specially valued. <lb/>
These things were never recovered.</p>
<p>"The people in the neighbourhood," remarks <lb/>
her friend and biographer, "were astonished to find <lb/>
Miss Pattison blacking her grate when they came <lb/>
to see her, but it never seems for a moment to <lb/>
have entered the heads of the poorest that she was <lb/>
not every inch a lady. Rather they tried, by every <lb/>
means in their power, to show that they knew her <lb/>
for 'a real princess.' An old gentleman and his <lb/>
wife, near the village, took such a fancy to her that <lb/>
they did their best to persuade her to give up her <lb/>
work, and to live with them. They had no children, <lb/>
and the gentleman offered to make her his heiress. <lb/>
For some time after Dora left Little Woolston, he <lb/>
used to send her ten pounds regularly every year <lb/>
to do as she pleased with, on condition that she <lb/>
should not acknowledge the gift. Nevertheless, <lb/>
she always acknowledged it, and gave it away, as <lb/>
she already did every sixpence which she could by <lb/>
any possibility spare out of her income, and, in <lb/>
consequence, he ceased after some time to send it."</p>
<p>Falling ill, and being also restless and miserable, <lb/>
she still persisted in going on with her work, until <lb/>
<pb n="201" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0204"/>
one morning she could no longer rise from her bed, <lb/>
and when the doctor came, he found her to be <lb/>
suffering from a severe attack of pleurisy. As <lb/>
soon as she could be moved, she was sent to <lb/>
Redcar for the sea-air, and here the old intense <lb/>
longing for regular work and training came over <lb/>
her. Upon her recovery, she only went back to <lb/>
Little Woolston, to say good-bye to her friends, <lb/>
and then she joined the Redcar Sisterhood. Those <lb/>
who best knew her recognized how unfitted she <lb/>
was for such a life, and her choice was the more <lb/>
extraordinary because she had always disliked the <lb/>
exclusive company of women, and almost despised <lb/>
their average physical and mental powers. But it <lb/>
seems that at this time she was passing through a <lb/>
deep spiritual conflict. Though a devoted adherent <lb/>
of the Church of England, she had fallen under <lb/>
the influence of a more powerful intellect than her <lb/>
own, and the result was a shock to the foundations <lb/>
of her religious faith, arising out of doubts relative <lb/>
to the authenticity and inspiration of the Holy <lb/>
Scriptures. In the severity of the Coatham <reg orig="dis-|cipline">discipline</reg> <lb/>
she found temporary distraction to her <lb/>
thoughts, though the work was extremely <reg orig="distaste-|ful">distasteful</reg> <lb/>
to her; she made beds, cleaned and scoured <lb/>
floors and grates, swept and dusted, and finally <lb/>
became a cook. Moreover, her work had <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg> <lb/>
to be done all over again. But there was <lb/>
one welcome break in the monotony, and that was <lb/>
when she was engaged in nursing at the little <lb/>
Cottage Hospital at North Ormesby, near <reg orig="Middles-|borough">Middlesborough</reg>. <lb/>
Sometimes she was left alone with the <lb/>
patients, which once included a strong burly man <lb/>
<pb n="202" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0205"/>
who was insensible from concussion of the brain, <lb/>
but who would insist on trying to get away from <lb/>
the place.</p>
<p>Early in 1865, Sister Dora was sent by the <lb/>
Sisterhood to nurse at their small Cottage Hospital <lb/>
at Walsall, in that part of Staffordshire known as <lb/>
"the Black Country." The coal and iron industries <lb/>
of this district have blackened and spoilt what was <lb/>
once very delightful scenery. Miss Lonsdale <lb/>
draws a gloomy picture of the inhabitants at that <lb/>
time. The colliery workers, though having a strong <lb/>
sense of honour and generosity, too often spent <lb/>
their high wages in riotous living. The women <lb/>
led hard lives of drudgery, and drunkenness and <lb/>
immorality were scarcely looked upon as any <reg orig="dis-|grace">disgrace</reg>. <lb/>
Sister Dora began to work very hard at <lb/>
the hospital, which contained fourteen beds, when <lb/>
she was stricken down by small-pox, and became <lb/>
very ill. It is stated that even in her delirium she <lb/>
showed the bent of her mind by occupying herself <lb/>
in tearing up her sheets into bandages. As a <reg orig="pre-|cautionary">precautionary</reg> <lb/>
measure, Sister Dora was isolated, and <lb/>
as no one was allowed to go into her room, certain <lb/>
bigoted spirits in Walsall raised a cry of Popery <lb/>
against the Sisters, who were charged with keeping <lb/>
an oratory, in which there was a figure of the <lb/>
Virgin Mary, etc. Stones and mud were thrown <lb/>
up at the hospital windows, and continual petty <lb/>
annoyances inflicted on the nurses. Sister Dora <lb/>
recovered, and the persecution began to die out. <lb/>
Almost the last instance of active persecution is <lb/>
related concerning Sister Dora.</p>
<p>At the time of the celebrated Murphy Riots, <lb/>
<pb n="203" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0206"/>
she was walking rather late in the evening through <lb/>
the town to visit a patient, when a boy from the <lb/>
other side of the road called out, "There goes one <lb/>
of those Sisters of Misery!" and threw a stone <lb/>
which cut open her forehead. Not long afterwards, <lb/>
this same young fellow was brought into the <lb/>
hospital, having met with a severe injury in a <reg orig="coal-|pit">coal-pit</reg>. <lb/>
Sister Dora, who never forgot a face, <reg orig="recog-|nized">recognized</reg> <lb/>
him at once, saying to herself, "That's my <lb/>
man!" He was for some time under her care, and <lb/>
she bestowed upon him probably more than usual <lb/>
attention.</p>
<p>One night, when he was recovering, she found <lb/>
him quietly crying. "I wouldn't ask him what <lb/>
was the matter," Sister Dora said, when relating <lb/>
this story, "because I knew well enough, and I <lb/>
wanted him to confess. At length it came out, <lb/>
with many sobs, 'Sister, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> threw that stone at you.' <lb/>
'Oh,' I replied, 'did you think I did not know <lb/>
that? Why, I knew you the very first minute you <lb/>
came in at the door.' 'What!' returned he; 'you <lb/>
knew me, and have been nursing me like this?' <lb/>
You see," added Sister Dora, "it was his first <lb/>
practical experience of good returned for evil, and <lb/>
he didn't know what to make of it."</p>
<p>Returning to Coatham in April, 1865, Sister <lb/>
Dora was engaged by Sir James Simpson, the <lb/>
eminent Edinburgh physician, to nurse a lady <lb/>
patient of his, old and semi-insane, in the <reg orig="neigh-|bourhood">neighbourhood</reg> <lb/>
of Redcar. She so fascinated the patient <lb/>
that she continually pressed jewels and other <lb/>
presents upon her, all of which were steadfastly <lb/>
refused. The old lady resorted to threats of <lb/>
<pb n="204" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0207"/>
personal violence, but in vain. Then, one night, <lb/>
she suddenly sprang out of bed, seized her <reg orig="atten-|dant">attendant</reg> <lb/>
by the shoulder, and brandished a long knife <lb/>
over her head. Sister Dora said not a word, but <lb/>
turned and looked calmly at her. "I wanted to <lb/>
see if I could frighten you!" said the half-crazy <lb/>
woman, and then laid aside her weapon. Ever <lb/>
afterwards she treated her nurse with real kindness <lb/>
and consideration, but she still tried to make her <lb/>
accept gifts, which were sometimes taken, and then <lb/>
handed over to the relatives of the patient.</p>
<p>In November, 1865, Sister Dora was again sent <lb/>
to Walsall, and here, save for occasional visits to <lb/>
Coatham, and professional engagements with private <lb/>
patients, the remainder of her life was passed. The <lb/>
Sisterhood of Good Samaritans were sometimes <lb/>
most exacting and inconsiderate. When Mr. <lb/>
Pattison was taken dangerously ill, Dora <reg orig="tele-|graphed">telegraphed</reg> <lb/>
to the Sisterhood to be allowed to go to <lb/>
Hauxwell, but instead of permission being granted, <lb/>
there came a peremptory measure ordering her to <lb/>
go and nurse a case in Devonshire. Her father <lb/>
died, and then she received from the Sisterhood a <lb/>
tardy permission to go to the funeral if she pleased. <lb/>
She was so indignant that she wrote back in <reg orig="bitter-|ness">bitterness</reg> <lb/>
of spirit to the effect that as when he was <lb/>
alive they would not allow her to go to him, now <lb/>
he was dead she no longer cared to go. She <lb/>
returned to Walsall from the South of England <lb/>
almost broken-hearted. Nevertheless, she faced <lb/>
her work with such courage as she was able to <lb/>
command, and made strenuous exertions to become <lb/>
a good surgical nurse. In-patients and out-patients <lb/>
<pb n="205" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0208"/>
alike came to have great confidence in her skill, <lb/>
while her manner was always inspiriting. <reg orig="Ex-|perience">Experience</reg> <lb/>
widened so rapidly that she achieved her <lb/>
ambition in course of time, and became a skilful <lb/>
surgeon. The old doctor attached to the hospital <lb/>
discovered her good qualities&mdash;her coolness, her <lb/>
nerve, and her unusual delicacy of touch, and he <lb/>
took a special pleasure in instructing her fully in <lb/>
the healing art. Her intense pity for suffering, <lb/>
and her sympathetic nature, enabled her to <reg orig="over-|come">overcome</reg> <lb/>
that natural repugnance to painful sights and <lb/>
sounds which she at first experienced.</p>
<p>It was to be expected that such a woman as <lb/>
Sister Dora would be sought in marriage, and she <lb/>
received an offer which her friends, and even some <lb/>
of the Sisterhood, strongly urged her to accept. <lb/>
She felt drawn two ways: on the one hand she <lb/>
was drawn towards woman's lot of wedded joys <lb/>
and sorrows, and on the other she saw in the <lb/>
struggle with human misery and suffering a career <lb/>
in which her varied powers would have ample <lb/>
scope and exercise. She chose the heroic course, <lb/>
but towards the close of her days she was heard to <lb/>
remark that if she had to begin life over again she <lb/>
would marry. Marriage she held to be the <reg orig="right-|ful">rightful</reg> <lb/>
sphere of woman, and, with her passionate <reg orig="fond-|ness">fondness</reg> <lb/>
for children, she regretted that she had had no <lb/>
children of her own. With regard to her religious <lb/>
difficulties, these were eventually surmounted, and <lb/>
being released from doubt, her enthusiasm found <lb/>
vent in a personal devotion to our Lord Jesus <lb/>
Christ. She was in the habit of attending the <lb/>
Church of St. James, Wednesbury, whose incumbent, <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0209"/>
the Rev. Richard Twigg, "buried talents which <lb/>
would have won the admiration of the world, in <lb/>
the smokiest dens of the Black country." His <lb/>
example and teaching proved most beneficial to <lb/>
her, and developed still further her religious zeal <lb/>
and her spirit of self-sacrifice. The good she <lb/>
received from his Scripture lessons she imparted <lb/>
in turn to her patients and others. Mr. Twigg <lb/>
was a true spiritual father to her, criticizing her <lb/>
actions and administering reproof when necessary <lb/>
as well as comfort and consolation.</p>
<p>The hospital at Walsall proving inadequate, as <lb/>
well as injurious, to patients, through the <reg orig="surround-|ing">surrounding</reg> <lb/>
foul air, a new building was erected on a more <lb/>
salubrious site. It contained twenty-eight beds, <lb/>
and was opened in 1868. Sister Dora's labours <lb/>
now became more arduous than ever, especially as <lb/>
the town of Walsall was visited at this time by a <lb/>
severe epidemic of small-pox. All the time she <lb/>
could spare from her hospital duties she spent in <lb/>
visiting the stricken at their homes, giving up her <lb/>
hours of rest, and sometimes her regular meals, in <lb/>
order to do this. She fearlessly braved the horrors <lb/>
of the terrible disease, and sometimes sat up whole <lb/>
nights with dying patients. One night she was <lb/>
sent for to a poor man, who was much attached <lb/>
to her, and who was dying of that virulent form <lb/>
of the disease known as the "black-pox." The <lb/>
neighbours and even his wife had fled from him, <lb/>
but she remained by his side till death released <lb/>
him. Just before the end came, he gasped out, <lb/>
"Sister, kiss me before I die," and the angel <lb/>
of mercy did so, notwithstanding his loathsome <lb/>
<pb n="207" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0210"/>
condition. It is said that at this juncture she <lb/>
had an idea that she would catch the small-pox <lb/>
herself, and die. She rather desired this, for she <lb/>
was suffering from remorse in connection with her <lb/>
father, and had no wish to live. In time, she <reg orig="re-|pented">repented</reg> <lb/>
of this feeling, and it passed away.</p>
<p>Sister Dora's reputation for surgical skill was <lb/>
quite remarkable. Her pleadings often saved a <lb/>
limb that was doomed. Once a fine healthy <lb/>
young man was brought into the hospital with <lb/>
his arm torn and twisted by a machine. The <lb/>
doctor pronounced that nothing but amputation <lb/>
could save the man's life, but the sufferer cried <lb/>
out, "Oh, Sister, save my arm for me; it's my <lb/>
right arm." She believed she could save the <lb/>
limb, and against the doctor's urgent advice, but <lb/>
with the man's consent, she agreed to do so. The <lb/>
doctor predicted that mortification must ensue in <lb/>
a few hours, and washed his hands of the case. <lb/>
Sister Dora persevered, and prayed as well as <lb/>
laboured for success, and was well rewarded. The <lb/>
arm was straightened and saved, and the doctor <lb/>
was lost in amazement when he saw the triumph <lb/>
which had been achieved, while the Sister wept <lb/>
for happiness. Other cures were effected similar <lb/>
to this, and there is no doubt that Sister Dora's <lb/>
strong magnetic personality had something to do <lb/>
with them. She acquired a singular power over <lb/>
her patients, so that they became fortified with a <lb/>
courage which they could not command in the <lb/>
presence of the ordinary practitioner, and faith <lb/>
and hope assisted recovery. Over suffering <lb/>
children she wielded an influence which was <lb/>
<pb n="208" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0211"/>
nothing short of marvellous. Against <reg orig="drunken-|ness">drunkenness</reg> <lb/>
she waged a constant warfare, although she <lb/>
was not a total abstainer; but she saw how <lb/>
intemperance affected her patients injuriously, <lb/>
both from the physical and mental points of view. <lb/>
Profanity she was equally strong against, and she <lb/>
commended her religion to the worst of the colliers, <lb/>
because they saw that it was without cant. She <lb/>
was cheerful, humorous, and buoyant in spirits. <lb/>
No one ever ventured to take a liberty with her, <lb/>
although she laughed and joked with all. "Make <lb/>
you laugh!" said a big Irishman, "she'd make <lb/>
you laugh when you were dying." She invented <lb/>
games for the boys, and played chess or draughts <lb/>
with the men, doing everything with hearty good <lb/>
will. All her reforms and prospects she carried <lb/>
through by her sheer personal influence over those <lb/>
with whom she was brought into contact.</p>
<p>But while she was surrounded by those who <lb/>
were full of admiration for, and gratitude to her, <lb/>
she had none to whom she could turn for <reg orig="com-|panionship">companionship</reg> <lb/>
in her own sphere, and consequently <lb/>
she felt very lonely at times. At length a man <lb/>
came across her path whom she at first respected <lb/>
and then loved. But he had no faith whatever in <lb/>
revealed religion, which was the mainspring of <lb/>
her life, and after a sharp struggle, which ended <lb/>
for her in a serious illness, she broke off the <lb/>
engagement, and thereby put away from her all <lb/>
hopes of domestic happiness.</p>
<p>Touching stories are told of her tenderness with <lb/>
children. She acted like a mother to them, and <lb/>
constantly took one, sometimes two children into <lb/>
<pb n="209" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0212"/>
her own bed, and she had been known to sleep <lb/>
with a burnt baby on each arm. A little girl, nine <lb/>
years old, was once brought to the hospital so <lb/>
badly burnt that she had only a few hours to live. <lb/>
Sister Dora gave herself up entirely to her, and by <lb/>
her loving ministrations prepared her for death. <lb/>
The child passed away peacefully, and her last <lb/>
words, as she looked at the flowers on the ward <lb/>
tables, were, "When you come to heaven, Sister, <lb/>
I'll meet you at the gates with a bunch of flowers."</p>
<p>During the Franco-German War of 1870&ndash;71, <lb/>
Sister Dora longed to go out and nurse the <lb/>
wounded, but she saw that there was no one who <lb/>
could carry on her work at Walsall, and therefore <lb/>
remained at home. One of her lady-pupils, in <lb/>
describing an ordinary day's work at Walsall <lb/>
Hospital, showed how it began at half-past six in <lb/>
the morning and lasted till about half-past ten at <lb/>
night. Sister Dora began by making the beds of <lb/>
the patients and giving them breakfast, having a <lb/>
pleasant word for all. Rude rough fellows thought <lb/>
they had never seen such a woman as this before, <lb/>
so beautiful, so good, so tender-hearted, so strong <lb/>
and so gentle, so full of fun and humour, and of <lb/>
sympathy for broken hearts as well as for every <lb/>
other kind of fracture. After her own breakfast, <lb/>
she read prayers on the staircase, so that the <lb/>
patients in all the wards could hear and join. <lb/>
Then came the daily ward work; the doctor <lb/>
arrived at eleven; at twelve there was the patients' <lb/>
dinner, which the Sister herself attended to in <lb/>
every detail; then she read prayers for the <reg orig="lady-|pupils">lady-pupils</reg> <lb/>
and servants in the general sitting-room; <lb/>
<pb n="210" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0213"/>
next followed dinner for the nurses; out-patients <lb/>
came at two o'clock&mdash;from sixty to a hundred <lb/>
persons arriving in the course of the afternoon. <lb/>
Sister Dora took the minor operations and <reg orig="dress-|ings">dressings</reg>, <lb/>
and her bandaging was so good that a <lb/>
Birmingham surgeon called upon his pupils to <lb/>
admire it. At five o'clock there was the in-patients' <lb/>
tea; and, after this, Sister Dora went round the <lb/>
wards, and conversed or played games with each <lb/>
patient; at eight o'clock, wounds were dressed for <lb/>
the night, and then came supper, followed by <lb/>
prayers, after which Sister Dora supped with the <lb/>
lady-pupils, though very frequently&mdash;as on Fridays, <lb/>
or during Lent&mdash;she went without supper. It was <lb/>
a marvel how she did such constant hard work <lb/>
upon her very meagre diet. Yet her physical <lb/>
strength was gigantic. If a huge collier fell out <lb/>
of bed, she asked no one to help her, but picked <lb/>
him up as if he had been a baby, and put him <lb/>
back again. One patient related that when a man <lb/>
died in the night, in the bed next to his own, <lb/>
Sister Dora, who was the only nurse present, took <lb/>
up the body in her arms with apparent ease, and <lb/>
carried it straight to the mortuary. The pupil <lb/>
already referred to described her life as one long <lb/>
self-sacrifice. "We ought to give up our lives for <lb/>
the brethren," she said, and she acted upon her <lb/>
convictions.</p>
<p>Touching Sister Dora's methods of work, and <lb/>
her character, Miss Lonsdale further says: "She <lb/>
preferred doing personally as much as possible of <lb/>
the work of her hospital, the chief reason for this <lb/>
being that activity and even restlessness of mind <lb/>
<pb n="211" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0214"/>
and body which would not allow her to be still. <lb/>
'She always took the heaviest and roughest part <lb/>
of any employment upon herself,' remarked her <lb/>
old servant, Mrs. H<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g6"/>, 'and she never chose to <lb/>
ask her servants or lady-pupils to do anything <lb/>
which she was not in the constant habit of <reg orig="under-|taking">undertaking</reg> <lb/>
herself.' She wished her own personal <lb/>
influence to be paramount with every in-or <reg orig="out-|patient">outpatient</reg> <lb/>
of the hospital. She was the first to be <lb/>
up and the last to go to rest, and she was, perhaps, <lb/>
apt to be intolerant of slowness or dullness of <lb/>
comprehension in others, preferring to do their <lb/>
work herself, rather than to wait while they got <lb/>
through it; she did not care to employ even a <lb/>
competent subordinate, and she thus thoroughly <lb/>
earned the title of the 'one-horse shay,' given to <lb/>
her by Bishop Selwyn, in whose diocese <reg orig="Wal-|sall">Walsall</reg> <lb/>
lay. Between Sister Dora and our great <lb/>
missionary Bishop a strong fellow-feeling and <lb/>
sympathy existed. They were in many respects <lb/>
kindred spirits, and she gave him, probably, as <lb/>
much of her confidence as she ever gave to any <lb/>
one. He, in return, fully appreciated her <reg orig="re-|markable">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
qualities.</p>
<p>"She was a person of strong, almost violent, <lb/>
prejudices, which she strove in vain not to exhibit <lb/>
towards her lady-pupils. When she was so <reg orig="in-|clined">inclined</reg>, <lb/>
no one could be a more patient and a more <lb/>
thorough teacher; she never grudged time or <lb/>
attention&mdash;both of which she bestowed liberally on <lb/>
the pupils to whom she took a fancy. She would <lb/>
explain to them carefully and elaborately the why <lb/>
and wherefore of everything she did, on the sole <lb/>
<pb n="212" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0215"/>
condition that they never asked her questions in <lb/>
the presence of the patients. Like many other <lb/>
people, whose own acquirements are of a first-rate <lb/>
order, she gave those who were her friends among <lb/>
her pupils credit for more knowledge and sagacity <lb/>
than they really possessed&mdash;'wrapping us,' says <lb/>
one of them, 'in the warm mantle of her own great <lb/>
skill and knowledge.'</p>
<p>"But still, the main lesson which her lady-pupils <lb/>
carried away from Walsall was not how to dress <lb/>
wounds or how to bandage, or even how to manage <lb/>
a hospital on the most popular as well as the most <lb/>
economical method, but rather the mighty results <lb/>
which the motive-power of love towards God, and, <lb/>
for His sake, towards mankind, might enable one <lb/>
single woman to effect. Sister Dora said to a <lb/>
friend who was engaging a servant for the hospital, <lb/>
'Tell her this is not an ordinary house, or even <lb/>
hospital. I want her to understand that all who <lb/>
serve here, in whatever capacity, ought to have <lb/>
one rule, <hi rend="italic">love for God</hi>, and then I need not say <lb/>
love for their work. I wish we could use, and <lb/>
really mean, the word, <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">Maison-Dieu</hi></foreign>.'</p>
<p>"She spoke unreservedly to her household upon <lb/>
the absolute necessity of constant private prayer, <lb/>
and expressed openly her own strong conviction <lb/>
that no blessing could attend the hospital unless <lb/>
those who worked in it fulfilled their duty in this <lb/>
respect. It was literally true that she never <lb/>
touched a wound without lifting up her heart to <lb/>
the Giver of all virtue, and asking that healing <lb/>
might be conveyed by her means; that she never <lb/>
set a fracture without a prayer that, through her <lb/>
<pb n="213" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0216"/>
instrumentality, the limb might unite. As she <lb/>
attended upon the surgeons during an operation, <lb/>
the most absorbing and anxious of a nurse's duties, <lb/>
where the patient's life must often, humanly <reg orig="speak-|ing">speaking</reg>, <lb/>
depend on readiness of eye and instantaneous <lb/>
comprehension of the slightest sign on the part of <lb/>
the operating surgeon, and on intelligent obedience <lb/>
to his orders, she seemed able to separate her bodily <lb/>
and intellectual from her spiritual powers, which <lb/>
were engaged in holding communion with that Being <lb/>
in whose Hand are the issues of life and death."</p>
<p>Sister Dora was such an excellent surgeon that <lb/>
she would have passed a first-rate examination in <lb/>
the art. She was strongly pressed by a Scotch <lb/>
surgeon to go to Edinburgh, there to study and <lb/>
qualify for practice, but she shrank from the <lb/>
publicity of the step. Moreover, she could do all <lb/>
the work of house-surgeon at the Walsall Hospital, <lb/>
and there was plenty to occupy her. Railway <lb/>
accidents on the South Staffordshire line were of <lb/>
frequent occurrence, and the sufferers were usually <lb/>
brought straight to Sister Dora. In 1871 there <lb/>
were so many poor fellows who owed a debt of <lb/>
gratitude to her that they subscribed among <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
&pound;50, with which they bought a small carriage <lb/>
and a pony. This gift was presented to her in the <lb/>
hospital grounds, and Sister Dora was deeply <lb/>
touched by it. At first she feared it might prove <lb/>
a white elephant, but she lived to find it a great <lb/>
saving of time and strength in visiting the sick. <lb/>
For three years, 1870 to 1872 inclusive, Sister <lb/>
Dora pursued her avocations without intermission, <lb/>
taking no holiday whatever.</p>
<pb n="214" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0217"/>
<p>In the month of March, 1873, a mission was held <lb/>
at Walsall, and Sister Dora took an active part in <lb/>
it. The missioner exhorted the lay-workers to <lb/>
bring people to the services, and on the second day <lb/>
the Sister appeared at Church with a following of <lb/>
thirty or forty waifs and strays, whom she had <lb/>
collected in various parts of the town. In <reg orig="Septem-|ber">September</reg> <lb/>
she took a few days' rest at Cannock Chase; <lb/>
but soon after her return she had a sharp attack of <lb/>
fever, caught in nursing a very bad case. She <reg orig="re-|covered">recovered</reg> <lb/>
quickly, and found her hospital "full of <lb/>
interesting cases; one man with a compound <lb/>
fracture of each leg, and no less than thirty cuts <lb/>
on his head." In August, 1874, she enjoyed a <reg orig="well-|earned">well-earned</reg> <lb/>
holiday at Redcar. When Messrs. Moody <lb/>
and Sankey visited Birmingham, she went to hear <lb/>
them, and feeling convinced that their mode of <lb/>
worship would be appreciated at the hospital, she <lb/>
introduced their hymn-book into the wards. She <lb/>
taught the patients to sing the hymns, and many <lb/>
pleasant Sunday afternoons were passed by present <lb/>
and former inmates of the hospital. Railway <lb/>
servants, cabmen, and others, often looked back <lb/>
regretfully, and yet gratefully, to these happy <lb/>
services. All of them felt that Sister Dora came <lb/>
down to their own level in order to do them good, <lb/>
and lift them up to a better life. In October, 1874, <lb/>
she took a number of convalescent patients to <lb/>
Rhyl, on the Welsh coast, for a few weeks, having <lb/>
returned from a visit to a married sister in Guernsey <lb/>
in order to do this. Another time, we read of her <lb/>
taking seven or eight boy-patients to Sutton Park, <lb/>
not far from Walsall, and thoroughly entering into <lb/>
<pb n="215" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0218"/>
their pleasures; while on other occasions she would <lb/>
take a whole army of followers, patients, <reg orig="night-|nurses">night-nurses</reg>, <lb/>
and humble friends over to Lichfield for <lb/>
the day, to see the cathedral, and attend the service, <lb/>
bearing most of the expense herself. She had <lb/>
come into some money from her relatives, but <lb/>
money was only valuable to her because it could <lb/>
be spent profitably upon others, and her charity <lb/>
was widely distributed. No one knew the extent <lb/>
of her liberality, but many profited by it, including <lb/>
a number of men who could make no headway in <lb/>
England, and whom she assisted to emigrate with <lb/>
their families. Letters thanking her for her <reg orig="kind-|ness">kindness</reg> <lb/>
and pecuniary aid she invariably destroyed.</p>
<p>Towards the close of 1874 all connection between <lb/>
Sister Dora and the community of the Good <lb/>
Samaritans was dissolved. When questioned on <lb/>
the subject, she said, "I am a woman, and not a <lb/>
piece of furniture!" The Coatham Sisterhood <lb/>
notified the committee of the hospital that they <lb/>
must no longer be considered responsible for the <lb/>
nursing at Walsall, and the committee gave the <lb/>
best of all practical replies by formally requesting <lb/>
the Sister to take upon herself in name, as she had <lb/>
long, in fact, the management of the hospital. It <lb/>
was at this time that Sister Dora heard of the <lb/>
death of a beloved sister in Yorkshire, who had <lb/>
left a husband and a large family of children. <lb/>
Her first thought was to leave Walsall and go to <lb/>
them, and for a considerable period she was torn <lb/>
between inclination and duty. At last it was left <lb/>
to others to decide, when it was resolved that she <lb/>
ought not to leave her manifest sphere of duty at <lb/>
<pb n="216" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0219"/>
Walsall. Her own feeling had been in this <reg orig="direc-|tion">direction</reg>, <lb/>
for her work in the hospital and in the town <lb/>
had become as it were her very life. "It would be <lb/>
impossible to recount the tenth part of the instances <lb/>
in which she ministered to the needy, the desolate, <lb/>
the sinful, the sorrowful, the helpless, and the <lb/>
broken-hearted. 'Fetch Sister Dora,' was the <lb/>
invariable cry, and she never failed to respond to <lb/>
it. No wonder that her work seemed ever <reg orig="increas-|ing">increasing</reg> <lb/>
and widening with her growing knowledge of <lb/>
human nature, and with the cultivation of her own <lb/>
powers. But it was the poor and ignorant amongst <lb/>
whom she most delighted to work; with them lay <lb/>
her largest sympathies, and by her intercourse <lb/>
with them she refreshed her own spirit, and <lb/>
brightened her life. She brought back many an <lb/>
amusing account of her adventures from her visits to <lb/>
the low lodging-houses, whither she was occasionally <lb/>
summoned, sometimes to set a limb broken in a <lb/>
drunken brawl, sometimes to dress the burns of a <lb/>
scalded child."</p>
<p>In February, 1875, there was a fresh outbreak <lb/>
of small-pox in Walsall, and it spread with fearful <lb/>
rapidity. The mayor and corporation had already <lb/>
built an Epidemic Hospital on the outskirts of the <lb/>
town, to be ready for such an emergency, but <lb/>
patients refused to be moved from their homes. <lb/>
However, Sister Dora saw the authorities, and <lb/>
urged them to open the hospital at once, promising <lb/>
to leave her own work and nurse the small-pox <lb/>
patients. The authorities joyfully acceded to <lb/>
this, for they dreaded the ravages of the disease, <lb/>
and the plan answered admirably. She went to <lb/>
<pb n="217" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0220"/>
the Epidemic Hospital with a presentiment that <lb/>
she would never return to her own work, but <lb/>
happily the presentiment was unfulfilled. The <lb/>
Cottage Hospital suffered during her absence, for <lb/>
there was no first-class nurse to take her place. <lb/>
Her pride in aiming at always being an absolute <lb/>
necessity to the hospital was one of the few blots <lb/>
upon her character. Now, when there should have <lb/>
been an efficient head in her absence, there was <lb/>
not one to be found, and she could only tell her <lb/>
pupils to divide the work, and do their best till she <lb/>
returned.</p>
<p>Sister Dora at first dreaded the work at the <lb/>
Epidemic Hospital, but she soon got over this, <lb/>
and became engrossed in her beneficent labours. <lb/>
The hospital was admirably appointed on the <lb/>
isolated system, with all kinds of supplementary <lb/>
buildings, including a laundry, an ambulance shed, <lb/>
a mortuary, etc. But the patients were <reg orig="trouble-|some">troublesome</reg> <lb/>
and dirty, and she had next to no help in <lb/>
the work. Her thoughts constantly reverted to <lb/>
the patients in her own hospital, and she wrote <lb/>
them a characteristic letter, addressed to "My <lb/>
dear Children," saying that she had not been able <lb/>
to trust herself to say good-bye to them. Then <lb/>
she gave directions to particular patients as <lb/>
follows: "Tell John Dawson that to-morrow <reg orig="after-|noon">afternoon</reg> <lb/>
Sister must give him some paper, and he is <lb/>
to write me a letter, with a message from each of <lb/>
my children, and with it to send word how his foot <lb/>
is. Remember me to Isaac; he is not to leave <lb/>
the 'Darkey' too much. 'Everlasting' is not to <lb/>
dance about. 'Delicate man' is to tell me how <lb/>
<pb n="218" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0221"/>
he sleeps, and if he does not miss me to arrange <lb/>
his leg and look after him. Tell my Irishman I <lb/>
miss his blessing&mdash;the man by the door, I will <lb/>
soon come and starch him &lpar;<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> his leg&rpar;. Mr. <lb/>
Baker, I hope, is attentive to his duties, and has <lb/>
broken no more pink cups. I hope 'Leg' is getting <lb/>
on grandly, not sitting up too long; 'King Charles' <lb/>
brushes his hair with care; 'Head' is better; <lb/>
'Burnt' misses me; 'Hand' is better; 'Thumb' <lb/>
easier; Michael as content as ever. What shall I <lb/>
say to my beloved Sam? I wish I had my boy <lb/>
here. I send him twenty kisses, and hope he has <lb/>
been in church to-day, and in time. He must not <lb/>
sulk all the time I am away. I have two blessed <lb/>
babies who alternately keep up music all day and <lb/>
night, accompanied with my Irishwoman's tongue, <lb/>
so I am not dull. Have you been singing to-day? <lb/>
You must sing, particularly, 'Safe in the arms of <lb/>
Jesus,' and think of me. Living or dying, I am <lb/>
His. Oh, my children, you all love me for the <lb/>
very little I do for you; but oh, if you would only <lb/>
think what Jesus has done and is doing for you, <lb/>
your hearts would soon be full of love for Him, <lb/>
and you would all choose Him for your Master. <lb/>
Now, whilst you are on your beds, read and study <lb/>
His life; see the road He went, and follow Him."</p>
<p>Finally she said, "Your mother is thinking of <lb/>
you, and praying for you. And if it please God <lb/>
you should never see her again, will you make up <lb/>
your minds to walk in the narrow way, so that we <lb/>
may all meet in the green fields above? May <lb/>
God bring you all safe there is the earnest prayer <lb/>
of your faithful friend."</p>
<pb n="219" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0222"/>
<p>Nearly every one gave the Epidemic Hospital <lb/>
a wide berth, but she went on bravely with her <lb/>
task, greatly overtaxing her strength, but never <lb/>
really breaking down. The patients, who were <lb/>
nearly all of the lowest and most ignorant class, <lb/>
placed implicit trust in her, and many natures were <lb/>
softened under her influence. It is stated as an <lb/>
absolute fact that she brought back to life patients <lb/>
who were in the first stage of fatal collapse by <lb/>
actually putting her mouth to theirs and breathing <lb/>
into them until vitality was restored. The only <lb/>
two people she had to help her&mdash;for no others <lb/>
would come&mdash;were an old porter and an <reg orig="Irish-|woman">Irishwoman</reg>, <lb/>
and these would go off sometimes on the <lb/>
drink, leaving her to battle alone with the patients, <lb/>
some of whom were delirious. Yet, as if by a <lb/>
miracle, her strength and courage did not fail her. <lb/>
For six months she remained at the Epidemic <lb/>
Hospital, and never left it until the last small-pox <lb/>
patient had been discharged cured. Then she <lb/>
went back to her beloved work at the Cottage <lb/>
Hospital.</p>
<p>One of the most awful episodes at the Walsall <lb/>
Hospital occurred in October, 1875. An explosion <lb/>
had taken place at some ironworks at Burchills, <lb/>
near Walsall, when eleven men were speedily <lb/>
covered with molten metal, which poured over <lb/>
them like a cataract. In their terror and agony <lb/>
they jumped into the canal, from which they were <lb/>
with difficulty rescued and conveyed to the hospital. <lb/>
What followed is thus described by Miss Lonsdale: <lb/>
"All but very serious cases then under treatment <lb/>
were turned out into the passages, and some were <lb/>
<pb n="220" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0223"/>
sent home till one ward was entirely cleared and <lb/>
ready for the sufferers. They were so burnt all <lb/>
over and disfigured that they were more like <lb/>
charred logs of wood than human beings. Some <lb/>
were in terrible agony, crying out, 'Water! <lb/>
Water!' A few were dying painlessly, but most <lb/>
of them were entreating, 'Sister, come and dress <lb/>
me!' '<hi rend="italic">Do</hi> dress me!' 'Oh, you don't know how <lb/>
bad I am!' She answered, 'Oh, my poor men! <lb/>
I'll dress you all, if you'll give me time.' She gave <lb/>
them each a glass of brandy, and then tried to <lb/>
undress them, but the flesh was so burnt away&mdash; <lb/>
the water into which they had jumped having <lb/>
terribly aggravated their injuries &mdash; that it was <lb/>
almost impossible to cut off their clothes.</p>
<p>"Both sight and smell were terrible, and even the <lb/>
medical men of the town, who promptly came to <lb/>
help, were incessantly sick, and could hardly stay <lb/>
in the ward. Ladies in Birmingham and in the <lb/>
neighbourhood, who heard of the accident, offered <lb/>
their assistance, and a few actually came, but <lb/>
scarcely one of them could get beyond the door <lb/>
of the ward. One poor man named Phillips&mdash; <lb/>
let due honour be done to his memory&mdash;seeing <lb/>
how Sister Dora was distracted by the cries for <lb/>
help by which she was surrounded, said, 'Sister <lb/>
Dora, I want to be dressed <hi rend="italic">very</hi> bad, but if there's <lb/>
any wants you worse, go and do them first.' He <lb/>
was in intense agony, and able to lie only on his <lb/>
face, and he died during the night. Another died <lb/>
on Sunday, but the rest lingered, some for ten <lb/>
days, some for longer; and all this time Sister <lb/>
Dora not only never went to bed, but she scarcely <lb/>
<pb n="221" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0224"/>
ever left the foul atmosphere of the ward. Her <lb/>
friend, the secretary, came and helped her, and <lb/>
one lady always stayed with her at night.</p>
<p>"The surgeon testifies that this was the sole <lb/>
occasion that he ever knew Sister Dora to fortify <lb/>
herself for her work with brandy. Without it she <lb/>
could scarcely have endured those ten fearful days. <lb/>
Many people came desiring to relieve her, and <lb/>
thinking that they could endure the scene if they <lb/>
tried, but in two or three minutes they were sitting, <lb/>
sick and faint with horror, on the stairs, and Sister <lb/>
Dora was laughing over them, and advising them <lb/>
to go home as fast as they could. Two men <lb/>
ultimately recovered."</p>
<p>During a period of three years&mdash;that is, from <lb/>
November, 1871, to November, 1874&mdash;Sister Dora <lb/>
held two services every week at the hospital. An <lb/>
eye-witness, who was a staunch friend of the Sister, <lb/>
recorded her impressions of her influence and <lb/>
labours. She noted that she never came into the <lb/>
wards except with a face of sunshine; she was <lb/>
naturally cheerful, witty, and sociable, and she <lb/>
induced one patient to become quite a leader of <lb/>
the responses at prayers by telling him that his <lb/>
very name &lpar;Clarke&rpar; ought to make him help the <lb/>
parson. Easter Day, Christmas Day, New Year's <lb/>
Day, and Sundays as a whole, she tried to make <lb/>
seasons of exceptional brightness. Penny <reg orig="Read-|ings">Readings</reg> <lb/>
also, or People's Evenings, she sometimes <lb/>
gave, which were highly appreciated. Instead of <lb/>
"cramming religion down people's throats," she <lb/>
patiently bided her time, when she was singularly <lb/>
successful in creating the salutary impression she <lb/>
<pb n="222" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0225"/>
desired. Several sceptics, who had always sworn <lb/>
by Tom Paine and Voltaire, were constrained to <lb/>
admit the beauty and faithfulness of her Christian <lb/>
life.</p>
<p>Serious difficulties arose at the close of 1875 <lb/>
with regard to the Cottage Hospital. One of the <lb/>
wards became completely infected by erysipelas, <lb/>
wounds refusing to heal, and the place seemed <lb/>
impregnated by the poison. The committee came <lb/>
to the conclusion to pull down the old building <lb/>
and to erect a larger and more commodious one <lb/>
in its place. But the work must be carried on <lb/>
meanwhile, and a small house was fitted up in <lb/>
Bridgeman Street as a temporary hospital. It <lb/>
was found to be extremely inconvenient, however, <lb/>
and being close to the railway line, the shrieks of <lb/>
the whistles and engines greatly disturbed the <lb/>
patients who were seriously ill. Sister Dora <reg orig="pro-|cured">procured</reg> <lb/>
relief from this evil by her own intervention. <lb/>
Another mission was held in Walsall, in 1876, and <lb/>
the Sister took part in it, guiding two of the <reg orig="mis-|sioners">missioners</reg> <lb/>
through one of the worst slums of the town, <lb/>
and assisting them in their services. The district <lb/>
had such a bad reputation that a policeman said to <lb/>
her before she entered the mission-room, "Hadn't <lb/>
we better be near, Sister; it's an ugly place?" <lb/>
"Oh no," she replied earnestly, "on no account; <lb/>
it would spoil all; they must not think we are <lb/>
afraid." Then, as the three missioners turned <lb/>
down a narrow court, the most disreputable of all <lb/>
the neighbourhood, the Sister spoke to the clergy, <lb/>
"Now keep close behind me. I am safe enough, <lb/>
but your lives are not worth a moment's purchase, <lb/>
<pb n="223" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0226"/>
if you are seen down here without me to protect <lb/>
you." They came to a small house, brightly <lb/>
lighted, through the window of which she bade <lb/>
them look. What followed is thus described:&mdash;</p>
<p>"They saw a circle of women sitting round a <lb/>
table, evidently receiving orders from an ill-looking <lb/>
man, who appeared to be master. Sister Dora <lb/>
knocked at the door, and received at first no answer; <lb/>
she knocked again, and a man's voice growled, <lb/>
'Who's there?' 'Sister Dora,' was the answer. <lb/>
A volley of oaths was the next sound, coupled <lb/>
with the question, 'What do you mean by coming <lb/>
here at this time of night?' She merely answered <lb/>
'Open the door, it's Sister; I want to speak to you. <lb/>
The man got up swearing, and did as she told him. <lb/>
She stood in the doorway, looking with infinite <lb/>
compassion upon the scene before her, and <reg orig="ex-|horting">exhorting</reg> <lb/>
the man as follows: 'Why, Bill, what <lb/>
possesses you to treat me like this? Don't you <lb/>
remember what you told me, the last time you <lb/>
came up to have that head seen to?' Growls <lb/>
from the man, and muttered oaths, was the <reg orig="re-|joinder">rejoinder</reg>; <lb/>
with orders to 'be quick, and say what <lb/>
she wanted.' 'I'll tell you what I want,' answered <lb/>
Sister Dora, advancing into the room, and holding <lb/>
out her hand, first to one woman and then to <lb/>
another; and as they crowded round her she <lb/>
addressed them severally. 'Well, Lizzie,' or <lb/>
'Mary, how are you?' and 'I've seen you before; <lb/>
did up your arm last winter twelvemonth, but I <lb/>
can't put a name to you;' or 'you came up to see <lb/>
me two months ago.' Then, speaking to them all, <lb/>
'I want you all to go down on your knees with me <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0227"/>
now, this moment, and say a prayer to God.' To <lb/>
the utter amazement of the two clergymen, the <lb/>
man, as well as all the women, knelt with Sister <lb/>
Dora, while she offered up aloud a prayer from the <lb/>
depths of her heart, for her 'brothers and sisters' <lb/>
who were gathered there with her. As the man <lb/>
rose from his knees, he turned to her in a <reg orig="shame-|faced">shamefaced</reg> <lb/>
manner, and said, 'I'm very sorry, Sister, I <lb/>
was so rude to you. I didn't mean it; you've been <lb/>
good to me.' 'Then,' answered she, quickly, 'if <lb/>
you're sorry, will you do what I ask you?' 'That <lb/>
I will,' replied he. 'I want you, and all these <lb/>
women here, to come with me into a room we've got <lb/>
hard by, and listen to something some friends of <lb/>
mine have to say to you there.' Bill at once <reg orig="pre-|pared">prepared</reg> <lb/>
to obey her like a little child, and most of <lb/>
the women followed his example.</p>
<p>"The two clergymen had vanished into the little <lb/>
mission-room, which was soon filled. But they <lb/>
had scarcely begun their service when a rough <lb/>
fellow pushed his way in, accompanied by some <lb/>
women, and set to work shoving and nudging <lb/>
those who were already there, and jeering at them <lb/>
with coarse bitterness. 'Bill' turned to Sister Dora, <lb/>
by whose side he sat, and said imploringly, 'Make <lb/>
him be quiet, Sister; now do.' She rose, saying <lb/>
authoritatively, 'Now then, Jack, none of that. <lb/>
Come and sit you down here by me, and behave <lb/>
yourself.' The dignity of her appearance and <lb/>
manner entirely quelled his savage nature, and as <lb/>
meekly as a lamb Jack came to her side, and the <lb/>
service proceeded, she, seated between the two <lb/>
ruffians, who, under ordinary circumstances, would <lb/>
<pb n="225" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0228"/>
have thought little of murdering anybody who had <lb/>
thus dared to interfere with them."</p>
<p>Many anecdotes similar to this are told, and <lb/>
many strange stories of Sister Dora's work among <lb/>
her fallen sisters. She also did a wonderful <lb/>
work amongst the cab-drivers. She held meetings <lb/>
specially for them, and every cabman in Walsall <lb/>
attended except one, who was compelled to be <lb/>
on duty at the railway station at the time of the <lb/>
meeting. He went to tell her why he could not <lb/>
come, and another cabman, an old patient of hers, <lb/>
told her that she was always to send for him <lb/>
when she wanted a drive, and he would drive her <lb/>
anywhere for nothing, adding that there was only <lb/>
one way he wouldn't drive her, and that was away <lb/>
from Walsall.</p>
<p>Sister Dora began to find her strength failing <lb/>
her during the winter of 1876&ndash;77. She could no <lb/>
longer carry her patients with the old ease and <lb/>
freedom. She consulted a medical man with <lb/>
whom she was on terms of personal friendship, <lb/>
and after a careful examination he told her that <lb/>
she was suffering from a disease which must <lb/>
ultimately prove fatal to her. Surgical aid might, <lb/>
he said, prolong her days, but she resolved to <lb/>
allow the disease to take its natural course, and <lb/>
extracted a promise from him that he would keep <lb/>
the whole matter a secret. She desired to labour <lb/>
up to the last, and this would be impossible if <lb/>
others got to know of her affliction. Outwardly <lb/>
blooming in appearance, and with her fine form <lb/>
apparently enjoying undiminished strength, no <lb/>
one would have guessed that she was really <lb/>
<pb n="226" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0229"/>
within measurable distance of death, and even the <lb/>
doctor himself sometimes felt inclined to recall his <lb/>
opinion. Then she took a pride in her physical <lb/>
strength, which had enabled her to do so much <lb/>
good, and to reach the souls of others through <lb/>
their bodies. To her humble friends she was the <lb/>
personification of their idea of a Saviour, and one <lb/>
of them said after her death, "Sister Dora was <lb/>
as like Jesus Christ as any human creature could <lb/>
be." She threw herself with such energy into her <lb/>
labours, in order to drown the painful knowledge <lb/>
she had acquired, that the committee again and <lb/>
again remonstrated with her, and urged her in <lb/>
vain to allow them to furnish her with efficient <lb/>
help. Every night she used her pony-carriage till <lb/>
between ten and eleven o'clock, visiting patients <lb/>
of all classes who could not be received into the <lb/>
hospital. She was most tender to all whom she <lb/>
thought to be approaching the dark valley, <reg orig="bring-|ing">bringing</reg> <lb/>
to them spiritual comfort wherever she could, <lb/>
as well as bodily alleviation. Without fear she <lb/>
went into the purlieus of Marsh Lane, an infamous <lb/>
district in Walsall, and on more than one occasion <lb/>
put a stop to brutal and bloody encounters with <lb/>
which no other person would dare to have <reg orig="inter-|meddled">intermeddled</reg>. <lb/>
Her motto everywhere, and under all <lb/>
circumstances, was this: "Greater love hath no <lb/>
man than this, that a man lay down his life for <lb/>
his friends." Her expeditions in all weathers <lb/>
brought on an attack of acute inflammation, from <lb/>
which she had not entirely recovered when she <lb/>
longed to go out and nurse the soldiers stricken <lb/>
down in the war between Turkey and Bulgaria.</p>
<pb n="227" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0230"/>
<p>At Christmastide, 1877, she gave a dinner to all <lb/>
her old patients at the temporary hospital, bearing <lb/>
all the expense herself, as was her wont. A feeling <lb/>
had come over her that this was probably her last <lb/>
Christmas on earth, and she wished her friends to <lb/>
remember it. In the spring of 1878 the symptoms <lb/>
of her disease increased so rapidly that she <reg orig="con-|sulted">consulted</reg> <lb/>
Mr. Crompton, the eminent Birmingham <lb/>
surgeon, from whose judgment she felt there could <lb/>
be no appeal. It was established beyond doubt <lb/>
that she was suffering from cancer, and the disease <lb/>
had progressed so much that constant dressing <lb/>
became necessary. This she insisted upon doing <lb/>
herself, which testified to the strength of her nerve, <lb/>
seeing that she was at this very time watching <lb/>
three cases of the same kind in the hospital. Once <lb/>
she saved a child's life by drawing with her mouth <lb/>
the diphtheritic poison from its throat. In June, <lb/>
1878, Sister Dora took a fortnight's holiday, leaving <lb/>
an old friend in charge of her patients. Soon after <lb/>
her return, typhoid fever broke out in the <reg orig="tem-|porary">temporary</reg> <lb/>
hospital in Bridgeman Street, and the place <lb/>
had to be closed. She was now able to leave <reg orig="Wal-|sall">Walsall</reg> <lb/>
for a time&mdash;as the new hospital would not be <lb/>
ready till October&mdash;but before she did so she took <lb/>
all her former patients on a day's visit to Lichfield. <lb/>
The expedition was a delightful one, and marked <lb/>
a red-letter day in the lives of all who shared in it.</p>
<p>During the summer, Sister Dora joined some of <lb/>
her nieces in the Isle of Man. She seemed full of <lb/>
life and energy, greatly enjoying the sea. Later <lb/>
she went over to Paris to see the Exhibition. <lb/>
Returning in September, she went to London to <lb/>
<pb n="228" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0231"/>
study Professor Lister's treatment of wounds, with <lb/>
a view to the employment of his method in the <lb/>
Walsall Hospital. An opportunity was afforded <lb/>
her to attend the distinguished surgeon's operations. <lb/>
Her cough and other symptoms now became so <lb/>
troublesome that she hurried to Birmingham to <lb/>
consult Mr. Crompton again. The agitation and <lb/>
distress of mind from which she suffered brought <lb/>
on fatal symptoms. Mr. Crompton, who greatly <lb/>
admired her, and spoke of her self-control, courage, <lb/>
and devotion as "more than mortal," wished to <lb/>
take her into his own house, but she declined to go <lb/>
anywhere except to Walsall, saying, "Let me die <lb/>
among my own people." She was accordingly <lb/>
conveyed back to Walsall by the surgeon of the <lb/>
Walsall Hospital in his own carriage. The nature <lb/>
of her affliction was not made known, but as she <lb/>
was now laid aside, a report spread like wildfire <lb/>
through Walsall that she was dying of consumption. <lb/>
She now never left her bed, and her sufferings <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg> <lb/>
daily. At her request, none of the members <lb/>
of her family were sent for, but to her friend Mrs. <lb/>
H<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g7"/> the sufferer was at length obliged to reveal <lb/>
the true nature of her disease, as she was no longer <lb/>
able to dress her wound herself in the doctor's <lb/>
absence. As soon as two of her sisters heard of <lb/>
her illness, they went to Walsall to nurse her, but <lb/>
she would not permit it, and they left without <lb/>
learning the nature of her complaint. Sister Dora <lb/>
seems to have been morbidly sensitive on this <lb/>
point, and she was very anxious that people should <lb/>
not say she had taken cancer from one of her <lb/>
patients, or had killed herself by her mode of life.</p>
<pb n="229" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0232"/>
<p>Sometimes she was filled with joy at the prospect <lb/>
of a speedy release from her sufferings; at other <lb/>
times a dread of death would come over her. But <lb/>
she strove to cling to her Saviour through all, and <lb/>
drew comfort from the fact that He could <reg orig="sym-|pathize">sympathize</reg> <lb/>
with her, for her sufferings were light when <lb/>
compared with His. There was one bright gleam <lb/>
on November 4, when the Mayor of Walsall <reg orig="de-|clared">declared</reg> <lb/>
the new hospital to be open," in the name of <lb/>
Sister Dora." Friends she continued to receive for <lb/>
some lime longer, and her natural joyousness of <lb/>
disposition so triumphed over pain sometimes, that <lb/>
superficial observers thought she might recover; <lb/>
but she knew that her days were numbered, and <lb/>
that the last had almost come. She now busied <lb/>
herself in making presents to her friends and <lb/>
patients, accompanying them with wise counsels <lb/>
or words of warning. The closing scene Miss <lb/>
Lonsdale thus describes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"On Saturday, December 21, it became evident <lb/>
that the end was really drawing near, and Mrs. <lb/>
H<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g8"/> came, determined not to leave her dear <lb/>
mistress until all was over. Sister Dora's <reg orig="de-|pression">depression</reg> <lb/>
now seemed greater than before, and a <lb/>
dread, amounting to horror, of the last pangs of <lb/>
death came upon her. She had extracted from <lb/>
the doctor, with some difficulty, his opinion that <lb/>
the end would probably come during one of her <lb/>
fits of coughing. These were now almost incessant, <lb/>
and the thought of death during one of these <lb/>
paroxysms seemed to cause her anxious terror. <lb/>
At times all was loneliness and darkness; but still <lb/>
the faith in which her life had been passed stood <lb/>
<pb n="230" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0233"/>
her in such good stead that one of her nurses, who <lb/>
had watched many death-beds, testified, 'I <hi rend="italic">never</hi> <lb/>
saw such faith and patience.' Mrs. H<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g9"/> said to <lb/>
her, 'Why, Sister, think how many friends you <lb/>
are going to;' and this idea of a welcome from <lb/>
those souls whom she had herself led to God, <reg orig="com-|forted">comforted</reg> <lb/>
her not a little. She repeatedly said, 'Oh, <lb/>
I hope I shall sing my Christmas carol in heaven;' <lb/>
but as each day passed, her hope of release before <lb/>
Christmas Day grew fainter. On Monday night <lb/>
the pain became terrible, and early on Tuesday <lb/>
morning, December 24, she said,'I am dying; run <lb/>
for Sister Ellen.' Meanwhile, Mrs. H<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g10"/> tried <lb/>
to soothe her, saying, 'Our Blessed Lord is <reg orig="stand-|ing">standing</reg> <lb/>
at the gates of heaven to open them for you.' <lb/>
But she no longer needed such consolation, for all <lb/>
her darkness was gone, and she answered, 'I see <lb/>
Him there! The gates are opened wide.' Mrs. <lb/>
H<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g11"/>'s thoughts &lpar;as she afterwards said&rpar; turned <lb/>
involuntarily to the little girl dying of her burns, <lb/>
and she wondered if the child would also be at the <lb/>
gates with her bunch of flowers. When all human <lb/>
efforts for her relief had been exhausted, she said, <lb/>
as they stood watching her, 'I have lived alone, let <lb/>
me die alone;' repeating,'let me die alone,' till they <lb/>
were forced to leave her, one friend only watching <lb/>
through the half-open door. For some hours she <lb/>
lived on. All pain seemed to have left her; and <lb/>
about two p.m. the anxious watcher only knew, by <lb/>
a slight change of position, that Sister Dora's life <lb/>
was gone."</p>
<p>The whole population of Walsall followed the <lb/>
body of Sister Dora to the grave, while mourners <lb/>
<pb n="231" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0234"/>
came from a distance, including Bishops Selwyn <lb/>
and Abraham, her personal friends, and every <lb/>
public body of the district was represented. <reg orig="Per-|haps">Perhaps</reg> <lb/>
what would have touched the dead more, <lb/>
could she have been cognizant of it, was the <lb/>
fact that "hundreds of the poor, the maimed, the <lb/>
halt, and the blind, were there; and miserable, <lb/>
ragged women, as well as half-starved children, <lb/>
with the marks of real grief and distress on their <lb/>
faces, walked long distances to say good-bye to <lb/>
the best friend they had ever known." In 1886 <lb/>
the working men of Walsall erected a monument <lb/>
to her memory.</p>
<p>Sister Dora was one of the most helpful of her <lb/>
sex in times of pain, difficulty, and sorrow. She <lb/>
had a great hopefulness which communicated itself <lb/>
to her patients. Other characteristics will have <lb/>
been apparent in the course of this sketch. She <lb/>
had a strong intellect, a noble heart, and a saintly <lb/>
spirit. One who knew her well, a Nonconformist <lb/>
minister, said that she loved her Church, but kept <lb/>
still a place in her heart for all who belonged to <lb/>
other communions. Her liberality was unbounded, <lb/>
but perhaps the grandest lesson to be derived <lb/>
from her career is that we ought never to despair <lb/>
of humanity. However obscured the Divine image <lb/>
may be in man, it is possible for such love and <lb/>
compassion as Sister Dora's to assist in recovering <lb/>
some lineaments of it, by leading back the soul <lb/>
through this human affection to the ineffable love <lb/>
and tenderness of the Father.</p>

LOUISA MAY ALCOTT.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> the character of this most popular writer of <lb/>
children's books there was a triple combination&mdash; <lb/>
that of the practical, the educational, and the <lb/>
literary. She rendered signal service to her day <lb/>
and generation in all of these aspects; and her <lb/>
chequered life, with its successes on the one hand, <lb/>
and its difficulties and discouragements on the <lb/>
other, offers many points of interest to those of <lb/>
her sex engaged in the battle of life. Miss Alcott <lb/>
had decided gifts by nature, but the real secret of <lb/>
her influence in the world was in discovering what <lb/>
she was best able to do, and doing it with all her <lb/>
might.</p>
<p>Louisa May Alcott was the second child of <lb/>
Amos Bronson and Abba May Alcott, and was <lb/>
born at Germantown, Pennsylvania, on November <lb/>
29, 1832. Both parents came of highly esteemed <lb/>
Northern families. Mr. Alcott was a noted <reg orig="edu-|cationist">educationist</reg>, <lb/>
whose writings were somewhat tinged <lb/>
with mysticism. Mrs. Alcott was the daughter of <lb/>
Colonel John May of Boston, and the sister of the <lb/>
Rev. Samuel J, May, one of the anti-slavery <lb/>
pioneers and philanthropists. A woman of fine <lb/>
<pb n="236" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0239"/>
physique and noble character, Mrs. Alcott seems <lb/>
to have exercised a strong and enduring influence <lb/>
over her children. Her husband being an idealist, <lb/>
with limited means of support, the struggle for <lb/>
existence brought with it many trials and <reg orig="priva-|tions">privations</reg>, <lb/>
with which she was mainly called upon to <lb/>
grapple. The family moved to Boston in 1834, <lb/>
and Mr. Alcott opened in the Masonic Temple a <lb/>
school, which afterwards acquired celebrity. Louisa <lb/>
seems to have been a most affectionate and <reg orig="attrac-|tive">attractive</reg> <lb/>
child, with a heart full of love for all mankind. <lb/>
In 1840 Mr. Alcott gave up his school, and <reg orig="re-|moved">removed</reg> <lb/>
with his family to Concord. They inhabited <lb/>
a cottage which is described in "Little Women" <lb/>
as Meg's first home. It was a pleasant abode, in <lb/>
the midst of a garden full of trees, and there was <lb/>
a large barn in which the children enacted their <lb/>
games and little plays. One winter's morning a <lb/>
half-starved bird was found in the garden. Louisa <lb/>
warmed and fed it, and drew from the incident <lb/>
inspiration for her little poem, "The Robin," which <lb/>
had very unusual merit for a child of eight. The <lb/>
father now gave close attention to the education <lb/>
of his daughters, instilling into their hearts at the <lb/>
same time lessons of love and wisdom. His high <lb/>
spiritual life impressed them deeply, but not with <lb/>
a sense of fear, and he taught them to open their <lb/>
hearts to him for instruction and sympathy.</p>
<p>In a sketch describing her childhood, Miss <lb/>
Alcott says: "I became an Abolitionist at a very <lb/>
early age, but have never been able to decide <lb/>
whether I was made so by seeing the portrait of <lb/>
George Thompson hidden under a bed in our <lb/>
<pb n="237" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0240"/>
house during the Lloyd Garrison riot, and going <lb/>
to comfort 'the poor man who had been good to <lb/>
the slaves,' or because I was saved from drowning <lb/>
in the Frog Pond some years later by a coloured <lb/>
boy. However that may be, the conversion was <lb/>
genuine, and my greatest pride is in the fact that <lb/>
I lived to know the brave men and women who <lb/>
did so much for the cause, and that I had a very <lb/>
small share in the war which put an end to a great <lb/>
wrong." Mr. Alcott taught his children in the <lb/>
wise way which unfolds what lies in the child's <lb/>
nature, as a flower blooms, rather than crammed <lb/>
it with more than it could digest. Arithmetic <lb/>
and grammar were distasteful to Louisa, but she <lb/>
greatly enjoyed reading, writing, composition, <lb/>
history, and geography. The "Pilgrim's <reg orig="Pro-|gress">Progress</reg>," <lb/>
Krummacher's "Parables," and fairy-tales, <lb/>
were in great request; and on Sundays there was <lb/>
a simple service for the little ones of Bible stories, <lb/>
hymns, and improving conversation. Nature was <lb/>
also made to play a conspicuous part in their <lb/>
education, and they grew to have an intense love <lb/>
for her.</p>
<p>In 1843, Mr. Alcott and a company of <reg orig="fellow-|enthusiasts">fellow-enthusiasts</reg>, <lb/>
who were vegetarians and <reg orig="transcen-|dentalists">transcendentalists</reg>, <lb/>
took a farm at Harvard, which they <lb/>
named Fruitlands,and where they lived in common. <lb/>
It was a time of trial for Mrs. Alcott, who was so <lb/>
devoted to her husband that she aided him in <lb/>
carrying out his plans, although she by no means <lb/>
shared all his views. The farm experiences had <lb/>
their serious as well as their comical side, and <lb/>
Louisa wrote a faithful account of the colony <lb/>
<pb n="238" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0241"/>
in her delightful story entitled, "Transcendental <lb/>
Wild Oats." Emerson was charmed by his friend <lb/>
Alcott's experiment, though he did not see his <lb/>
way to join in it. Louisa revelled in botany <lb/>
lessons in the woods, and in the evenings was <lb/>
enraptured by reading Scott's "Kenilworth," and <lb/>
the "Heart of Midlothian," Bremer's "Homes," <lb/>
and the "Vicar of Wakefield." At twelve years <lb/>
of age, her own compositions showed a singular <lb/>
ripeness of thought and expression, and at fifteen <lb/>
she had made a close study of Goethe's works, <lb/>
which ever afterwards held the highest place <lb/>
with her. From a very early period, her religious <lb/>
feelings were deep and strong. "She does not <lb/>
appear to have suffered from doubt or <reg orig="question-|ing">questioning</reg>, <lb/>
but to have gone on her way fighting <lb/>
all the real evils that were presented to her, <lb/>
trusting in a sure power of right, and confident <lb/>
of victory."</p>
<p>The Fruitlands experiment proved a disastrous <lb/>
failure, and the impoverished Alcott family returned <lb/>
to Concord. The hardships of poverty were now <lb/>
experienced, but there was a rare bond of love <lb/>
between parents and children, so that their reverses <lb/>
of fortune were bravely borne. On the death of <lb/>
her father, Mrs. Alcott came in for a small amount <lb/>
of property, and this, combined with five hundred <lb/>
dollars from Emerson&mdash;"who was always the good <lb/>
providence of the family"&mdash;enabled the Alcotts, <lb/>
in 1845, to buy the house known as Hillside, in <lb/>
Concord. This house was afterwards occupied by <lb/>
Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was here that Louisa <lb/>
Alcott spent the happiest time of her life. Yet <lb/>
<pb n="239" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0242"/>
there were many privations still to encounter, and <lb/>
the family frequently went short of the necessaries <lb/>
of life. In 1848 they removed to Boston, where <lb/>
both Mr. and Mrs. Alcott found occupation, and <lb/>
the burden was lightened. Three rules were given <lb/>
to Louisa by her mother for her guidance: "Rule <lb/>
yourself; love your neighbour; do the duty which <lb/>
lies nearest you." These rules were observed by <lb/>
Miss Alcott all her life through. It was no common <lb/>
child who at the age of fourteen could write a <lb/>
poem, "My Little Kingdom," in which this stanza <lb/>
occurred:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"I do not ask for any crown,</l>
<l rend="indent">But that which all may win,</l>
<l>Nor seek to conquer any world</l>
<l rend="indent">Except the one within.</l>
<l>Be Thou my guide until I find,</l>
<l rend="indent">Led by a tender hand,</l>
<l>Thy happy kingdom in <hi rend="italic">myself,</hi></l>
<l rend="indent">And dare to take command."</l>
</lg></q>
In 1850 Miss Alcott headed her diary, "The <lb/>
Sentimental Period." She was then seventeen, <lb/>
and seems to have indulged for Emerson that kind <lb/>
of ideal hero worship described in Goethe's "<reg orig="Corre-|spondence">Correspondence</reg> <lb/>
with a Child." Emerson had a refining <lb/>
and elevating influence upon her, "and her intimate <lb/>
acquaintance with his beautiful home chastened <lb/>
her idolatry into pure reverent friendship which <lb/>
never failed her." At this period, also, she <reg orig="con-|ceived">conceived</reg> <lb/>
a great passion for the stage, and wrote a <lb/>
number of plays, which were performed at home. <lb/>
In 1851 Louisa had a brief but painful experience <lb/>
as helper and companion in a small family, and <lb/>
she enshrined her sorrows and disappointments in <lb/>
<pb n="240" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0243"/>
the sketch entitled," How I went out to Service." <lb/>
At the age of sixteen her first story was printed, and <lb/>
she received five dollars for it Next she kept a <lb/>
school for some time. But she was ill adapted to <lb/>
the routine of this work, and it was a great relief <lb/>
to her when she found that her literary <reg orig="produc-|tions">productions</reg> <lb/>
began to bring in the much-needed money <lb/>
for family support.</p>
<p>When twenty-two years of age, Miss Alcott <lb/>
formally began her career of authorship by the <lb/>
publication of her volume of tales called "Flower <lb/>
Fables." "About this time," observes her <reg orig="biogra-|pher">biographer</reg>, <lb/>
Miss Cheney, "Miss Alcott mentions a <lb/>
young friend who died in her arms, and speaks of <lb/>
going to console the sister in her loneliness. This <lb/>
shows how warmly her heart beat for others while <lb/>
her head was so busy with her ambitious plans. <lb/>
She speaks also of the hint of a new story called <lb/>
'The Cost of an Idea.' She never lost sight of <lb/>
this plan, but did not carry it out. Her father's <lb/>
life and character were in her mind, and she <lb/>
longed to portray the conflict between his high <lb/>
ideal and the practical difficulties of his life; but <lb/>
it was an impossible subject. The Fruitlands <lb/>
episode was told in 'Transcendental Wild Oats,' <lb/>
and his early life in 'Elis's Education.' But <lb/>
although her admiration and affection for him are <lb/>
abundantly shown in her journals, she never, <lb/>
perhaps, understood him so thoroughly that she <lb/>
could adequately portray his personality; neither <lb/>
could she do justice to all related to him <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
trenching upon the privacy due to sacred <lb/>
feelings."</p>
<pb n="241" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0244"/>
<p>In October, 1857, the family again removed to <lb/>
Concord, and in their new abode, Orchard House, <lb/>
Louisa Alcott devotedly nursed her sister Elizabeth <lb/>
until her death, which resulted from gradual <lb/>
decline. "This young girl was tenderly beloved <lb/>
by all the family, and was indeed as pure, refined, <lb/>
and holy as she is represented as Beth in 'Little <lb/>
Women.'" This was the first break in the family, <lb/>
and the mother never fully recovered from the <lb/>
shock. In the presence of death, Louisa was <lb/>
always calm and strong; it had no terrors for her. <lb/>
The marriage of her elder sister next occurred, <lb/>
and more than one offer was made to Louisa, but <lb/>
her heart was bound up in those of her own <lb/>
household, and she had no inclination towards <lb/>
matrimony. Literary work began to increase with <lb/>
her, and it was a day of triumph when she first <lb/>
made her appearance in the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly.</hi> <lb/>
Stories now followed each other in quick succession <lb/>
from her prolific brain. Her father also secured <lb/>
the appointment of Superintendent of Schools in <lb/>
Concord; so she heads her diary for 1860, "A Year <lb/>
of Good Luck."</p>
<p>War was declared with the South in 1861, and <lb/>
Louisa was fired with patriotic enthusiasm like <lb/>
the rest of her family, and took an active part in <lb/>
fitting out the Concord youths for the army. Then <lb/>
she became absorbed in writing her first novel, <lb/>
"Moods." Though her own favourite, it was the <lb/>
least successful of all her books. In the heroine, <lb/>
Sylvia, she meant to represent much of her own <lb/>
nature, but many portions of the work seemed <lb/>
unreal, and it consequently failed to grip the <lb/>
<pb n="242" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0245"/>
public. She was very busy in the house at this <lb/>
time, for the daughters of John Brown, the hero <lb/>
of Harper's Ferry, came to board with the Alcotts. <lb/>
In 1862, at the suggestion of Miss Peabody, Miss <lb/>
Alcott made an attempt to keep a Kindergarten <lb/>
school, but it was not successful, and she finally <lb/>
abandoned the teacher's profession and returned <lb/>
to literature. Her story of "Work" was the first <lb/>
considerable result, and in the life of the heroine, <lb/>
her own experiences as servant, governess, <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg>, <lb/>
seamstress, and actress are depicted. The <lb/>
book was well and vividly written, and became <lb/>
popular. Now came a memorable period in the <lb/>
novelist's life, which is thus described by her <lb/>
friend and biographer:&mdash;</p>
<p>Miss Alcott could not help feeling deeply the <lb/>
excitement of the hour when the war broke out. <lb/>
Her father had been one of the earliest <reg orig="Aboli-|tionists">Abolitionists</reg>, <lb/>
having joined the Anti-slavery Society <lb/>
with Garrison, and she well remembered the <lb/>
fugitive slave whom her mother had hidden in the <lb/>
oven. Now this feeling could be united with her <lb/>
patriotic zeal, and her strong love of active life, <lb/>
and it was inevitable that she should long to share <lb/>
personally in the dangers and excitement of the <lb/>
war.</p>
<p>"Louisa had always been the nurse in the <lb/>
family, and had by nature the magnetic power <lb/>
which encourages and helps the feeble and <reg orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg>; <lb/>
therefore, since no other way of serving the <lb/>
cause opened to her, it was most like her to take <lb/>
her own life in her hands and join the corps of <lb/>
devoted nurses. She was accepted, and went to <lb/>
<pb n="243" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0246"/>
Washington. Her journal gives an account of her <lb/>
situation in the Union Hospital at Georgetown. <lb/>
It was a small hospital, much inferior in its <lb/>
appointments to those which were afterwards <lb/>
arranged. Although Louisa had never been very <lb/>
ill up to that time, and thought herself <reg orig="excep-|tionally">exceptionally</reg> <lb/>
strong, yet she had not the rugged <reg orig="con-|stitution">constitution</reg> <lb/>
fit to bear the labours and exposures of <lb/>
such a position; and the healthful habits of <reg orig="out-|door">outdoor</reg> <lb/>
life and simple food to which she had always <lb/>
been accustomed made the conditions of the <lb/>
crowded, ill-ventilated hospital peculiarly perilous <lb/>
to her. She says, 'I was never ill before this <lb/>
time, and never well afterwards.'</p>
<p>"But with all its hardships, Miss Alcott found <lb/>
in the hospital the varied and intense human life <lb/>
she had longed to know. Her great heart went <lb/>
out to all the men, black or white, the Virginia <lb/>
blacksmith and the rough Michigander. She even <lb/>
tried to befriend the one solitary rebel who had <lb/>
got left behind, and who was taken into the <lb/>
hospital to the disgust of some of the men; but <lb/>
he was impervious to all kindness, and she could <lb/>
find nothing in him for sympathy or romance to <lb/>
fasten upon.</p>
<p>"Miss Alcott remained in the hospital only <lb/>
about six weeks. Yet this short period had a very <lb/>
strong influence, both for good and evil, on her <lb/>
future life. The severe attack of fever which drove <lb/>
her from her post left her with shattered nerves <lb/>
and weakened constitution, and she never again <lb/>
knew the fulness of life and health which she <lb/>
had before. The chamber in her quiet home at <lb/>
<pb n="244" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0247"/>
Concord was evermore haunted by the fearful <lb/>
visions of delirium, and she could not regain there <lb/>
the peace she needed for work. But the experience <lb/>
of life, the observation of men under the <reg orig="excite-|ment">excitement</reg> <lb/>
of war, the way in which they met the great <lb/>
conqueror, Death, the revelations of heroism and <lb/>
love, and sometimes of bitterness and hate, brought <lb/>
her a deeper insight into human life than she ever <lb/>
had before, and gave to her writings greater <lb/>
reality."</p>
<p>Graphic letters written by Miss Alcott in the <lb/>
hospital were published in the <hi rend="italic">Commonwealth</hi>, <lb/>
and afterwards collected into a volume entitled, <lb/>
"Hospital Sketches." Although these sketches <lb/>
were hastily written, they were full of life and <lb/>
colour; and their vigour and originality gave them <lb/>
a great charm. While in the hospital at <reg orig="George-|town">Georgetown</reg>, <lb/>
Miss Alcott often felt home-sick, heart-sick, <lb/>
and worn out, yet she found new hope and <lb/>
pleasure in comforting, tending, and cheering the <lb/>
poor soldiers, who felt her sympathy though <reg orig="un-|spoken">unspoken</reg>, <lb/>
and who were docile, respectful, and <lb/>
affectionate in demeanour. One man in particular, <lb/>
a Virginia blacksmith, was the prince of patients, <lb/>
a perfect gentleman, with a noble character&mdash;a <lb/>
nature fresh and frank as any child's, and a heart <lb/>
as warm and tender as a woman's. Though <lb/>
mortally wounded, he died royally, without <reg orig="re-|proach">reproach</reg>, <lb/>
repining, or remorse. The "Hospital <lb/>
Sketches" had an extensive sale, and publishers <lb/>
now eagerly sought out the author. She was ill <lb/>
for a long time after returning from her hospital <lb/>
work, but as soon as she recovered sufficiently, she <lb/>
<pb n="245" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0248"/>
dramatized six scenes from Dickens, which were <lb/>
produced by the author and her friends for the <lb/>
benefit of the Sanitary Fair in Boston, when the <lb/>
entertainments realized &pound;5000. Stories for the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Atlantic</hi> and other periodicals were produced with <lb/>
great rapidity, and she received a handsome sum <lb/>
for the copyright of "Moods," so that at the end <lb/>
of 1864, she triumphantly wrote in her diary that <lb/>
"the year closed with enough to make her feel <lb/>
free of debt, and the family comfortable." The <lb/>
following year was spent mostly in Boston, where <lb/>
she went a good deal into literary society, enjoying <lb/>
greatly interchanges of thought with those similarly <lb/>
engaged with herself, and appearing frequently <lb/>
with brilliant success in theatrical representations for <lb/>
charities. Henry James and his wife received her <lb/>
especially with great kindness, and their son, now <lb/>
the eminent novelist, wrote an article on "Moods," <lb/>
in the <hi rend="italic">North American Review</hi>. "Being a literary <lb/>
youth," she na&iuml;vely says, "he gave me advice as <lb/>
if he had been eighty and I a girl."</p>
<p>Early in April, 1865, the news of the taking of <lb/>
Richmond was received with great enthusiasm it <lb/>
Boston. In a few days, however, it was followed by <lb/>
the sad intelligence of the President's assassination, <lb/>
and the city went into mourning. "I am glad," <lb/>
writes Miss Alcott, "to have seen such a strange <lb/>
and sudden change in a nation's feelings. Saw <lb/>
the great procession, and though few coloured men <lb/>
were in it, one was walking arm-in-arm with a <lb/>
white gentleman, and I exulted thereat." The <lb/>
autumn of 1865, and the first six months of 1866, <lb/>
Miss Alcott spent in England and Europe. She <lb/>
<pb n="246" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0249"/>
had for years indulged a strange longing to visit <lb/>
Europe, and as her health had been seriously <lb/>
injured by the attack of fever in the hospital, <lb/>
without some such change, she had no longer the <lb/>
physical energy to sustain the unceasing activity <lb/>
of her brain. As an opportunity was offered her <lb/>
to go to Europe as companion to an invalid lady <lb/>
she accepted it. At Vevay in Switzerland, she <lb/>
made the acquaintance of a young Polish lad, who <lb/>
was the original of the charming Laurie in "Little <lb/>
Women." He had great musical talent, which <lb/>
gave her keen delight, and he on his part looked <lb/>
up to her with something of the reverential feeling <lb/>
of a son. She met with him again in Paris, <lb/>
and at a later date he visited her in her American <lb/>
home. Miss Alcott gave up the task of nursing her <lb/>
patient, and went on to London, where she passed <lb/>
several weeks of profound enjoyment, visiting all <lb/>
the places of interest, and meeting the literary and <lb/>
political "lions" of the day. "That Louisa might <lb/>
have these few weeks of entire relaxation and <reg orig="en-|joyment">enjoyment</reg>," <lb/>
remarks Miss Cheney, "her mother had <lb/>
been obliged to borrow means for the support of <lb/>
the family; and Louisa was very anxious to clear <lb/>
off this debt, like all others. She was very exact <lb/>
in pecuniary matters. Money to her was not an <lb/>
end, but a most necessary means. She paid every <lb/>
debt that her father had incurred, even though <lb/>
outlawed by time. It is often asked whether she <lb/>
ever sold her beautiful hair, as represented in <lb/>
'Little Women.' The deed was never really done, <lb/>
but she and her sisters always held this treasure <lb/>
as a possible resource in case of need; and Louisa <lb/>
<pb n="247" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0250"/>
once says in her journal, 'I will pay my debts, <lb/>
if I have to sell my hair to do it.' She even went <lb/>
so far as to inquire of a barber as to its money <lb/>
value."</p>
<p>When she returned to America in July, 1866, <lb/>
she devoted herself with renewed energy to the <lb/>
personal care of her mother, now aging fast, and <lb/>
to story-writing for the support of the family. In <lb/>
addition to innumerable sketches, she set to work <lb/>
on her famous book, "Little Women," which was <lb/>
finished in July, 1868. It described the early life <lb/>
of her home, and its pictures are so true and <lb/>
natural that its popularity increased year by year, <lb/>
a popularity which has been continued into a <lb/>
second generation. "Mothers who read it in their <lb/>
childhood renew their enjoyment as they watch <lb/>
the faces of their little girls brighten with smiles <lb/>
over the theatricals in the barn, or their eyes <lb/>
moisten into tears at the death of the beloved sister. <lb/>
One of the greatest charms of the book is its <lb/>
perfect truth to New England life. But it is not <lb/>
merely local, it touches the universal heart deeply.</p>
<p>"The excitement of the children was intense; <lb/>
they claimed the author as their own property, <lb/>
and felt as if she were interpreting their very <lb/>
lives and thoughts. The second series was <reg orig="antici-|pated">anticipated</reg> <lb/>
with the eagerness of a bulletin from the <lb/>
war and the stock market. But unlike Miss <lb/>
Alcott herself, the children took especial interest <lb/>
in the love-story, and when poor Laurie was so <lb/>
obstinately refused by Jo, 'they wept aloud and <lb/>
refused to be comforted,' and in some instances <lb/>
were actually made ill by grief and excitement."</p>
<pb n="248" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0251"/>
<p>The second part, which was eagerly demanded <lb/>
by thousands of little women outside the charmed <lb/>
circle, was finished by January, 1869. She did not <lb/>
quite see her way to answer the almost universal <lb/>
demand that she should make all the girls marry, <lb/>
though she found a husband for Jo, by creating <lb/>
a German professor for her, whose strong and <lb/>
genial personality, and high moral character, are <lb/>
again prominent in "Jo's Boys." "Little Women" <lb/>
was translated into French, German, and Dutch, <lb/>
and it had also a large sale in England. The girls <lb/>
in these books act as girls, and not as precocious <lb/>
women. All is easy, graceful, natural, and there <lb/>
are many touches of humour as well as of deep <reg orig="feel-|ing">feeling</reg> <lb/>
in the stories. Miss Alcott's publishers, Messrs. <lb/>
Roberts Brothers, took many troubles off her <lb/>
hands, and treated her generously. At Christmas, <lb/>
1869, we find her writing to them, thanking them for <lb/>
an unexpected cheque which made her Christmas <lb/>
an unusually merry one, and adding: "After <reg orig="toil-|ing">toiling</reg> <lb/>
so many years along the uphill road&mdash;always <lb/>
a hard one to women-writers&mdash;it is peculiarly <lb/>
grateful to me to find the way growing easier <lb/>
at last, with pleasant little surprises blossoming <lb/>
on either side, and the rough places made smooth <lb/>
by the courtesy and kindness of those who have <lb/>
proved themselves friends as well as publishers."</p>
<p>Miss Alcott fell ill in 1869, and notwithstanding <lb/>
visits to Canada and other places, her health did <lb/>
not improve, and she completely lost her voice <lb/>
in January, 1870. For this she tried "heroic <reg orig="treat-|ment">treatment</reg>," <lb/>
under a distinguished physician. With <lb/>
the courage which always animated her, she went <lb/>
<pb n="249" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0252"/>
on at intervals with her work, and completed her <lb/>
new story, "The Old-fashioned Girl," which was <lb/>
published in March, 1870. "I wrote it," she says, <lb/>
"with left hand in a sling, one foot up, head aching, <lb/>
and no voice. Yet, as the book is funny, people <lb/>
will say, 'Didn't you enjoy doing it?' I often <lb/>
think of poor Tom Hood as I scribble, rather than <lb/>
lie and groan. I certainly earn my living by the <lb/>
sweat of my brow." The book is singularly bright, <lb/>
fresh, and wholesome to have been produced under <lb/>
such circumstances. Happily the receipts from <lb/>
"Little Women" continued to be so large that <lb/>
the author was enabled to go abroad for the rest <lb/>
and change she so much needed. Her experiences <lb/>
during this second trip to Europe were published <lb/>
in one of the volumes of "Aunt Jo's Scrap-Bag" <lb/>
called "Shawl-straps." All the interesting French <lb/>
and swiss towns were visited, and she and her <lb/>
party were fortunately over the Swiss Frontier <lb/>
when the great was of 1870 broke out. In October <lb/>
they journeyed into Italy by the Simplon Pass. The <lb/>
journey was perfect, with its sunlight and <reg orig="moon-|light">moonlight</reg> <lb/>
effects, and its magnificent scenery all the <lb/>
way to the Lake of Como. "Crossing the Simplon <lb/>
is an experience worth having; for without any <lb/>
real danger, fatigue, or hardship, one sees some <lb/>
of the finest as well as most awful parts of these <lb/>
wonderful Alps. The road&mdash;a miracle in itself, <lb/>
for all Nature seems to protest against it, and the <lb/>
elements never tire of trying to destroy it. Only <lb/>
a Napoleon would have dreamed of making a <lb/>
path through such a place."</p>
<p>While Miss Alcott was in Rome she received <lb/>
<pb n="250" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0253"/>
news of the death of her beloved brother-in-law, <lb/>
Mr. John Pratt. His loss was deeply felt both for <lb/>
his own sake and the family he left behind. It <lb/>
was characteristic of Miss Alcott that when the <lb/>
first stress of grief was over she began to do <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
towards the support of the surviving wife and <lb/>
children. she found comfort in writing "Little <lb/>
Men," which was published when she reached <lb/>
home in June, 1871. Fifty thousand copies were <lb/>
ordered of this favourite work before the day of <lb/>
publication. At forty years of age, this popular <lb/>
author had made her family independent, and paid <lb/>
all its debts, thus completing a task she had <lb/>
set herself twenty years before.</p>
<p>In 1872&ndash;73 her chief literary occupation was the <lb/>
composition of "Work," a novel which represents <lb/>
her own personal experience more than any other <lb/>
book. Its excellence was astonishing, seeing that <lb/>
it was produced at a time of great anxiety, when <lb/>
her mother was ill, and the writer herself suffered <lb/>
terribly from sleeplessness. In March, 1874, she <lb/>
welcomed home her sister May, for whom she had <lb/>
provided an artistic training in Europe. May <lb/>
Alcott brought back with her a portfolio full of <lb/>
fine work. She had copied Turner so well that <lb/>
Ruskin&mdash;seeing her at work in the National Gallery <lb/>
&mdash;told her that she had "caught Turner's spirit <lb/>
wonderfully." Her original sketches of <reg orig="West-|minster">Westminster</reg> <lb/>
Abbey, etc., were also most meritorious. <lb/>
Louisa Alcott took a deep interest in the woman <lb/>
suffrage question, at a time when it was very <reg orig="un-|popular">unpopular</reg>. <lb/>
She was not fond of appearing on public <lb/>
platforms, but "she always put herself bravely on <lb/>
<pb n="251" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0254"/>
the side of the unpopular cause, and lent to it all <lb/>
the argument of her heroic life." Attending the <lb/>
meeting of the Women's Congress at Syracuse, in <lb/>
October, 1875, "she was introduced to the audience <lb/>
by Mrs. Livermore, and the young people crowded <lb/>
about her like bees about a honeycomb. She was <lb/>
waylaid in the streets, petitioned for autographs, <lb/>
kissed by gushing young maidens, and made <lb/>
emphatically the lion of the hour. It was all so <lb/>
genial and spontaneous that she enjoyed the <lb/>
fun. No amount of adulation ever affected the <lb/>
natural simplicity of her manners. She neither <lb/>
despised nor over-rated her fame; but was glad of <lb/>
it as a proof of success in what she was ever <reg orig="aim-|ing">aiming</reg> <lb/>
to do. She spent a few weeks in New York, <lb/>
enjoying the gay literary society which was freely <lb/>
opened to her; but finding most satisfaction in <lb/>
visiting the Tombs, the Newsboys' Home, and <lb/>
Randall's Island, for she liked these things better <lb/>
than parties and dinners."</p>
<p>Writing to her nephews from New York, she <lb/>
gave them an interesting sketch of her visit to the <lb/>
Newsboys' Home. Here is an extract from her <lb/>
letter: "A nice big house has been built for them, <lb/>
with dining-room and kitchen on the first floor, <lb/>
bathrooms and schoolroom next, two big <reg orig="sleeping-|places&mdash;third">sleepingplaces&mdash;third</reg> <lb/>
and fourth stories&mdash;and at the top <lb/>
a laundry and gymnasium. We saw all the tables <lb/>
set for breakfast&mdash;a plate and bowl for each&mdash;and <lb/>
in the kitchen great kettles, four times as big as our <lb/>
copper boiler, for tea and coffee, soup, and meat. <lb/>
They have bread and meat and coffee for <reg orig="break-|fast">breakfast</reg>, <lb/>
and bread and cheese and tea for supper, and <lb/>
<pb n="254" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0255"/>
the teachers, who were ladylike and very devoted, <lb/>
did not go mad while fulfilling their duties. On <lb/>
reaching home after a fatiguing day, Miss Alcott <lb/>
wrote: "My Christmas Day was without dinner <lb/>
or presents, for the first time since I can remember. <lb/>
Yet it has been a very memorable day, and I feel <lb/>
as if I'd had a splendid feast seeing the poor babies <lb/>
wallow in turkey soup, and that every gift I put <lb/>
into their hands had come back to me in the dumb <lb/>
delight of their unchild-like faces trying to smile."</p>
<p>Miss Alcott's "Eight Cousins," and its sequel, <lb/>
"A Rose in Bloom"&mdash;two volumes in the Little <lb/>
Women Series, were written in 1876, and these <lb/>
were followed in 1877 by one of the sweetest and <lb/>
brightest of the series, "Under the Lilacs." It <lb/>
was written at Concord, and the animal studies are <lb/>
remarkably natural. Her next venture was a novel <lb/>
for the No Name Series, which she entitled, "A <lb/>
Modern Mephistopheles." It was wholly different <lb/>
in character from her children's books, and was <lb/>
produced under the influence of Goethe and <reg orig="Haw-|thorne">Hawthorne</reg>. <lb/>
It is powerful but morbid, and while <lb/>
several of the characters are marked by intense <lb/>
individuality, the story, as a whole, is of too <lb/>
bizarre a nature to be pleasing or healthful. To <lb/>
turn from this to any of her homely, natural <lb/>
stories, is to escape from an oppressive <reg orig="atmo-|sphere">atmosphere</reg> <lb/>
into a balmy air, irradiated by sunshine.</p>
<p>In November, 1877, Mrs. Alcott passed away. <lb/>
She had completed her eighty years, and her <lb/>
daughter commemorated her in a beautiful poem, <lb/>
"Transfiguration." Louisa remained by her to <lb/>
the end, and her journal "tells the story of the <lb/>
<pb n="255" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0256"/>
last days of watching, and of the peaceful close <lb/>
of the mother's self-sacrificing yet blessed life. <lb/>
Louisa was very brave in the presence of death. <lb/>
She had no dark thoughts connected with it; and <lb/>
in her mother's case, after her long, hard life, she <lb/>
recognized how 'growing age longed for its <lb/>
peaceful sleep.'</p>
<p>"The tie between this mother and daughter was <lb/>
exceptionally strong and tender. The mother saw <lb/>
all her own fine powers reproduced and developed <lb/>
in her daughter; and if she also recognized the <lb/>
passionate energy which had been the strength <lb/>
and bane of her own life, it gave her only a more <lb/>
constant watchfulness to save her child from the <lb/>
struggles and regrets from which she had suffered <lb/>
herself."</p>
<p>May Alcott was the next to go away into the <lb/>
unseen. As a maiden, she was graceful and <reg orig="child-|like">childlike</reg>, <lb/>
and she has been described in "Little <lb/>
Women" as "a regular snow maiden, with blue <lb/>
eyes, and yellow hair curling on her shoulders, <lb/>
pale and slender, and always carrying herself like <lb/>
a young lady mindful of her manners." She was <lb/>
an artist by nature as well as training, and not <lb/>
long before her death, one of her pictures of still <lb/>
life was accepted at the Paris Salon. She gave <lb/>
instruction gratis to many less fortunate girls, and <lb/>
wrote a serviceable little book to aid them, entitled, <lb/>
"Studying Art Abroad, and how to do it cheaply." <lb/>
She made the acquaintance of a young Swiss <lb/>
gentleman named Nieriker, who had refined and <lb/>
artistic tastes similar to her own, and who was a <lb/>
kind, sympathetic friend to her after her mother's <lb/>
<pb n="256" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0257"/>
death. Their feelings of mutual esteem ripened <lb/>
into affection, and they were married in London <lb/>
on March 22, 1878. After less than two years <lb/>
of unbroken happiness with her husband, Mrs. <lb/>
Nieriker died on December 29, 1879, having just <lb/>
before given birth to a daughter. This child the <lb/>
dying mother bequeathed to her sister Louisa, <lb/>
knowing the tender care it would receive from <lb/>
her, and it became a source of great comfort to <lb/>
the surviving sister.</p>
<p>In care for others, Miss Alcott sought to assuage <lb/>
her deep grief over her sister's death. During a <lb/>
visit to Concord Prison, she told a story to the <lb/>
prisoners which deeply moved them, and which <lb/>
was long remembered by them. Her literary <lb/>
work she pursued diligently, and after spending <lb/>
some weeks at Willow Cottage, Magnolia, she <lb/>
wrote her popular story of "Jack and Jill," though <lb/>
the scene of it is chiefly laid in Concord. About <lb/>
this time her father realized his long-hoped-for <lb/>
project of a School of Philosophy, which drew <lb/>
together many earnest thinkers, male and female. <lb/>
In July, 1879, Miss Alcott was the first woman to <lb/>
register her name as a voter on the State lists. <lb/>
Visiting in the ensuing October the Women's <lb/>
Prison at Sherburne, she writes: "A much better <lb/>
place than Concord Prison, with its armed warders, <lb/>
and 'knock-down and drag-out' methods. Only <lb/>
women here, and they work wonders by patience, <lb/>
love, common sense, and the belief in salvation <lb/>
for all."</p>
<p>Although the year 1880 opened sorrowfully after <lb/>
the death of her sister, she interested herself in <lb/>
<pb n="257" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0258"/>
many new projects. Among other incidents, she <lb/>
received a visit from thirty pupils of the Boston <lb/>
University, and also helped to give the children <lb/>
of the North End Mission a happy day at Walden <lb/>
Pond. Then the care of the motherless baby took <lb/>
up a great deal of her time. It drew forth all the <lb/>
feeling of motherhood in her nature, and it was a <lb/>
daily happiness to see the child grow and thrive <lb/>
beneath her care. Story-writing also occupied <lb/>
several hours of each day, and by way of outer <lb/>
interests she assisted in establishing a temperance <lb/>
society in Concord. Such a society was much <lb/>
needed, and she acted as secretary, writing records, <lb/>
letters, and drawing up pledges, etc.</p>
<p>The death of Ralph Waldo Emerson, in April, <lb/>
1882, affected her deeply. "Our best and greatest <lb/>
American gone," she writes in her diary. "The <lb/>
nearest and dearest friend father has ever had, <lb/>
and the man who has helped me most by his life, <lb/>
his books, his society. I can never tell all he has <lb/>
been to me&mdash;from the time I sang Mignon's song <lb/>
under his window &lpar;a little girl&rpar;, and wrote letters <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">&agrave; la</hi> Bettine to him, my Goethe, at fifteen, up <lb/>
through my hard years, when his essays on <reg orig="Self-|Reliance">Self-Reliance</reg>, <lb/>
Character, Compensation, Love, and <lb/>
Friendship, helped me to understand myself and <lb/>
life, and God and Nature. Illustrious and beloved <lb/>
friend, Good-bye!"</p>
<p>Another severe trouble overtook her in the <lb/>
following year, when her father was stricken down <lb/>
by a severe stroke of paralysis, from which he <lb/>
never fully recovered. Three years passed slowly <lb/>
by, partly spent in nursing, and partly in writing, <lb/>
<pb n="258" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0259"/>
and then in the autumn of 1885 Miss Alcott, with <lb/>
her father and sister, moved to a house in <reg orig="Louis-|burg">Louisburg</reg> <lb/>
Square, Boston. The change proved <reg orig="bene-|ficial">beneficial</reg>, <lb/>
though Louisa's own health was now very <lb/>
feeble, and she suffered from dyspepsia and from <lb/>
chronic trouble in the throat. Her work, however, <lb/>
was still pursued vigorously, and she prepared the <lb/>
first collection of stories under the name of "Lulu's <lb/>
Library." This series was published in 1885, and <lb/>
a second and third series at intervals of two years <lb/>
each. Another favourite book of hers, "Jo's <lb/>
Boys," was completed in 1886. Meantime, her <lb/>
father lingered on; he was very tired of living, <lb/>
and wanted to "go up," as he expressed it. "A <lb/>
little more or less light would make him happier," <lb/>
said his daughter to a friend; "but the still active <lb/>
mind beats against the prison bars, and rebels <lb/>
against the weakness of body that prevents the <lb/>
old independent life." During the former half of <lb/>
1886 Miss Alcott's health somewhat improved <lb/>
owing to the massage treatment and other means, <lb/>
but in August she was attacked severely with <lb/>
rheumatism, and troubled with vertigo. Her <lb/>
sufferings were great, and she was in a very <lb/>
nervous condition.</p>
<p>Feeling that her own time of departure was <lb/>
approaching, she calmly made her preparations <lb/>
for the dread change. The winter of 1886 she <lb/>
spent in Boston with her father, and in the society <lb/>
of her sister and nephews and her sister's child. <lb/>
Though still ill and unable to sleep, she laid <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
out to comfort and sustain others. But, with <lb/>
the close of the year, great weakness ensued, and <lb/>
<pb n="259" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0260"/>
she removed to the house of her friend and <reg orig="phy-|sician">physician</reg>, <lb/>
Dr. Rhoda Lawrence, in Roxbury, where <lb/>
she spent the remainder of her life. In June she <lb/>
visited her father at Melrose, and in July went to <lb/>
Concord, and looked over papers, and completed <lb/>
a plan she had formed for adopting her nephew, <lb/>
whom she legally made her son and heir, desiring <lb/>
him to assume the name of Alcott. Returning to <lb/>
Dr. Lawrence's, she still made various plans for <lb/>
literary work, and also busied herself in making <lb/>
garments for poor children, or helping the doctor <lb/>
in his work. The last work of her hands was a <lb/>
flannel garment for a poor child. Her health <reg orig="im-|proved">improved</reg> <lb/>
a little in February, and she wrote part of <lb/>
the "Garland for Girls," a series of stories suggested <lb/>
by the flowers sent to her by different friends. It <lb/>
was hoped by her friends that she might have <lb/>
many years of life yet. Early in March, 1888, she <lb/>
went to see her father, being herself conscious that <lb/>
it was for the last time. She returned to her <lb/>
friend's house, and the next day she was seized <lb/>
with agonizing pains in the head. Serious brain <lb/>
symptoms rapidly developed, and she passed <lb/>
quietly away, on March 6, in her fifty-sixth year. <lb/>
She was unconscious that her father had preceded <lb/>
her, but he had died not many hours before her, <lb/>
at the great age of eighty-eight.</p>
<p>Miss Alcott's biographer observes, in closing her <lb/>
memoir of this gifted writer, "The friends of the <lb/>
family who gathered to pay their last tribute of <lb/>
respect and love to the aged father, were met at <lb/>
the threshold by the startling intelligence, 'Louisa <lb/>
Alcott is dead,' and a deeper sadness fell upon <lb/>
<pb n="260" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0261"/>
every heart. The old patriarch had gone to his <lb/>
rest in the fulness of time, 'corn ripe for the sickle,' <lb/>
but few realized how entirely his daughter had <lb/>
worn out her earthly frame. Her friends had <lb/>
hoped for renewed health and strength, and for <lb/>
even greater and nobler work from her with her <lb/>
ripened powers and greater ease and leisure.</p>
<p>"Miss Alcott had made every arrangement for <lb/>
her death; and by her own wish the funeral service <lb/>
was very simple, in her father's rooms at <reg orig="Louis-|burg">Louisburg</reg> <lb/>
Square, and attended only by a few of her <lb/>
family and nearest friends. They read her <reg orig="ex-|quisite">exquisite</reg> <lb/>
poem to her mother, her father's noble <lb/>
tribute to her, and spoke of the earnestness and <lb/>
truth of her life. She was remembered as she <lb/>
would have wished to be. Her body was carried <lb/>
to Concord, and placed in the beautiful cemetery <lb/>
of Sleepy Hollow, where her dearest ones were <lb/>
already laid to rest. 'Her boys' went beside her <lb/>
as a 'guard of honour,' and stood around as she <lb/>
was placed across the feet of father, mother, and <lb/>
sister, that she might 'take care of them as she <lb/>
had done all her life.'</p>
<p>"Of the silent grief of the bereaved family I <lb/>
will not speak, but the sound of mourning filled <lb/>
all the land, and was re-echoed from foreign shores. <lb/>
The children everywhere had lost their friend. <lb/>
Miss Alcott had entered into their hearts and <lb/>
revealed them to themselves. In her childish <lb/>
journal, her oldest sister said, 'I have not a secret <lb/>
from Louisa; I tell her everything, and am not <lb/>
afraid she will think me silly.' It was this respect <lb/>
for the thought and life of children that gave <lb/>
<pb n="261" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0262"/>
Louisa Alcott her great power of winning their <lb/>
respect and affection. Nothing which was real <lb/>
and earnest to them seemed unimportant to her."</p>
<p>A little poem which Miss Alcott found under a <lb/>
dying soldier's pillow in the hospital at <reg orig="George-|town">Georgetown</reg>, <lb/>
helped to bring calmness and resignation <lb/>
to her own soul when she was laid aside during <lb/>
her last illness. The stanza in this poem which <lb/>
most affected her, was the following:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"I am no longer eager, bold, and strong,</l>
<l rend="indent">All that is past;</l>
<l>I am ready <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to do</l>
<l rend="indent">At last&mdash;at last.</l>
<l>My half-day's work is done,</l>
<l rend="indent">And this is all my part.</l>
<l>I give a patient God</l>
<l rend="indent">My patient heart."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>A description of Miss Alcott's person and <lb/>
character shows her to have been of somewhat <lb/>
imposing appearance, tall and well proportioned in <lb/>
form and feature rather than beautiful. There was <lb/>
dignity in her demeanour, and strength and activity <lb/>
in her movements. She was unconventional in <lb/>
manners, generous in the extreme in serving others, <lb/>
yet at the same time tenacious of her own rights. <lb/>
Favoured with the noblest and most intellectual <lb/>
society of New England, male and female, she <lb/>
developed a benevolent, thoughtful, and widely <lb/>
sympathetic nature. One of her dearest aims was <lb/>
to elevate her own sex, and to invest it with a <lb/>
greater dignity and usefulness. Duty was ever <lb/>
kept before her as a guiding star, and it plays no <lb/>
inconsiderable part in her writings. She had a <lb/>
profound appreciation of all that was beautiful in <lb/>
<pb n="262" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0263"/>
Nature, and all that was noble and elevating in <lb/>
man. In the world she was a true philanthropist, <lb/>
while in the home she was one of those strong <lb/>
earnest spirits who help to bind its various members <lb/>
together by the indissoluble ties of mutual <reg orig="affec-|tion">affection</reg>, <lb/>
of self-surrender, of willing service, and of <lb/>
moral aspiration.</p>

Earlham, Norfolk, and Catherine, his wife, daughter <lb/>
of Daniel Bell, a London merchant. Mrs. Bell was <lb/>
granddaughter of Robert Barclay, the well-known <lb/>
apologist of the Quakers, so that on both sides <lb/>
Elizabeth Fry was descended from families <reg orig="occu-|pying">occupying</reg> <lb/>
prominent positions in the Society of Friends. <lb/>
The Gurney family is a very ancient one, and can <lb/>
trace an uninterrupted line to the Norman lords of <lb/>
Gournay-en-Brai, in Normandy. From the time <lb/>
of William Rufus, these Norman lords held lands in <lb/>
Norfolk, and their successors still dwell in the county. <lb/>
One of Mrs. Fry's ancestors, John Gurney, espoused <lb/>
the principles of George Fox, and became one of <lb/>
the first members of the Society of Friends.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Fry was born at Norwich, on the 21st of <lb/>
May, 1780, but when she was six years of age the <lb/>
family removed to Earlham Hall, a charming <reg orig="pro-|perty">property</reg> <lb/>
in the centre of a well-wooded park, through <lb/>
which flows the river Wensum, a clear, winding <lb/>
stream.</p>
<pb n="266" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0267"/>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gurney were not strict Quakers in <lb/>
garb and speech, and their numerous children were <lb/>
also brought up with more knowledge and enjoyment <lb/>
of the world than is usually the case. Nevertheless, <lb/>
Mrs. Gurney, who was a woman of a noble and <lb/>
beautiful spirit, trained up her daughters in ways of <lb/>
usefulness and wisdom, and in the fear of the Lord. <lb/>
Like her celebrated daughter, it was her earnest <reg orig="de-|sire">desire</reg> <lb/>
that when dead she might yet speak, and that <lb/>
others might be stimulated by her example to follow <lb/>
her, as she desired and endeavoured to follow Christ. <lb/>
Her diary shows that she was anxious to give her <lb/>
daughters a wide, intellectual training, including the <lb/>
study of Latin, French, mathematics, and natural <lb/>
history; and she also desired them to become good <lb/>
and capable housewives. But she never lost sight <lb/>
of a higher end than this. "If in conversation," <lb/>
she observed, "we studied rather to avoid whatever <lb/>
may in its nature be reprehensible, than to search <lb/>
for approbation or admiration, would not associating <lb/>
with our friends become more innocent, if not more <lb/>
profitable? If our piety does not appear adequate <lb/>
to supporting us in the exigencies of life, and, I <lb/>
may add, death, surely our hearts cannot be <reg orig="suffi-|ciently">sufficiently</reg> <lb/>
devoted to it. As piety is undoubtedly the <lb/>
shortest and securest way to all moral rectitude, <lb/>
young women should be virtuous and good, on the <lb/>
broad, firm basis of Christianity. As many <lb/>
things happen to lead the mind from the adoration <lb/>
and love of God, which is His due, and our truest <lb/>
enjoyment, it is necessary to retire with our friends <lb/>
and neighbours from hurry and business, that we <lb/>
may think of Him who delights to bless us, and <lb/>
<pb n="267" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0268"/>
will consider us as His children, if we love Him as <lb/>
a heavenly Father."</p>
<p>This estimable woman and devoted mother died <lb/>
in November, 1792, leaving eleven children, the <lb/>
eldest scarcely seventeen, and the youngest not <lb/>
two years old.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was twelve years of age at this time, and <lb/>
the blow was a very severe one to her, as she had <lb/>
deeply loved and reverenced her mother. She was a <lb/>
somewhat nervous child, diffident of her own talents, <lb/>
and yet endued with keen perception of character. <lb/>
Moreover, "her faculty for independent investigation, <lb/>
her unswerving loyalty to duty, and her fearless <reg orig="per-|severance">perseverance</reg> <lb/>
in works of benevolence, were all <reg orig="fore-|shadowed">foreshadowed</reg> <lb/>
in these early days." As a girl she was <lb/>
tall and slender in person, with a pleasing <reg orig="counte-|nance">countenance</reg> <lb/>
and manner, fond of dancing, and peculiarly <lb/>
graceful in the saddle. Her restless heart, however, <lb/>
yearned for something more than worldly gaieties <lb/>
on the one hand, or Quaker asceticism on the other. <lb/>
Two or three extracts from her diary will reveal <lb/>
something of her character, and of her mental <lb/>
struggles.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Monday, May</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi>.&mdash;I am seventeen to-day. Am <lb/>
I happier, or a better creature, than I was this time <lb/>
twelvemonths? I know I am happier; I think I <lb/>
am better. I hope I shall be much better this day <lb/>
year than I am now. I hope to be quite an altered <lb/>
person; to have more knowledge; to have my mind <lb/>
in greater order; and my heart, too&mdash;that wants to <lb/>
be put in order as much, if not more, than any part <lb/>
of me, it is in such a fly-away state. But I think, if <lb/>
ever it were settled on one object, it would never, no <lb/>
<pb n="268" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0269"/>
never, fly away any more; it would rest quietly and <lb/>
happily on the heart that was open to receive it. <lb/>
It will then be most constant. It is not my fault it <lb/>
now flies away; it is owing to circumstances.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">July 17th</hi>.&mdash;I have seen several things in myself <lb/>
and others I never before remarked, but I have not <lb/>
tried to improve myself. I have given way to my <lb/>
passions, and let them have command over me. I <lb/>
have known my faults, and not corrected them; <lb/>
and now I am determined I will once more try, <lb/>
with redoubled ardour, to overcome my wicked <lb/>
inclinations. I must not flirt; I must not ever <lb/>
be out of temper with the children; I must not <lb/>
contradict without a cause; I must not mump <lb/>
when my sisters are liked and I am not; I <lb/>
must not allow myself to be angry; I must not <lb/>
exaggerate, which I am inclined to do; I must not <lb/>
give way to luxury; I must not be idle in mind; I <lb/>
must try to give way to every good feeling, and <lb/>
overcome every bad. I will see what I can do. If <lb/>
I had but perseverance, I could do all that I wish. <lb/>
I will try. I have lately been too satirical, so as to <lb/>
hurt sometimes. Remember, it is always a fault to <lb/>
hurt others.</p>
<p>8<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.&mdash;A much better day, though many faults.</p>
<p>10<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.&mdash;Some poor people were here. I do not <lb/>
think I gave them what I did with a good heart. <lb/>
I am inclined to give away, but for a week past, <lb/>
owing to not having much money, I have been mean <lb/>
and extravagant. Shameful! Whilst I live, may I <lb/>
be generous. It is in my nature, and I will not <lb/>
overcome so good a feeling. I am inclined to be <lb/>
extravagant, and that leads to meanness, for those <lb/>
<pb n="269" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0270"/>
who will throw away a good deal are apt to mind <lb/>
giving a little.</p>
<p>11<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.&mdash;I am in a most idle mind, and inclined to <lb/>
have an indolent, dissipated day; but I will try to <lb/>
overcome it, and see how far I can. I am well&mdash; <lb/>
oh, most inestimable of comforts! Happy, happy <lb/>
I, to be so well. How good, how virtuous, ought <lb/>
I to be! May what I have suffered be a lesson <lb/>
to me, to feel for those who are ill, and alleviate <lb/>
their sorrows as far as lies in my power; let it <lb/>
teach me never to forget the blessings I enjoy. I <lb/>
ought never to be unhappy. Look back at this time <lb/>
last year, how ill I was, how miserable; yet I was <lb/>
supported through it. God will support through <lb/>
the suffering He inflicts."</p>
<p>She was happily saved from the wave of <reg orig="scepti-|cism">scepticism</reg> <lb/>
which flowed over English society more or less <lb/>
at this period, yet she also seems to have dreaded <lb/>
enthusiasm in religion, which was somewhat strange <lb/>
in one who was destined to be moved by the loftiest <lb/>
enthusiasm of humanity. But the truth is that she <lb/>
was at the parting of the ways, and was waiting for <lb/>
that Divine awakening which came through the <lb/>
agency of William Savery, a travelling Friend from <lb/>
America. Through his preaching and influence she <lb/>
became deeply impressed by the Gospel. Richenda <lb/>
Gurney, Elizabeth's sister, wrote an account of <lb/>
Savery's visit. His voice and manner arrested <reg orig="Eliza-|beth's">Elizabeth's</reg> <lb/>
attention at once. She soon began to weep, <lb/>
and at length became a good deal agitated. When <lb/>
the meeting was over, she begged her father to allow <lb/>
her to dine at the house of her uncle, Joseph Gurney, <lb/>
whither Savery was invited. All the way home <lb/>
<pb n="270" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0271"/>
she was deeply moved. "The next morning," says <lb/>
Richenda, "William Savery came to breakfast, and <lb/>
preached to our dear sister after breakfast, <reg orig="prophesy-|ing">prophesying</reg> <lb/>
of the high and important calling she would be <lb/>
led into. What she went through in her own mind I <lb/>
cannot say, but the results were most powerful and <lb/>
most evident. From that day her love of pleasure <lb/>
and of the world seemed gone."</p>
<p>Elizabeth herself, in giving her own account of the <lb/>
change, in her journal for Sunday, February 4, 1798, <lb/>
says: "I wish the state of enthusiasm I am now <lb/>
in may last, for to-day I have felt <hi rend="italic">that there is a <lb/>
God!</hi> I have been emotional, and my mind has been <lb/>
led away from the follies that it is mostly wrapped <lb/>
up in. We had much serious conversation; in short, <lb/>
what he said, and what I felt, was like a refreshing <lb/>
shower, falling upon earth that had been dried up <lb/>
for ages. It has not made me unhappy. I have <lb/>
felt ever since humble. I have longed for virtue. <lb/>
I hope to be truly virtuous, to let sophistry fly from <lb/>
my mind; not to be enthusiastic and foolish, but <lb/>
only to be so far religious as will lead to virtue. <lb/>
There seems nothing so little understood as religion."</p>
<p>To test her newly-awakened feelings, she now <lb/>
paid a visit to London, there to acquire actual <reg orig="ac-|quaintance">acquaintance</reg> <lb/>
with the amusements and fascinations of <lb/>
the world so that she might try all things, and <lb/>
choose the right. She returned home entirely <reg orig="de-|cided">decided</reg>. <lb/>
She rejected the way of the world, and <lb/>
chose the less flowery way of religion; and from <lb/>
this time forward never swerved from the path in <lb/>
which she believed lay her duty. Yet she greatly <lb/>
enjoyed learned and brilliant society. While in <lb/>
<pb n="271" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0272"/>
London she had encountered Amelia Opie, Mrs. <lb/>
Siddons, Mrs. Inchbald, "Peter Pindar," and many <lb/>
others; and among the leaders of fashion whom she <lb/>
admired was the Prince of Wales. It is not a little <lb/>
remarkable that so young a girl, and one susceptible <lb/>
to intellectual and society influences, should have <lb/>
deliberately chosen for herself the ways of God in <lb/>
preference to the ways of the world. It was, no <lb/>
doubt, the ordering of Providence, as she said. She <lb/>
was confirmed in her convictions by hearing William <lb/>
Savery several times, and by receiving from him <lb/>
afterwards a letter couched in a most earnest spirit.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1798 Mr. Gurney, with his <lb/>
seven daughters, took a journey into Wales and the <lb/>
south of England. "Elizabeth delighted in nature, <lb/>
and dwelt with pleasure on the beautiful scenery they <lb/>
passed through; but to the works of man, however <lb/>
imposing, she was comparatively indifferent. She <lb/>
visited cathedral cities, she saw scenes of high <reg orig="his-|toric">historic</reg> <lb/>
interest&mdash;castles whose walls could reveal dark <lb/>
tales of bygone days, but she scarcely mentions <lb/>
them, and if she notices them at all, it is but to <lb/>
draw some moral inference. In visiting the <reg orig="dock-|yards">dockyards</reg> <lb/>
at Plymouth, and beholding one of the noblest <lb/>
instances of man's skill and power, a first-rate <reg orig="man-|of-war">man-of-war</reg>, <lb/>
in perfect order, and equipped for sea, she <lb/>
considers the effects of war, and its influences on <lb/>
the human race. But by far the greatest interest <lb/>
afforded her by this journey was the prospect of <lb/>
seeing different Friends, and becoming better <reg orig="ac-|quainted">acquainted</reg> <lb/>
with them and their principles. The <lb/>
travellers paid a visit to Coalbrook Dale, the <reg orig="resi-|dence">residence</reg> <lb/>
of the well-known Christian philanthropist, <lb/>
<pb n="272" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0273"/>
Richard Reynolds. There she was left for some <lb/>
days with her cousin, Priscilla Hannah Gurney. <lb/>
This lady was cousin to the Gurneys of Earlham, <lb/>
by both their father and mother, her father being <lb/>
Joseph Gurney, and her mother Christiana Barclay. <lb/>
She was exactly the person to attract the young; <lb/>
she possessed singular beauty and elegance of <lb/>
manner, a figure small but perfect, and eyes of great <lb/>
brilliancy and expression. She was of the old <lb/>
school, and tinged with its forms and dignities; <lb/>
her costume partook of this, and her long retention <lb/>
of the black hood gave much character to her <reg orig="ap-|pearance">appearance</reg>."</p>
<p>Priscilla Gurney had a powerful influence over <lb/>
Elizabeth, and when she returned home in <reg orig="Sep-|tember">September</reg> <lb/>
she felt strengthened in her feelings to <lb/>
become a "plain Friend," though she was very <lb/>
careful not to offend unnecessarily the <reg orig="suscepti-|bilities">susceptibilities</reg> <lb/>
of her brothers and sisters. Her course <lb/>
of usefulness to others now became more clearly <lb/>
defined. In visiting and relieving the poor, both <lb/>
at Earlham and Norwich, in reading the Bible to <lb/>
the sick, and instructing the neglected children, <lb/>
most of her time was passed. Her school, which <lb/>
began with a solitary boy, increased so much <lb/>
that at last she had more than seventy scholars, <lb/>
whom she taught without monitors, and without <lb/>
the adjuncts of the books and pictures now in <lb/>
such request. How she controlled the wills and <lb/>
fixed the attention of so many unruly children <lb/>
must ever remain a mystery to those who have <lb/>
not the gift she possessed of influencing the minds <lb/>
of others. She also delighted in assisting families <lb/>
<pb n="273" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0274"/>
who, from positions of affluence, had fallen into <lb/>
poverty from no fault of their own. Her own <lb/>
personal appearance changed by degrees. She <lb/>
abandoned her favourite scarlet riding-habit, laid <lb/>
aside all ornament, and conformed by slow stages <lb/>
to the simple costume of the Friends. What was <lb/>
even more difficult than this was the adoption of the <lb/>
phraseology, and it was a long time before she felt <lb/>
at her ease in using the colloquial terms "thee" <lb/>
and "thou."</p>
<p>By the close of 1799 Elizabeth Gurney wore <lb/>
the cap and close neckerchief of Friends, and, with <lb/>
the dress, had adopted their other peculiarities. As <lb/>
she had deliberately chosen Quakerism as the future <lb/>
religion of her life, she felt more comfortable when <lb/>
she had courageously adopted its distinctive outer <lb/>
symbols. She now received a proposal of marriage <lb/>
from Mr. Joseph Fry, a member of a wealthy Quaker <lb/>
family in London. Being divided in her mind as <lb/>
to whether a married life would interfere with her <lb/>
philanthropic and religious work, she consulted her <lb/>
friends on the momentous question. In the end she <lb/>
accepted Mr. Fry's offer, and was married to him on <lb/>
the 19th of August, 1800, at the Friends' Meeting <lb/>
House, Norwich, she being then a few months over <lb/>
twenty years of age. It was a great wrench to <lb/>
leave Norwich, where "the very stones of the street <lb/>
seemed dear to her," but she accompanied her <lb/>
husband to London, and took up her abode in his <lb/>
place of business at St. Mildred's Court. Here she <lb/>
began the duties of wedded life, and here most of <lb/>
her children were born. The family into which <lb/>
she had married belonged to the strictest order of <lb/>
<pb n="274" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0275"/>
Quakers, who had so little parleying with the world <lb/>
that even Elizabeth's urbane and ladylike manners <lb/>
seemed almost to wear a temporizing character.</p>
<p>In the slums of London Mrs. Fry pursued her <lb/>
beneficent work, undaunted by difficulties. Her <lb/>
intense love for her own children stirred her <reg orig="solici-|tude">solicitude</reg> <lb/>
for the uncared-for waifs and strays. She <lb/>
achieved much good, but sometimes she sustained <lb/>
a shock in her efforts, as the following anecdote <lb/>
will prove:&mdash;</p>
<p>"One cold winter day she was accosted by a <lb/>
woman asking charity in the street, with a <reg orig="half-|naked">half-naked</reg> <lb/>
little child in her arms very ill with the <lb/>
whooping-cough. Grieved at the appearance of <lb/>
the child, and her suspicions being excited by the <lb/>
evasive answers of the woman, Mrs. Fry offered to <lb/>
accompany her home, and there relieve her <reg orig="neces-|sities">necessities</reg>. <lb/>
This the woman tried to clude; but, <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg> <lb/>
on her purpose, she succeeded in following <lb/>
her into a low back street, where, in a wretched, <lb/>
filthy house, the melancholy spectacle presented itself <lb/>
of a number of sick and neglected infants, not <lb/>
only without comforts, but with the aggravations of <lb/>
misery. The next day, when the medical <reg orig="atten-|dant">attendant</reg> <lb/>
of her own children went, at her request, to <lb/>
assist the little sufferers, the room was empty, <lb/>
woman and children gone, nor was any trace ever <lb/>
found of them. On inquiry among the neighbours, <lb/>
it was discovered that these were parish children, <lb/>
put to this woman to nurse, who kept them in this <lb/>
condition, not merely to assist her purposes of <lb/>
mendicity, but with the intention of shortening <lb/>
their lives, and then concealing their death, in order <lb/>
<pb n="275" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0276"/>
that she might receive the pittance allowed for <lb/>
their maintenance."</p>
<p>Incidents of this nature opened her eyes to the <lb/>
remedial nature of the work which was waiting for <lb/>
her to do. She further took an interest in the <lb/>
educational labours of Joseph Lancaster, founder of <lb/>
the school system which bears his name, and she <lb/>
visited the workhouse and school belonging to the <lb/>
Society of Friends at Islington. Family events of a <lb/>
mingled character also occupied her attention about <lb/>
this time. One of her sisters was married to Mr. <lb/>
Samuel Hoare, and another to Sir Thomas Fowell <lb/>
Buxton, while other members of the family passed <lb/>
away, including her husband's mother and a brother's <lb/>
wife. Then, after a few years, Mr. Fry, senior, died, <lb/>
and Elizabeth Fry and her family removed to Plashet <lb/>
House, in Essex, the country seat of the Frys. <lb/>
She has left on record the delight she felt in the <lb/>
enjoyment of a country life. When some of her <lb/>
relatives united themselves with the Church of <lb/>
England, she experienced for a time a feeling of <lb/>
disappointment, but the close union between them <lb/>
was never disturbed, and all were devoted <reg orig="worship-|pers">worshippers</reg> <lb/>
of the same Lord.</p>
<p>Towards the close of 1809 Elizabeth Fry was <lb/>
summoned to Earlham, where she arrived in time <lb/>
to receive her father's benediction, and to witness <lb/>
the triumphant close of his honourable and <lb/>
Christian life. By the side of the dead, and in <lb/>
the presence of the survivors, and also afterwards <lb/>
at the grave, she gave utterance to words of <lb/>
thanksgiving to God for the safe and happy <reg orig="end-|ing">ending</reg> <lb/>
of a life which had been so dear to her. She <lb/>
<pb n="276" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0277"/>
had been exercised in spirit for some time as to <lb/>
her fitness for the ministry; that is, for preaching <lb/>
or bearing testimony in the Meeting under the <lb/>
promptings of the Holy Spirit. From the time <lb/>
of her father's death, the Meeting of which she <lb/>
was a member feeling unity with her, <reg orig="acknow-|ledged">acknowledged</reg> <lb/>
her in the character of a minister amongst <lb/>
them. But she only spoke, as she said, from a <lb/>
feeling of duty borne in upon her, and she did <lb/>
not relax in her efforts to improve the condition <lb/>
of the world outside. With the aid of the <reg orig="incum-|bent">incumbent</reg> <lb/>
of the parish and a benevolent lady named <lb/>
Howell, she established a school of seventy girls <lb/>
at Plashet&mdash;which was a hamlet of East Ham&mdash;that <lb/>
maintained a prosperous condition for half a <reg orig="cen-|tury">century</reg>. <lb/>
Meanwhile Plashet House became a dep&ocirc;t <lb/>
of charity. Calicoes, flannels, jackets, gowns, and <lb/>
pinafores were kept in piles to clothe the naked; <lb/>
drugs suited to domestic practice were stored in <lb/>
a closet for healing the sick; an amateur <reg orig="soup-|kitchen">soup-kitchen</reg>, <lb/>
for feeding the hungry, was established <lb/>
in a roomy outbuilding, and this long years before <lb/>
public soup-kitchens became the rage; whilst <lb/>
copies of Testaments were forthcoming on all <lb/>
occasions, to teach erring souls the way to Heaven. <lb/>
But her charity did not stop with these things. <lb/>
An unsavoury locality known as "Irish Row," <lb/>
about half a mile off, soon attracted her attention. <lb/>
The slatternliness, suffering, shiftlessness, dirt, and <lb/>
raggedness were inducements to one of her <reg orig="chari-|table">charitable</reg> <lb/>
temperament to visit its inhabitants, having <lb/>
their relief and improvement in view; while her <lb/>
appreciation of the warmheartedness and drollery <lb/>
<pb n="277" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0278"/>
of the Irish character afforded her genuine <lb/>
pleasure. She found a willing coadjutor in the <lb/>
priest of the district, and with his consent she <lb/>
gave away Bibles and tracts, vaccinated and taught <lb/>
the children, distributed clothes to the mothers, <lb/>
and became a veritable Lady Bountiful to this <lb/>
squalid Irish colony, which soon exhibited a <lb/>
wonderful moral and physical improvement as the <lb/>
result of her self-denying labours. Mrs. Fry taught <lb/>
her children to take pleasure in her benevolent <lb/>
deeds, and to become almoners of her bounty.</p>
<p>In September, 1811, the Norwich Auxiliary Bible <lb/>
Society was formed, and Mrs. Fry attended the <lb/>
meeting, at which were present the Bishop of <lb/>
Norwich, and many clergymen and Nonconformist <lb/>
ministers. All through life she took the warmest <lb/>
interest in the Bible Society, and she rejoiced to <lb/>
co-operate with her Church friends in this and <lb/>
other undertakings.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Fry's connection with prisons began <lb/>
practically in 1813, though, as a child of fifteen, <lb/>
she had been deeply interested in the House of <lb/>
Correction at Norwich, and had prevailed on her <lb/>
father to allow her to visit it. Now, at the <reg orig="insti-|gation">instigation</reg> <lb/>
of some of her friends who had come to <lb/>
know of the state of things in Newgate, she turned <lb/>
her attention to the condition of the female <lb/>
prisoners. Accompanied by a sister of Sir Fowell <lb/>
Buxton, she paid several visits to Newgate in <lb/>
February, 1813. Writing in her diary after the <lb/>
third visit, she says: "Yesterday we were some <lb/>
hours at Newgate with the poor female felons, <lb/>
attending to their outward necessities; we had <lb/>
<pb n="278" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0279"/>
been twice previously. Before we went away, <lb/>
dear Anna Buxton uttered a few words in <reg orig="suppli-|cation">supplication</reg>, <lb/>
and very unexpectedly to myself, I did <lb/>
so also. I heard weeping, and I thought they <lb/>
appeared much tendered and softened; a very <lb/>
solemn quiet was observed. It was a striking <lb/>
scene, the poor people on their knees around us, <lb/>
in their deplorable condition." Mrs. Fry's daughters, <lb/>
who completed her Memoirs, furnish fuller details <lb/>
of this memorable visit. It appears that at that <lb/>
time "all the female prisoners in Newgate were <lb/>
confined in the part now known as the untried <lb/>
side. The larger portion of the quadrangle was <lb/>
then used as a state-prison. The partition wall <lb/>
was not of sufficient height to prevent the <reg orig="state-|prisoners">state-prisoners</reg> <lb/>
from overlooking the narrow yard and <lb/>
the windows of the two walls and the two cells of <lb/>
which the women's division consisted. These four <lb/>
rooms comprised about one hundred and ninety <lb/>
superficial yards, into which, at the time of these <lb/>
visits, nearly three hundred women, with their <lb/>
numerous children, were crowded; tried and <reg orig="un-|tried">untried</reg>, <lb/>
misdemeanants and felons, without <reg orig="classifica-|tion">classification</reg>, <lb/>
without employment, and with no other <lb/>
superintendence than that given by a man and <lb/>
his son, who had charge of them by night and by <lb/>
day. Destitute of sufficient clothing, for which <lb/>
there was no provision, in rags and dirt, without <lb/>
bedding&mdash;they slept on the floor, the boards of <lb/>
which were in parts raised to supply a sort of <lb/>
pillow. In the same rooms they lived, cooked, <lb/>
and washed.</p>
<p>"With the proceeds of their clamorous begging <lb/>
<pb n="279" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0280"/>
when any stranger appeared amongst them, the <lb/>
prisoners purchased liquors from a regular tap in <lb/>
the prison. Spirits were openly drunk, and the <lb/>
ear was assailed by the most terrible language. <lb/>
Beyond that necessary for safe custody, there was <lb/>
little restraint over their communication with the <lb/>
world without.</p>
<p>"Although military sentinels were posted on the <lb/>
leads of the prison, such was the lawlessness <reg orig="pre-|vailing">prevailing</reg>, <lb/>
that Mr. Newman, the governor, entered <lb/>
this portion of it with reluctance. Fearful that <lb/>
their watches should be snatched from their sides, <lb/>
he advised the ladies &lpar;though without avail&rpar; to <lb/>
leave them in his house.</p>
<p>"Into this scene Mrs. Fry entered, accompanied <lb/>
only by one lady, a sister of Sir T. F. Buxton. <lb/>
The sorrowful and neglected state of these depraved <lb/>
women and their miserable children, dwelling in <lb/>
such a vortex of corruption, deeply sank into her <lb/>
heart, although at this time nothing more was <lb/>
done than to supply the most destitute with <lb/>
clothes. A vivid recollection of the green baize <lb/>
garments, and the pleasure of assisting in their <lb/>
preparation for this purpose, is still retained in her <lb/>
family. She carried back to her home, and into <lb/>
the midst of other interests and avocations, a <lb/>
lively remembrance of all that she had witnessed <lb/>
in Newgate, which, within four years, induced <lb/>
that systematic effort for ameliorating the <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg> <lb/>
of these poor outcasts, so signally blessed by <lb/>
Him who said, 'That joy shall be in Heaven over <lb/>
one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety <lb/>
and nine just persons which need no repentance."</p>
<pb n="280" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0281"/>
<p>Meanwhile the penal laws still remained in <lb/>
vogue in all their painful severity. Criminals were <lb/>
dealt with on the principle of fear, and Romilly <lb/>
and other humane men were scandalized and <lb/>
grieved to the heart's core because the death <lb/>
penalty continued to be exacted for crimes <reg orig="com-|paratively">comparatively</reg> <lb/>
trivial. For a time domestic matters <lb/>
claimed the attention of Elizabeth Fry. Within <lb/>
a very short period she was called upon to sustain <lb/>
the loss of her brother John Gurney, of her <lb/>
paternal friend Joseph Gurney Bevan, and of one <lb/>
of her own tenderly beloved children, while her <lb/>
husband also suffered considerable loss of property. <lb/>
In April, 1816, another life was added to the Fry <lb/>
household, this being the tenth child. Although <lb/>
the family was very large, the mother's energy was <lb/>
so great that she ever gave to its various members <lb/>
the closest care and solicitude. She wrote out <lb/>
wholesome physical and beautiful moral rules for <lb/>
her boys when she was compelled to part with <lb/>
them for the boarding-school.</p>
<p>But all the while the condition of poor prisoners <lb/>
lay heavy upon her soul. Howard and his humane <lb/>
exertions appeared to have been forgotten, and <lb/>
Acts of Parliament to have become a dead letter; <lb/>
so that, with a few exceptions, the prisons of <lb/>
England were a disgrace to civilization. At <lb/>
Christmas, 1816, therefore, Mrs. Fry began her <lb/>
prison visitation again earnestly and <reg orig="systemati-|cally">systematically</reg>. <lb/>
Some slight improvements had been <lb/>
effected owing to the action of the London <reg orig="Corpora-|tion">Corporation</reg>, <lb/>
but the prisons still exhibited an unchecked <lb/>
condition of idleness, riot, and vice of every. <lb/>
<pb n="281" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0282"/>
description. But Mrs. Fry bravely went in and <lb/>
out of the prison of Newgate. On her second visit <lb/>
she remained quite alone amongst the women for <lb/>
some hours. She read and spoke to them with <lb/>
marvellous effect. Her biographers state that <lb/>
some who were greatly moved asked her who <lb/>
Christ was; while others feared that their day of <lb/>
salvation was passed. The children, who were <lb/>
almost naked, were pining for want of proper <lb/>
food, air, and exercise. Mrs. Fry addressed <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
to the mothers, and pointed out to them the <lb/>
grievous consequences to their children of living in <lb/>
such a scene of depravity; she proposed to establish <lb/>
a school for them, to which they acceded with tears <lb/>
of joy. She desired them to consider the plan, for <lb/>
without their steady co-operation she would not <lb/>
undertake it; leaving it to them to select a governess <lb/>
from amongst themselves. On her next visit they <lb/>
had chosen as schoolmistress a young woman named <lb/>
Mary Connor, who proved eminently qualified for <lb/>
the task. She had been recently committed for <lb/>
stealing a watch, and became one of the firstfruits <lb/>
of Christian labour in that place. She was <reg orig="assidu-|ous">assiduous</reg> <lb/>
in her duties, and was never known to infringe <lb/>
one of the rules. A free pardon was granted her <lb/>
about fifteen months afterwards, but this proved <lb/>
an unavailing gift, for a cough, which had attacked <lb/>
her a short time previously, ended in consumption. <lb/>
She displayed during her illness much patience <lb/>
and quietness of spirit; having, as she humbly <lb/>
believed, obtained everlasting pardon and peace, <lb/>
through the merits of her Lord and Saviour. She <lb/>
died in the full hope of immortality.</p>
<pb n="282" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0283"/>
<p>"Mrs. Fry's views were received with cordial <lb/>
approbation by the Sheriffs of London, the <lb/>
Ordinary, and the Governor of Newgate, although <lb/>
they looked upon her experiment as almost <reg orig="hope-|less">hopeless</reg>. <lb/>
An unoccupied cell was, by their <reg orig="permis-|sion">permission</reg>, <lb/>
appropriated for the schoolroom. On the <lb/>
day following this arrangement, Mrs. Fry, <reg orig="accom-|panied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
by her friend, Mary Sanderson, and with <lb/>
the poor prisoner, Mary Connor, as mistress, <lb/>
opened the school, for the children and young <lb/>
persons under twenty-five years of age; but from <lb/>
the small size of the room, they had the pain of <lb/>
being obliged to refuse admission to many of the <lb/>
women, who earnestly entreated to be allowed to <lb/>
share in their instructions. Mary Sanderson then <lb/>
visited a prison for the first time, and her feelings <lb/>
were thus described by herself to Sir T. F. Buxton. <lb/>
'The railing was crowded with half-naked women, <lb/>
struggling together for the front situations with <lb/>
the most boisterous violence, and begging with <lb/>
the utmost vociferation. She felt as if she were <lb/>
going into a den of wild beasts, and she well <lb/>
recollects quite shuddering when the door closed <lb/>
upon her, and she was locked in with such a herd <lb/>
of novel and desperate companions.'"</p>
<p>Many of these ferocious women, however, became <lb/>
humanized, through the grace of God, under the <lb/>
instruction of Mrs. Fry and a few ladies who now <lb/>
joined her. The little school in the gaol of <reg orig="New-|gate">Newgate</reg> <lb/>
continued for a considerable time to be their <lb/>
daily occupation, and with beneficial results. A <lb/>
matron was afterwards appointed. In her evidence <lb/>
before a Committee of the House of Commons, <lb/>
<pb n="283" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0284"/>
Mrs. Fry deposed: "It was in our visits to the <lb/>
school, where some of us attended almost every <lb/>
day, that we were witnesses to the dreadful <reg orig="pro-|ceedings">proceedings</reg> <lb/>
which went forward on the female side of <lb/>
the prison: the begging, swearing, gaming, <reg orig="fight-|ing">fighting</reg>, <lb/>
singing, dancing, dressing up in men's clothes; <lb/>
the scenes are too bad to be described, so that we <lb/>
did not think it suitable to admit young persons <lb/>
with us." All chance of reformation seemed <reg orig="hope-|less">hopeless</reg>, <lb/>
yet the brave band of philanthropic ladies <lb/>
continued their efforts. The officers of the prison, <lb/>
as well as private friends, treated the idea of <lb/>
introducing industry and order into Newgate as <lb/>
visionary. But Mrs. Fry persevered, and the results <lb/>
astonished the most sceptical. At first, she tried <lb/>
no more than to supply the most destitute with <lb/>
clothes. Then her personal influence and exertions <lb/>
induced reformation in many cases. The reading <lb/>
of the Scriptures was a leading part of her remedial <lb/>
measures, and her impressive tones and profound <lb/>
reverence made a deep impression. "The pathos of <lb/>
her voice," says one writer, "was almost miraculous, <lb/>
and melted alike the hardest criminals and the <lb/>
most impervious men of the world." Cool observers <lb/>
who witnessed the effects of her appeals in <reg orig="New-|gate">Newgate</reg> <lb/>
Prison could hardly describe the scene without <lb/>
tears. The American minister of the day thus <lb/>
placed on record his own impression of her labours: <lb/>
&mdash;"Two days ago I saw the greatest curiosity in <lb/>
London, ay, and in England too, compared with <lb/>
which Westminster Abbey, the Tower, Somerset <lb/>
House, the British Museum, nay, Parliament itself, <lb/>
sink into utter insignificance. I have seen Elizabeth <lb/>
<pb n="284" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0285"/>
Fry in Newgate, and I have witnessed there the <lb/>
miraculous effect of true Christianity upon the most <lb/>
depraved of human beings. And yet the wretched <lb/>
outcasts have been tamed and subdued by the <lb/>
Christian eloquence of Mrs. Fry."</p>
<p>But the work was sometimes almost heart-<reg orig="rend-|ing">rending</reg> <lb/>
in its nature. Take the typical case of a woman <lb/>
named Elizabeth Fricker, who was executed for <lb/>
being accessory to the robbing of a dwelling-house. <lb/>
Mrs. Fry visited her on the 4th of March, 1817, <lb/>
the day before the execution, and wrote the <reg orig="follow-|ing">following</reg> <lb/>
memorandum respecting this and other painful <lb/>
cases:&mdash;"I have just returned from a most <reg orig="melan-|choly">melancholy</reg> <lb/>
visit to Newgate, where I have been, at the <lb/>
request of Elizabeth Fricker, previous to her <reg orig="execu-|tion">execution</reg> <lb/>
to-morrow morning at eight o'clock. I found <lb/>
her much harried, distressed, and tormented in <lb/>
mind: her hands cold, and covered with <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
like the perspiration preceding death, and in <lb/>
an universal tremor. The women who were with <lb/>
her said she had been so outrageous before our <lb/>
going that they thought a man must be sent for <lb/>
to manage her. However, after a serious time <lb/>
with her, her troubled soul became calmed. But <lb/>
is it for man thus to take the prerogative of the <lb/>
Almighty into his own hands? Is it not his place <lb/>
rather to endeavour to reform such; or restrain <lb/>
them from the commission of further evil; at least <lb/>
to afford poor erring fellow-mortals, whatever may <lb/>
be their offences, an opportunity of proving their <reg orig="re-|pentance">repentance</reg> <lb/>
by amendment of life? Besides this poor <lb/>
young woman, there are also six men to be hanged, <lb/>
one of whom has a wife near her confinement, <lb/>
<pb n="285" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0286"/>
also condemned, and seven young children. Since <lb/>
the awful report came down, he has become quite <lb/>
mad, from horror of mind. A strait-waistcoat <lb/>
could not keep him within bounds; he has just <lb/>
bitten the turnkey; I saw the man come out with <lb/>
his hand bleeding, as I passed the cell. I hear <lb/>
that another, who had been tolerably educated <lb/>
and brought up, was doing all he could to harden <lb/>
himself, through unbelief, trying to convince <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
that religious truths were idle tales. In this <lb/>
endeavour, he appeared to have been too successful <lb/>
with several of his fellow-sufferers. He sent to <lb/>
beg for a bottle of wine, no doubt in the hope of <lb/>
drowning his misery, and the fears that would <lb/>
arise, by a degree of intoxication. I inquired no <lb/>
further; I had heard and seen enough."</p>
<p>In a published letter, by the Honourable H. G. <lb/>
Bennett, addressed to the Common Council and <lb/>
Livery of London, on the abuses existing in <reg orig="New-|gate">Newgate</reg>, <lb/>
he says, in allusion to Fricker's case:&mdash;</p>
<p>"A man by the name of Kelly, who was executed <lb/>
some weeks back for robbing a house, counteracted <lb/>
by his conversation, and by the jest he made of <lb/>
all religious feelings, the labour of Dr. Cotton to <lb/>
produce repentance and remorse among the prisoners <lb/>
in the cells; and he died as he lived, hardened <lb/>
and unrepenting. He sent to me the day before <lb/>
his execution, and when I saw him, he maintained <lb/>
the innocence of the woman convicted with him, <lb/>
asserting that not Fricker, but a boy concealed, <lb/>
opened the door, and let him into the house. <lb/>
When I pressed him to tell me the name of the <lb/>
parties concerned, whereby to save the woman's <lb/>
<pb n="286" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0287"/>
life, he declined complying without a promise of <lb/>
pardon. I urged as strongly as I could the crime <lb/>
of suffering an innocent woman to be executed to <lb/>
screen criminal accomplices; but it was all to no <lb/>
effect, and he suffered, maintaining to the last the <lb/>
same story. With him was executed a boy of <lb/>
nineteen or twenty years of age, whose fears and <lb/>
remorse Kelly was constantly ridiculing."</p>
<p>In April, 1817, Mrs. Fry succeeded in forming a <lb/>
ladies' society under the title of "An Association <lb/>
for the Improvement of the Female Prisoners in <lb/>
Newgate." The association included eleven <reg orig="Quaker-|esses">Quakeresses</reg> <lb/>
and one clergyman's wife, and its objects <lb/>
were "to provide for the clothing, instruction, and <lb/>
employment of the women; to introduce them to <lb/>
a knowledge of the Scriptures; and to form in <lb/>
them, as much as possible, those habits of sobriety, <lb/>
order, and industry which may render them docile <lb/>
and peaceable whilst in prison, and respectable <lb/>
when they leave it." The sheriffs and city <lb/>
magistrates concurred in the efforts made, and <lb/>
rules were drawn up for the regulation and <reg orig="im-|provement">improvement</reg> <lb/>
of the condition of the female prisoners. <lb/>
Funds were forthcoming from Mrs. Fry's own <lb/>
family circle and other quarters, and the work of <lb/>
battling with ignorance, vice, and crime began <lb/>
vigorously. In a short time, the school and <reg orig="manu-|factory">manufactory</reg> <lb/>
portions of the remedial work were taken <lb/>
under the wing of the Corporation, and adopted <lb/>
as part of the prison system, and the industry of <lb/>
the women was turned to account. In May, 1817, <lb/>
the Committee of Aldermen relating to gaols met <lb/>
at the Mansion House, and unanimously resolved: <lb/>
<pb n="287" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0288"/>
"That the thanks of this Committee be given to <lb/>
Mrs. Fry and the other ladies who have so kindly <lb/>
exerted themselves with a view to bettering the <lb/>
condition of the women confined in the gaol in <lb/>
Newgate, and that they be requested to continue <lb/>
their exertions, which have hitherto been attended <lb/>
with good effect."</p>
<p>A lady-worker belonging to the Association has <lb/>
thus described a scene which might well inspire <lb/>
the painter's pencil:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">May 2nd</hi>.&mdash;Rose early and visited Newgate, <lb/>
where most of the Committee met to receive the <lb/>
Lord Mayor, the sheriffs, several aldermen, among <lb/>
whom were Sir William Curtis, Atkins, and some <lb/>
of the Gaol Committee, who had visited Elizabeth <lb/>
Fry the preceding day, in order to learn what had <lb/>
been done, what remained to be improved, and to <lb/>
lend the assistance they deemed needful in this <lb/>
important work. The wisdom and integrity of her <lb/>
purpose was made apparent to them, and the plans <lb/>
gradually expanded before each of them. Nothing <lb/>
was precipitated, caution marked every step, and <lb/>
even the irritable state of city politics does not <lb/>
interfere with this attempt at improvement. The <lb/>
women were assembled as usual, looking <reg orig="particu-|larly">particularly</reg> <lb/>
clean, and Elizabeth Fry had commenced <lb/>
reading a Psalm when the whole of the party <lb/>
entered the already crowded room. Her reading <lb/>
was thus interrupted for a short time. She looked <lb/>
calmly on the approaching gentlemen, who, soon <lb/>
perceiving the solemnity of her occupation, stood <lb/>
still amidst the multitude; whilst Elizabeth Fry <lb/>
resumed her office, and the women their quietude, <lb/>
<pb n="288" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0289"/>
in an impressive tone she told them she never <lb/>
permitted any trifling circumstance to interrupt the <lb/>
very solemn and important engagement of reading <lb/>
the Holy Scriptures; but in this instance it <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
unavoidable, from the unexpected entrance <lb/>
of so many persons, besides which, when <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
offers, we should pay respect to those in <lb/>
authority over us, those who administer justice. <lb/>
She thus, with a Christian prudence peculiar to <lb/>
herself, controlled the whole assembly, and subdued <lb/>
the feelings of the prisoners, many of whom were <lb/>
but too well acquainted with the faces of the <lb/>
magistrates, who were themselves touched and <lb/>
astonished at being thus introduced to a state of <lb/>
decorum so new within those walls; and could not <lb/>
help acknowledging how admirably this mode of <lb/>
treatment was adapted to overcome the evil spirit <lb/>
which had so long triumphed there. The usual <lb/>
silence ensued after the reading, then the women <lb/>
withdrew. We could not help feeling particularly <lb/>
glad that the gentlemen were present at this <reg orig="read-|ing">reading</reg>; <lb/>
the prisoners crowded round the Lord Mayor <lb/>
and sheriffs, to beg little favours. We had a long <lb/>
conference with these gentlemen relative to this <lb/>
prison and its objects, and to the wisest regulations <lb/>
for prison discipline, and the causes of crime; <lb/>
indeed, we could not have received more kind or <lb/>
devoted attention to what was suggested. <reg orig="Eliza-|beth">Elizabeth</reg> <lb/>
Fry's manner seemed to awaken new trains <lb/>
of reflection, and to place the individual value of <lb/>
these poor creatures before them in a fresh point <lb/>
of view. They talked of building a schoolroom, <lb/>
but as it would encroach on the area of the yard, <lb/>
<pb n="289" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0290"/>
the scheme was unanimously abandoned. <reg orig="Regula-|tions">Regulations</reg> <lb/>
for cooking, washing, and dining were <reg orig="pro-|mised">promised</reg>; <lb/>
but everything at present that involves <lb/>
expense to the city is relinquished. Economy, not <lb/>
parsimony, was the theme of the Lord Mayor; <lb/>
private benevolence has up to this time supplied <lb/>
every extra expense, besides what is termed the <lb/>
Sheriffs' Gift. The sheriffs came to our <reg orig="committee-|room">committee-room</reg>; <lb/>
they ordered a cell to be given up to the <lb/>
committee for the temporary confinement of <reg orig="delin-|quents">delinquents</reg>; <lb/>
it was to be made appear as formidable <lb/>
as possible, and we hope never to require it.</p>
<p>"12<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.&mdash;The soldiers who guarded the interior of <lb/>
Newgate were, at our request, dismissed; they <lb/>
overlooked the women's yard, and rendered them <lb/>
very disorderly.</p>
<p>"23<hi rend="italic">rd</hi>.&mdash;I found poor Woodman lying-in, in the <lb/>
common ward, where she had been taken suddenly <lb/>
ill; herself and little girl were each doing very well. <lb/>
She was awaiting her execution, at the end of the <lb/>
month. What can be said of such sights as these?</p>
<p>"24<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.&mdash;I read to Woodman, who was not in the <lb/>
state of mind we could wish for her; indeed, so <lb/>
unnatural is her situation that one can hardly tell <lb/>
how or in what manner to meet her case. She <lb/>
seems afraid to love her baby, and the very health <lb/>
which is being restored to her produces irritation <lb/>
of mind."</p>
<p>It has been remarked that this last entry "<reg orig="in-|cidentally">incidentally</reg> <lb/>
furnishes proof of the barbarity of the <lb/>
laws of Christian England at that time. Human <lb/>
life was of no account compared with the robbery <lb/>
of a few shillings, or the cutting down of a tree. <lb/>
<pb n="290" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0291"/>
This matter of capital punishment, in its turn, <lb/>
attracted the attention of the Quaker community, <lb/>
together with other philanthropic individuals, and <lb/>
the Statute Book was in time freed from many <lb/>
of the sanguinary enactments which had, prior to <lb/>
that period, disgraced it."</p>
<p>Public attention now began to be attracted <lb/>
towards Elizabeth Fry and her work, and this <lb/>
she deeply regretted, as notoriety was distasteful <lb/>
to her. Against her will she became famous, <lb/>
and letters poured in upon her from all parts of <lb/>
the country. Some were from ladies wishing to <lb/>
form prison-visiting associations, others were from <lb/>
magistrates; and both classes required thoughtful <lb/>
replies. Then there were innumerable petitions <lb/>
from poor people for counsel, employment, or <lb/>
pecuniary aid. Further, Mrs. Fry accompanied <lb/>
almost daily groups of distinguished and influential <lb/>
persons who wished to see for themselves what had <lb/>
been done in the prison. Once she was at Newgate <lb/>
in company with the Chancellor of the Exchequer <lb/>
and other celebrities, and at another time she <lb/>
appeared at the Mansion House, honoured by <lb/>
Royalty. Queen Charlotte desired her to appear <lb/>
before her, so that she might see and converse <lb/>
with one who had solved a great social problem <lb/>
which had baffled the municipal authorities of <lb/>
London. The meeting was one to be remembered. <lb/>
The presentation to the Queen was to have taken <lb/>
place in the drawing-room of the Mansion House, <lb/>
but by some mistake Mrs. Fry was conducted to <lb/>
the Egyptian Hall, where a number of <reg orig="school-|children">schoolchildren</reg> <lb/>
were waiting to be examined. After a <lb/>
<pb n="291" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0292"/>
time the Queen arrived, with a distinguished <lb/>
party. "At the close of the examination," says an <lb/>
eye-witness, "her Majesty, who was now aged and <lb/>
infirm, perceived Mrs. Fry, and advanced to address <lb/>
her. It was a fitting subject for Hayter, the Court <lb/>
painter: the diminutive stature of the Queen, <lb/>
covered with diamonds, but her countenance lighted <lb/>
up with an expression of the kindest benevolence; <lb/>
Mrs. Fry, her simple Quaker's dress adding to the <lb/>
height of her figure, though a little flushed, <reg orig="pre-|serving">preserving</reg> <lb/>
her wonted calmness of look and manner, <lb/>
with several of the bishops standing near her; the <lb/>
platform crowded with celebrities wearing orders, <lb/>
jewels, and waving feathers; the noble hall lined <lb/>
with spectators, and in the centre hundreds of poor <lb/>
children brought there to be examined from their <lb/>
different schools. The English nation may be slow <lb/>
in perceiving the beauty of a moral sentiment; <lb/>
but, when perceived, none appreciate it more highly. <lb/>
A murmur of applause ran through the assembly, <lb/>
followed by a simultaneous cheer, which was <reg orig="re-|peated">repeated</reg> <lb/>
again and again, and taken up by the <lb/>
multitude without, finally dying away gradually in <lb/>
the distance. The scene demonstrated that a <lb/>
devoted life, and one distinguished for the spirit <lb/>
of love and self-sacrifice, will take precedence <lb/>
even of Royal state in touching the heart of the <lb/>
people."</p>
<p>Yet her very public position brought peculiar <lb/>
trials with it for Mrs. Fry. She was especially <lb/>
disturbed and wounded by a serious <reg orig="misunder-|standing">misunderstanding</reg> <lb/>
with Lord Sidmouth, arising out of a <lb/>
case of capital punishment, and the efforts she <lb/>
<pb n="292" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0293"/>
made for a reconciliation testify to her <reg orig="sensitive-|ness">sensitiveness</reg> <lb/>
of spirit. On the other hand, there were <lb/>
compensations to cheer her in her work. In June, <lb/>
1818, prison reform was brought before the House <lb/>
of Lords, and the Marquis of Lansdowne moved <lb/>
an address to the Prince Regent for an inquiry <lb/>
into the state of the prisons of the United <reg orig="King-|dom">Kingdom</reg>. <lb/>
He quoted some remarkable statistics on <lb/>
the miseries of the gaols, and concluded with a <lb/>
high eulogium upon Mrs. Fry, as the "good genius" <lb/>
among the criminals of Newgate. Minor reforms <lb/>
still continued to be effected in the Old Bailey. <lb/>
A small shop was opened between the gates, <lb/>
where tea, sugar, and other things could be <reg orig="pur-|chased">purchased</reg> <lb/>
by the prisoners out of their earnings, thus <lb/>
avoiding the temptations from without. There <lb/>
was plenty of room for work, as Botany Bay could <lb/>
take any number of garments made by the female <lb/>
English prisoners. Mrs. Fry was further successful <lb/>
in putting a stop to the disgraceful riots which <lb/>
had always attended the removal of the female <lb/>
convicts for transportation to the vessels awaiting <lb/>
them at Deptford.</p>
<p>Her work in connection with convict-ships and <lb/>
convict settlements now demands some detailed <lb/>
mention. Early in the nineteenth century <reg orig="trans-|ported">transported</reg> <lb/>
criminals were sent to New South Wales, <lb/>
and the voyage was performed without <reg orig="classifica-|tion">classification</reg>, <lb/>
employment, or superintendence. In New <lb/>
South Wales, no arrangements were made for <lb/>
enabling them to earn an honest living. Mrs. <lb/>
Fry exerted herself greatly to induce the <reg orig="Govern-|ment">Government</reg> <lb/>
to make proper regulations for the voyage, <lb/>
<pb n="293" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0294"/>
and to provide a suitable home and proper <lb/>
employments for them on arriving. But her <lb/>
labours to achieve these desirable ends were very <lb/>
arduous. On one occasion there were 128 female <lb/>
convicts to be got on board at Deptford. Mrs. <lb/>
Fry prevailed on the Governor to consent to their <lb/>
removal in hackney coaches, and she and her <lb/>
friends superintended the arrangements for the <lb/>
journey. When on board ship, the ladies were <lb/>
distressed to see so many women and children <lb/>
herded together below deck. They were usually <lb/>
divided into classes of six each, the worst being <lb/>
mingled with the best; but Mrs. Fry proposed that <lb/>
they should be arranged in classes of twelve, <reg orig="ac-|cording">according</reg> <lb/>
to ages and criminality; and to this the <lb/>
convicts themselves assented. A monitor for each <lb/>
class was chosen out of the steadiest of the convicts. <lb/>
The question of work next came up, for it was <lb/>
felt that complete idleness during so long a voyage <lb/>
must have injurious effects. Fortunately, Mrs. Fry <lb/>
and her friends received from certain wholesale <lb/>
houses in London sufficient remnants of cotton, <lb/>
print, and materials for knitting to furnish all the <lb/>
convicts with work. As there were several weeks <lb/>
before the vessel sailed, the arrangements for this <lb/>
light labour were perfected, many of the women <lb/>
being glad to have the chance of benefiting <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>, <lb/>
and of earning sufficient money to make a <lb/>
fair start on arriving at their destination. Provision <lb/>
was further made for the instruction of all the <lb/>
children on board. When the time came for the <lb/>
vessel, which was called the <hi rend="italic">Maria</hi>, to sail, Mrs. <lb/>
Fry held a religious service for the convicts. She <lb/>
<pb n="294" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0295"/>
had been in and out amongst them for nearly five <lb/>
weeks, and now the time had come for them to <lb/>
say good-bye to England. Mrs. Fry stood near the <lb/>
door of the cabin, with the women facing her, and <lb/>
ranged on the quarter-deck, while the sailors <reg orig="occu-|pied">occupied</reg> <lb/>
different positions in the rigging and at other <lb/>
vantage-points. As she read in a solemn voice <lb/>
some passages from her pocket-Bible, the sailors <lb/>
on board the other ships leant over to hear the <lb/>
sacred words. When the reading was done, she <lb/>
knelt down and commended the party of exiles to <lb/>
God's mercy, while those for whom she prayed <lb/>
sobbed bitterly that they should see her face no <lb/>
more. When she left the ship, the poor women <lb/>
followed her with their eyes and their blessings as <lb/>
long as she remained in sight.</p>
<p>The convicts reached New South Wales safely; <lb/>
but as time wore on Mrs. Fry learned to her <reg orig="pro-|found">profound</reg> <lb/>
sorrow the actual condition of this penal <lb/>
colony. She found that all her labours, all systems <lb/>
of prison discipline, all efforts to reform the offender, <lb/>
were absolutely null and void, and but a wasteful <lb/>
expenditure of time and money, so long as the <lb/>
female convicts were without shelter, without <reg orig="re-|source">resource</reg>, <lb/>
and without protection, on their arrival in <lb/>
the land of exile. Rations just sufficient to <reg orig="main-|tain">maintain</reg> <lb/>
life were, it is true, allotted them daily; but <lb/>
a place to sleep in, or the means to obtain one, <lb/>
or necessary clothing for themselves, and, when <lb/>
mothers, for their children, they were absolutely <lb/>
without. It only aggravated their misery to <reg orig="in-|culcate">inculcate</reg> <lb/>
morality, and to endeavour to prove to them <lb/>
that without holiness no one can see the Lord, <lb/>
<pb n="295" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0296"/>
when they were placed in such circumstances that <lb/>
existence could only be maintained at the terrible <lb/>
price of their ruin. Much of this was drawn from <lb/>
the prisoners themselves, but careful inquiries <reg orig="con-|firmed">confirmed</reg> <lb/>
their accounts, and Mrs. Fry received from <lb/>
the Rev. Samuel Marsden, chaplain in New South <lb/>
Wales, a letter full of the most painful and <reg orig="heart-|rending">heart-rending</reg> <lb/>
details. Mr. Marsden had been to Europe <lb/>
some years before, and had proved to his Majesty's <lb/>
Government and the heads of the Colonial Office <lb/>
the absolute necessity of providing barracks for <lb/>
the accommodation of the female convicts before <lb/>
any good remedial work could be achieved.</p>
<p>In concluding his remarkable letter to Mrs. Fry, <lb/>
Mr. Marsden said: "I rejoice, madam, that you <lb/>
reside near the seat of Government, and may have <lb/>
it in your power to call the attention of his <lb/>
Majesty's Ministers to this important subject&mdash;a <lb/>
subject in which the entire welfare of these <reg orig="settle-|ments">settlements</reg> <lb/>
is involved. If proper care is taken of the <lb/>
women, the colony will prosper, and the expenses <lb/>
to the mother country will be reduced. On the <lb/>
contrary, if the morals of the female convicts are <lb/>
wholly neglected, as they have been hitherto, the <lb/>
colony will be only a nursery for crime, and <lb/>
mothers will continue, as they now do, to abandon <lb/>
their daughters at an early age, to every kind of <lb/>
evil for the sake of gain, and the burdens of these <lb/>
settlements will increase with the increasing number <lb/>
of persons who live in vice, idleness, and debauchery. <lb/>
What has been wanting hitherto, was an active <lb/>
agent in London, living upon the spot, who would <lb/>
and could move those in authority, to interest <lb/>
<pb n="296" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0297"/>
themselves in behalf of the exiled females. I now <lb/>
flatter myself, madam, you will become that effective <lb/>
agent, and that you will only want to be acquainted <lb/>
with facts to stimulate your exertions for the good <lb/>
of the outcasts of society. If we bud or graft a <lb/>
tree, corrupt in its nature, with good fruit, the new <lb/>
graft or budding will bring forth good fruit. <lb/>
'Make the tree good, and then the fruit will be <lb/>
good also.'</p>
<p>"Your good intentions and benevolent labours <lb/>
will be all abortive, if the exiled females on their <lb/>
arrival in the colony are plunged into every <lb/>
sort of ruinous temptation and vice, which will ever <lb/>
be the case till some barrack is provided for them. <lb/>
Great evils in a state cannot be soon remedied. <lb/>
In the cure of radical state evils, the work must <lb/>
be slow, and all who are engaged in it must <lb/>
exercise great patience and perseverance, if they <lb/>
hope to succeed. I have been complaining and <lb/>
remonstrating for more than twenty years, and <lb/>
have done nothing yet effectually; but hope never <lb/>
to relinquish the object in view till I see it <reg orig="accom-|plished">accomplished</reg>. <lb/>
I believe the Governor has got instructions <lb/>
from home to provide accommodation for the <lb/>
female convicts, and hope in two or three years to <lb/>
see them lodged in a comfortable barrack, so that <lb/>
none shall be lost for want of a hut to lie in. <lb/>
If a communication is kept up on a regular plan, <lb/>
between this colony and London, much good may <lb/>
be done for the poor female convicts. It was the <lb/>
custom for some years, when a ship with female <lb/>
convicts arrived, soldiers, convicts, and settlers were <lb/>
allowed to go on board, and take their choice; this <lb/>
<pb n="297" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0298"/>
custom does not now openly obtain countenance <lb/>
and sanction, but when they are landed they have <lb/>
no friend, nor any accommodation, and therefore <lb/>
are glad to live with any one who can give them <lb/>
protection; so that the real moral state of the <lb/>
females is little improved from what it always has <lb/>
been, nor will it be the least improved till they can <lb/>
be provided with a barrack. The neglect of the <lb/>
female convicts in this country is a disgrace to our <lb/>
national character, as well as a national sin. Many <lb/>
do not live out half their days from their habits of <lb/>
vice. When I am called to visit them upon their <lb/>
dying beds, my mind is greatly pained, my mouth <lb/>
is shut, I know not what to say to them. Probably, <lb/>
at the very time when the men with whom they live <lb/>
are with them in their dying moments, perhaps I <lb/>
am constrained to say, 'Know ye not, that the <reg orig="un-|righteous">unrighteous</reg> <lb/>
shall not inherit the kingdom of God,' <lb/>
etc. While I use the Scripture language, my soul <lb/>
yearns over them. I should wish to impart to them <lb/>
the consolations of the Gospel, and point out to <lb/>
them the Lamb of God, but my tongue often <lb/>
seems tied, I have got nothing to say to them. <lb/>
To tell them of their crimes is to upbraid them <lb/>
with misfortune. They will say, 'Sir, you know <lb/>
how I was situated, I did not wish to lead the life <lb/>
I have done, I know and lament my sins, but <lb/>
necessity compelled me to do what my conscience <lb/>
condemned; I could not help myself, and must <lb/>
have starved if I had not done as I have.' These <lb/>
are cases continually met with, and are very <reg orig="dis-|tressing">distressing</reg>. <lb/>
Many, again, I meet with who think <lb/>
these things no crime, because they believe their <lb/>
<pb n="298" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0299"/>
necessities compel them to live in their sins. Hence <lb/>
their consciences are so hardened through the <lb/>
deceitfulness of sin, that death itself gives them <lb/>
little concern."</p>
<p>This powerful appeal was not without its effect, <lb/>
and official dilatoriness was compelled to give way <lb/>
before the cry for reform. Meantime Mrs. Fry still <lb/>
continued her exertions in improving the condition <lb/>
of the convict-ships, or floating prisons. She was <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg> <lb/>
detained for weeks in the Thames, arranging <lb/>
for the instruction, employment, and personal <reg orig="clean-|liness">cleanliness</reg> <lb/>
and comfort of the women. With her friend <lb/>
and fellow-helper, Mrs. Pryor, she had to endure <lb/>
exposure to weather, rough seas, and accidents; <lb/>
and on one occasion they ran the risk of drowning <lb/>
together, being rescued with great difficulty from a <lb/>
perilous position while they were navigating a little <lb/>
boat on the Thames. Unnecessary cruelties were <lb/>
sometimes inflicted on the female convicts. In <lb/>
1822 a party of prisoners arrived at Woolwich from <lb/>
Lancaster Castle, not only handcuffed, but with <lb/>
heavy irons on their legs, which, in some cases, <reg orig="in-|duced">induced</reg> <lb/>
swelling and inflammation. It is stated that <lb/>
a vessel called <hi rend="italic">The Brothers</hi> sailed in 1823, with its <lb/>
freight of human misery on board, "and the <reg orig="suffer-|ing">suffering</reg> <lb/>
which resulted from the mode of ironing was <lb/>
so great that Mrs. Fry took down the names and <lb/>
particulars, in order to make representations to the <lb/>
Government. Twelve women arrived on board the <lb/>
vessel handcuffed; eleven others had iron hoops <lb/>
round their legs and arms, and were chained to each <lb/>
other. The complaints of these women were very <lb/>
mournful. They were not allowed to get up or <lb/>
<pb n="299" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0300"/>
down from the coach without the whole party being <lb/>
dragged together. Some of them had children to <lb/>
carry, but they received no help or alleviation to <lb/>
their sufferings. One woman from Wales must <lb/>
have had a bitter experience of irons. She came <lb/>
to the ship with a hoop around her ankle, and <lb/>
when the sub-matron insisted on having it removed <lb/>
the operation was so painful that the poor wretch <lb/>
fainted. She told Mrs. Fry that she had worn for <lb/>
some time an iron hoop around her waist; from <lb/>
that a chain connected with hoops round her legs, <lb/>
above the knee; from these another chain was <lb/>
fastened to irons round her ankles. Not content <lb/>
with this, her hands were confined <hi rend="italic">every night</hi> to <lb/>
the hoop which went round her waist, while she <lb/>
lay like a log on her bed of straw. Such tales <lb/>
remind one of the tortures of the Inquisition."</p>
<p>A correspondence between Mrs. Fry and the <lb/>
Controller of the Navy, in 1820, revealed the <reg orig="pleas-|ing">pleasing</reg> <lb/>
fact that the building for the women in New <lb/>
South Wales was already in course of erection. <lb/>
In a letter to Earl Bathurst, a member of the <lb/>
Government, Mrs. Fry made a number of <reg orig="valu-|able">valuable</reg> <lb/>
suggestions relative to the female convicts <lb/>
after their arrival at Hobart Town, Tasmania. <lb/>
These suggestions included education; the <reg orig="appoint-|ment">appointment</reg> <lb/>
of a respectable and judicious matron; of a <lb/>
Government inspector of vessels; of a notification <lb/>
of each woman's offence, character, and capability <lb/>
by the Surgeon-superintendent; the provision of <lb/>
domestic service for the best convicts; the adoption <lb/>
of a uniform dress, etc. Her recommendations were <lb/>
well received, and carried out. Every year five or <lb/>
<pb n="300" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0301"/>
six convict-ships went out to the Australian colonies, <lb/>
and Mrs. Fry continually visited each ship until <lb/>
it sailed. The leave-takings were very pathetic. <lb/>
One vessel which left Woolwich in 1826 was visited <lb/>
together by Mrs. Fry and William Wilberforce.</p>
<p>In giving a graphic picture of the scene, one who <lb/>
was present writes: "On board, between two and <lb/>
three hundred women were assembled, in order to <lb/>
listen to the exhortations and prayers of perhaps the <lb/>
two brightest personifications of Christian <reg orig="philan-|thropy">philanthropy</reg> <lb/>
that the age could boast. Scarcely could two <lb/>
voices even so distinguished for beauty and power <lb/>
be imagined united in a more touching <reg orig="engage-|ment">engagement</reg>; <lb/>
as, indeed, was testified by the breathless <lb/>
attention, the tears and suppressed sobs of the <lb/>
gathered listeners. No lapse of time can ever efface <lb/>
the impression of the 107th Psalm, as read by Mrs. <lb/>
Fry with such extraordinary emphasis and <reg orig="intona-|tion">intonation</reg> <lb/>
that it seemed to make the simple reading <lb/>
a commentary."</p>
<p>With regard to the <hi rend="italic">George Hibbert</hi> convict-ship, <lb/>
which sailed in 1834, Mrs. Fry interviewed Lord <lb/>
Melbourne and Mr. Spring Rice; and as the result <lb/>
of her earnest pleadings, Mrs. Saunders, the wife of <lb/>
a missionary returning to the colony, was permitted <lb/>
by the Government to fill the office of matron to <lb/>
the convicts. When Mrs. Saunders fell ill on the <lb/>
voyage, her husband took her place as far as <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg>, <lb/>
and performed the duties of chaplain and <lb/>
schoolmaster. The experiment answered <reg orig="admir-|ably">admirably</reg>. <lb/>
Many other useful reforms were effected in <lb/>
the condition of prisons and convicts by the Ladies' <lb/>
British Society, formed by Mrs. Fry. Ultimately, <lb/>
<pb n="301" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0302"/>
after an interview with Queen Adelaide and other <lb/>
members of the Royal Family, Mrs. Fry was able <lb/>
to record: "Surely the result of our labours has <lb/>
hitherto been beyond our most sanguine <reg orig="expecta-|tions">expectations</reg>, <lb/>
as to the improved state of our prisons, female <lb/>
convict-ships, and the convicts in New South <lb/>
Wales."</p>
<p>Returning to Mrs. Fry's home work, in 1818 she <lb/>
made a religious and philanthropic tour through <lb/>
Scotland, together with her daughter Rachel, Joseph <lb/>
John Gurney, and his wife. The principal object <lb/>
was the visitation of Friends' Meetings, but with <lb/>
this, prison visitation was also comprised. On the <lb/>
way north, they were the guests of the Earl of Derby, <lb/>
at Knowsley, and they inspected many of the <reg orig="Lan-|cashire">Lancashire</reg> <lb/>
gaols and bridewells. In some of these, and <lb/>
also in the Scotch prisons, the horrors exceeded <lb/>
those of Newgate. At Haddington there were four <lb/>
prison cells almost Cimmerian in their darkness, <lb/>
with clay floors, no fireplaces, straw for beds, and <lb/>
in each cell a tub, the receptacle for all filth. Mrs. <lb/>
Fry found one poor young fellow, a lunatic, who <lb/>
had been subjected to misery and torture in <reg orig="Had-|dington">Haddington</reg> <lb/>
Gaol for eighteen months, without once <lb/>
leaving his cell for an airing. No clothes were <lb/>
allowed, no medical man attended, no chaplain ever <lb/>
attended, and the prison was destitute of an <reg orig="airing-|yard">airing-yard</reg>. <lb/>
Debtors, however many or few, were all <lb/>
confined in one small cell, about nine feet square, <lb/>
where one little bed served for all. At Kinghorn, <lb/>
in Fifeshire, a young laird had languished for six <lb/>
years in the prison, in a state of madness, and <lb/>
had at length committed suicide. The prisoners at <lb/>
<pb n="302" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0303"/>
Forfar were chained to the bedstead; at Berwick <lb/>
to the walls of their cells; and at Newcastle to a <lb/>
ring in the floor. The worst features of the <reg orig="Scot-|tish">Scottish</reg> <lb/>
prisons were the treatment of debtors, and the <lb/>
cruelties practised towards lunatics. Mrs. Fry's <reg orig="ex-|posure">exposure</reg> <lb/>
led to salutary reforms in these dark prison <lb/>
abodes.</p>
<p>Another question which greatly occupied Mrs. <lb/>
Fry at this time was that of capital punishment. <lb/>
Quakers were opposed to the death penalty for <lb/>
any crime save that of murder, and the heart of <lb/>
the philanthropist was cut to the quick by the <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
that even women were sent to the scaffold <lb/>
for simply passing forged Bank of England notes, <lb/>
and for other minor offences. Forgery, smuggling, <lb/>
coining, passing bad coin or forged notes, and <reg orig="shop-|lifting">shoplifting</reg>, <lb/>
were all punishable by death. One terrible <lb/>
case especially, though it was only one out of <lb/>
many, made the public conscience revolt. A young <lb/>
woman, the destitute wife of a man whom the <lb/>
press-gang had captured and carried off to sea, <lb/>
was actually hanged for stealing, to which she had <lb/>
been driven in order to procure food for herself and <lb/>
her child. Great numbers were thus executed, and <lb/>
yet crime increased, for the simple reason that <lb/>
humane persons would not prosecute when they <lb/>
knew that the penalty for almost every offence was <lb/>
death. Writers, philanthropists, divines, caricaturists, <lb/>
and others, rose up against the Draconian severity <lb/>
of the laws; and as a consequence of the issue <lb/>
of a caricature by George Cruikshank, entitled, <lb/>
"Bank Note; not to be imitated," no man or <lb/>
woman was ever afterwards hanged for passing <lb/>
<pb n="303" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0304"/>
one-pound Bank of England notes, as had frequently <lb/>
been the case hitherto. Wilberforce, Mackintosh, <lb/>
Romilly, the Frys, the Gurneys, were all now <reg orig="labour-|ing">labouring</reg> <lb/>
hard to restrict the application of the death <lb/>
penalty. In 1810, when the House of Lords <reg orig="re-|jected">rejected</reg> <lb/>
Sir Samuel Romilly's Bill to remove the <lb/>
penalty for shop-lifting, the Royal Dukes of Sussex <lb/>
and Gloucester joined some of the peers in signing <lb/>
a protest against the law. In conjunction with the <lb/>
Duke of Gloucester, Mrs. Fry made an earnest <lb/>
effort to save from the scaffold a woman named <lb/>
Harriet Skelton, who had been led by others to <lb/>
pass forged Bank of England notes. She failed to <lb/>
save her, however, and it was in connection with <lb/>
this case and with other information supplied by <lb/>
Mrs. Fry to Lord Sidmouth that the painful <lb/>
misunderstanding arose between the philanthropist <lb/>
and the Home Secretary. The latter seemed to <lb/>
doubt Mrs. Fry's facts, and although he was not <lb/>
by nature a hard man, he shrank from wiping out <lb/>
the terrible blots in the English criminal code. It <lb/>
was not until the year 1823 that any considerable <lb/>
amelioration of the laws was secured. Then came <lb/>
Sir Robert Peel's humane measures; and finally, <lb/>
by the Act of 1861, the punishment of death <lb/>
was reserved for four crimes only. It must never <lb/>
be forgotten, however, that the great pioneers in <lb/>
the reform of the criminal code were Sir Samuel <lb/>
Romilly, Elizabeth Fry, and Sir James Mackintosh.</p>
<p>After examining the condition of the chief <lb/>
prisons in the British Isles, Mrs. Fry resolved to <lb/>
visit the Continental prisons. She had received <lb/>
communications from nearly every European capital. <lb/>
<pb n="304" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0305"/>
Her attention, however, was first directed to the <lb/>
Channel Islands, and when she visited them in <lb/>
1833 she found that none of the reforms adopted <lb/>
in England had found their way thither. The <lb/>
reason for this was that the islands were more <lb/>
French than English, and were not amenable to <lb/>
British Acts of Parliament. However, after a tour <lb/>
of inspection, she drew up a list of <reg orig="recommenda-|tions">recommendations</reg>, <lb/>
and forwarded them to the prison authorities. <lb/>
The whole penal system of the islands needed a <lb/>
thorough revision, and after many years spent in <lb/>
indefatigable efforts, Mrs. Fry succeeded in her <lb/>
projects. In January, 1838, she paid her first visit <lb/>
to France, being accompanied by two Friends, <lb/>
Josiah Forster and Lydia Irving. The prisons of <lb/>
the French capital were explored, including the <lb/>
St. Lazare Prison for women, containing nearly <lb/>
one thousand inmates; La Force Prison for men; <lb/>
the Central Prison at Poissy, and that of the <reg orig="Con-|ciergerie">Conciergerie</reg>. <lb/>
The prisoners in St. Lazare were much <lb/>
affected by Mrs. Fry's ministrations. After the <lb/>
prisons came the hospitals, schools, and convents, <lb/>
which were all carefully inspected. When the <lb/>
work was concluded, and various suggestions had <lb/>
been drawn up, Mrs. Fry had an audience of the <lb/>
King and his consort and the Duchess of Orleans.</p>
<p>The year 1839 saw Mrs. Fry engaged in <reg orig="further-|ing">furthering</reg> <lb/>
pecuniarily the interests of various benevolent <lb/>
institutions formed in England, including the <lb/>
Refuge for Girls at Chelsea, the Refuge for <lb/>
Women at Clapham, and the Ladies' Society for <lb/>
its work with the convict-ships. This <reg orig="accom-|plished">accomplished</reg>, <lb/>
she paid her second visit to the Continent. <lb/>
<pb n="305" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0306"/>
At Paris she inspected the hospitals for women <lb/>
and foundlings, and the hospital of St. Louis for <lb/>
the plague, leprosy, and other infectious disorders. <lb/>
In many cases she secured ameliorations of the <lb/>
severe treatment prevalent. At Nismes, guarded <lb/>
by five armed soldiers because of the desperate <lb/>
character of the inmates, she inspected the Maison <lb/>
Centrale, containing about twelve hundred <lb/>
prisoners. For some of the inmates she <reg orig="inter-|ceded">interceded</reg>, <lb/>
and was rewarded with tears of gratitude. <lb/>
The prison for the galley-slaves at Toulon she <lb/>
found to be a sad and fearful place, the criminals <lb/>
faring horribly. She was almost equally sad to <lb/>
find what little was done, remedially and religiously, <lb/>
for the inmates of a different institution at <reg orig="Mar-|seilles">Marseilles</reg>, <lb/>
a conventual establishment and refuge for <lb/>
female penitents. Very different were the <reg orig="arrange-|ments">arrangements</reg> <lb/>
at the Geneva Penitentiary, which she <lb/>
found to be most praiseworthy.</p>
<p>A third Continental tour was made by Mrs. <lb/>
Fry in 1840, when she was accompanied by her <lb/>
brother Samuel Gurney and his daughter, and by <lb/>
William Allen and Lucy Bradshaw. At Brussels <lb/>
the King frankly discussed with them the <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg> <lb/>
of the Belgian prisons, and Mrs. Fry was <lb/>
much pleased at the admirable management of a <lb/>
large prison for boys at Antwerp. At Hameln, in <lb/>
Hanover, was a men's prison of a different class, <lb/>
where the inmates were heavily chained to the <lb/>
ground until they confessed the crimes of which <lb/>
they were accused, whether they had committed <lb/>
them or not. At Berlin the travellers had a most <lb/>
cordial welcome from the Crown Prince and <lb/>
<pb n="306" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0307"/>
Princess, and other members of the Royal Family. <lb/>
Mrs. Fry's niece, in giving an account of a <reg orig="dis-|tinguished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
assembly at the Royal palace, specially <lb/>
invited to meet the visitors, says: "I could not <lb/>
but long for a painter's eye, to have carried away <lb/>
the scene. All of us seated in that beautiful <lb/>
room, our aunt in the middle of the sofa, the <lb/>
Crown Prince and Princess and the Princess Charles <lb/>
on her right; the Princess William, the Princess <lb/>
Marie, and the Princess Czartoryski on the left; <lb/>
Count Gr&ouml;ben sitting near her to interpret; the <lb/>
Countesses B&ouml;hlen and Dernatt by her. I was <lb/>
sitting by the Countess Schlieffen, a delightful <lb/>
person, who is much interested in all our <reg orig="proceed-|ings">proceedings</reg>. <lb/>
A table was placed before our aunt, with <lb/>
pens, ink, and paper, like other committees, with <lb/>
the various rules our aunt and I had drawn up, <lb/>
and the Countess B&ouml;hlen had translated into <lb/>
German, and which she read to the assembly. <lb/>
After that my aunt gave a concise account of the <lb/>
societies in England, commencing every fresh <lb/>
sentence with, 'If the Prince and Princesses will <lb/>
permit.' When business was over, my aunt <reg orig="men-|tioned">mentioned</reg> <lb/>
some texts which she asked leave to read. <lb/>
A German Bible was handed to Count Gr&ouml;ben; <lb/>
the text in Isaiah having been pointed out that <lb/>
our good aunt had wished for, 'Is not this the <lb/>
fast that I have chosen?' etc., the Count read it, <lb/>
after which our aunt said, 'Will the Prince and <lb/>
Princesses allow a short time for prayer?' They <lb/>
all bowed assent and stood, while she knelt down <lb/>
and offered one of her touching, heartfelt prayers <lb/>
for them&mdash;that a blessing might rest on the whole <lb/>
<pb n="307" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0308"/>
place, from the King on his throne to the poor <lb/>
prisoner in the dungeon; and she prayed <reg orig="especi-|ally">especially</reg> <lb/>
for the Royal Family; then for the ladies, <lb/>
that the works of their hands might be prospered <lb/>
in what they had undertaken to perform. Many <lb/>
of the ladies now withdrew, and we were soon left <lb/>
with the Royal Family. They all invited us to <lb/>
see them again before we left Berlin, and took <lb/>
leave of us in the kindest manner."</p>
<p>One result of Mrs. Fry's reception at Berlin was <lb/>
a relaxation of the stringent treatment of the <lb/>
Lutherans. Although, after her return to England <lb/>
Mrs. Fry began to find her health failing, she paid <lb/>
yet another brief visit to the Continent in 1841, <lb/>
when she was accompanied by her brother Joseph <lb/>
John Gurney and two nieces. At the Hague, <lb/>
they were introduced by the Prince Consort to <lb/>
the King, with whom they had an hour's audience. <lb/>
They afterwards visited Amsterdam, Bremen, and <lb/>
other cities, their journey having almost the <lb/>
character of a royal progress. They were received <lb/>
with unusual favour by the King and Queen of <lb/>
Denmark, to whom they unfolded, without fear, the <lb/>
condition of persecuted Christians; the sad state <lb/>
of the prisons in the Danish dominions, and the <lb/>
prevalence of slavery in the Danish colonies in the <lb/>
West Indies. Although she never sought to <lb/>
obtrude herself on Royal personages, she was <reg orig="every-|where">everywhere</reg> <lb/>
received by them with consideration. She <lb/>
was delighted with the German princesses, with <lb/>
whom she had much serious conversation, and she <lb/>
noted that the Christian ladies on the Continent <lb/>
dressed far more simply than those in England. <lb/>
<pb n="308" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0309"/>
Describing a meeting with the King and Queen of <lb/>
Prussia, Mrs. Fry wrote to one of her <reg orig="grand-|children">grandchildren</reg>: <lb/>
"The Royal Family were assembled, <lb/>
and numbers of the nobility; after a while, the <lb/>
King and Queen arrived; the poor Tyrolese <lb/>
flocked in numbers. I doubt such a meeting ever <lb/>
having been held anywhere before&mdash;the curious <lb/>
mixture of all ranks and conditions. My poor <lb/>
heart almost failed me. Most earnestly did I <lb/>
pray for best help, and not unduly to fear man. <lb/>
The Royal Family eat together, or nearly so; the <lb/>
King and Queen, Princess William and Princess <lb/>
Frederick, Princess Mary, Prince William, Prince <lb/>
Charles, Prince Frederick of the Netherlands, <lb/>
young Prince William, beside several other <lb/>
princes and princesses not Royal. Your uncle <lb/>
Joseph spoke for a little, explaining our views on <lb/>
worship. Then I enlarged upon the changes that <lb/>
had taken place since I was last in Prussia; <lb/>
mentioned the late King's kindness to these poor <lb/>
Tyrolese in their affliction and <reg orig="distress&mdash;after-|wards">distress&mdash;afterwards</reg> <lb/>
addressed these poor people, and then those <lb/>
of high rank, and felt greatly helped to speak the <lb/>
truth to them in love. They finished with a <lb/>
hymn."</p>
<p>One more brief visit Mrs. Fry paid to the <lb/>
Continent, and that was in 1843. The time was <lb/>
spent wholly in Paris, her object being to effect <lb/>
improvements in the management of the French <lb/>
prisons. The Duchesses of Orleans and <reg orig="Mecklen-|burg">Mecklenburg</reg>, <lb/>
the Duc de Broglie, M. Guizot, M. de <lb/>
Tocqueville, and others interested themselves in <lb/>
the subject, and a Bill to sanction the needful <lb/>
<pb n="309" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0310"/>
reforms was brought forward in the Chamber of <lb/>
Deputies by the Minister of the Interior. By its <lb/>
passage, the solitary confinement system was <lb/>
mitigated, the prisons of the galley-slaves were <lb/>
reformed, and smaller prisons were ordered to be <lb/>
erected for minor offenders. This measure was <lb/>
the pioneer of other legislative reforms. The <lb/>
philanthropist returned home feeble in body, but <lb/>
much cheered in soul, in consequence of the <reg orig="ever-|widening">ever-widening</reg> <lb/>
appreciation of her humanitarian efforts.</p>
<p>In her published letters, in her work entitled, <lb/>
"Observations on Female Prisoners" &lpar;1827&rpar;, and in <lb/>
her evidence before Committees of both Houses of <lb/>
Parliament, Mrs. Fry expounded her theories of <lb/>
prison discipline and management. In her brief <lb/>
but compact treatise dealing with this subject, she <lb/>
laid down suggestions, hints, and principles upon <lb/>
which others could work. She discussed among <lb/>
other things the formation of ladies' committees for <lb/>
visiting prisons, the right method of proceeding <lb/>
by such committees, female officers in prisons, <lb/>
separate prisons for females, instruction and <lb/>
employment, medical attendance, diet, clothing, <lb/>
and the benevolent efforts necessary for prisoners <lb/>
who have served their sentences. While she <lb/>
recommended to the attention of ladies not only <lb/>
prisons, but lunatic asylums, hospitals, and <reg orig="work-|houses">workhouses</reg>, <lb/>
she also strongly advised that only orderly <lb/>
and experienced visitors should endeavour to <lb/>
penetrate into the abodes of vice and wickedness. <lb/>
The spirit of the worker must be one of mercy, not <lb/>
of judgment; but it would not be well for her to <lb/>
converse with the prisoners on the subject of their <lb/>
<pb n="310" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0311"/>
crimes, or to appeal for the mitigation of sentences <lb/>
except in cases which were remarkably clear. <lb/>
Great discrimination should be exercised in the <lb/>
appointment of matrons. With regard to the <lb/>
classification of prisoners, Mrs. Fry recommended <lb/>
four classes or divisions which should comprise the <lb/>
total:&mdash;"1st. Prisoners of previous good character, <lb/>
and guilty only of venial crimes. This class, she <lb/>
suggested, should be allowed to dress a little better <lb/>
and be put to lighter labours than the others. <lb/>
From their ranks, also, should temporary officers <lb/>
be selected, while pecuniary rewards might be with <lb/>
propriety offered. 2nd. Prisoners convicted of <lb/>
more serious crimes. These should be treated <lb/>
with more strictness; but it should be possible for <lb/>
a prisoner, by constant good conduct and obedience <lb/>
to rules, to rise into the first class. 3rd. In this <lb/>
class the privileges were to be considerably <lb/>
diminished, while the fourth class consisted only <lb/>
of hardened offenders, guilty of serious crimes, and <lb/>
of those who had been frequently committed. <lb/>
'This class must undergo its peculiar privations <lb/>
and hardships.' Still, that hope may not entirely <lb/>
give place to despair, Mrs. Fry recommended that <lb/>
even these criminals should be eligible for <reg orig="pro-|motion">promotion</reg> <lb/>
to the upper classes upon good behaviour. <lb/>
It will be seen that this system partook somewhat <lb/>
of Captain Mackonochie's merit, or good-mark <lb/>
system, introduced by him with such remarkable <lb/>
success into Norfolk Island."</p>
<p>By way of promoting order and regularity, Mrs. <lb/>
Fry recommended that female convicts should <lb/>
wear a ticket, as also all articles belonging to them, <lb/>
<pb n="311" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0312"/>
whereby all disputes would be avoided. She <lb/>
further considered the most thorough, vigilant, and <lb/>
unremitting inspection essential to a correct <lb/>
system of prison discipline; and with regard to <lb/>
instruction, she had decided views as to the primary <lb/>
importance of Scriptural knowledge. The Bible <lb/>
was to be the text-book for this purpose. For the <lb/>
employment of prisoners, she recommended reading, <lb/>
writing, and arithmetic, and also such occupations <lb/>
as patchwork, stocking-knitting, making articles of <lb/>
plain needlework, washing, ironing, housework, <lb/>
cooking, spinning, and weaving. The greater <lb/>
portion of their allotted share of earnings should <lb/>
be reserved for them against the time of their <lb/>
leaving prison and returning to the world. She <lb/>
was not against the treadmill for hardened, <reg orig="re-|fractory">refractory</reg>, <lb/>
and depraved women, but only for short <lb/>
periods. Under the new regulations which she <lb/>
succeeded in getting passed, female convicts <lb/>
destined for the colonies were allowed to take out <lb/>
with them all children under the age of seven <lb/>
years, while mothers nursing their children were <lb/>
not compelled to leave England until the children <lb/>
were old enough to be weaned. Her general <lb/>
prison policy, which had most beneficial effects, <lb/>
was thus described by Mrs. Fry: "Let our prison <lb/>
discipline be severe in proportion to the enormity <lb/>
of the crimes of those on whom it is exercised, and <lb/>
let its strictness be such as to deter others from <lb/>
a similar course of iniquity, but let us ever aim at <lb/>
the diminution of crime through the just and <lb/>
happy medium of the reformation of criminals."</p>
<p>Mrs. Fry held that prisoners should be fitted <lb/>
<pb n="312" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0313"/>
to return to society improved, and not degraded, <lb/>
by their experience of penal measures. In giving <lb/>
evidence before a Committee of the House of <lb/>
Commons, in 1832, she said as regards secondary <lb/>
punishments that, while advocating complete <lb/>
separation at night, she quite as earnestly <reg orig="con-|tended">contended</reg> <lb/>
against what was known as the solitary <lb/>
system of confinement. It did not prepare women <lb/>
for returning to social and domestic life, or tend <lb/>
to real improvement so much as carefully arranged <lb/>
intercourse with one another during the day, under <lb/>
close superintendence and inspection. In the <lb/>
management of prisons, she was strongly in favour <lb/>
of female officers being superintended by ladies. <lb/>
On this point, she remarked in her evidence: "I <lb/>
may say, after sixteen years' experience, that the <lb/>
result of ladies of principle and respectability <lb/>
superintending the female officers in prisons, and <lb/>
the prisoners themselves, has far exceeded my <lb/>
most sanguine expectations. In no instance have <lb/>
I more clearly seen the beneficial effects of ladies <lb/>
visiting and superintending prisoners than on <lb/>
board convict-ships. I have witnessed the <reg orig="altera-|tions">alterations</reg> <lb/>
since ladies have visited them constantly in <lb/>
the river. I heard formerly of the most dreadful <lb/>
iniquity, confusion, and frequently great distress. <lb/>
Latterly I have seen a very wonderful <reg orig="improve-|ment">improvement</reg> <lb/>
in their conduct. And as to the voyage, I <lb/>
have most valuable certificates to show the <reg orig="differ-|ence">difference</reg> <lb/>
of their condition on their arrival in the <lb/>
colony. I can produce, if necessary, extracts from <lb/>
letters. Samuel Marsden, who has been chaplain <lb/>
there a good many years, says it is quite a different <lb/>
<pb n="313" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0314"/>
thing; that they used to come in a most filthy, <lb/>
abominable state, hardly fit for anything; now <lb/>
they arrive in good order, in a totally different <lb/>
situation. And I have heard the same thing from <lb/>
others. General Darling's wife, a very benevolent <lb/>
lady, has adopted the same system there; she has <lb/>
visited the prison at Paramatta, and the same <lb/>
thing respecting the officers is felt there as it is <lb/>
here. On the Continent of Europe, in various <lb/>
parts&mdash;St. Petersburg, Geneva, Turin, Berne, Basle, <lb/>
and some other places&mdash;there are corresponding <lb/>
societies, and the result is the same in every part. <lb/>
In Berlin they are doing wonders&mdash;I hear a most <lb/>
satisfactory account; and in St. Petersburg, where, <lb/>
from the barbarous state of the people, it was said <lb/>
it could not be done, the conduct of the prisoners <lb/>
has been perfectly astonishing&mdash;an entire change <lb/>
has been produced."</p>
<p>In May, 1835, Mrs. Fry further explained her <lb/>
views on prison management before a Select <reg orig="Com-|mittee">Committee</reg> <lb/>
of the House of Lords. She went carefully <lb/>
through the various proposals we have already <lb/>
cited, and one who was present thus describes her <lb/>
demeanour in giving her evidence: "Never, should <lb/>
I think, was the calm dignity of her character more <lb/>
conspicuous. Perfectly self-possessed, her speech <lb/>
flowed melodiously, her ideas were clearly <reg orig="ex-|pressed">expressed</reg>, <lb/>
and if another thought possessed her <lb/>
besides that of delivering her opinions faithfully <lb/>
and judiciously upon the subjects brought before <lb/>
her, it was that she might speak for her Lord and <lb/>
Master in that noble company." Respectful <reg orig="con-|sideration">consideration</reg> <lb/>
was given to her suggestions, and <lb/>
<pb n="314" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0315"/>
special attention was given to that portion of her <lb/>
evidence which condemned both the <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> and <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> systems as being peculiarly liable to abuse.</p>
<p>A few years after these expositions of her prison <lb/>
principles, she addressed a valuable communication <lb/>
to Colonel Jebb, in reference to the new Model <lb/>
Prison at Pentonville then in course of erection. <lb/>
While giving the buildings cordial praise on many <lb/>
points, she objected first to dark cells, as calculated <lb/>
to excite awful terrors, and then, on the ground of <lb/>
health and moral effects, to those cells in which the <lb/>
windows had such a description of glass that the <lb/>
sight of the sky was entirely precluded. Lunatic <lb/>
asylums and their keepers was another question <lb/>
on which she expressed very decided views. No <lb/>
effort was spared by her to better the condition <lb/>
of lunatics, and to mitigate the evils to which <lb/>
they had long been subjected. She was <reg orig="con-|sulted">consulted</reg> <lb/>
on this matter by the Governments of <lb/>
France, Germany, Denmark, Russia, Switzerland, <lb/>
etc. In Russia, her example stirred up the <lb/>
Emperor and Empress, the Princess Sophia <reg orig="Mest-|chersky">Mestchersky</reg>, <lb/>
Prince Galitzin, and others of high rank, <lb/>
to befriend both criminals and lunatics, and to <lb/>
inaugurate a system of more rational treatment.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Fry's death, a letter was addressed to <lb/>
her children by Mr. Walter Venning, of St. <reg orig="Peters-|burg">Petersburg</reg>, <lb/>
acting under the orders of the Empress, <lb/>
who manifested the greatest interest in the <lb/>
benevolent enterprise. After dealing with the <lb/>
improvements effected in the condition of prisoners <lb/>
and lunatics, Mr. Venning went on to say: "Among <lb/>
the many striking features in your mother's <lb/>
<pb n="315" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0316"/>
correspondence, her love for the World of God, and <lb/>
her desire for its general circulation, were very <reg orig="ap-|parent">apparent</reg>. <lb/>
Evidently that sacred Book was the fountain <lb/>
whence she herself derived all that strength and <lb/>
grace to carry on her work of faith and labour of <lb/>
love, which her Divine Master so richly blessed. &hellip; <lb/>
In December, 1827, when accompanying the <lb/>
Emperor Nicholas through the new Litoffsky Prison, <lb/>
he was not only well pleased to find every cell fully <lb/>
supplied with the Scriptures&mdash;the rich result of his <lb/>
having confirmed the late Emperor Alexander's <lb/>
orders to give the Scriptures gratis to all the <lb/>
prisoners&mdash;but on seeing some Jews in the prison, <lb/>
he said to me: 'I hope you also furnish these <lb/>
poor people with them, that they may become <lb/>
Christians; I pity them.' I witnessed a most <lb/>
touching scene on the Emperor's entering the <lb/>
Debtor's Room; three old, venerable, grey-headed <lb/>
men fell on their knees and cried, 'Father, have <lb/>
mercy on us!' The Emperor stretched out his <lb/>
hand in the peculiar grandeur of his manner, and <lb/>
said, 'Rise; all your debts are paid; from this <lb/>
moment you are free!' without knowing the <lb/>
amount of the debts, one of which was very <reg orig="con-|siderable">considerable</reg>. <lb/>
I hope this feeble attempt to detail <lb/>
a little of your dear mother's useful work may be <lb/>
acceptable, leaving you to make what use of it <lb/>
you think proper."</p>
<p>All the time that Mrs. Fry was so abundant in <lb/>
labours, she did not neglect her duties as a wife, <lb/>
mother, neighbour, and Christian. Her position <lb/>
as the wife of a City merchant, and the mother of <lb/>
a large family&mdash;she had eleven children, ten of <lb/>
<pb n="316" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0317"/>
whom survived&mdash;brought with it many <reg orig="respon-|sibilities">responsibilities</reg>. <lb/>
Yet she was frequently exercised in <lb/>
spirit, and careful to do the right towards her <lb/>
family, and also as a ministering Friend, while not <lb/>
able to escape the sacred burden of the <reg orig="philan-|thropist">philanthropist</reg>, <lb/>
which she felt to be laid upon her. An <lb/>
entry in her journal headed, "Questions for Myself," <lb/>
shows her daily anxiety to help her children, <lb/>
servants, and others to lead the Christian life. <lb/>
When her child Elizabeth, aged five years, was <lb/>
stricken for death, she "begged earnestly of the <lb/>
Great Disposer of life and death that He would <lb/>
spare the child if consonant with His holy will; <lb/>
but when the end came, and the child had passed <lb/>
'through the pearly gates into the city,' she uttered <lb/>
an audible thanksgiving that she was at last where <lb/>
neither sin, sorrow, nor death could have any <lb/>
dominion." Later on she wrote: "Abundant <reg orig="com-|forts">comforts</reg> <lb/>
are left me if it please my kind and Heavenly <lb/>
Father to provide me power to enjoy them, and <lb/>
continually in heart I return Him thanks for His <lb/>
unutterable lovingkindness to my tenderly beloved <lb/>
little one, who had so sweet and easy a life, and <lb/>
so tranquil a death." Her other children she <lb/>
taught to be useful in their day and generation, <lb/>
and she earnestly enjoined upon them the daily <lb/>
reading of the Holy Scriptures, with appropriate <lb/>
meditation and prayer. Her written rules for <lb/>
those children leaving home for school are <reg orig="per-|meated">permeated</reg> <lb/>
by a lofty spirit of honour and duty. In <lb/>
1828, one of the houses of business with which <lb/>
Mr. Fry was connected failed, and he and his <lb/>
family sank from affluence to comparative poverty. <lb/>
<pb n="317" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0318"/>
The daughters state that this failure "involved <lb/>
Mrs. Fry and her family in a train of sorrows and <lb/>
perplexities which tinged the remaining years of <lb/>
her life." The first effect of the disaster was, <lb/>
for Mrs. Fry, felt in hours of keen humiliation and <lb/>
sorrow; then there was the pain of leaving Plashet <lb/>
House for St. Mildred's Court, and afterwards for <lb/>
her eldest son's home, and fresh grief at parting <lb/>
with servants, schools, and the poor of Plashet, <lb/>
whom she had so long befriended. But the family <lb/>
found some consolation in the loving sympathy of <lb/>
friends in all ranks of society. Upon pecuniary <lb/>
troubles came illness in the family, until the home <lb/>
seemed to have become a hospital on a small scale. <lb/>
In the course of a touching letter written by <lb/>
William Wilberforce to Mrs. Fry at this time of <lb/>
trial, he said: "You have been enabled to exhibit <lb/>
a bright specimen of Christian excellence in <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> <lb/>
the will of God, and, I doubt not, you will manifest <lb/>
a similar specimen in the harder and more difficult <lb/>
exercise of suffering it. May every loss of this <lb/>
world's wealth be more than compensated by a <lb/>
larger measure of the unsearchable riches of Christ." <lb/>
It was mainly owing to Mr. Wilberforce that she <lb/>
resumed her prison labours, for he pointed out that <lb/>
it was her absolute duty to continue work which <lb/>
had been so abundantly blessed of God. Mrs. <lb/>
Opie also wrote to Mrs. Fry: "Adversity is indeed <lb/>
the time to try the hearts of our friends; and it <lb/>
must be now, or will be in future, a cordial to thee <lb/>
to remember that thou hast proved how truly and <lb/>
generally thou art beloved and reverenced." In <lb/>
June, 1829, the Frys removed to a small villa in <lb/>
<pb n="318" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0319"/>
Upton Lane, in which, as we shall find, a king did <lb/>
not disdain to visit the philanthropist.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Fry by no means confined her labours <lb/>
to prison reform. It should, however, be stated <lb/>
that, in addition to her Ladies' Society, she founded <lb/>
a somewhat similar one for "The Improvement <lb/>
of Prison Discipline and Reformation of Juvenile <lb/>
Offenders." This organization sought by <reg orig="corre-|spondence">correspondence</reg> <lb/>
and deputations to awaken the minds <lb/>
of provincial magistrates and prison officials to the <lb/>
necessity for new arrangements, rules, and <reg orig="accom-|modation">accommodation</reg> <lb/>
for prisoners; while it also afforded <lb/>
watchful oversight and assistance to the numerous <lb/>
class of juvenile offenders who, after conviction, <lb/>
were absolutely thrown friendless upon the country, <lb/>
to continue and develop a course of crime. Then <lb/>
there was a society possessing still broader aims, <lb/>
and working in a wider field, called the "British <lb/>
Ladies' Society for Promoting the Reformation of <lb/>
Female Prisoners." It was really an outgrowth of <lb/>
Mrs. Fry's efforts to reclaim the women whom she <lb/>
taught while in prison, and it existed as a central <lb/>
point for communication and assistance between <lb/>
the various associations in Great Britain engaged <lb/>
in visiting prisons. There was also a Convict-Ship <lb/>
Committee, which looked after the welfare of those <lb/>
who were transported, saw to the arrangements on <lb/>
board ship, the appointment of matrons, furnished <lb/>
employment, and secured shelters in the colonies. <lb/>
A remark by Mrs. Fry on the temptations of <reg orig="dis-|charged">discharged</reg> <lb/>
female prisoners led a charitable Christian <lb/>
lady named Miss Neave to open the Tothill Fields <lb/>
Asylum, which was afterwards enlarged under the <lb/>
<pb n="319" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0320"/>
name of the Royal Manor Hall Asylum. A school <lb/>
for discipline for discharged girl prisoners was <lb/>
opened at Chelsea.</p>
<p>While staying at Brighton on one occasion, Mrs. <lb/>
Fry was surprised to find it greatly infested by <lb/>
beggars. She consequently instituted a District <lb/>
Visiting Society, designed to relieve real distress, <lb/>
to prevent mendicity and imposture, and to <reg orig="en-|courage">encourage</reg> <lb/>
industry. Again, observing how the <lb/>
members of the coastguard or preventive service <lb/>
were exposed to dreary idleness, she got them a <lb/>
supply of Bibles and useful books, and by-and-by <lb/>
libraries were supplied to the preventive stations. <lb/>
This was a formidable undertaking, for there were <lb/>
about five hundred stations, including within their <lb/>
boundaries some twenty-one thousand men, women, <lb/>
and children. However, the work was <reg orig="accom-|plished">accomplished</reg>, <lb/>
partly with Government aid, and the total <lb/>
number of volumes, pamphlets, and numbers <reg orig="pre-|sented">presented</reg> <lb/>
to the stations amounted to 57,821. During <lb/>
the summer of 1835 Mrs. Fry visited all the <reg orig="coast-|guard">coastguard</reg> <lb/>
stations along the south coast of England. <lb/>
She also visited the Haslar Hospital at Portsmouth <lb/>
and the Female Penitentiary at Portsea. Her old <lb/>
influence again brought the refractory to tears. <lb/>
At Falmouth she supplied some of the men-of-war <lb/>
with libraries. We next find her providing welcome <lb/>
literature for the shepherds on Salisbury Plain. <lb/>
Returning to London, she formed a Servants' <lb/>
Society for the succour and help of domestic <reg orig="ser-|vants">servants</reg> <lb/>
who needed temporary refuge and assistance. <lb/>
The miseries of homeless wanderers in London <lb/>
during the rigorous winter&mdash;as illustrated by the <lb/>
<pb n="320" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0321"/>
case of a poor boy who was found frozen to death <lb/>
on a doorstep&mdash;led her to establish a nightly shelter <lb/>
for the homeless. Soup and bread, as well as a <lb/>
bed, were given to those who applied. The scheme <lb/>
prospered under a committee of ladies, of whom <lb/>
she was the head. They did not limit their efforts <lb/>
merely to providing a night's lodging, but tried to <lb/>
find occupation for the unemployed.</p>
<p>One of the most valuable institutions which <lb/>
Mrs. Fry founded was the order of Nursing Sisters. <lb/>
It arose out of a visit to Germany. She had passed <lb/>
a most interesting time at Kaiserswerth, Pastor <lb/>
Fliedner owning that her example had moved him <lb/>
greatly. In her turn, she had been impressed by what <lb/>
she saw at Kaiserswerth, and with the importance <lb/>
of having trained nurses to attend the sick. She <lb/>
therefore established the order in question, whose <lb/>
aid was sought and valued by all classes. Under <lb/>
the supervision of Mrs. Samuel Gurney, Mrs. Fry's <lb/>
sister-in-law, and the patronage of the Queen <lb/>
Dowager, Lady Inglis, and other influential persons, <lb/>
a number of young women were selected, trained, <lb/>
and taught to fulfil the duties of nurses. Christian <lb/>
women of all denominations were encouraged to <lb/>
join the institution, while the services of the Sisters <lb/>
were equally available in the palace and in the <lb/>
cottage.</p>
<p>In her prison enterprises, Mrs. Fry had the <reg orig="sym-|pathy">sympathy</reg> <lb/>
of kings, queens, statesmen, philanthropists, <lb/>
authors, and divines. Hannah More, in presenting <lb/>
her with a copy of her "Practical Piety," wrote <lb/>
this inscription on the fly-leaf: "To Mrs. Fry. <reg orig="Pre-|sented">Presented</reg> <lb/>
by Hannah More, as a token of veneration <lb/>
<pb n="321" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0322"/>
of her heroic zeal, Christian charity, and <reg orig="per-|severing">persevering</reg> <lb/>
kindness to the most forlorn of human <lb/>
beings. They were naked, and she clothed them; <lb/>
in prison, and she visited them; ignorant, and she <lb/>
taught them&mdash;for <hi rend="italic">His</hi> sake, in <hi rend="italic">His</hi> name, and by <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">His</hi> word, who went about doing good." Maria <lb/>
Edgeworth, during one of her visits to London, <lb/>
went to Newgate, and was herself witness to the <lb/>
wonderful influence exercised by Mrs. Fry over the <lb/>
female convicts. Germany, Denmark, and other <lb/>
countries now adopted her prison reforms, and news <lb/>
of a better state of things with regard to English <lb/>
criminals arrived from New South Wales. At <lb/>
Hobart Town the good work was still necessary, <lb/>
and Lady Franklin and others put themselves into <lb/>
communication with Mrs. Fry, in 1843, in order to <lb/>
effect it. An official report issued concerning the <lb/>
Grange Gorman Lane Female Prison, Dublin, <lb/>
showed that the adoption of Mrs. Fry's system in <lb/>
that prison had answered admirably. Prisoners in <lb/>
Newgate and convicts in New South Wales <reg orig="per-|sonally">personally</reg> <lb/>
wrote to Mrs. Fry, warmly thanking her <lb/>
for her efforts on their behalf.</p>
<p>Among the Royal personages with whom Mrs. <lb/>
Fry formed a lifelong friendship was the Princess <lb/>
Royal of Denmark, who visited her first at Plashet <lb/>
in 1822, and entered deeply into her work. In <lb/>
1831 the philanthropist had her first interview with <lb/>
our gracious Queen, then the young Princess <lb/>
Victoria. Mrs. Fry thus unaffectedly describes <lb/>
the meeting: "About three weeks ago I paid a <lb/>
very satisfactory visit to the Duchess of Kent, and <lb/>
her very pleasing daughter, the Princess Victoria. <lb/>
<pb n="322" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0323"/>
William Allen went with me. We took some <lb/>
books on the subject of slavery, with the hope of <lb/>
influencing the young Princess in that important <lb/>
cause. We were received with much kindness and <lb/>
cordiality, and I felt my way open to express, not <lb/>
only my desire that the best blessing may rest <lb/>
upon them, but that the young Princess might <lb/>
follow the example of our blessed Lord; that as <lb/>
she grew in stature she might also grow in favour <lb/>
with God and man. I also ventured to remind <lb/>
her of King Josiah, who began to reign at eight <lb/>
years old, and did that which was right in the <lb/>
sight of the Lord, turning neither to the right <lb/>
hand nor to the left, which seemed to be well <lb/>
received. Since that, I thought it right to send <lb/>
the Duke of Gloucester my brother Joseph's work <lb/>
on the Sabbath, with a rather serious letter, and <lb/>
had a very valuable answer from him, full of <lb/>
feeling. I have an invitation to visit the Duchess <lb/>
of Gloucester the next Fourth Day. May good <lb/>
result to them and no harm to myself; but I feel <lb/>
those openings a rather weighty responsibility, and <lb/>
desire to be faithful and not forward. I had long <lb/>
felt an inclination to see the young Princess, and <lb/>
endeavour to throw a little weight into the right <lb/>
scale, seeing the very important place she is likely <lb/>
to fill. I was much pleased with her, and think her <lb/>
a sweet, lovely, and hopeful child."</p>
<p>Early in 1840 the Queen sent Mrs. Fry &pound;50 for <lb/>
Miss Neave's Refuge at Chelsea; and on the 1st <lb/>
of February, a few days before her marriage to <lb/>
Prince Albert, her Majesty received Mrs. Fry at <lb/>
Buckingham Palace. During the interview, the <lb/>
<pb n="323" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0324"/>
philanthropist expressed her heartfelt satisfaction <lb/>
that the Queen encouraged various works of charity. <lb/>
The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester were always <lb/>
warm friends of Mrs. Fry, and after the Duke's <lb/>
death the latter wrote a letter of sympathy to the <lb/>
Princess Sophia of Gloucester.</p>
<p>In January, 1842, Mrs. Fry was invited by the <lb/>
Lady Mayoress to attend a banquet given at the <lb/>
Mansion House to meet Prince Albert, Sir Robert <lb/>
Peel, and the different Ministers of State. Banquets <lb/>
were little to her taste, but she saw here the means <lb/>
of doing much good, and after grave consideration <lb/>
she accepted the invitation. What took place at <lb/>
the banquet is thus recorded in her diary: "I had <lb/>
an important conversation, on a female prison being <lb/>
built, with Sir James Graham, our present Secretary <lb/>
of State, upon the Patronage Society, etc. I think <lb/>
it was a very important beginning with him for our <lb/>
British Society. With Lord Aberdeen, Foreign <lb/>
Secretary, I spoke on some matters connected with <lb/>
the present state of the Continent. With Lord <lb/>
Stanley, our Colonial Secretary, upon the state of <lb/>
our penal colonies, and the condition of the women <lb/>
in them, hoping to open the door for further <reg orig="com-|munication">communication</reg> <lb/>
with him on these subjects. Nearly <lb/>
the whole dinner was occupied in deeply interesting <lb/>
conversation with Prince Albert and Sir Robert <lb/>
Peel. With the Prince I spoke very seriously <lb/>
upon the Christian education of their children, the <lb/>
management of the nursery, the infinite importance <lb/>
of a holy and religious life; how I had seen it in <lb/>
all ranks of life; no real peace or prosperity without <lb/>
it. Then the state of Europe, the advancement of <lb/>
<pb n="324" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0325"/>
religion in the Continental Courts. Then prisons, <lb/>
their present state in this country&mdash;my fear that <lb/>
our punishments were becoming too severe&mdash;my <lb/>
wish that the Queen should be informed of some <lb/>
particulars respecting separate confinement, etc. <lb/>
We also had much entertaining conversation about <lb/>
my journeys, the state of Europe, habits of countries, <lb/>
mode of living, etc. With Sir Robert Peel, I dwelt <lb/>
much more on the prison subject; I expressed my <lb/>
fears that gaolers had too much power, that <reg orig="punish-|ment">punishment</reg> <lb/>
was rendered uncertain, and often too severe; <lb/>
pressed upon him the need of mercy, and begged <lb/>
him to see the new prison, and to have the dark <lb/>
cells a little altered."</p>
<p>Writing to her sister, Lady Buxton, Mrs. Fry <lb/>
said: "With respect to my Mansion House visit, <lb/>
it appeared laid upon me to go, therefore I <lb/>
went; also at the most earnest wish of the Lord <lb/>
Mayor and Lady Mayoress. I was wonderfully <lb/>
strengthened, bodily and mentally, and believe I <lb/>
was in my right place there, though an odd one for <lb/>
me. I sat between Prince Albert and Sir Robert <lb/>
Peel at dinner, and a most interesting time we <lb/>
had; our conversation on very numerous important <lb/>
subjects. The Prince, Ministers, Bishops, Citizens, <lb/>
Churchmen, Quakers, etc., etc., all surrounding one <lb/>
table, and such a feeling of harmony over us all. <lb/>
It was a very remarkable occasion; I hardly ever <lb/>
had such kindness and respect shown me; it was <lb/>
really humbling and affecting to me, and yet sweet, <lb/>
to see such various persons, whom I had worked with <lb/>
for years past, showing such genuine kindness and <lb/>
esteem, so far beyond my most unworthy deserts."</p>
<pb n="325" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0326"/>
<p>The King of Prussia arrived in England towards <lb/>
the close of January, 1842, in order to stand <lb/>
sponsor to the infant Prince of Wales. The King <lb/>
had previously shown much kindness to Mrs. Fry, <lb/>
and he now desired her to meet him at luncheon <lb/>
at the Mansion House, on the 30th, which she <lb/>
accordingly did. Next day the King met Mrs. <lb/>
Fry at Newgate, and afterwards took luncheon <lb/>
with her at Upton Lane. The remarkable <lb/>
scene in Newgate Mrs. Fry thus detailed in her <lb/>
journal:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Yesterday was a day never to be forgotten whilst <lb/>
memory lasts. We set off about eleven o'clock, <lb/>
my sister Gurney and myself, to meet the King of <lb/>
Prussia at Newgate. I proceeded with the Lady <lb/>
Mayoress to Newgate, where we were met by <lb/>
many gentlemen. My dear brother and sister <lb/>
Gurney, and Susannah Corder being with me, was <lb/>
a great comfort. We waited so long for the <lb/>
King that I feared he would not come; however, <lb/>
at last he arrived, and the Lady Mayoress and I, <lb/>
accompanied by the Sheriffs, went to meet the <lb/>
King at the door of the prison. He appeared <lb/>
much pleased to meet our little party; and after <lb/>
taking a little refreshment, he gave me his arm, <lb/>
and we proceeded into the prison and up to one of <lb/>
the long wards, where everything was prepared; <lb/>
the poor women round the table, about sixty of <lb/>
them, many of our ladies' committee, and some <lb/>
others; also a number of gentlemen following the <lb/>
King, Sheriffs, etc. I felt deeply, but quiet in <lb/>
spirit&mdash;fear of man was removed. After we were <lb/>
seated, the King on my right hand, the Lady <lb/>
<pb n="326" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0327"/>
Mayoress on my left, I expressed my desire that <lb/>
the attention of none, particularly the poor <lb/>
prisoners, might be diverted from attending to our <lb/>
reading by the company there, however <reg orig="interest-|ing">interesting</reg>, <lb/>
but that we should remember that the King of <lb/>
kings and Lord of lords was present, in whose <lb/>
fear we should abide, and seek to profit by what <lb/>
we heard. I then read the twelfth chapter of <lb/>
Romans. I dwelt on the mercies of God being the <lb/>
strong inducement to serve Him, and no longer to <lb/>
be conformed to this world. Then I finished the <lb/>
chapter, afterwards impressing our all being <lb/>
members of one body, poor and rich, high and low, <lb/>
all one in Christ, and members one of another. I then <lb/>
related the case of a poor prisoner, who appeared <lb/>
truly converted, and who became such a holy <reg orig="ex-|ample">example</reg>; <lb/>
then I enlarged on love, and forgiving one <lb/>
another, showing how Christians must love their <lb/>
enemies, etc., etc. After a solemn pause, and feeling <lb/>
my deep humiliation before the cross, I believed it <lb/>
my duty to kneel down before this most curious, <reg orig="in-|teresting">interesting</reg> <lb/>
and mixed company, for I felt my God <lb/>
must be served the same everywhere, and amongst <lb/>
all people, whatever reproach it brought me into. I <lb/>
first prayed for the conversion of prisoners and <lb/>
sinners generally, that a blessing might rest on the <lb/>
labours of those in authority, as well as the more <lb/>
humble labourers for their conversion; next I <lb/>
prayed for the King of Prussia, his Queen, his <lb/>
kingdom, that it might be more and more as a <lb/>
city set on a hill that could not be hid, that true <lb/>
religion in its purity, simplicity, and power might <lb/>
more and more break forth, and that every cloud <lb/>
<pb n="327" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0328"/>
that obscured it might be removed; then for us all <lb/>
that we might be of the number of the redeemed, <lb/>
and eventually unite with them in Heaven, in a <lb/>
never-ending song of praise. All this prayer was <lb/>
truly offered in the name and for the sake of the <lb/>
dear Saviour, that it might be heard and answered. <lb/>
I only mention the subject, but by no means the <lb/>
words. The King then again gave me his arm, and <lb/>
we walked down together; there were difficulties <lb/>
raised about his going to Upton, but he chose to <lb/>
persevere. I went with the Lady Mayoress and <lb/>
the Sheriffs, and the King with his own people. <lb/>
We arrived first; I had to hasten to take off my <lb/>
cloak, and then went down to meet him at his <lb/>
carriage-door with my husband, and seven of our <lb/>
sons and sons-in-law. I then walked with him <lb/>
into the drawing-room, where all was in beautiful <lb/>
order, neat, and adorned with flowers. I presented <lb/>
to the King our eight daughters and daughters-<reg orig="in-|law">in-law</reg> <lb/>
&lpar;R. E. C. only away&rpar;, our seven sons and eldest <lb/>
grandson, my brother and sister Buxton, Sir Henry <lb/>
and Lady Pelly, and my sister-in-law, Elizabeth <lb/>
Fry&mdash;my brother and sister Gurney he had known <lb/>
before, and afterwards presented twenty-five of our <lb/>
grandchildren. We had a solemn silence before <lb/>
our meal, which was handsome and fit for a king, <lb/>
yet not extravagant&mdash;everything most complete <lb/>
and nice. I sat by the King, who appeared to <lb/>
enjoy his dinner, perfectly at his ease, and very <lb/>
happy with us. We went into the <reg orig="drawing-|room">drawing-room</reg>, <lb/>
after another solemn silence, and a few words <lb/>
which I uttered in prayer for the King and Queen. <lb/>
We found a deputation of Friends with an address <lb/>
<pb n="328" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0329"/>
to read to him&mdash;this was done; the King appeared <lb/>
to feel it much. We then had to part.</p>
<p>"The King expressed his desire that blessings <lb/>
might continue to rest on our house."</p>
<p>But while Mrs. Fry thus stood before kings and <lb/>
rulers, and entertained a powerful monarch at <lb/>
dinner in her own home, these things bred in her <lb/>
no arrogance. On the contrary, it is delightful to <lb/>
find her about the same time drinking tea with <lb/>
a poor shoemaker who had been able to procure <lb/>
but one luxury for her entertainment&mdash;a little <lb/>
fresh butter.</p>
<p>The motive force in Mrs. Fry's honourable and <lb/>
noble career she described in these words, uttered <lb/>
not long before her death: "Since my heart was <lb/>
touched at seventeen years old, I believe I have <lb/>
never awakened from sleep, in sickness or in health, <lb/>
by day or by night, without my first waking <lb/>
thought being, 'how best I might serve my Lord.'" <lb/>
But long years of strenuous service naturally told <lb/>
upon her constitution. The last three years of life <lb/>
in particular were years of infirm health, but they <lb/>
were sweetened by the honours which came upon <lb/>
her through her good works, and she was especially <lb/>
cheered by seeing her relatives and friends treading <lb/>
in her footsteps of usefulness. In the autumn of <lb/>
1842 she seemed to recover strength a little, but <lb/>
domestic trials soon fell rapidly upon her. Four <lb/>
or five grandchildren followed each other to the <lb/>
grave, and then her beloved sister-in-law, Elizabeth, <lb/>
between whom and herself were close womanly and <lb/>
Christian bonds. In the summer of 1844 Mrs. <lb/>
Fry was able to make on appearance at the dear <lb/>
<pb n="329" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0330"/>
familiar Meeting-house at Plaistow, where she <lb/>
spoke with much fervour and tenderness on the <lb/>
death of the righteous.</p>
<p>She next went to Walmer to get the benefit of <lb/>
the sea-air, and the afflicting news reached her there <lb/>
that two of her son William's daughters had been <lb/>
carried off by scarlet fever. This double <reg orig="bereave-|ment">bereavement</reg> <lb/>
affected her keenly, and it was soon followed <lb/>
by the death of a beloved niece, as well as of her <lb/>
friend, coadjutor, and brother-in-law, Sir Thomas <lb/>
Fowell Buxton. Her sorrows seemed to tread <lb/>
upon each other like the patriarch Job's. Her last <lb/>
written communication was one of encouragement <lb/>
to the committee of the British Ladies' Society. <lb/>
The early months of 1845 were spent in valedictory <lb/>
visits to Earlham Hall, North Repps, and Runcton. <lb/>
Returning to Upton Lane, she was able to receive <lb/>
visits of sympathy and regard from the Duchess of <lb/>
Sutherland and her daughters, the Chevalier de <lb/>
Bunsen, and a few others. In May she was able <lb/>
to be present at two of the yearly meetings for <lb/>
Friends in London, and in June she attended the <lb/>
annual meeting of the British Ladies' Society, <lb/>
which was held at Plaistow instead of Westminster, <lb/>
in deference to her infirm health and visibly <reg orig="de-|clining">declining</reg> <lb/>
strength.</p>
<p>She was taken to Ramsgate in July, and though <lb/>
very feeble, her interest in the Friends, in the <lb/>
coast-guardsmen, etc., was unabated. Her last <lb/>
characteristic act was to obtain a grant of Bibles <lb/>
and Testaments from the Bible Society, which she <lb/>
distributed among the sailors in the harbour, with <lb/>
the help of her grandchildren. The end came <lb/>
<pb n="330" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0331"/>
rather suddenly at the last, and after a few hours <lb/>
of spasmodic suffering, Elizabeth Fry passed away <lb/>
on October 13, 1845, in her sixty-sixth year. She <lb/>
was buried in the Friends' burial-ground at Barking, <lb/>
close to the little daughter whom she had lost many <lb/>
years before. No better epitaph could be desired <lb/>
for her than that she set in motion springs of <lb/>
benevolent and Christian action, which have <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
to gather strength ever since her death. Men <lb/>
now look hopefully forward to the time when the <lb/>
vice and the crime which she so zealously combated <lb/>
will cease to inflict their innumerable evils upon <lb/>
the human race.</p>

FELICIA DOROTHEA HEMANS.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">This</hi> sweet lyric-singer, who was as admirable for <lb/>
her graces of mind and heart as she was beautiful <lb/>
in person, was born in Liverpool, on September 25, <lb/>
1793. Her father, George Browne, was a merchant <lb/>
of Irish extraction; and her mother, whose family <lb/>
name was Wagner, was of mingled Italian and <lb/>
German descent, and was the daughter of the <lb/>
Imperial and Tuscan Consul at Liverpool. Felicia <lb/>
Browne was the fifth of seven children, and almost <lb/>
from her cradle she was distinguished for her <lb/>
extreme beauty and precocious talents. <reg orig="Com-|mercial">Commercial</reg> <lb/>
reverses, which were only too common <lb/>
during the French revolutionary period, compelled <lb/>
Mr. Browne to break up his establishment in <lb/>
Liverpool, and to remove with his family into <lb/>
Wales. For nine years they resided at Gwyrch, <lb/>
near Abergele, in Denbighshire, a large old mansion <lb/>
close to the sea, and shut in by a picturesque range <lb/>
of mountains. The original house has long since <lb/>
given place to a fine baronial structure now known <lb/>
as Gwyrch Castle.</p>
<p>Endowed with a peculiarly sensitive and <reg orig="im-|pressionable">impressionable</reg> <lb/>
nature, there is little wonder that the <lb/>
<pb n="334" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0335"/>
youthful Felicia revelled in the delights of this <lb/>
romantic region, and in later years her thoughts <lb/>
frequently reverted to the happy home of her <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg>. <lb/>
Here she imbibed an intense love of Nature, <lb/>
and a strong attachment to the Welsh people, with <lb/>
their interesting and manifold traditions. She was <lb/>
educated under the eye of her mother&mdash;a woman <lb/>
of varied acquirements, whose life was regulated by <lb/>
Christian piety and charity. Felicia manifested <reg orig="extra-|ordinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
quickness in the acquisition of knowledge. <lb/>
With one reading she could recite lengthy passages <lb/>
from her favourite authors, and at the age of six she <lb/>
was familiar with the finest scenes in Shakespeare. <lb/>
When only eleven, she wrote a poetical eulogy of <lb/>
the Bard of Avon, which was singularly happy and <lb/>
matured in expression. During her girlhood she <lb/>
spent two winters in London, but after that she <lb/>
never again visited the metropolis, her heart being <lb/>
bound up in her mountain home Books of <lb/>
chronicle and romance she eagerly devoured, and <lb/>
she gained a useful knowledge of the German, <lb/>
Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese languages. She <lb/>
was also passionately attached to musical studies. <lb/>
Her first volume of poems was published in 1808, <lb/>
when she was but fifteen years of age. Two of <lb/>
her brothers were engaged in the Peninsular War, <lb/>
one of them serving under Sir John Moore; and, <lb/>
inspired by the campaign, she wrote a poem <reg orig="en-|titled">entitled</reg>, <lb/>
"England and Spain," which was published <lb/>
and afterwards translated into Spanish. She was <lb/>
only fourteen when she composed this poem, which <lb/>
displayed lofty sentiments, correctness of language, <lb/>
and historical knowledge.</p>
<pb n="335" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0336"/>
<p>At fifteen, Felicia Browne was thrown into the <lb/>
society of Captain Hemans, of the 4th King's Own <lb/>
Regiment, and he seems to have so impressed her <lb/>
youthful heart that she invested him with all the <lb/>
attributes of the heroes of her dreams. She did <lb/>
not see him again for three years, but the early <lb/>
impressions did not fade as she became a woman. <lb/>
In 1809 the family removed from Gwyrch to <reg orig="Bron-|wylfa">Bronwylfa</reg>, <lb/>
near St. Asaph. Visits to the noble ruins <lb/>
of Conway Castle and the old fortress of Dyganwy. <lb/>
stirred her poetic fervour for the past, and led to <lb/>
the production of many melodious strains. To all <lb/>
lovers of song and tradition these ancient castles are <lb/>
endeared, as having echoed the complaints of the <lb/>
captive Elphin, and resounded to the harp of Taliesin. <lb/>
In 1812 appeared Miss Browne's volume entitled, <lb/>
"The Domestic Affections and other Poems," and <lb/>
in the same year she was married to Captain <lb/>
Hemans. They took up their residence at Daventry, <lb/>
as the captain had been appointed Adjutant to the <lb/>
Northamptonshire Local Militia. The scenery in <lb/>
the district was so tame that Mrs. Hemans felt a <lb/>
longing almost amounting to home-sickness for the <lb/>
old Welsh mountains. She found happiness, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
in her firstborn son, Arthur, the child of many <lb/>
hopes, who was destined also to be the first to <lb/>
rejoin her in the spirit-world. In a short time <lb/>
Captain Hemans and his family left Daventry, and <lb/>
returned to Wales, taking up their abode with the <lb/>
now widowed mother of the poetess at Bronwylfa. <lb/>
From this period Mrs. Hemans remained with her <lb/>
beloved parent until the death of the latter. Four <lb/>
more children were born to Mrs. Hemans, all sons. <lb/>
<pb n="336" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0337"/>
and her time was now divided between her studies <lb/>
and the care of her family.</p>
<p>In 1818 Mrs. Hemans published a volume of <reg orig="trans-|lations">translations</reg>, <lb/>
and her close study of the ancient glories of <lb/>
Greece and Rome led to the production of such <lb/>
poems as "The Restoration of the Works of Art to <lb/>
Italy," "Modern Greece"&mdash;which she contrasted with <lb/>
the ancient&mdash;and several of the poems which formed <lb/>
the volume entitled, "Tales and Historic Scenes." <lb/>
In course of time, she turned from these cold and <lb/>
stately themes to those more homely subjects in <lb/>
which she achieved her most lasting success. But <lb/>
through all her work there shone an instinctive <lb/>
sense of the picturesque and a profound <reg orig="apprecia-|tion">appreciation</reg> <lb/>
of the beautiful. Captain Hemans, whose <lb/>
health had been impaired by the vicissitudes of a <lb/>
military life, went to the South of Europe in 1818, <lb/>
and settled in Rome. While Mrs. Hemans felt <lb/>
that the education of her children and her literary <lb/>
pursuits would in any case have kept her in <lb/>
England, there was also an incompatibility of <reg orig="feel-|ing">feeling</reg> <lb/>
and aspiration between husband and wife. They <lb/>
did not at the time, however, contemplate a <reg orig="per-|manent">permanent</reg> <lb/>
separation, but fate decreed that they should <lb/>
never meet again. During the period of her virtual <lb/>
widowhood, Mrs. Hemans found wise counsellors <lb/>
and friends in the Bishop of St. Asaph and Dr. <lb/>
Luxmore. She found, also, further consolation in <lb/>
the extended influence and growing popularity of <lb/>
her writings. Her sons welcomed in the bishop an <lb/>
affectionate and fatherly adviser, who entered <lb/>
thoroughly into their studies and sports. They <lb/>
practically made his lordship's palace their own <lb/>
<pb n="337" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0338"/>
indeed, Mrs. Hemans wrote on one occasion from <lb/>
Scotland: "I have been much at Abbotsford, <lb/>
where my boys run in and out as if they were <lb/>
children of the soil, or as if it were 'The Palace.'"</p>
<p>A poem called "The Sceptic," written by Mrs. <lb/>
Hemans, in 1820, seems to have been instrumental <lb/>
in establishing the faith of many individuals, and <lb/>
especially of one lady who was near death at the <lb/>
time of its publication. The poem showed with <lb/>
much force and literary skill the utter inadequacy <lb/>
of sceptical principles to support the soul in <lb/>
seasons of deep trial or in the presence of death. <lb/>
One critic, comparing the writer with other <reg orig="con-|temporary">contemporary</reg> <lb/>
poets, remarked: "With the promise <lb/>
of talents not inferior to any, and far superior to <lb/>
most of them, the author before us is not only free <lb/>
from every stain, but breathes all moral beauty <lb/>
and loveliness; and it will be a memorable <reg orig="co-|incidence">coincidence</reg> <lb/>
if the era of a woman's sway in literature <lb/>
shall become coeval with the return of its moral <lb/>
purity and elevation."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hemans's next literary effort was of a <lb/>
different character. A patriotic Scotsman having <lb/>
notified his intention of contributing &pound;1000 towards <lb/>
a monument to Sir William Wallace, a prize of <lb/>
&pound;50 was offered for the best poem on the subject. <lb/>
The number of competitors was almost <reg orig="overwhelm-|ing">overwhelming</reg>, <lb/>
and the Herculean labours of the adjudicators <lb/>
were aggravated by the portentous length of some <lb/>
of the contributions, one of them rivalling "Paradise <lb/>
Lost" in this respect, though in no other. The <lb/>
prize was unanimously awarded to Mrs. Hemans, <lb/>
for her poem on "The Meeting of Wallace and <lb/>
<pb n="338" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0339"/>
Bruce on the Banks of the Carron." That a <lb/>
Scottish prize, for a poem on a subject purely, <lb/>
proudly Scottish, was adjudged to an English <lb/>
candidate, was a proof at once of the perfect <reg orig="fair-|ness">fairness</reg> <lb/>
of the award, and of the merit of the poem. <lb/>
The last few spirited lines of Mrs. Hemans's poem <lb/>
may be quoted here:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Land of bright deeds and minstrel lore!</l>
<l>Withhold thy guerdon now no more.</l>
<l>On some bold height of awful form,</l>
<l>Stern eyrie of the cloud and storm,</l>
<l>Sublimely mingling with the skies,</l>
<l>Bid the proud Cenotaph arise;</l>
<l>Not to <hi rend="italic">record</hi> the name that thrills</l>
<l>Thy soul, the watchword of thy hills</l>
<l>Not to assert, with needless claim,</l>
<l>The bright <hi rend="italic">forever</hi> of its fame;</l>
<l>But, in the ages yet untold,</l>
<l>When <hi rend="italic">ours</hi> shall be the days of old,</l>
<l>To rouse high hearts and speak thy pride</l>
<l>In him, for thee who lived and died."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>It was in the spring of 1820 that Mrs. Hemans <lb/>
first made "the acquaintance of one who became <lb/>
afterwards a zealous and valuable friend, revered <lb/>
in life, and sincerely mourned in death&mdash;Bishop <lb/>
Heber, then Rector of Hodnet, and a frequent <lb/>
visitor at Bodryddan, the residence of his <reg orig="father-|in-law">father-in-law</reg>, <lb/>
the late Dean of St. Asaph, from whom <lb/>
also, during an intercourse of many years, Mrs. <lb/>
Hemans at all times received much kindness and <lb/>
courtesy. Mr. Reginald Heber was the first <lb/>
eminent literary character with whom she had ever <lb/>
familiarly associated, and she therefore entered <lb/>
with a peculiar freshness of feeling into the delight <lb/>
inspired by his conversational powers, enhanced as <lb/>
<pb n="339" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0340"/>
they were by that gentle benignity of manner so <lb/>
often the characteristic of minds of the very highest <lb/>
order. In a letter to a friend on this occasion, <lb/>
she thus describes her enjoyment: 'I am more <lb/>
delighted with Mr. Heber than I can possibly tell <lb/>
you; his conversation is quite rich with anecdote, <lb/>
and every subject on which he speaks had been, <lb/>
you would imagine, the whole study of his life. <lb/>
In short, his society has made much the same sort <lb/>
of impression on my mind that the first perusal of <lb/>
"Ivanhoe" did; and was something so perfectly <lb/>
new to me that I can hardly talk of anything else. <lb/>
I had a very long conversation with him on the <lb/>
subject of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> poem, which he read aloud, and <lb/>
commented upon as he proceeded. His manner <lb/>
was so entirely that of a friend that I felt perfectly <lb/>
at ease, and did not hesitate to express all my own <lb/>
ideas and opinions on the subject, even where they <lb/>
did not exactly coincide with his own.'"</p>
<p>The poem here alluded to, "Superstition and <lb/>
Revelation," was intended to embrace a very <reg orig="ex-|tensive">extensive</reg> <lb/>
range of subjects, the idea being to contrast <lb/>
the spirit and tenets of Paganism in every heathen <lb/>
land with those of Christianity. Mr. Heber warmly <lb/>
approved of the plan, and gave valuable help and <lb/>
encouragement to the author, but the latter found <lb/>
that the vastness of the theme precluded its <reg orig="realiza-|tion">realization</reg>, <lb/>
and the project was abandoned. A visit <lb/>
which she now paid to the family of Mr. Henry <lb/>
Parke, Wavertree Lodge, near Liverpool, marked <lb/>
an epoch in her life. "I cannot tell you," she <lb/>
wrote to a friend, "how much I have enjoyed the <lb/>
novelty of all the objects around me. The pastoral <lb/>
<pb n="340" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0341"/>
seclusion and tranquillity of the life I have led for <lb/>
the last seven or eight years had left my mind in <lb/>
that state of blissful ignorance particularly calculated <lb/>
to render every new impression an agreeable one; <lb/>
and accordingly, gas-lights, steam-boats, Mr. Kean, <lb/>
casts from the Elgin marbles, and tropical plants <lb/>
in the Botanic Garden, have all in turn been the <lb/>
objects of my wondering admiration. I saw Kean <lb/>
in two characters, Richard the Third and Othello, <lb/>
and can truly say I felt as if I had never <reg orig="under-|stood">understood</reg> <lb/>
Shakespeare till then. I shall never forget <lb/>
the sort of electric light which seemed to flash <lb/>
across my mind from the bursts of power he <reg orig="dis-|played">displayed</reg> <lb/>
in several of my favourite passages."</p>
<p>Occasionally, Mrs. Hemans's muse indulged in a <lb/>
light satirical vein, and a <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">jeu d'esprit</hi></foreign>, which she <lb/>
called her "sheet of forgeries," on the use of the <lb/>
word "barb," deceived many experts in poetry, on <lb/>
account of its close imitation of Spenser, <reg orig="Shake-|speare">Shakespeare</reg>, <lb/>
Massinger, Percy's "Reliques," etc. Another <lb/>
clever piece of humorous verse dealt with an <lb/>
imaginary voyage to China, in company with that <lb/>
eminent old English worthy, John Evelyn. In <lb/>
June, 1821, Mrs. Hemans secured the prize offered <lb/>
by the Royal Society of Literature for the best <lb/>
poem on "Dartmoor." She next composed a <lb/>
tragedy entitled, "The Vespers of Palermo" She <lb/>
had no idea of producing it on the stage, but was <lb/>
persuaded to do so by Heber and Milman. It <lb/>
was produced at Covent Garden, with a cast <lb/>
including Young, Charles Kemble, and Yates, but <lb/>
it proved a failure, chiefly owing to the inefficiency <lb/>
of the actress who personated the heroine Constance. <lb/>
<pb n="341" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0342"/>
When it was subsequently produced in Edinburgh, <lb/>
with Mrs. Henry Siddons in this part, it was <reg orig="com-|pletely">completely</reg> <lb/>
successful.</p>
<p>In German literature, Mrs. Hemans was deeply <lb/>
versed; but although she read Goethe and Schiller, <lb/>
she found Herder more suggestive, and it was one <lb/>
of his works which inspired her with the idea of <lb/>
her own "Lays of Many Lands." She was <reg orig="pro-|foundly">profoundly</reg> <lb/>
moved by the story of the noble-hearted <lb/>
young soldier bard, K&ouml;rner; and the heroism of <lb/>
his death suggested one of her finest lyrics, "The <lb/>
Grave of K&ouml;orner." One of the most popular of her <lb/>
lyrics, however, was "The Voice of Spring." Who <lb/>
does not know that beautiful salutation beginning, <lb/>
"I come, I come! ye have called me long"? It <lb/>
is buoyant with hope, and charming in its poetic <lb/>
sweetness. Spring had a peculiar fascination for <lb/>
Mrs. Hemans. It made her even more thoughtful <lb/>
than joyous, as is shown in another of her lyrics, <lb/>
"Breathings of Spring," and it was at this season <lb/>
that she passed away. In 1823 Mrs. Hemans <lb/>
wrote one of her more ambitious works, "The <lb/>
Siege of Valencia, the Last Constantine, and other <lb/>
Poems." The volume demonstrated her command <lb/>
of striking and felicitous verse, but her genius was <lb/>
more adapted to lyrical effusions than to more <lb/>
extensive poetical flights. "De Chatillon; or, The <lb/>
Crusaders," a tragedy published posthumously, <lb/>
erred in the opposite sense from the "Vespers," being <lb/>
as bald in diction as the latter was ornate. In <lb/>
1826 was published "The Forest Sanctuary," which <lb/>
in point of finish and consecutiveness may be <reg orig="re-|garded">regarded</reg> <lb/>
as the author's most important work. It <lb/>
<pb n="342" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0343"/>
related to the sufferings of a Spanish Protestant in <lb/>
the time of Philip II., and was supposed to be <lb/>
narrated by the exile himself, who escaped to <lb/>
America.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hemans was peculiarly sensitive to the <lb/>
influences of Nature. She heard her myriad secret <lb/>
tones, and it was one of her favourite fancies that <lb/>
each tree had its peculiar language, suited to its <lb/>
character for majesty, solemnity, or grace, and that <lb/>
she could distinguish with closed eyes the measured <lb/>
tones of the oak or elm, the funeral sighs of the <lb/>
cypress, or the sensitive murmurs of the willow or <lb/>
the poplar. All legends and superstitions regarding <lb/>
trees and flowers were peculiarly dear to her. The <lb/>
howling of the wind at night had a singular effect <lb/>
upon her nerves; the sensation was not one of fear, <lb/>
but something akin to an electrical feeling, which <lb/>
was always succeeded by a reaction of fatigue and <lb/>
exhaustion. In many of her lyrics, such as "The <lb/>
Song of Night," and "The Voice of the Wind," <lb/>
will be found reminiscences of these mysterious <lb/>
and solemn influences. Again, the sight and sound <lb/>
of the sea were always connected in her mind with <lb/>
melancholy associations, and not, as in the case of <lb/>
Byron, with jubilant feelings. Storm, shipwreck, <lb/>
desolation, and death were the images which the sea <lb/>
brought to her mind. Witness the closing stanza in <lb/>
her exquisite lyric, "The Treasures of the Deep":&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"To thee the love of woman hath gone down,</l>
<l rend="indent">Dark flow thy tides o'er manhood's noble head,</l>
<l>O'er youth's bright locks and beauty's flowery crown,</l>
<l rend="indent">Yet must thou hear a voice&mdash;Restore the Dead!</l>
<l>Earth shall reclaim her precious things from thee&mdash;</l>
<l rend="indent2">Restore the Dead, thou Sea!"</l>
</lg></q></p>
<pb n="343" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0344"/>
<p>The year 1826 brought heavy sorrows with it&mdash; <lb/>
first a bereavement in the family of her eldest <lb/>
brother, and then the death of her own <reg orig="deeply-|loved">deeply-loved</reg> <lb/>
mother. Several of Mrs. Hemans's poems <lb/>
testify to the wonderful bond of affection between <lb/>
these two, and the blow to the survivor was so <lb/>
keen that for some days she remained in a kind of <lb/>
stupor. Meanwhile, the light of her genius was <lb/>
penetrating to other lands, and distinguished <lb/>
Americans sought the honour of her friendship. <lb/>
But no appreciation, however supplemented by the <lb/>
joys of life, could ever fill up the aching void left by <lb/>
her mother's death, and it remained with her more <lb/>
or less till the close of life. Her health also began <lb/>
to suffer, and she had frequent attacks of <reg orig="palpita-|tion">palpitation</reg> <lb/>
of the heart, with distressing pains in the <lb/>
chest. From a number of original fragments <lb/>
written by Mrs. Hemans, and belonging to this <lb/>
date, the following are worth reproducing:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Is not the propensity of ardent and affectionate <lb/>
natures to love and trust, though disappointed <lb/>
again and again, as a perpetual spring in the heart, <lb/>
ever throwing out fresh buds and flowers, though <lb/>
but to be nipped by the 'killing frost?' Far better <lb/>
thus, than to be bound in the lifelessness of winter."</p>
<p>"What is fame to a heart yearning for affection, <lb/>
and finding it not? Is it not as a triumphal crown <lb/>
to the brow of one parched with fever, and asking for <lb/>
a fresh, healthful draught&mdash;the 'cup of cold water.'"</p>
<p>"Is it real affliction&mdash;ill-health, <reg orig="disappointment-|or">disappointment-or</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="344" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0345"/>
the 'craving void that aches within the breast' <lb/>
for sympathies which perhaps earth does not afford <lb/>
&mdash;that weans us most from life? I think the latter. <lb/>
If we could only lie down to die as to sleep, how <lb/>
few would not willingly throw off what Wordsworth <lb/>
calls&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">'The weight</l>
<l>Of all this unintelligible world!'</l>
</lg></q>
and 'flee away, and be at rest'?"</p>
<p>"'The ancients feared death,&mdash;we, thanks to <lb/>
Christianity, fear only <hi rend="italic">dying;</hi>' so says the author <lb/>
of 'Guesses at Truth,' and surely it is even so. <lb/>
I, that have seen a spirit pass away in sleep, in <lb/>
soft and solemn repose that almost melted into <lb/>
death, should scarcely fear even the latter; and <lb/>
yet the very stillness of such a parting is almost <lb/>
too awful for human nature to sustain. It seems <lb/>
as if there should be last words of love, and tears, <lb/>
and blessings, when the strong ties that bound soul <lb/>
to soul are broken; but <hi rend="italic">to call and not to be <lb/>
answered</hi> by the voice that ever before spoke <reg orig="kind-|ness">kindness</reg> <lb/>
and comfort!&mdash;who can sound the deep gulf <lb/>
of separation that must be 'set between,' when that <lb/>
moment arrives?"</p>
<p>"Our home!&mdash;what images are brought before <lb/>
us by that one word! The meeting of cordial <lb/>
smiles, and the gathering round the evening hearth, <lb/>
and the interchange of thought in kindly words, <lb/>
and the glance of eyes to which our hearts lie open <lb/>
as the day;&mdash;there is the true 'City of Refuge;'&mdash; <lb/>
where are we to turn when it is shut from us or <lb/>
<pb n="345" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0346"/>
changed? Who ever thought his home could <lb/>
change? And yet those calm and deep and still <lb/>
delights over which the world seems to have no <lb/>
breath or power, they too are like the beautiful <lb/>
summer clouds, tranquil as if fixed to sleep for ever <lb/>
in the pure azure of the skies, yet all the while <lb/>
melting from us, though imperceptibly 'passing <lb/>
away!'"</p>
<p>By such sisters in letters as Joanna Baillie, Mary <lb/>
Russell Mitford, Mary Howitt, and Caroline Bowles, <lb/>
Mrs. Hemans was warmly admired and appreciated, <lb/>
while her feeling for them was equally strong. <lb/>
Mrs. Grant of Laggan wrote to Mrs. Hemans: <lb/>
"Shenstone complains of his hard fate, in wasting <lb/>
a lonely existence, 'not loved, not praised, not <lb/>
known.' How very different is your case! Praised <lb/>
by all that read you&mdash;loved by all that praise you&mdash; <lb/>
and known, in some degree, wherever our language <lb/>
is spoken." In the autumn of 1827, at the request <lb/>
of Alaric A. Watts, who was then forming a gallery <lb/>
of portraits of the living authors of Great Britain, <lb/>
Mrs. Hemans was prevailed upon to sit for her <lb/>
picture. When the portrait was engraved and <lb/>
published, those who expected to see in the author <lb/>
of the "Forest Sanctuary" a "potent, grave, and <lb/>
reverend personage," whom it would be necessary <lb/>
to approach with a formal and solemn air, were as <lb/>
much astonished by her frankness and vivacity as <lb/>
by her thorough freedom from pretension and <lb/>
everything approaching to the technicalities of a <lb/>
"learned lady." "All these," remarks her sister, <lb/>
she held in as much detestation as she did the <lb/>
<pb n="346" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0347"/>
fulsome compliments and conventional homage of <lb/>
those by whom every intellectual woman is <reg orig="indis-|criminately">indiscriminately</reg> <lb/>
treated as a <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">bas bleu</hi></foreign>, and saluted in <lb/>
some such strain of hyperbole as used to prevail <lb/>
in the Della Cruscan coteries of Hayley and Miss <lb/>
Seward; whilst no one could be more alive to the <lb/>
delight of being really understood and appreciated, <lb/>
or of knowing that anything she had written had <lb/>
found its way into the depths of any kind and true <lb/>
and loving heart."</p>
<p>In 1828 Mrs. Hemans published her "Records <lb/>
of Woman," a volume into which she put more of <lb/>
her heart and individual feelings than into anything <lb/>
else which she had written. For this or some other <lb/>
reason it never ceased to maintain a steady hold <lb/>
upon the reading public. About the time of its <lb/>
issue, the author paid a long-projected visit to her <lb/>
friends at Wavertree Lodge, near Liverpool. Her <lb/>
health had now become so much affected that she <lb/>
at last placed herself under medical discipline. <lb/>
She also made arrangements for engaging a <lb/>
residence in the neighbourhood, being moved thereto <lb/>
by the superior advantages offered for the <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg> <lb/>
of her boys, and by the closer literary <reg orig="com-|munion">communion</reg> <lb/>
which she hoped to enjoy with her attached <lb/>
friends in the vicinity. A house was found in the <lb/>
village of Wavertree which happily answered her <lb/>
requirements, and she soon felt at home in her <lb/>
new surroundings. Among the new friends she <lb/>
formed were the members of the Chorley family, <lb/>
one of whom, H. F. Chorley, published a volume <lb/>
of "Memorials" of her after her death. Other <lb/>
friends to whom she was attached were Mary <lb/>
<pb n="347" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0348"/>
Howitt, Maria Jane Jewsbury, and the New <lb/>
Englanders, Professor Charles Eliot Norton and <lb/>
his wife, who came over to the old country on a <lb/>
visit. In "The Three Histories," Miss Jewsbury <lb/>
depicted Mrs. Hemans under the name of Egeria. <lb/>
"Egeria was totally different from any other woman <lb/>
I had ever seen, either in Italy or England. She <lb/>
did not dazzle, she subdued me. Other women <lb/>
might be more commanding, more versatile, more <lb/>
acute; but I never saw one so exquisitely feminine. <lb/>
Her birth, her education, but, above all, the genius <lb/>
with which she was gifted, combined to inspire a <lb/>
passion for the ethereal, the tender, the imaginative, <lb/>
the heroic&mdash;in one word, the beautiful. It was in <lb/>
her a faculty divine, and yet of daily life&mdash;it <lb/>
touched all things, but, like a sunbeam, touched <lb/>
them with a golden finger."</p>
<p>When she had settled at Wavertree, we find her <lb/>
taking delight in such literary treasures as Bulwer's <lb/>
"Rienzi," the "Noctes Ambrosian&aelig;," Herder's <lb/>
beautiful ballads of "The Cid," Tieck's "Sternbald," <lb/>
Goethe's "Iphigenia," Carlyle's essay on "Burns" <lb/>
&mdash;which went deeper into the heart of the mystery <lb/>
than any other; Grillparzer's "Sappho," Sismondi's <lb/>
"Literature," Oehlenschl&auml;ger's "Dramas," etc., etc. <lb/>
She now began to appreciate Wordsworth more, <lb/>
though he never appealed to her so closely as <lb/>
Goethe, Byron, and Shelley did. Good music <lb/>
always enthralled her, and of the spiritual music <lb/>
of Pergolesi she wrote, "I am learning Pergolesi's <lb/>
'Stabat Mater,' which realizes all that I could <lb/>
dream of religious music, and which derives <lb/>
additional interest from its being the last work <lb/>
<pb n="348" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0349"/>
in which the master-spirit breathed forth its <lb/>
enthusiasm."</p>
<p>The change to Wavertree proved unfortunate in <lb/>
one respect, for Mrs. Hemans's three sons were <lb/>
speedily down with the whooping-cough; and the <lb/>
mother, after great fatigue in nursing them, was <lb/>
seized with the same distressing complaint. Change <lb/>
of air being imperatively necessary, in the spring <lb/>
all the sufferers repaired to Seacombe, a small <lb/>
bathing-place on the Cheshire side of the Mersey. <lb/>
Here they derived great benefit, and were soon <lb/>
able to enjoy the bracing air. On Sundays Mrs. <lb/>
Hemans visited the Mariners' Church on the <lb/>
Liverpool side of the water. It was the hulk of <lb/>
a ship-of-war, fitted up for Divine service, which <lb/>
was conducted by Mr. Scoresby, an earnest Church <lb/>
of England clergyman. The services were <reg orig="interest-|ing">interesting</reg> <lb/>
and impressive, and the earnest attention of <lb/>
the hardy, weather-beaten sailors was a sight not <lb/>
to be forgotten. In her times of serious thought, <lb/>
Mrs. Hemans wrote some remarkable letters to <lb/>
bosom friends of her own sex: "Fear not any <lb/>
danger for me," she says in one of these letters, <lb/>
"in the adulation which surrounds me. A moment's <lb/>
transient entertainment&mdash;scarcely even that at <lb/>
times&mdash;is the utmost effect of things that 'come like <lb/>
shadows, so depart.' Of all things, may I never <lb/>
become that despicable thing&mdash;a woman living <lb/>
upon admiration! The village matron, tidying up <lb/>
for her husband and children at evening, is far, far <lb/>
more enviable and respectable."</p>
<p>In the month of July, 1829, she made a voyage <lb/>
round the coast of Scotland, for the purpose of <lb/>
<pb n="349" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0350"/>
paying a visit to her friends Thomas Hamilton and <lb/>
his wife. Hamilton was the author of "Cyril <lb/>
Thornton," and resided at Chiefswood, near <reg orig="Abbots-|ford">Abbotsford</reg>. <lb/>
The visit was a memorable one, for she <lb/>
was thrown much into the company of the <lb/>
"Wizard of the North." In one of her letters <lb/>
she writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You will be pleased to think of me, as I now <lb/>
am, in constant, almost daily intercourse with Sir <lb/>
Walter Scott, who has greeted me to this mountain <lb/>
land in the kindest manner, and with whom I talk <lb/>
freely and happily, as to an old familiar friend. I <lb/>
have taken several long walks with him over moor <lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">brae</hi>, and it is indeed delightful to see him thus, <lb/>
and to hear him pour forth, from the fulness of his <lb/>
rich mind and peopled memory, song and legend, <lb/>
and tale of old, until I could almost fancy I heard <lb/>
the gathering-cry of some chieftain of the hills, so <lb/>
completely does his spirit carry me back to the <lb/>
days of the slogan and the fire-cross. The other <lb/>
day, he most kindly made a party to take me to <lb/>
the banks of the Yarrow, about ten miles from <lb/>
hence. I went with him in an open carriage. We <lb/>
forded Ettrick river, passed Carterhaugh &lpar;the scene <lb/>
of the wild-fairy legend of 'Tam o' Linn,' and <lb/>
many a cairn and field of old combat, the heroes <lb/>
of which seemed to start up before me, in answer <lb/>
to the mighty master's voice, which related their <lb/>
deeds as we went by. And he is, indeed, a fitting <lb/>
narrator: his whole countenance&mdash;the predominant <lb/>
expression of which is generally a sort of arch <lb/>
benevolence&mdash;changes at the slightest allusion to <lb/>
any bold emprise? It is&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="350" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0351"/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'As the stream late conceal'd</l>
<l rend="indent">By the fringe of its willows,</l>
<l>When it flashes, reveal'd</l>
<l rend="indent">In the light of its billows;'</l>
</lg></q>
or like the war-horse at the sound of the trumpet. <lb/>
Sometimes, in reciting a verse of old martial song, <lb/>
he will suddenly spring up, and one feels ready to <lb/>
exclaim&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'Charge, Chester, charge! on, Stanley, on!'</l>
</lg></q>
so completely is the electric chain struck by his <lb/>
own high emotion. But Yarrow! beautiful Yarrow! <lb/>
we wound along its banks, through some stately <lb/>
grounds belonging to the Duke of Buccleuch; and <lb/>
was it not like a dream to be walking there with <lb/>
Sir Walter Scott by my side, reciting, every now <lb/>
and then, some verse of the fine old ballad? We <lb/>
visited Newark Tower, and returned to Abbotsford <lb/>
through the Tweed. The rest of the day was <lb/>
passed at that glorious place, the hall of which in <lb/>
particular is a scene to dream of, with the rich <lb/>
purple light streaming in through its coloured <lb/>
windows, and mantling its stately suits of armour <lb/>
and heraldric blazonries. We had a great deal of <lb/>
music in the evening&mdash;Sir Walter is particularly <lb/>
fond of national airs&mdash;and I played many of my <lb/>
waltzes, mazurkas, and Spanish melodies, for which <lb/>
I wish you could have heard how kindly and <lb/>
gracefully he thanked me. I am fortunate in <lb/>
seeing him as I do, surrounded only by his children <lb/>
and grandchildren, wandering through his own <lb/>
woods, taking the fresh delight of an <reg orig="unquench-|ably">unquenchably</reg> <lb/>
youthful spirit in the creations of his own <lb/>
hands. It is all so healthful to see and feel!"</p>
<pb n="351" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0352"/>
<p>The visit to Abbotsford was one of the brightest <lb/>
passages in her life. Scott unbent himself in a <lb/>
remarkable manner, introduced her to many <lb/>
friends, and when alone poured forth the treasures <lb/>
of romance into her ear. He complimented her <lb/>
highly on her musical talents: "I should say you <lb/>
had too many gifts, Mrs. Hemans, were they not <lb/>
all made to give pleasure to those around you." <lb/>
And on parting he said: "There are some whom <lb/>
we meet and should like ever after to claim as <lb/>
kith and kin; and you are one of these."</p>
<p>At Edinburgh, Mrs. Hemans was welcomed by <lb/>
Sir David and Lady Wedderburn, at whose house <lb/>
she enjoyed the society of Mrs. Grant of Laggan, <lb/>
Captain Basil Hall, and Francis Jeffrey. One of <lb/>
her most delightful days was passed at Jeffrey's <lb/>
country seat, Craig Crook. She heard the Rev. <lb/>
Archibald Alison, father of the historian, and <lb/>
author of the "Essay on Taste," preach, and visited <lb/>
the venerable Henry Mackenzie, the author of that <lb/>
famous novel, "The Man of Feeling," who regaled <lb/>
her with anecdotes of Hume, Robertson, and <lb/>
Gibbon. In the families of Baron Hume and Mr. <lb/>
Alison she formed life-long friendships.</p>
<p>Early in the summer of 1830 Mrs. Hemans <lb/>
published her volume of "Songs of the Affections," <lb/>
and in the month of June paid a visit to the <lb/>
English lakes, accompanied by her son Charles. <lb/>
Health reasons partially accounted for this visit, <lb/>
but she was also attracted by the prospect of <lb/>
intellectual communion with Wordsworth, who was <lb/>
at length year by year exercising a stronger spell <lb/>
over her mind. The lofty and pure-minded poet <lb/>
<pb n="352" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0353"/>
received her with all kindliness and courtesy, and <lb/>
her personal knowledge of him soon deepened the <lb/>
impression created by his works. In one of her <lb/>
letters she says: "I seem to be writing to you <lb/>
almost from the spirit-land; all is here so brightly. <lb/>
still, so remote from everyday cares and tumults, <lb/>
that sometimes I can hardly persuade myself I <lb/>
am not dreaming. It scarcely seems to be 'the <lb/>
light of common day' that is clothing the woody <lb/>
mountains before me; there is something almost <lb/>
visionary in its soft gleams and ever-changing <lb/>
shadows. I am charmed with Mr. Wordsworth, <lb/>
whose kindness to me has quite a soothing influence <lb/>
over my spirits. Oh, what relief, what blessing <lb/>
there is in the feeling of admiration, when it can <lb/>
be freely poured forth! 'There is a daily beauty <lb/>
in his life,' which is in such lovely harmony with <lb/>
his poetry, that I am thankful to have witnessed <lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">felt</hi> it. He gives me a good deal of his society, <lb/>
reads to me, walks with me, leads my pony when <lb/>
I ride; and I begin to talk with him as with a <lb/>
sort of paternal friend. The whole of this morning <lb/>
he kindly passed in reading to me a great deal <lb/>
from Spenser, and afterwards his own 'Laodamia,' <lb/>
my favourite 'Tintern Abbey,' and many of his <lb/>
noble sonnets. His reading is very peculiar, but, <lb/>
to my ear, delightful; slow, solemn, earnest in <lb/>
expression more than any I have ever heard. When <lb/>
he reads or recites in the open air, his deep rich <lb/>
tones seem to proceed from a spirit-voice, and <lb/>
belong to the religion of the place; they harmonize <lb/>
so fitly with the thrilling tones of woods and <lb/>
waterfalls. His expressions are often strikingly <lb/>
<pb n="353" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0354"/>
poetical, such as, 'I would not give up the mists <lb/>
that so spiritualize our mountains, for all the blue <lb/>
skies of Italy.' Yesterday evening he walked <lb/>
beside me as I rode on a long and lovely <reg orig="mountain-|path">mountain-path</reg>, <lb/>
high above Grasmere Lake. I was much <lb/>
interested by his showing me, carved deep into the <lb/>
rock, as we passed, the initials of his wife's name, <lb/>
inscribed there many years ago by himself; and <lb/>
the dear old man, like 'Old Mortality,' renews <lb/>
them from time to time. I could scarcely help <lb/>
exclaiming 'Esto perpetua.'</p>
<p>"It is delightful to see a life in such perfect <lb/>
harmony with all that his writings express&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>'True to the kindred points of heaven and home!'</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>"You may remember how much I disliked, <lb/>
and I think you agreed with me in reprobating, <lb/>
that shallow theory of Mr. Moore's with regard to <lb/>
the unfitness of genius for domestic happiness. I <lb/>
was speaking of it yesterday to Mr. Wordsworth, <lb/>
and was pleased by his remark: 'It is not because <lb/>
they possess genius that they make unhappy <lb/>
homes, but because they do not possess genius <lb/>
enough; a higher order of mind would enable them <lb/>
to see and feel all the beauty of domestic ties.' <lb/>
His mind, indeed, may well in habit an untroubled <lb/>
atmosphere, for, as he himself declares, no wounded <lb/>
affections, no embittered feelings, have ever been <lb/>
his lot; the current of his domestic life has flowed <lb/>
on, bright, and pure, and unbroken. Hence, I <lb/>
think, much of the high sculpture-like repose <lb/>
which invests both his character and writings with <lb/>
so tranquil a dignity."</p>
<p>After being for a fortnight the guest of <reg orig="Words-|worth">Wordsworth</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="354" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0355"/>
at Rydal Mount, Mrs. Hemans took up her <lb/>
abode at a little retired cottage called Dove Nest, <lb/>
where she was joined by the rest of her family <lb/>
group. The beauty of the Windermere scenery <lb/>
was most restful and soothing to the tired spirit of <lb/>
the poetess, and she drank in from the ever-<reg orig="chang-|ing">changing</reg> <lb/>
and majestic scene balm for both soul and <lb/>
body. Yet her letters speak of the irruption of <lb/>
parties "hunting for lions in doves' nests," of a <lb/>
renewal of the "Album persecution," of an absolute <lb/>
maelstrom of letters and papers threatening "to <lb/>
boil over the drawer to which they were consigned;" <lb/>
till at length the despairing conclusion is arrived <lb/>
at that "one might as well hope for peace in the <lb/>
character of a shadowless man as of a literary <lb/>
woman," On leaving Dove Nest in the middle of <lb/>
August, she paid a second visit to Scotland, as the <lb/>
friend and guest of Sir Robert Liston; and before <lb/>
she returned to England she visited Ireland at the <lb/>
invitation of Mr. J. C. Graves, of Dublin. After <lb/>
returning to Wavertree, she was strengthened in a <lb/>
conviction which had been growing for some time <lb/>
past that the situation of that place was neither <lb/>
suitable to her own health nor convenient for her <lb/>
sons. She therefore formed a resolution to settle <lb/>
in Ireland, and towards the end of April, 1831, she <lb/>
left England for the last time. A stay of a few <lb/>
weeks was made at Dublin, and then she proceeded <lb/>
to visit her brother, Major Browne, at the <reg orig="Hermi-|tage">Hermitage</reg>, <lb/>
Kilkenny. Although the scenery was <reg orig="delight-|ful">delightful</reg> <lb/>
and restful in character, the condition of <reg orig="Kil-|kenny">Kilkenny</reg> <lb/>
was very ominous, as one anecdote will <lb/>
testify. When Mrs. Hemans and her brother paid <lb/>
<pb n="355" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0356"/>
a visit to a clergyman of the neighbourhood, they <lb/>
found a guard of eight armed policemen stationed <lb/>
at the gate; the window ledges were also provided <lb/>
with great stones for the convenience of hurling <lb/>
down upon assailants; and the master of the house <lb/>
had not for a fortnight taken a walk without <lb/>
loaded pistols. But they themselves were in no <lb/>
danger, for it was a peculiarity in Irish disturbances <lb/>
that those who were not obnoxious, from party or <lb/>
political motives, to the people, had really nothing <lb/>
to fear. A visit which Mrs. Hemans paid to <lb/>
Woodstock, the home of the deceased poetess, Mrs. <lb/>
Tighe, led to the composition of a fine memorial <lb/>
poem.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1831 Mrs. Hemans took up <lb/>
her abode in Dublin, where two of her sons were <lb/>
placed at school under the Rev. Dr. Gwynne, while <lb/>
the third, Charles, had his education superintended <lb/>
by Mr. R. P. Graves, of Trinity College, who <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
became Bishop of Limerick. Among those <lb/>
who showed Mrs. Hemans the most friendly <reg orig="atten-|tions">attentions</reg> <lb/>
were Archbishop and Mrs. Whately, at whose <lb/>
house, also, she was much interested in meeting Mr. <lb/>
Blanco White. Soon after settling in the Irish <lb/>
capital, she had an opportunity of listening to the <lb/>
wonderful performances of Paganini, which she <lb/>
afterwards graphically and minutely described. <lb/>
After a wandering tour through the beautiful <lb/>
county of Wicklow, in October, 1832, she returned to <lb/>
Dublin only to suffer from the longest and severest <lb/>
attack of heart palpitation she had ever <reg orig="experi-|enced">experienced</reg>; <lb/>
it was accompanied by almost daily <reg orig="fainting-|fits">fainting-fits</reg>, <lb/>
and a languor quite indescribable. But once <lb/>
<pb n="356" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0357"/>
more she recovered with singular elasticity to enjoy <lb/>
a fair measure of health. Then came a winter of <lb/>
distressing fluctuations, with a partial recovery in <lb/>
the spring of 1833. Six months later she had a <lb/>
happy meeting with her sister and brother-in-law, <lb/>
after a five years' separation. They were painfully <lb/>
struck with the ravages which sickness had made <lb/>
upon her worn and faded form; but her spirits <lb/>
rallied to all their wonted cheerfulness, and the <lb/>
powers of her mind seemed more vivid and <reg orig="vigor-|ous">vigorous</reg> <lb/>
than ever.</p>
<p>Early in 1834 Mrs. Hemans published her <lb/>
"Hymns for Childhood" and her volume of "National <lb/>
Lyrics and Songs for Music." The latter work, she <lb/>
said, contained but "the broken music of a troubled <lb/>
heart" Then came the last work published during <lb/>
her lifetime, "Scenes and Hymns of Life." It was <lb/>
dedicated in a few simple words to Wordsworth, <lb/>
though at first she intended to preface the work by <lb/>
a letter giving free scope to the expression of her <lb/>
sentiments, not only of veneration for the poet, but <lb/>
of deep and grateful regard for the friend. By the <lb/>
critics the volume was recognized as the author's <lb/>
best work, and as indicating a noble path for her <lb/>
to pursue. She was contemplating at this time a <lb/>
series of German literary studies, but the only one <lb/>
of the papers which she completed and published <lb/>
was an essay on Goethe's "Tasso," which appeared <lb/>
in the <hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi> for January, 1834. <lb/>
She was much affected in the summer of this year <lb/>
by receiving news of the death of her friend, Maria <lb/>
Jewsbury, who had not long before married the <lb/>
Rev. W. K. Fletcher, one of the chaplains to the <lb/>
<pb n="357" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0358"/>
East India Company. She had fallen a victim to <lb/>
cholera at Poonah, where her remains were interred. <lb/>
Writing to a friend concerning Mrs. Fletcher's <lb/>
death, Mrs. Hemans said: "Strange and sad does <lb/>
it seem that only the broken music of such a <lb/>
spirit should have been given to the earth&mdash;the <lb/>
full and finished harmony never drawn forth. Yet <lb/>
I would rather a thousand times that she should <lb/>
have perished thus, in the path of her chosen duties, <lb/>
than have seen her become the merely brilliant <lb/>
creature of London literary life, at once the queen <lb/>
and slave of some heartless coterie, living upon <lb/>
those <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">succ&egrave;s de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</hi></foreign>, which I think utterly ruinous <lb/>
to all that is lofty, and holy, and delicate, in the <lb/>
nature of a highly endowed woman. I put on <lb/>
mourning for her with a deep feeling of sadness. <lb/>
I never expected to meet her again in this life, but <lb/>
there was a strong chain of interest between us, <lb/>
that spell of <hi rend="italic">mind on mind</hi> which, once formed, can <lb/>
never be broken. I felt, too, that my whole nature <lb/>
was understood and appreciated by her, and this is <lb/>
a sort of happiness which I consider the most rare <lb/>
in all earthly affection. Those who think and feel <lb/>
deeply, whatever playfulness of manner may <lb/>
brighten the surface of their character, are fully <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">unsealed</hi> to very few indeed.</p>
<p>"Will you tell Mr. Wordsworth this anecdote of <lb/>
poor Mrs. Fletcher? I am sure it will interest <lb/>
him. During the time that the famine in Deccan <lb/>
was raging, she heard that a poor Hindoo had <lb/>
been found lying dead in one of the temples at the <lb/>
foot of an idol, and with a female child, still living, <lb/>
in his arms. She and her husband immediately <lb/>
<pb n="358" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0359"/>
repaired to the spot, took the poor little orphan <lb/>
away with them, and conveyed it to their own <lb/>
house. She tended it assiduously, and one of her <lb/>
last cares was to have it placed at a female <lb/>
missionary school, and to be brought up as a <lb/>
Christian."</p>
<p>An attack of fever in the month of July, 1834, <lb/>
prevented Mrs. Hemans from carrying out a <reg orig="long-|cherished">long-cherished</reg> <lb/>
scheme of a second visit to the English <lb/>
Lakes. Instead of this, she went a few miles into <lb/>
the county of Wicklow for immediate change of <lb/>
air, when she unfortunately put up at a little <lb/>
country inn which proved to be infected with <lb/>
scarlet fever. The circumstance was concealed by <lb/>
the people of the house until both herself and her <lb/>
maid had caught the contagion. Again she was <lb/>
prostrated by illness, and frequently wept from <lb/>
sheer weakness and weariness. As soon as she <lb/>
had recovered somewhat she was conveyed back to <lb/>
Dublin. During the warm portion of the autumn <lb/>
days she sat a good deal in the gardens of the <lb/>
Dublin Society, thinking and reading. On one <lb/>
occasion, however, the penetrating chill of an <lb/>
autumnal fog suddenly closed round her, and <lb/>
when she reached home it was only to discover <lb/>
that she had taken a severe chill. Ague ensued, <lb/>
and she became much enfeebled. Again there was <lb/>
a partial recovery, however, and she was taken to <lb/>
Redesdale, a charming seat belonging to <reg orig="Arch-|bishop">Archbishop</reg> <lb/>
Whately, about seven miles from Dublin. <lb/>
Several poems written in her sickness reveal a <lb/>
beautiful and chastened spirit. She derived some <lb/>
benefit from the change to Redesdale; "but"&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="359" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0360"/>
she wrote&mdash;"better far than these indications of <lb/>
recovery is the sweet religious peace which I feel <lb/>
gradually overshadowing me with its dove-pinions, <lb/>
excluding all that would exclude thoughts of God." <lb/>
Her passion for flowers was very strong, and when <lb/>
new books failed to move her, flowers stirred her <lb/>
heart with a sudden sense of renovated <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg>. <lb/>
The devoted care of her sons, and the <lb/>
attentions of friends, cheered her during her <lb/>
months of suffering and enforced quietude. <reg orig="Un-|speakable">Unspeakable</reg> <lb/>
joy and gratitude filled her soul when <lb/>
she received a letter from Sir Robert Peel <reg orig="appoint-|ing">appointing</reg> <lb/>
her son Henry to a clerkship in the Admiralty, <lb/>
and forwarding for herself a munificent donation. <lb/>
By the Premier's generous and thoughtful action, <lb/>
a weight of anxiety was lifted from her heart.</p>
<p>After an apparent temporary revival of strength, <lb/>
a reaction set in with the sufferer, and she felt the <lb/>
most distressing debility, as well as an increase of <lb/>
other alarming symptoms. She endured much <lb/>
pain, and was wasted to a shadow, but the same <lb/>
patient, Christian spirit remained. She was serenely <lb/>
submissive to God's will, and moved by the kindest <lb/>
consideration for others. Again and again she <lb/>
spoke of the unutterable comfort which she derived <lb/>
from dwelling on the contemplation of the <reg orig="Atone-|ment">Atonement</reg>. <lb/>
Her powers of memory, which had always <lb/>
been remarkable, were now intensified, and she <lb/>
would lie for hours without moving, repeating to <lb/>
herself whole chapters from the Bible, and page <lb/>
after page of Milton and Wordsworth. On Sunday, <lb/>
April 26, she dictated to her brother the "Sabbath <lb/>
Sonnet," the last earthly strain of this sweet singer:&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="360" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0361"/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"How many blessed groups this hour are wending,</l>
<l rend="indent">Through England's primrose meadow-paths, their way</l>
<l>Toward spire and tower, 'midst shadowy elms ascending,</l>
<l rend="indent">Whence the sweet chimes proclaim the hallow'd day.</l>
<l>The halls, from old heroic ages grey,</l>
<l rend="indent">Pour their fair children forth; and hamlets low,</l>
<l>With those thick orchard blooms the soft winds play,</l>
<l rend="indent">Send out their inmates in a happy flow,</l>
<l>Like a freed vernal stream; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> may not tread</l>
<l rend="indent">With them those pathways&mdash;to the feverish bed</l>
<l>Of sickness bound; yet, O my God! I bless</l>
<l rend="indent">Thy mercy, that with Sabbath peace hath fill'd</l>
<l>My chasten'd heart, and all its throbbings still'd</l>
<l rend="indent">To one deep calm of lowliest thankfulness."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>During her closing days, a selection from the <lb/>
works of Archbishop Leighton brought great <lb/>
comfort to the patient. When the end was visibly <lb/>
approaching, she told her relatives, with a heavenly <lb/>
smile, that "she had been making her peace with <lb/>
God&mdash;that she felt all at peace within her bosom." <lb/>
On May 16 she sank into a gentle slumber, which <lb/>
continued unbroken for hours; then, when evening <lb/>
came, she passed away without pain or struggle. <lb/>
Her remains were deposited in a vault beneath St. <lb/>
Anne's Church, Dublin. A small tablet was <lb/>
placed over the spot where she is laid, inscribed <lb/>
with her name, her age&mdash;forty-one years&mdash;the date <lb/>
of her death, and the following lines from a dirge <lb/>
of her own:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Calm on the bosom of thy God,</l>
<l rend="indent">Fair Spirit! rest thee now!</l>
<l>E'en while with us thy footsteps trod,</l>
<l>His seal was on thy brow.</l>
<l rend="indent">Dust to its narrow house beneath!</l>
<l>Soul to its place on high!</l>
<l rend="indent">They that have seen thy look in death,</l>
<l>No more may fear to die."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<pb n="361" entity="Smith_NobleWomanhood_0362"/>
<p>A tablet erected to her memory in the Cathedral <lb/>
of St. Asaph truthfully says that her "character is <lb/>
best portrayed in her writings." Her "Poetical <lb/>
Remains," and other works, are perfect in Pathos <lb/>
and sentiment, and her finest lyrics will doubtless <lb/>
live as long as the English language. Equally <lb/>
deserving of remembrance is her blameless life, and <lb/>
she is one of those bright examples among women <lb/>
who show how true genius and the most tender <lb/>
affections may be happily blended.</p>
