            <p>
            Comme vous voyez  I am still 
            here.  Was all ready to start
            an hour or so ago when it
            started in to rain again.  A
            large crowd had gathered and I
            was sorry to disappoint them.
            I walked into town with a
            rather chic person who said
            her husband wouldn’t mind her
            walking with an aviator.  Seems
            an aviator is some class in
            these parts.  I apologized for my
            get up as I hadn’t figured
            on being in a town and only
            had on my leathers and a
            crummy looking blue coat with
            a pass &mdash; montagne.  Instead of
            saying that was all right she
            agreed that I looked fierce and
            not at all like other aviators 
            she had seen, which was amusing.
            We took her boy in and got 
            him some cakes and then I
            came to this cafe to write
            you a note.  I’ll surely get
            away to morrow and if lucky
            I’ll be breveted a day after.
            </p><p>
            Marcelle, you’re funny some
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0240" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            times.  About Paul’s remark and
            the Russian Ballet.  Can’t you
            jolly along as the rest of us
            do &mdash; as Paul did.  Quite
            harmless I assure you, and
            no reason to be serious and 
            shocked.  My only diversion here
            is reading your last letter.
            I received it just before I
            started and took it with me.
            </p><p>
            Its terrible to think of
            you being exposed to the
            Zeffelin attacks.  You are sure
            to go into the cave aren’t you 
            when they come?  You’ll be all
            right there and there’s no use
            exposing yourself for no end.
            </p><p>
            I shall see you before I
            go to the front.  Of that you
            may be sure.  Maybe I’ll go to
            Paris after my brevet but don’t
            know as we get but four days
            permission and its not worth while.
            If I had had luck I would have
            been breveted to day as I’ve finished
            all my other voyages.  Its just a
            month since I started training and
            I’ve had but 14 or 15 hours of flight
            in all.  Best to your mother and
            father and yourself, of course.
