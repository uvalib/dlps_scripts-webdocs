                              has been followed for Butler’s diary.
                                   Every attempt has been made to transcribe this document as found.
                              If a word or words cannot be discerned, a hyphen is inserted for each 
                              missing word.  For example, [hyphen hyphen hyphen] indicates three missing words.  
                              Spelling and punctuation are reproduced as found.  If a word or 
                              proper name is unclear, a question mark [?] is used after the name.
                                   If words are inserted above the line by the author, the symbol “^” 
                              is used with the inserted words bracketed.  For example, if “in this 
                              case” is written above the line, it would appear as ^ ‘in this case’.
                                   To facilitate reading this document when punctuation and or
