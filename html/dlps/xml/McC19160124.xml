            <p>
            I was very pleased 
            to hear from you at 
            last.  I was beginning
            to wonder.  Its delightful
            to have a letter of yours
            to carry around, and read
            when I’m waiting.
            </p><p>
            Saturday I spent
            my first quartier libre in
            Pau with the crowd.  We 
            had a large party.  I
            didn’t feel like going up
            today on my straight line.
            No one did, I guess, for it 
            was a bad day.  Seven
            wrecks.  I saw one man
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0231" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            on the piste next to
            me waver and fall.
            </p><p>
            There was a sickening,
            grinding crash and the
            machine turned over.  I
            thought him killed.  The 
            men ran to him and
            pulled him out.  He was
            stretched out on the ground.
            Just then my monitor
            signaled me to go ahead.
            I kissed myself good
            bye and started.  Mirable
            dictu I finished the day
            well and was passed
            to another division.  I have
            now passed all the group
            I found myself with
            save one officer who is
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0230" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            very good, and with
            fair weather and good
            luck I should have my
            brevet in sixteen days.
            I agree with you that
            one should not go too
            fast and I’m going to
            slow up until I get
            the atterrissage better.
            Sometimes I come down
            like a ton of bricks.
            </p><p>
            One machine burnt up
            today.  Gasoline tank exploded
            and a column of flame
            shot up.  Discouraging
            sight.
            </p><p>
            It was wonderful &mdash;
            the Russian Ballet &mdash; and
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0232" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            delightful that I saw 
            you there.  I had a double
            pleasure for I enjoyed it
            so myself and took added
            pleasure in knowing that
            Marcelle in the box across
            the way was in raptures.
            </p><p>
            Must hurry now.  Good
            night, dear, and my
            very best to your
            father and mother.
            </p>
