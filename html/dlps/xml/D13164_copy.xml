                        railroad from New York to thirty destinations including Richmond, Va. (18 &frac12; hours). Next
                        is "A Complete Table of Stamp Duties", eclipses in 1864, moon phases for 1864, and tide
                        tables for New York and San Francisco. The diary dates are pre-printed, one per page and
                        in the transcription these dates appear in bold italics. On February 20th, 1864, the
                        original owner of this diary, an unknown soldier from Indiana, begins his entries and in
                        the transcription, they will appear in italics. At a later time, William Smith comes
                        into possession of this 1864 diary. He starts on the page with the date January 1, 1864,
                        inserts his own dates (from November 7, 1864 through April 11, 1865), and adds his own
                        entries in the blank spaces available. The diary begins with the events in an election
                        for the U.S. President at Andersonville Prison. The author of this segment is William H.
                        Smith from Michigan, Co. E, 7th Michigan Volunteers. The unknown soldier, beginning his
                        entries on Feb. 20, 1864, was wounded in the Wilderness on May 6, 1864 and captured (he
                        was reported as killed). He arrived at Andersonville on or near June 28, 1864 and was
                        waiting for the train to leave on September 16, 1864. See transcription notes at the
                        end. The first eight pages are written in green ink that is quite faded.] -->

                            soldier from Pittsburg, Indiana. Eric Mink, an historian with the National Parks Service
                            at Fredericksburg, has been of great assistance in attempting to identify the unknown
                            soldier from Indiana. He wrote on 14 April 2005, " One thing that might help to at least
                            narrow down his company would be any diary entries that mention other members of his
                            unit by last name. Soldiers frequently mentioned their officers and that would be a huge
                            clue. Are there any such clues?" An answer was sent that day with the names of George
                            Larkum, Capt. John C. Brown, and Lieutenant John C. Bartholomew. Eric's response was, "
                            It certainly appears that Co. K. 20th Indiana is the most logical unit for the diarist
                            to have served with. George Larkum - Sgt. Co. K., Capt. John C. Brown - Co. K.,
                            Lieutenant John C. Bartholomew - Co. K." Robert S. Davis, Wallace University, has
                            visited the University of Virginia to view these two diaries. When I shared Eric's
                            theory with him, he replied as follows, " I think that Henry E. Olinger of Company I is
                            still our best candidate. Jack Lundquist has put together a data base of information on
                            the prisoners of Andersonville. Many problems exist with any such project including that
                            some men appear in diaries that do not appear on the prison's records. However, of the
                            men of the 20th Indiana, Olinger is the only man not ruled out by death in the prison
                            etc. His service record shows that he was indeed captured at the Wilderness on May 6,
                            1864. He was exchanged in Savannah, apparently having left Andersonville after he had
                            been admitted to the hospital there on September 11. I believe he was part of an
                            exchange of very sick prisoners." Relying solely on the unknown soldier's diary, we know
                            that he was in the 20th Indiana, 2nd Corps, that he was born on 30 May 1829, was married
                            to Mary, lived near Pittsburg, Indiana, and had relatives with the surnames of Baum,
                            McCormick, and Steele. On 6 May 1864, he was wounded on the head and left shoulder and
                            captured at the battle of the Wilderness. On 12 May, he was operated on by Dr. James
                            Bolton (in charge of the 3rd Corps (CS) receiving hospital). A ball was removed from his
                            shoulder. He arrived at Andersonville, Georgia on 28 June 1864 and left on 16 September
                            1864. - Mary Roy Dawson Edwards, Transcriber April 2005.] 13164 Page 1 -->
