                            applicants and need-based aid for admitted undergraduate students help

                            Commonwealth of Virginia will cause an erosion of the quality of the
                            University's academic program unless there is an increase in other

                            program to offer financial aid to meet 100 percent of demonstrated
                            financial need for all qualified undergraduate students by the fall of
                            2004; and </p>

                <p>The majority of the report was a summary of legislation of interest
                    to the University pending in the General Assembly. Of these bills, perhaps the
                    most significant are House Bill 1359 and Senate Bill 638, the so-called "charter

                        in previous years, the figures were high because of significant "8-figure"

                    <p>Among the significant gifts received between July 1 and

                    <p>The purpose of the student activity fee is to provide financial

                        purpose of the University of Virginia. As a required student fee the monies
                        collected by the University for funding student activities are public funds
                        which must be administered in a manner consistent with the educational

                    <p>The Board of Visitors has determined that fraternities, sororities, honor
                        societies, and special status student organizations not charged by the Board
                        of Visitors are ineligible for funds from the student activities fees. An
                        organization is also ineligible when admission is exclusionary in nature and
                        not open to all students or if membership is restricted by reason of race,
                        religion, disability, national origin, political affiliation, or gender.
                        Notwithstanding these requirements, a student organization may restrict
                        membership based on ability to perform the activities related to the
                        organization's purpose. In determining cases of discrimination, it is not
                        sufficient to look merely to the constitution of an organization but to its
                        actual practices and operations. </p>

                    <head type="sub">FUND ALLOCATION AND APPEAL PROCEDURES/PROCESS:</head>
                    <p>The Student Activities Committee chaired by the designee of the Vice
                        President for Student Affairs is charged with the authority and
                        responsibility for supervision of the student activities fee fund. With
                        respect to distributions from the fund, Student Council is responsible for
                        allocations to eligible student organizations. The ceiling on the aggregate
                        amount allocated to all such organizations shall be the current balance in
                        the student activities fees fund. The allocation process follows procedures
                        established by Student Council which are intended to maximize the use of the
                        funds and are consistent with the above guidelines. The Student Council
                        Appropriations Committee is responsible for following these procedures and
                        making the recommendations to the Student Council Representative Body on the
                        funding requests. In providing student organizations with appropriations
                        deemed needed, the Student Council Appropriations Committee shall be further
                        guided by such criteria as the size of the group, the University wide
                        benefit of the group's activities, and the group's level of financial
                        self-sufficiency. The committee is encouraged but is not required to
                        appropriate all of the available <pb n="3"/> fund balance. The
                        Appropriations Committee recommended allocation to a student organization
                        may be appealed to the Student Council Representative Body by any student or
                        student organization. The Student Activities Committee is the next and final
                        appeal for any budget reviewed and, in some cases, adjusted by the Student
                        Council Representative Body. In addition, the Student Activities Committee
                        may examine on its own motion any student organization's allocation request
                        submitted to the Student Council. After the allocations are finalized, the
                        Student Council Vice President for Student Organizations writes the chair of
                        the Student Activities Committee requesting that the allocations for those
                        funded organizations be released to the Student Activities Business Manager.
                        When the Student Activities Business Manager receives the funds, they are
                        deposited into a demand deposit account. Expenditures from the allocations
                        can be made provided the student organization completes the proper
                        authorization forms with the Student Activities Business Manager. The
                        student organizations receive their allocation on a per semester basis for
                        payment of expenses of activities conducted during the, fall and spring
                        semesters only. Any funded student organization alleged to be in violation
                        of the above guidelines is subject to the suspension or loss of student
                        activity fee funding after notice and an opportunity to be heard by Student
                        Council. The Student Activities Committee is the next and final appeal body.

                    <p>These definitions of terms are intended to provide clarification of the
                        student activity fee fund guidelines. In those cases where further
                        clarification is needed, Student Council and, if necessary, the Student
                        Activities Committee will interpret the guidelines based on the facts
                        presented and the Board of Visitors intent for the student activity fee.</p>
                    <p>Ability to Perform - a student organization may restrict membership based on
                        ability to perform the activities related to the organization's purpose. For
                        example, a student publication may make requirements based on writing
                        skills. A club sport may restrict membership where selection is based on
                        competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport thus resulting
                        in a team of one or predominately one gender. Likewise, ' a choral group may
                        restrict membership based on vocal range or quality which may also result in
                        a chorus or choruses of one or predominantly one gender. </p>
                    <p>Co-curricular Organization - a group which provides opportunities outside the
                        classroom setting for students to apply classroom theory and/or to acquire
                        knowledge, experience and/or skills. </p>
                    <p>Cultural Organization - an organization which is primarily concerned with
                        studying, promoting, and/or expressing racial, ethnic, or affinity group
                        traditions, social forms, art, and/or tastes. </p>
                    <pb n="4"/>
                    <p>Hobby Organization - a group which primarily pursues an activity for
                        relaxation, recreation, or entertainment. </p>
                    <p>Political Activity - an activity related to: (1) lobbying the principal
                        purpose of which is to influence the passage or defeat of specific
                        legislation, and/or (2) electioneering which encompasses participation or
                        intervention in any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any
                        candidate for public office. These restrictions on funding political
                        activities are not intended to preclude funding of any otherwise eligible
                        student organization which: (1) advocates, as an incidental or insubstantial
                        part of its activities, the adoption or rejection of legislation; (2)
                        engages in nonpartisan analysis, study, or research, and makes the results
                        available to the public, or (3) espouses particular positions or ideological
                        viewpoints, including those that may be unpopular or are not generally
                        accepted, or that may coincidentally be prominently held by particular
                        political parties or political candidates. </p>
                    <p>Political Organization - an organization primarily devoted to political
                        discussion or debate and the organization of meetings to further such
                        interests, and which in advancing such general social and educational
                        interests through its membership does not use student activities fee funding
                        for political activity as defined herein. </p>
                    <p>Religious Activity - the organized worship of a deity, divine power, or
                        supernatural entity, whether or not such activity is consistent with the
                        precepts of an organized religion or denomination. No student news,
                        information, opinion, entertainment or academic communications media group
