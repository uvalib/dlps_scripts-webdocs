    </head>
    <p> Praises her friendship; happy to receive a letter from her, which he will now answer. Fears
     that she is suffering on his account, but he is actually very well, as Hallie will assure her.
     Describes daily routine of the 3d Brigade. Began correspondence with Miss [Swancie?] Holcombe
     of Oberlin to encourage the dispirited Sergeant Moore to get a similar correspondent; now she
     has responded, and he wonders whether he shouldn't have Addie's permission to continue the
     exchange. Recounts comments by fellows sitting around him. Mentions Chauncey Corn, now of Co.
     A, 29th Regiment. They would like more newspapers, but don't send books, which are hard to
     transport. Asks after "Auntie," Laurie and Miss [Hegloss]; Will Braden and Sergeant Moore send
     their regards. </p>

     <salute>My dearest Addie:</salute>
    </opener>

    <p> Few, <hi rend="underline">very</hi> very few, have as kind or as<lb/> good a friend as I find
     in my darling Addie. Again<lb/> I was made happy by the reception of a letter from her<lb/>
     whom my heart holds very dear &amp; near. There being no<lb/> more pleasant duty before me
     this evening, I devote it<lb/> to communicating my scattered thoughts, <hi rend="underline">per
      paper</hi> to<lb/> you. Now do not imagine that there is <hi rend="underline">any</hi> duty,
     which,<lb/> in pleasure, comes between us, for such is not the case,</p>
    <p> Darling, are you not suffering too much, needlessly<lb/> on my account? I can scarcely blame
     you, either, for<lb/> I know what thoughts <hi rend="underline">must</hi> present themselves,
     at<lb/> times, but do not imagine that I am unwell for I claim<lb/> to be as healthy a member
     of the Regt. as our Company<lb/> affords. Hallie well knows this, and will assure you that<lb/>
     such is the case. I have not been unwell--so to speak--<lb/> since I have been in the service.
     How strange that you<lb/> have not <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> a letter from me for so
     long a time.<lb/> I wrote to you. I wrote you a letter the 1<hi rend="super">st</hi> of this
     month, again<lb/>
     <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0512"/> on the 15<hi rend="super">th</hi>, and the 23<hi
      rend="super">d</hi> Inst. I wrote again. But I<lb/> will write every day If you do not <orig
      reg="receive">recieve</orig> my letters until you<lb/> do. Capt Arper has returned, and gave
     me the letter also the picture<lb/> of <hi rend="underline">My Addie</hi>. How beautiful!
     Addie--an abrupt question--how did<lb/> you ever happen to love such a <orig reg="verdant"
      >verdunt</orig>-looking (<hi rend="underline">and acting too</hi>)<lb/> and <hi
      rend="underline">homely</hi> person as C,N,Tenney? Are you sorry you ever con=<lb/> sented to
     correspond with him? <hi rend="underline">I'm not</hi>, I'll assure you</p>
    <p>But what nonsense I am writing. Are you not ashamed<lb/> of me? I must tell you what we have
     to do now<lb/> While other troops are winning imperishable names in our<lb/> countrys cause,
     the gallant " <hi rend="underline">3<hi rend="super">d</hi> Brigade.</hi>" is busily engaged <hi
      rend="underline">in</hi><lb/>
     <hi rend="underline">the</hi> <hi rend="underline">laudable</hi> <hi rend="underline"
      >enterprise</hi> <hi rend="underline">of</hi><hi rend="underline">eating</hi><hi
      rend="underline">Uncle</hi><hi rend="underline">Sam's</hi><hi rend="underline"
      >provisions</hi>,<hi rend="underline">and</hi><lb/>
     <hi rend="underline">in</hi> <hi rend="underline">drilling</hi>, though what to prepare us for,
     I scarcely know, unless<lb/> it is that we may present a military appearance when we<lb/> come
      home, <hi rend="underline">covered</hi> <hi rend="underline">with</hi> <hi rend="underline"
      >the</hi> <hi rend="underline">honors</hi> <hi rend="underline">of</hi> <hi rend="underline"
     >War</hi>. The order of the<lb/> day, as read at Parade is as follows.-- Reveille &amp;
     Roll Call--6 A.M.<lb/> Surgeon's Call--(for the sick) 8.-- First signal for Guardmounting--
     8.30<lb/> Guardmounting 9.-- Company Drill from 9.30 to 11.-- Dinner &amp;<lb/> Roll call
     12.M. Company drill from 1 to 2 P.M.-- Adjutant's<lb/> Call, 4.-- Dress Parade 4.30-- Retreat
     6.-- Tattoo &amp; Roll Call 8.30<lb/> Extinguish lights, 9. Thus you <orig reg="perceive"
      >percieve</orig> that our time is<lb/> pretty well occupied. We ought to be able soon to "face
     the enemy"<lb/> will we not?</p>

    <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0513"/>

    <p> I must tell you something which I should have<lb/> mentioned before, and would, had I though
     of ever hearing<lb/> from it again. It is this. Sergt. Moore, who by the way<lb/> was rather
     dispirited--&amp; myself, at my suggestion--(which was<lb/> made for his benefit)--wrote a
     letter each. he one to Miss Julia A.<lb/> Prentiss, &amp; I to
     Miss <unclear>Luancie</unclear> Holcomb, &amp; sent them to Oberlin. Never<lb/> expecting to
     hear from <hi rend="underline">mine</hi>, I was surprised on <orig reg="receiving"
     >recieving</orig> a<lb/> reply the 22<hi rend="super">d</hi> Inst. I hesitated some time before
     answering<lb/> it, but having commenced it. I considered it ungentlemanly<lb/> to neglect
     answering it. so wrote again. Hal told me who to write<lb/> to, &amp; named <hi
      rend="underline">her</hi>. I send you the letter as I <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> it,
     &amp; and Hal has<lb/> a synopsis of my reply which he will show you. Will you please<lb/>
     preserve the letters, (for I will send you all I get) as I may have<lb/> occasion to return
      them <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">which is</add> Nothing unlikely. If you desire it,
     I<lb/> will instantly discontinue the correspondence. I ought never to<lb/> have commenced it,
     I know, without your consent, but<lb/> Hallie told me to, &amp; I wrote to please him,
     &amp; interest my friend<lb/> Moore. I will be guided by your decision. Shall I immediately
     cease<lb/> writing, or may I continue the correspondence in a reserved manner<add hand="h1"
      place="supralinear">?</add><lb/> subject to your supervision? Her letter is a very sensible
     one<lb/> but is not one twentieth part as pretty, or good as your beautiful<lb/> letters. By
     the Bye, how does Dora do? I consider her<lb/> my friend, as she is <hi rend="underline"
     >yours</hi>. How is her brother, Alexander? &amp;<lb/> what is he doing?</p>

    <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0514"/>
    <p> You spoke of certain remarks made while writing your<lb/> letter. Similar ones are being
     made now. One, Charlie Perky<lb/> says "That is rather fine writing for a soldier." Jack
     Pollock says<lb/> "he must be writing to his duck." Seth says "give her my best<lb/> wishes."
     Ben. Willson (spelled wrong) says, "I wish I was home with <hi rend="underline">my</hi>
     love"<lb/> "Charlie Campbell says "How I would like to draw mine to my <hi rend="underline"
      >throbbin</hi><lb/>
     <del hand="h1">bosik</del> <hi rend="underline">bosick</hi>." Dont you think we have a loving
     set?</p>
    <p> You remember Chauncey Corn, do you not? He is here in<lb/> the 29<hi rend="super">th</hi>
     and is now Orderly of Co. A. of that Regt. He was over here<lb/> a day or two since, and
     requested me to give you &amp; Laurie his<lb/> kind regards. Loren is here too in the same
     company.</p>
    <p> You ask me if we have plenty of reading here. We have<lb/> only the papers which come now
     and then, from which we<lb/> obtain the news. Home papers we are glad to see, but books
     can<lb/> not be easily carried, consequently it is better that they should<lb/> be reserved
     until we get home. Your kind offer to send me<lb/> some <add hand="h1" place="supralinear"
     >books</add> gratified me much, and I thank you very much for it</p>
    <p> Do any of <del hand="h1">my</del> <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">the</add> communications
     from "Julius" find their way<lb/> into print? I have not seen the C- since the 12<hi
      rend="super">th</hi> Inst.</p>
    <p> Why does Hallie not answer some of the numerous<lb/> letters which I have written him? Is he
     at home now? I<lb/> directed his letter to Warren.</p>
    <p> I guess Mr. Benton is not very anxious to hear<lb/> from me again, for I have not heard from
     him yet. I<lb/> wrote at his request, too.</p>
    <p> Is your Auntie well? and Laurie? How is Miss <unclear>Hegloss</unclear> now?<lb/> you must
     write me all interesting news.</p>
    <p> I must close as it is now <orig reg="tattoo">tatoo</orig> over in the 29th<lb/> and will soon
     be here, and we must all be in line.</p>
    <p> Write soon &amp; often to your</p>
    <closer>
