     <salute>My darling precious Charlie,</salute>
    </opener>


    <p> Will you forgive me for allowing one whole week to <unclear/> by without writing to thee
     when I know how much pleasure it affors you. Do not think darling that I have been
     volunintarily silent- far from it. Every day I have thought that another should not find you
     neglected, but the next would come followed by its usual work, which must be performed, and
      <unclear>finding one</unclear>, to all appearances as far from writing to you as the day
     preceding. Today I have sat down regardless of <unclear/> etc. determined that I will neglect
     you no longer.</p>
    <p> I have not heard from you since you wrote me of your severe illness from which you had not
     recovered and <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0256"/> naturally enough dread apprehensions
     fill my mind. Apprehensions that I dare not breathe. I <unclear/> a measure <unclear/> with the
     thought that if you were worse you would get some one to write me but I am fearful that you are
     worse and dred to let me know of it until you are better. If so darling one, let me entreat of
     you, as I often have done before and as you value any happi-ness, that you will inform me all
     about your health. I should so love to hear from you daily, aye, even hourly if could be, but I
     know the latter is impossible and the former nearly so. Nevertheless I would try and be content
     with hearing from you once a week if I could not hear from you oftener. </p>
    <p> Forgive me dearest if my letter has the appearance of being dictated by a complaining hear;
     let me assure you that it is only my love for you that causes my anxiety. I can not conceal it
     if I try ever so <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0257"/> hard, and I have tried <hi
      rend="underline">earnestly</hi> and,- as I expected I should- have failed. </p>
    <p> I can no longer conceal from thee dear, the suffering I have been compelled to endure since
     learning of you illness. Darling, let me urge you to speedily come <unclear/> home if possible,
     If I only was permitted to fill the sacred office of watching by you I should be happy, but
     even that is denied me, and I must- <unclear/> what art thou writing, has he not enough to
     suffer without sharing thy grief? Hush your complaints. </p>
    <p> The weather is cold and gloomy not a bright <unclear/> to be seen in the sky. A few snow
     flakes are stragging down as if fearful to tarry with us in this world of sorrow but then we
     need some gloomy weather, in order to fully appreciate the fair weather. <unclear/> weary I do
     get looking and seeing-what; Nothing but <unclear/> trees, ground covered <pb n="4"
      entity="DSSR_000000766_0258"/> snow, and dark frowning clouds. These all have a tendency to
     make me "bluer" than I otherwise should be. But- why I should, write so "bluish" to you is more
     than I can tell, I can not send this out till tomorrow so I will "lay it by" till evening. Good
     evening dearest, How art thou this cold evening. I trust your are not suffering from the cold
     even if we at the North do. I think I never "saw such sudden changes in the weather" as we have
     this winter. Yesterday morning when I arose it seemed more like a real refreshing spring
     morning, than like a morning in mid-winter. Every thing seemed so exhilarating, nothing seemed
     deficient except the joyous notes of the little birds, but towards <unclear/> the wind moved
     into the N.W. and today it has been very cold, so cold that as I breathe, little frosty
     particles collect </p>
