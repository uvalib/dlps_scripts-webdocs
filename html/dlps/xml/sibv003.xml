          <p>"BY COMMON CONSENT THE CONSTITUTION OF an author's text is the highest aim that a
            scholar can set before himself."<ref target="f003.01.01" n="1"><hi rend="super"
              >1</hi></ref> This, as one might guess, is the dictum of a classical scholar, and a
            classical scholar is far more acutely conscious than a student of the modern literatures
            that for over two thousand years the preservation and elucidation of the texts of the
            great writers have been the primary concern of literary study. Yet to many, and not to
            lay minds alone, textual criticism is an arid activity, almost synonymous with pedantry.
            Nevertheless, the text must be established before a just critical appraisal is possible,
            as a simple illustration will make clear.</p>
          <p>The 13th of Donne's <hi rend="italic">Holy Sonnets</hi> is one of the better known of
            his <hi rend="italic">Divine Poems</hi>. It begins, <q>
              <l>What if this present were the worlds last night?</l>
              <l>Marke in my heart, O Soule, where thou dost dwell,</l>
              <l>The picture of Christ crucified, and tell</l>
              <l>Whether that countenance can thee affright.</l>
            </q> In all the editions before Grierson's the poem concluded: <q>
              <l>so I say to thee</l>
              <l>To wicked spirits are horrid shapes assign'd,</l>
              <l>This beauteous form assumes a pitious mind,</l>
            </q> but Grierson, on the authority of the manuscripts, altered "assumes" to "assures."
            "Assumes" gives the poem the flatness of a geometrical demonstration, even though it
            might be argued that <pb n="003.004"/> the word would come naturally enough from one so
            soaked as Donne in the dialectic of scholastic philosophy. "Assures," on the other hand,
            alters the whole effect of the poem and brings it to the triumphant climax which Donne
            surely intended.</p>
          <p>The present disrepute of textual criticism, it would seem, arises from an excessive
            faith in our mechanical means of reproducing books. We take our texts on trust. Modern
            scholarship, Dr. R. W. Chapman has remarked, seems to proceed on the assumption that the
            texts of books published after 1700 are sound, or, if not, that "it is useless, if not
            improper, to correct them." But, he continues, "The first position has only to be stated
            to reveal its absurdity; every book, every newspaper, reminds us of human fallibility.
            The second position . . . arises from cowardice."<ref target="f003.01.02" n="2"><hi
                rend="super">2</hi></ref> Whether due to indifference or cowardice, textual
            corruption can go unchecked for a surprisingly long time, and can produce some very
            disconcerting results. Let me illustrate.</p>
          <p>A correspondent in <hi rend="italic">The Times Literary Supplement</hi> not long ago
            pointed out that the very titles of certain books, quite frequently reprinted, have been
            altered, and the original titles almost forgotten. How many readers of Dickens, for
            instance, know that <hi rend="italic">The Adventures of Oliver Twist: or, The Parish
              Boy's Progress</hi> is the title which the author gave his novel? And if title pages
            are so unreliable, what can be expected of the text? An examination of modern reprints
            of <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi> revealed widespread divergences from Sterne's
            final text: <q>Errors in punctuation amount on many pages to 15 to 20 to the page. . . .
              Modern reprints have frequently set in lower case words which Sterne required to be
              set in small capitals. Alterations in spelling have not been confined to
              modernizations; . . . errors destroying Sterne's sense and meaning have been
              perpetuated, like <hi rend="italic">area</hi> for <hi rend="italic">aera, clause</hi>
              for <hi rend="italic">cause, port</hi> for <hi rend="italic">post, timber</hi> for <hi
                rend="italic">tinder, catching</hi> for <hi rend="italic">catechising</hi>, and <hi
                rend="italic">caravans</hi> for <hi rend="italic">caverns</hi>.<ref
                target="f003.01.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref></q> Many of these errors
            apparently originated in some popular nineteenth-century reprint, and have been repeated
            ever since.</p>
          <p>Another class of book in which textual laxity is frequent is one in which,
            theoretically, it should be rarest: the textbook. Textbooks profess to be edited by
            competent scholars, and should <pb n="003.005"/> thus be in a class quite apart from the
            popular reprint, mass-produced as economically as possible. It would be easy to cite
            examples of indifferent, scissors-and-paste editing, and even of culpable carelessness,
            but it will be more effective to refer to books otherwise immune from the ordinary
            criticism of slipshod work. Within the past year or so two new college <hi rend="italic"
              >Shakespeares</hi> have appeared,<ref target="f003.01.04" n="4"><hi rend="super"
                >4</hi></ref> whose editors are perhaps the two most active and distinguished
            Shakespearian scholars in the country. For range and interest of material presented in
            introductions and notes, the two books are a marked improvement on anything previously
            available, and they are bound to exert a strong influence on the teaching of Shakespeare
            for a generation or so. Yet both reproduce the Globe text. It is not as if there had
            been no advances in the textual study of Shakespeare during the present century, nor are
            these two editors ignorant of the work of Pollard, McKerrow, Greg, and Dover Wilson; but
            is there any other branch of study in which a teacher would be satisfied to present
            students, as these books do, with the results achieved by scholarship up to, but not
            beyond, the year 1864?</p>
          <p>A third example may be given to show how neglect of textual matters may distort or
            nullify an argument. In a recent investigation into the origins and development of what
            we call the Victorian attitude of mind the Reverend Thomas Bowdler's <hi rend="italic"
              >Family Shakespeare</hi> almost inevitably came up for discussion. In <hi
              rend="italic">I Henry IV</hi>, it was alleged, Bowdler showed a certain squeamishness
            about Falstaff's oaths, though, rather surprisingly, he was somewhat erratic in his
            elimination of them. "Zounds," "'Sblood," "By the Lord," and "By the mass" are
            frequently omitted, and in one place "God" is replaced by "heaven."<ref
              target="f003.01.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> But such omissions and
            substitutions were not due to Bowdler at all. The more forcible expressions are all
            found, it is true, in most modern editions, and they also appear in the early quartos,
            but they do not appear in the First Folio. This half-hearted censorship of Shakespeare's
            text took place in the theatre, and was the result of the Act of 1606 which forbade the
            profane "use of the holy name of God or of Jesus Christ or of the Holy Ghost or of the
            Trinitie" <pb n="003.006"/> on the stage; Bowdler was merely working from an
            eighteenth-century text of Shakespeare based on the First Folio, and in actual fact did
            not concern himself in any way with Falstaff's oaths.</p>
          <p>If, then, we are aware of the value of textual studies, we must pay them more than lip
            service, and no scholar is properly trained unless he knows something of the mechanics
            of preparing a text. In the remarks which follow I shall confine myself to English texts
            from the period of the Renaissance onwards, that is, to the age of the printed book,
            since the texts of the manuscript age are to be the subject of another paper in this
            series. A distinction between the texts of the manuscript age and those of the age of
            the printed book is fully justified. I am aware, of course, that certain early texts and
            editions have survived in unique exemplars, and that the twelve surviving copies of the
            first edition of <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> contain ten different combinations of
            corrected and uncorrected sheets, so that such texts may present problems closely
            analogous to those of texts found only in manuscript. In the main, however, it is true
            to say that the printed book presents the text in a fixed and standardized form, whereas
            every manuscript is unique, and its value as an authority for the text must be
            separately investigated.</p>
          <p>Although there have been authors, from Ben Jonson in Shakespeare's day to Housman in
            our own, who have been extremely meticulous about the form in which their work has
            appeared in print, most of the conventions of English spelling and punctuation are the
            creation of printers and compositors, especially in the seventeenth century. Most
            authors, provided their words and sense have been accurately reproduced, have been
            content to have current printers' usage superimposed upon their writings. In other
            words, though a manuscript copied out fair to be sent to the publisher may represent the
            work in its final form as far as the author is concerned, it is not necessarily yet in
            the form in which it will be offered to the reader, or in which the author expects it to
            be offered. Thus Wordsworth sent the copy for the second edition of <hi rend="italic"
              >Lyrical Ballads</hi> to Humphry Davy, requesting him before the manuscript went to
            press to adjust the punctuation&mdash;"a business in which I am ashamed to say I am not
            adept." Similarly the manuscript of his <hi rend="italic">Ode on Intimations of
              Immortality</hi> (first published <pb n="003.007"/> in the <hi rend="italic"
              >Poems</hi> of 1807), which is in the handwriting of his sister-in-law Sara Hutchinson
            with notes and corrections in Wordsworth's hand, has had emphatic changes in
            capitalization and punctuation added, presumably by a reader at the publisher's.<ref
              target="f003.01.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> Coleridge's <hi rend="italic"
              >Friend</hi> may be cited for another example. The manuscript is extant, partly in
            Coleridge's hand, but mainly in Sara Hutchinson's. It was originally printed by a
            provincial printer at Penrith, with the result that the first edition reproduces many of
            the eccentricities of spelling, punctuation, italicization, and capitalization of
            Coleridge and his amanuensis. A few years later, when a revised edition was brought out
            in London, most of these eccentricities were normalized. By comparison with the edition
            of 1818 the original edition looks more like a piece of eighteenth than of
            nineteenth-century typography, but there is no shred of evidence that Coleridge
            concerned himself in any way with the typographical practice of either printer.</p>
          <p>Although authors have frequently shown no care for such <hi rend="italic"
            >minutiae</hi>, or "accidentals," as Dr. Greg calls them, they are of some concern to
            the editor, and his treatment of them will in large measure be determined by the nature
            of the edition he is preparing. For our purposes we may distinguish between three
            classes of editions: (1) the modern-spelling edition, (2) the old-spelling edition; and
            (3) the facsimile edition, sometimes called the diplomatic edition.<ref
              target="f003.01.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref></p>
          <p>There will always be, one hopes, editions in modern spelling of the major English
            authors since Spenser. Chaucer can only be modernized by altering his language, and
            Spenser, with his deliberately cultivated archaisms, is also separated from us by a
            linguistic gulf, narrow and easily crossed, but none the less real. But if ever the day
            comes when no modernized editions of Shakespeare and Donne and Milton are available to
            the general reader, <pb n="003.008"/> our cultural heritage will be in a sad state. The
            responsibility of the editor of a text in modern spelling is no less than that of him
            who edits in the old spelling; if anything, it is greater. Nor is the task any lighter;
            in fact, the editor of one such work, who had no modernized text already made for him,
            writes in his preface that the task of modernization had convinced him "that Elizabethan
            editors save themselves a vast deal of trouble and risk by adhering to the original
            spelling and punctuation."<ref target="f003.01.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref>
            Yet, in this particular case at least, the undertaking was well worth while, bringing as
            it did a great deal of otherwise inaccessible material within the range of the ordinary
            reader, who would have been easily repelled by the apparent remoteness and strangeness
            of the originals.</p>
          <p>The aim of the facsimile reprint is to provide the most accurate substitute for a rare
            original that typography can supply. Those who contemplate the preparation of such a
            text will find the principles to be followed set out in the "Rules for Editors" drawn up
            for the Malone Society. But with the development of cheap photographic processes the
            facsimile reprint will be less and less in demand, except on those occasions where it is
            desirable to furnish a <hi rend="italic">literatim</hi> transcript of a manuscript,
            either to preserve the peculiarities of an individual writer or to aid those unskilled
            in palaeography, as in a work like Greg's <hi rend="italic">English Literary
              Autographs</hi>, 1550-1650.</p>
          <p>The old-spelling text is of course requisite in any standard or definitive edition.
            After the copy-text has been chosen, the editor reproduces it faithfully except for such
            corrections as he finds it necessary to make. The copy-text will usually be either the
            first (authorized) edition, or the last to receive the author's revision; the editorial
            corrections will involve such matters as the elimination of misprints, the adjustment in
            poetry of faulty verse-lining, the correction of inadequate punctuation, the
            incorporation of manifestly superior (and authentic) readings from other editions, and
            the emendation of corrupt passages. The <hi rend="italic">rationale</hi> of such
            editorial procedure has been fully discussed and set forth by McKerrow and Greg, and one
            can usually find in their writings a solution for one's difficulties.<ref
              target="f003.01.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></p>
          <pb n="003.009"/>
          <p>Thanks to these and to other scholars, current editorial practice is fairly clearly
            defined, but I should like to emphasize that many editors will sooner or later find
            themselves face to face with problems or with materials that demand treatment different
            from that worked out by classical scholars or even by editors of Shakespeare, and I
            propose briefly to survey some of these and indicate their consequence for an
            editor.</p>
          <p>In recent years it has become clear that in the seventeenth century certain authors
            cared sufficiently for textual accuracy not to rest content with printed errata slips,
            but had manuscript corrections made in as many copies of their works as possible. Such
            autograph corrections by Sir Thomas Browne and Izaak Walton are now well known, but they
            were by no means the only authors to resort to this device. Even the plays of such minor
            court dramatists as Sir William Berkeley and Sir William Lower are known to contain
            manuscript corrections by or at the instigation of the authors, and editors should
            constantly be on the watch for other instances. Obviously such corrections are of the
            highest textual importance.</p>
          <p>Other classes of material throw light on the earlier history of a work, and no one,<ref
              target="f003.01.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> I fancy, will dispute the
            fact that one of the functions of a definitive edition is to illuminate as much as
            possible the origin and development of the work edited. Every student of the Romantic
            Period, for instance, knows something of the fascinating struggle for artistic
            perfection revealed by Keats's manuscripts, or of the information about the development
            of Wordsworth's thought and art furnished by the new Oxford edition. Many writers, too,
            have constantly revised their writings after the first publication; sometimes the extent
            of revision can be shown by recording the readings of the successive editions, but often
            the revisions are so thorough that there is no alternative but to print all the versions
            or, if not all, at least the first and final ones. Examples that come to mind
            immediately are Whitman's <pb n="003.010"/>
            <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, whose problems were discussed here several years
              ago,<ref target="f003.01.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> or Fitzgerald's
            successive versions of <hi rend="italic">The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</hi>. But these
            are by no means solitary instances. Among the Elizabethans, Daniel and Drayton revised
            throughout their careers. In the eighteenth century Pope wrote <hi rend="italic">The
              Rape of the Lock</hi> in two forms, and left two <hi rend="italic">Dunciads</hi>. In
            the nineteenth century both Wordsworth and Tennyson completely rewrote some of their
            early poems, and Coleridge reworked <hi rend="italic">The Rime of the Ancient
              Mariner</hi> from 1798 until his death. Nor are poets the only revisers. While English
            literature can scarcely furnish a parallel equal in interest and importance to the case
            of Montaigne's <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> in French, the two versions of Sidney's <hi
              rend="italic">Arcadia</hi>, the successive editions of Burton's <hi rend="italic"
              >Anatomy of Melancholy</hi>, and of Walton's <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi> involve
            problems scarcely less complex.</p>
          <p>The bulk of authors' manuscripts, first drafts, and work sheets that has survived may
            sometimes by very considerable indeed. The most famous of such documents is of course
            the collection of Milton's manuscripts preserved at Trinity College, Cambridge. But
            there is scarcely a major author since the beginning of the eighteenth century of whose
            work some manuscripts have not survived. Such materials are not necessarily of primary
            textual authority, since they may consist of early drafts, or the author may have made
            his final revisions in proof; but they can be of utmost importance in correcting the
            text, as a simple example will make clear. The epigraph to the second chapter of <hi
              rend="italic">The Heart of Midlothian</hi> consists of two stanzas from Prior's <hi
              rend="italic">The Thief and the Cordelier</hi>. In the novel one of the lines reads <q>
              <l>There the squire of the poet and knight of the post,</l>
            </q> which is nonsense. It should be <q>
              <l>There the squire of the pad and the knight of the post.</l>
            </q> This example is unusual, because there is the possibility of a double check. Not
            only do the texts of Prior give the right reading, but Scott's manuscript, which is
            extant, shows that he quoted the passage correctly. Nevertheless this printer's error
            was repeated in all editions until 1948.<ref target="f003.01.12" n="12"><hi rend="super"
                >12</hi></ref></p>
          <pb n="003.011"/>
          <p>Two other similar classes of material that have as yet been scarcely used by editors
            should also be noticed: printer's copy and author's proofs. Printer's copy and
            proof-sheets have both survived from as early as the fifteenth century; in neither of
            these instances, however, was the author involved. But even a brief enumeration of some
            of the surviving manuscripts which were sent by the authors to the press is an
            impressive one, including as it does Book I of Hooker's <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical
              Polity</hi>, part of Sir John Harington's translation of Ariosto's <hi rend="italic"
              >Orlando Furioso</hi>, Book I of <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, Pope's <hi
              rend="italic">Essay on Criticism</hi>, the second edition of <hi rend="italic">Lyrical
              Ballads</hi>, and Wordsworth's <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> of 1807. The Bodleian
            manuscript of Herbert's <hi rend="italic">Temple</hi>, though not sent to the press, is
            the one bearing the <hi rend="italic">imprimatur</hi> of the official licenser, and is
            therefore of textual authority at least equal to that of the first edition. Of author's
            proofs I know of no actual examples earlier than some of Dr. Johnson's in the R. B. Adam
            Collection, and the earliest I happen myself to have examined were of works by Hazlitt
            and Scott, but there must be many others in existence awaiting full examination by
            interested scholars.</p>
          <p>A further class of material offering editorial problems of its own is to be found in
            those manuscripts, such as letters, diaries, and notebooks, which were never prepared
            for the press by the authors, and were never intended for the press. Editors, and
            especially biographer-editors, have allowed themselves a latitude in handling such
            materials that varies all the way from a naive desire to safeguard the hero's dignity to
            flagrant dishonesty. One of the earliest writers to suffer from such editorial
            ineptitude was Donne. His son in editing his letters not only showed extreme
            carelessness over dates and addresses but, it is now known, altered the names of those
            to whom the letters were written, presumably in order to suggest that he had access to a
            much greater volume of his father's correspondence than in fact he had.<ref
              target="f003.01.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> Even Walton was not above
            tampering with Donne's letters, so that on one occasion he strung together excerpts from
            five different letters, clapped a date on the end, and presented the result as a single
              epistle.<ref target="f003.01.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref> My colleague
            Professor W. M. Sale tells me that Samuel <pb n="003.012"/> Richardson's letters were
            similarly mishandled by Mrs. Barbauld, and other examples from eighteenth and
            nineteenth-century biographies could doubtless be found with little difficulty.</p>
          <p>Many of these earlier editorial mutilations are explicable in terms of the standards of
            their age. Two of Donne's letters seem to have survived only in the opening and close;
            the intermediate news or business communication, or whatever it was, has been
              omitted.<ref target="f003.01.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> His
            contemporaries were interested in the elegance of Donne's epistolary style and the
            ingenuity of his compliments more than in the details of his personal relations with his
            friends. Nineteenth-century taboos were responsible for a different kind of excision
            altogether; witness those, for instance, in the early editions of Lamb's letters. One
            recalls how Lamb wrote to Thomas Manning about the little book on honours and dignities
            which he had written for children,<ref target="f003.01.16" n="16"><hi rend="super"
                >16</hi></ref> and how in the course of it he had envisaged himself advancing
            through all the degrees of the peerage, concluding with "Duke Lamb." <q>It would look
              like quibbling [he continued] to carry it on further . . . otherwise I have sometimes
              in my dreams imagined myself still advancing, as 9th, King Lamb; 10th, Emperor Lamb;
              11th, Pope Innocent, higher than which is nothing upon earth.</q> At least, that is
            what appeared in the nineteenth-century editions; what Lamb actually wrote was "higher
            than which is nothing but the Lamb of God."</p>
          <p>Coleridge, who left behind him vast stores of marginalia, notes, scattered papers, and
            other <hi rend="italic">disjecta membra</hi>, has given much trouble to his editors.
            Henry Nelson Coleridge, who edited the <hi rend="italic">Literary Remains</hi>, did some
            very strange things with his uncle's writings, though he was attempting in all sincerity
            to impose some order on chaos, and to show his uncle to best advantage. Ernest Hartley
            Coleridge, in editing the series of extracts from the notebooks entitled <hi
              rend="italic">Anima Poetae</hi>, had similar problems to face. Not only was the family
            still reluctant to reveal the extent of Coleridge's disagreement with his wife and his
            attachment for Sara Hutchinson (which entailed various excisions), but the compressed
            form of many of the notes, with their disregard for <pb n="003.013"/> ordinary rules of
            syntax, to say nothing of their highly individual punctuation and capitalization,
            produced numerous additional difficulties. Here are two brief examples of E. H.
            Coleridge's editorial procedure. In each case the passage is transcribed as accurately
            as possible from the original, and then followed by the corresponding passage in <hi
              rend="italic">Anima Poetae</hi>.</p>
          <q>
            <p>A new year&mdash;the old Wants/ The new from God, the old our own/ . . .</p>
            <p>Time&mdash;3 fold&mdash;Future slow&mdash;Present swift&mdash;Past

              rein in the Flyer&mdash;No Regret set in motion the Stationary&mdash;would'st be
              happy, take the Delayer for thy counsellor, do not choose the Flyer for thy Friend,
              nor the ever-remainer for thy Enemy&mdash;</p> (Notebook viii, p. 3)<lb/>
            <p>The old world begins a new year. That is <hi rend="italic">ours</hi>, but this is
              from God.</p>
            <p>We may think of time as threefold. Slowly comes the Future, swift the Present passes
              by, but the Past is unmoveable. No impatience will quicken the loiterer; no terror, no
              delight rein in the flyer, and no regret set in motion the stationary. Wouldst be
              happy, take the delayer for thy counsellor; do not choose the flyer for thy friend,
              nor the ever-remainer for thine enemy.</p> (<hi rend="italic">Anima Poetae</hi>, p. 22)<lb/>
            <p>Reviewers resemble often the English Jury and the Italian Conclave, that they are

            <p>Pope like an old Lark who tho' he leaves off soaring &amp; singing in the height, yet
              has his <hi rend="italic">Spurs</hi> grow longer &amp; sharper, the older he

            <p>Reviewers resemble often the English jury and the Italian conclave, they are
              incapable of eating till they have condemned or craned.</p>
            <p>The Pope [may be compared to] an old lark, who, though he leaves off soaring and
              singing in the height, yet has his spurs grow longer and sharper the older he
              grows.</p> (<hi rend="italic">Anima Poetae</hi>, p. 223)<lb/>
          </q>
          <p>In the first passage I suspect that E. H. Coleridge misread "Wants" as "world," as it
            is difficult otherwise to account for the rephrasing; in the second he was certainly
            baffled by "crowned," which he rendered by the unintelligible "craned". But the two
            notes in the second extract are interesting for another misconception, which would
            positively have delighted Coleridge, who was always <pb n="003.014"/> fascinated by the
            workings of the principle of the association of ideas. In writing the first of the two
            notes Coleridge's mind went from the notion of juries condemning before eating to the
            line in <hi rend="italic">The Rape of the Lock</hi>, <q>
              <l>And wretches hang that juryman may dine,</l>
            </q> and thence to its author, who became the subject of the next note; his grandson's
            mind, on the other hand, was caught by the phrase "Italian conclave," and he therefore
            interpreted the succeeding note as referring to the pontiff instead of the poet.</p>
          <p>E. H. Coleridge was for many years a schoolmaster, and his procedure with the text of
            the notebooks resembles that of a conscientious instructor correcting a carelessly
            written schoolboy exercise. He believed, no doubt, that he was only doing what was
            needful to remove unnecessary stumbling blocks from the path of a reader, and he was
            preparing a book for the general reader rather than the scholar. But notions of
            editorial responsibility have changed within the last fifty years, and such manipulation
            of the text is contrary to modern standards. Editors of comparatively recent material
            will, no doubt, always have to make excisions out of regard to the susceptibilities of
            the family and friends of the author, but what they do print will be printed with
            scrupulous fidelity to the wording of the original, and there will be some statement as
            to the nature and extent of any necessary omissions.</p>
          <p>The problem of fidelity to the minuter details of the author's text&mdash;to the
            "accidentals"&mdash;is a more difficult one and depends, in the last resort, on the
            editor's taste and judgment. It is worth bearing in mind, I think, that there is a real
            gain in consulting, wherever possible, the reader's convenience. Mr. Harold Williams, in
            his recent edition of Swift's Journal to Stella, reproduces faithfully Swift's "little
            language" from such of the letters as have survived in manuscript, with the exception
            that Swift's "th" and "te" become "the," "y" and "yo" becomes "you," and "yr" and "yrs"
            become "your" and "yours." The consequent gain in legibility is considerable, as may be
            seen by comparison with the edition which prints these forms as Swift wrote them. As Mr.
            Williams points out in his preface: <q>In these days, when the art of photography has
              been enlisted in the student's service, the attempt to reproduce in print
              insignificant orthographical peculiarities <pb n="003.015"/> has less meaning than it
              once had. The result can never be wholly satisfactory, and it may only repel or
              distract the reader.</q> Again, Professor Vinaver's edition of Malory, the most
            exciting piece of literary scholarship of the past decade, is not least so because the
            editor has made Malory so much easier to read in the original text than ever before.
            Compare any page of this edition with the corresponding passage in Oskar Sommer's and
            the difference will be apparent at a glance. The paragraphing, the re-punctuation, and
            the setting of the dialogue in the manner of the modern novel are all introduced without
            any compromising of editorial integrity, and the gain to the reader who is not primarily
            a mediaevalist is enormous.</p>
          <p>A less successful solution of some of these problems is exemplified in the edition
            recently published of Melville's <hi rend="italic">Billy Budd</hi>. Two pages of the
            original manuscript are reproduced, so that a measure of comparison with the printed
            text is possible. Melville's spelling, we are told, has been corrected "to modern
            American usage," and any editorial insertions in the text are enclosed within pointed
            brackets (instead of the more usual square ones). Thus the editor conceals the fact that
            Melville used such spellings as "Judgement," "fellow-man," "innocense," and
            "respectivly" (though the last two may have been mere slips of the pen), but if Melville
            neglected to close quotations marks or to add a period at the end of a paragraph, the
            fact is forcibly brought to our notice by means of pointed brackets. It would be of
            little value, no doubt, to record that the <hi rend="italic">um</hi> of "circumstances"
            is two minims short, but Melville's characteristic spellings are not without interest,
            while his careless omission of occasional punctuation marks is of far less significance
            and their silent editorial correction would have been perfectly proper.</p>
          <p>Further, the textual notes are insufficient to permit an adequate reconstruction of the
            original. One discovers, after some initial bewilderment, that what are referred to as
            "variants" are in fact words and phrases that have been deleted and on second thoughts
            replaced by others; words and phrases said to have been "omitted" are those which in
            revision were <hi rend="italic">added</hi>, very often above a caret mark. Nor is there
            any attempt in the notes to distinguish the various stages of revision. In the phrase
            "he could never convert," <pb n="003.016"/> "could" is above the line in ink over a
            caret mark, but the fact is not recorded; in the phrase "without first performing,"
            "first" is above the line in ink over a caret mark, and here it is recorded as "<hi
              rend="italic">om.</hi>" In the phrase "that hitherto has stood in human record,"
            Melville first wrote in ink "that stands in human record," then altered it in pencil to
            "that hitherto has stood in authoritative record," but finally deleted "authoritative"
            and restored "human." The textual note here merely cites the phrase "that stands in
            authoritative record" as the "variant" of the final form, thus telescoping two steps in
            the process of revision into one. Thus an editor, however well intentioned, by departing
            from established conventions and inadequately describing the state of his original, can
            confuse more than he aids the reader, and a student wishing to make a close study of
            Melville's method of composition in this tale is still unable to do so without recourse
            to the original manuscript.</p>
          <p>Though it is a function of the editor to aid the reader wherever he can, it is scarcely
            possible to condone the practice of the editors of <hi rend="italic">The Oxford Book of
              Seventeenth Century Verse:</hi>
            <q>Where words or lines might seem ugly to modern eyes [they write], or where a
              difference in usage might lead to ambiguity, we have substituted simpler forms, always
              taking care (we believe) that the substituted form <hi rend="italic">was actually in
                use during the seventeenth century</hi>.</q> This, though the editors disavow it, is
            really normalization. One used to get Old English texts normalized to standard West
            Saxon of about 1000 A.D., and even normalized texts of Chaucer. But happily such a
            practice is out of favour nowadays, for editors know that not until the eighteenth
            century was normalization imposed on English orthography, and then by printers rather
            than authors.<ref target="f003.01.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref></p>
          <p>There is, however, a real difference between normalization and the expansion of
            contractions, or the attempt to reproduce in type scribal peculiarities outside the
            range of the printer's case. The value of the facsimile reprint, in other words, is
            strictly limited, and photographic aids are diminishing its usefulness. Hence, as a
            literary student&mdash;as distinct from the historian or the palaeographer&mdash;<pb
              n="003.017"/>I deplore the over-meticulous habit of printing legal records and other
            old documents with all their contractions, or with the contractions expanded in italics.
            The silent expansion of contractions is but a courtesy to the reader. Actually, many of
            these documents ought merely to be described and summarized, with a few of the important
            phrases quoted; the class of document to which the example belongs may be indicated, if
            necessary, through reference to historical source books or to formularies.</p>
          <p>Many of the processes in the preparation of a text, such as transcription, collation,
            and even proof-correction, involve, it must be admitted, much sheer drudgery, and unlike
            some other forms of drudgery they cannot be delegated. They are exacting, and they
            demand the unremitting concentration of a highly trained mind. But the less they show
            the better; the text's the thing, not the textual notes; and this is perhaps the final
            principle that an editor would do well to bear in mind. If he has been brought to his
            task by enthusiasm for an author or a book, he will wish above all things by his work to
            pass on that enthusiasm. We may fitly conclude with some other words of the classical
            scholar with whom we began: <q>A man is led by some feeling of kinship for what is
              greater than himself to devote his life to the interpretation of a poet, philosopher,
              or historian, to the elucidation of the language itself on its purely linguistic side,
              or to that of the art or institutions of antiquity. Such a man will freely give
              himself up to the most arid and laborious investigations. No erasure in a manuscript,
              no half-read scholium, no fragmentary inscription will seem unworthy of his attention;
              no grammatical nicety or stylistic peculiarity will be passed by as too trivial for
              his patient study. All these things will live in his hands; for they are all
              transformed by his faith in something to which he can hardly give a name, but which,
              to him, is more real than anything else.<ref target="f003.01.18" n="18"><hi

            <p>The term "diplomatic edition" is so loosely employed that, pending more precise
              definition and agreement on its meaning, its use is better avoided. It has been
              employed to cover anything from an edition which consistently adopts the readings of a
              single text or manuscript to one which reproduces a particular text with extreme
              scrupulosity, down to every contraction and error, even, in the case of printed texts,
              to turned letters and irregular spacing. In the discussion following the reading of
              this paper it was suggested that whereas a facsimile reprint was a page-for-page and
              line-for-line reprint, a diplomatic edition was not, but I cannot feel certain that
              this distinction can be made to hold.</p>

          <head/>
          <p>WHEN, IN HIS EDITION OF NASHE, McKERROW invented the term 'copy-text', he was merely
            giving a name to a conception already familiar, and he used it in a general sense to
            indicate that early text of a work which an editor selected as the basis of his own.
            Later, as we shall see, he gave it a somewhat different and more restricted meaning. It
            is this change in conception and its implications that I wish to consider.</p>
          <p>The idea of treating some one text, usually of course a manuscript, as possessing
            over-riding authority originated among classical scholars, though something similar may
            no doubt be traced in the work of biblical critics. So long as purely eclectic methods
            prevailed, any preference for one manuscript over another, if it showed itself, was of
            course arbitrary; but when, towards the middle of last century, Lachmann and others
            introduced the genealogical classification of manuscripts as a principle of textual
            criticism, this appeared to provide at least some scientific basis for the conception of
            the most authoritative text. The genealogical method was the greatest advance ever made
            in this field, but its introduction was not unaccompanied by error. For lack of logical
            analysis, it led, at the hands of its less discriminating exponents, to an attempt to
            reduce textual criticism to a code of mechanical rules. There was just this much excuse,
            that the method did make it possible to sweep away mechanically a great deal of rubbish.
            What its more hasty devotees failed to understand, or at any rate sufficiently to bear
            in mind, was that authority is never absolute, but only relative. Thus a school arose,
            mainly in Germany, that <pb n="003.020"/> taught that if a manuscript could be shown to
            be generally more correct than any other and to have descended from the archetype
            independently of other lines of transmission, it was 'scientific' to follow its readings
            whenever they were not manifestly impossible. It was this fallacy that Housman exposed
            with devastating sarcasm. He had only to point out that 'Chance and the common course of
            nature will not bring it to pass that the readings of a ms are right wherever they are
            possible and impossible wherever they are wrong'.<ref target="f003.02.01" n="1"><hi
                rend="super">1</hi></ref> That if a scribe makes a mistake he will inevitably
            produce nonsense is the tacit and wholly unwarranted assumption of the school in
              question,<ref target="f003.02.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> and it is one
            that naturally commends itself to those who believe themselves capable of distinguishing
            between sense and nonsense, but who know themselves incapable of distinguishing between
            right and wrong. Unfortunately the attractions of a mechanical method misled many who
            were capable of better things.</p>
          <p>There is one important respect in which the editing of classical texts differs from
            that of English. In the former it is the common practice, for fairly obvious reasons, to
            normalize the spelling, so that (apart from emendation) the function of an editor is
            limited to choosing between those manuscript readings that offer significant variants.
            In English it is now usual to preserve the spelling of the earliest or it may be some
            other selected text. Thus it will be seen that the conception of 'copy-text' does not
            present itself to the classical and to the English editor in quite the same way; indeed,
            if I am right in the view I am about to put forward, the classical theory of the 'best'
            or 'most authoritative' manuscript, whether it be held in a reasonable or in an
            obviously fallacious form, has really nothing to do with the English theory of
            'copy-text' at all.</p>
          <p>I do not wish to argue the case of 'old spelling' <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> 'modern
            spelling'; I accept the view now prevalent among English scholars. But I cannot avoid
            some reference to the ground on which <pb n="003.021"/> present practice is based, since
            it is intimately connected with my own views on copy-text. The former practice of
            modernizing the spelling of English works is no longer popular with editors, since
            spelling is now recognized as an essential characteristic of an author, or at least of
            his time and locality. So far as my knowledge goes, the alternative of normalization has
            not been seriously explored, but its philological difficulties are clearly
              considerable.<ref target="f003.02.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> Whether,
            with the advance of linguistic science, it will some day be possible to establish a
            standard spelling for a particular period or district or author, or whether the
            historical circumstances in which our language has developed must always forbid any
            attempt of the sort (at any rate before comparatively recent times) I am not competent
            to say; but I agree with what appears to be the general opinion that such an attempt
            would at present only result in confusion and misrepresentation. It is therefore the
            modern editorial practice to choose whatever extant text may be supposed to represent
            most nearly what the author wrote and to follow it with the least possible alteration.
            But here we need to draw a distinction between the significant, or as I shall call them
            'substantive', readings of the text, those namely that affect the author's meaning or
            the essence of his expression, and others, such in general as spelling, punctuation,
            word-division, and the like, affecting mainly its formal presentation, which may be
            regarded as the accidents, or as I shall call them 'accidentals', of the text.<ref
              target="f003.02.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> The distinction is not
            arbitrary or theoretical, but has an immediate bearing on textual criticism, for scribes
            (or compositors) may in general be expected to react, and experience shows that they
            generally do react, differently to the two categories. As regards substantive readings
            their aim may be assumed to be to reproduce exactly those of their copy, though they
            will doubtless sometimes depart from them accidentally and may <pb n="003.022"/> even,
            for one reason or another, do so intentionally: as regards accidentals they will
            normally follow their own habits or inclination, though they may, for various reasons
            and to varying degrees, be influenced by their copy. Thus a contemporary manuscript will
            at least preserve the spelling of the period, and may even retain some of the author's
            own, while it may at the same time depart frequently from the wording of the original:
            on the other hand a later transcript of the same original may reproduce the wording with
            essential accuracy while completely modernizing the spelling. Since, then, it is only on
            grounds of expediency, and in consequence either of philological ignorance or of
            linguistic circumstances, that we select a particular original as our copy-text, I
            suggest that it is only in the matter of accidentals that we are bound (within reason)
            to follow it, and that in respect of substantive readings we have exactly the same
            liberty (and obligation) of choice as has a classical editor, or as we should have were
            it a modernized text that we were preparing.<ref target="f003.02.05" n="5"><hi
                rend="super">5</hi></ref></p>
          <p>But the distinction has not been generally recognized, and has never, so far as I am
            aware, been explicitly drawn.<ref target="f003.02.06" n="6"><hi rend="super"
              >6</hi></ref> This is not surprising. The battle between 'old spelling' and 'modern
            spelling' was fought out over works written for the most part between 1550 and 1650, and
            for which the original authorities are therefore as a rule printed editions. Now printed
            editions usually form an ancestral series, in which each is derived from its immediate
            predecessor; whereas the extant manuscripts of any work have usually only a collateral
            relationship, each being derived from the original independently, or more or less
            independently, of the others. Thus in the case of printed books, and in the absence of
            revision in a later edition, it is normally the first edition alone that can claim
            authority, and this authority naturally extends to substantive readings and accidentals
            alike. There was, therefore, <pb n="003.023"/> little to force the distinction upon the
            notice of editors of works of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and it apparently
            never occurred to them that some fundamental difference of editorial method might be
            called for in the rare cases in which a later edition had been revised by the author or
            in which there existed more than one 'substantive' edition of comparable authority.<ref
              target="f003.02.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> Had they been more familiar
            with works transmitted in manuscript, they might possibly have reconsidered their
            methods and been led to draw the distinction I am suggesting. For although the
            underlying principles of textual criticism are, of course, the same in the case of works
            transmitted in manuscripts and in print, particular circumstances differ, and certain
            aspects of the common principles may emerge more clearly in the one case than in the
            other. However, since the idea of copy-text originated and has generally been applied in
            connexion with the editing of printed books, it is such that I shall mainly consider,
            and in what follows reference may be understood as confined to them unless manuscripts
            are specifically mentioned.</p>
          <p>The distinction I am proposing between substantive readings and accidentals, or at any
            rate its relevance to the question of copy-text, was clearly not present to McKerrow's
            mind when in 1904 he published the second volume of his edition of the Works of Thomas
            Nashe, which included <hi rend="italic">The Unfortunate Traveller</hi>. Collation of the
            early editions of this romance led him to the conclusion that the second, advertised on
            the title as 'Newly corrected and augmented', had in fact been revised by the author,
            but at the same time that not all the alterations could with certainty be ascribed to
              him.<ref target="f003.02.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> He nevertheless
            proceeded to enunciate the rule that 'if an editor has reason to suppose that a certain
            text embodies later corrections than any other, and at the same time has no ground for
            disbelieving that these corrections, <hi rend="italic">or some of them at <pb
                n="003.024"/> least</hi>, are the work of the author, he has no choice but to make
            that text the basis of his reprint'.<ref target="f003.02.09" n="9"><hi rend="super"
                >9</hi></ref> The italics are mine.<ref target="f003.02.10" n="10"><hi rend="super"
                >10</hi></ref> This is applying with a vengeance the principle that I once
            approvingly described as 'maintaining the integrity of the copy-text'. But it must be
            pointed out that there are in fact two quite distinct principles involved. One, put in
            more general form, is that if, for whatever reason, a particular authority be on the
            whole preferred, an editor is bound to accept all its substantive readings (if not
            manifestly impossible). This is the old fallacy of the 'best text', and may be taken to
            be now generally rejected. The other principle, also put in general form, is that
            whatever particular authority be preferred, whether as being revised or as generally
            preserving the substantive readings more faithfully than any other, it must be taken as
            copy-text, that is to say that it must also be followed in the matter of accidentals.
            This is the principle that interests us at the moment, and it is one that McKerrow
            himself came, at least partly, to question.</p>
          <p>In 1939 McKerrow published his <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena for the Oxford
              Shakespeare</hi>, and he would not have been the critic he was if his views had not
            undergone some changes in the course of thirty-five years. One was in respect of
            revision. He had come to the opinion that to take a reprint, even a revised reprint, as
            copy-text was indefensible. Whatever may be the relation of a particular substantive
            edition to the author's manuscript (provided that there is any transcriptional link at
            all) it stands to reason that the relation of a reprint of that edition must be more
            remote. If then, putting aside all question of revision, a particular substantive
            edition has an over-riding claim to be taken as copy-text, to displace it in favour of a
            reprint, whether revised or not, means receding at least one step further from the
            author's original in so far as the general form of the text is concerned.<ref
              target="f003.02.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> Some such considerations
            must have been in McKerrow's mind when he wrote (<hi rend="italic">Prolegomena</hi>, pp.
            17-18): 'Even if, however, we were to assure <pb n="003.025"/> ourselves . . . that
            certain corrections found in a later edition of a play were of Shakespearian authority,
            it would not by any means follow that that edition should be used as the copy-text of a
              reprint.<ref target="f003.02.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> It would
            undoubtedly be necessary to incorporate these corrections in our text, but . . . it
            seems evident that . . . this later edition will (except for the corrections) deviate
            more widely than the earliest print from the author's original manuscript. . . . [Thus]
            the nearest approach to our ideal . . . will be produced by using the earliest "good"
            print as copy-text and inserting into it, from the first edition which contains them,
            such corrections as appear to us to be derived from the author.' This is a clear
            statement of the position, and in it he draws exactly the distinction between
            substantive readings (in the form of corrections) and accidentals (or general texture)
            on which I am insisting. He then, however, relapsed into heresy in the matter of the
            substantive readings. Having spoken, as above, of the need to introduce 'such
            corrections as appear to us to be derived from the author', he seems to have feared
            conceding too much to eclecticism, and he proceeded: 'We are not to regard the
            "goodness" of a reading in and by itself, or to consider whether it appeals to our
            aesthetic sensibilities or not; we are to consider whether a particular edition taken
              <hi rend="italic">as a whole</hi> contains variants from the edition from which it was
            otherwise printed which could not reasonably be attributed to an ordinary
            press-corrector, but by reason of their style, point, and what we may call inner harmony
            with the spirit of the play as a whole, seem likely to be the work of the author: and
            once having decided this to our satisfaction we must accept <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
            the alterations of that edition, saving any which seem obvious blunders or misprints.'
            We can see clearly enough what he had in mind, namely that the evidence of correction
            (under which head he presumably intended to include revision) must be considered <hi
              rend="italic">as a whole</hi>; but he failed to add the equally important proviso that
            the alterations must also be <hi rend="italic">of a piece</hi> (and not, as in <hi
              rend="italic">The Unfortunate Traveller</hi>, of apparently disparate origin) before
            we can be called upon to accept them <hi rend="italic">all</hi>. As he states it his
            canon is open to exactly the same objections as the 'most authoritative manuscript'
            theory in classical editing.</p>
          <p>McKerrow was, therefore, in his later work quite conscious <pb n="003.026"/> of the
            distinction between substantive readings and accidentals, in so far as the problem of
            revision is concerned. But he never applied the conception to cases in which we have
            more than one substantive text, as in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and perhaps in 2 <hi
              rend="italic">Henry IV, Troilus and Cressida</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>.
            Presumably he would have argued that since faithfulness to the wording of the author was
            one of the criteria he laid down for determining the choice of the copy-text, it was an
            editor's duty to follow its substantive readings with a minimum of interference.</p>
          <p>We may assume that neither McKerrow nor other editors of the conservative school
            imagined that such a procedure would always result in establishing the authentic text of
            the original; what they believed was that from it less harm would result than from
            opening the door to individual choice among variants, since it substituted an objective
            for a subjective method of determination. This is, I think, open to question. It is
            impossible to exclude individual judgement from editorial procedure: it operates of
            necessity in the all-important matter of the choice of copy-text and in the minor one of
            deciding what readings are possible and what not; why, therefore, should the choice
            between possible readings be withdrawn from its competence? Uniformity of result at the
            hands of different editors is worth little if it means only uniformity in error; and it
            may not be too optimistic a belief that the judgement of an editor, fallible as it must
            necessarily be, is likely to bring us closer to what the author wrote than the
            enforcement of an arbitrary rule.</p>
          <p>The true theory is, I contend, that the copy-text should govern (generally) in the
            matter of accidentals, but that the choice between substantive readings belongs to the
            general theory of textual criticism and lies altogether beyond the narrow principle of
            the copy-text. Thus it may happen that in a critical edition the text rightly chosen as
            copy may not by any means be the one that supplies most substantive readings in cases of
            variation. The failure to make this distinction and to apply this principle has
            naturally led to too close and too general a reliance upon the text chosen as basis for
            an edition, and there has arisen what may be called the tyranny of the copy-text, a
            tyranny that has, in my opinion, vitiated much of the best editorial work of the past
            generation.</p>
          <pb n="003.027"/>
          <p>I will give a couple of examples of the sort of thing I mean that I have lately come
            across in the course of my own work. They are all the more suitable as illustrations
            since they occur in texts edited by scholars of recognized authority, neither of whom is
            particularly subject to the tyranny in question. One is from the edition of Marlowe's
              <hi rend="italic">Doctor Faustus</hi> by Professor F. S. Boas (1932). The editor,
            rightly I think, took the so-called B-text (1616) as the basis of his own, correcting it
            where necessary by comparison with the A-text (1604).<ref target="f003.02.13" n="13"><hi
                rend="super">13</hi></ref> Now a famous line in Faustus's opening soliloquy runs in
            1604, <q>
              <l>Bid <hi rend="italic">Oncaym&oelig;on</hi> farewell, <hi rend="italic">Galen</hi>
                come</l>
            </q> and in 1616, <q>
              <l>Bid <hi rend="italic">Oeconomy</hi> farewell; and <hi rend="italic">Galen</hi> come
                . . .</l>
            </q> Here <hi rend="italic">Oncaym&oelig;on</hi> is now recognized as standing for <hi
              rend="italic">on cay m&oelig; on</hi> or &oragr;&ngr; &Kgr;&agr;&igragr;
            &mgr;&eegragr; &oragr;&ngr;: but this was not understood at the time, and <hi
              rend="italic">Oeconomy</hi> was substituted in reprints of the A-text in 1609 and
            1611, and thence taken over by the B-text. The change, however, produced a rather
            awkward line, and in 1616 the <hi rend="italic">and</hi> was introduced as a metrical
            accommodation. In the first half of the line Boas rightly restored the reading implied
            in A; but in the second half he retained, out of deference to his copy-text, the <hi
              rend="italic">and</hi> whose only object was to accommodate the reading he had
            rejected in the first. One could hardly find a better example of the contradictions to
            which a mechanical following of the copy-text may lead.<ref target="f003.02.14" n="14"
                ><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref></p>
          <p>My other instance is from <hi rend="italic">The Gipsies Metamorphosed</hi> as edited by
            Dr. Percy Simpson among the masques of Ben Jonson in 1941. He took as his copy-text the
            Huntington manuscript, and I entirely agree with his choice. In this, and in Simpson's
            edition, a line of the ribald Cock Lorel ballad runs (sir-reverence!), <q>
              <l>All w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> he blewe away with a fart</l>
            </q>
            <pb n="003.028"/> whereas for <hi rend="italic">blewe</hi> other authorities have <hi
              rend="italic">flirted</hi>. Now, the meaning of <hi rend="italic">flirted</hi> is not
            immediately apparent, for no appropriate sense of the word is recorded. There is,
            however, a rare use of the substantive <hi rend="italic">flirt</hi> for a sudden gust of
            wind, and it is impossible to doubt that this is what Jonson had in mind, for no scribe
            or compositor could have invented the reading <hi rend="italic">flirted</hi>. It follows
            that in the manuscript <hi rend="italic">blewe</hi> is nothing but the conjecture of a
            scribe who did not understand his original: only the mesmeric influence of the copy-text
            could obscure so obvious a fact.<ref target="f003.02.15" n="15"><hi rend="super"
              >15</hi></ref></p>
          <p>I give these examples merely to illustrate the kind of error that, in modern editions
            of English works, often results from undue deference to the copy-text. This reliance on
            one particular authority results from the desire for an objective theory of
            text-construction and a distrust, often no doubt justified, of the operation of
            individual judgement. The attitude may be explained historically as a natural and
            largely salutary reaction against the methods of earlier editors. Dissatisfied with the
            results of eclectic freedom and reliance on personal taste, critics sought to establish
            some sort of mechanical apparatus for dealing with textual problems that should lead to
            uniform results independent of the operator. Their efforts were not altogether
            unattended by success. One result was the recognition of the general worthlessness of
            reprints. And even in the more difficult field of manuscript transmission it is true
            that formal rules will carry us part of the way: they can at least effect a preliminary
            clearing of the ground. This I sought to show in my essay on <hi rend="italic">The
              Calculus of Variants</hi> (1927); but in the course of investigation it became clear
            that there is a definite limit to the field over which formal rules are applicable.
            Between readings of equal extrinsic authority no rules of the sort can decide, since by
            their very nature it is only to extrinsic relations that they are relevant. The choice
            is necessarily a matter for editorial judgement, and an editor who declines or is unable
            to exercise his judgement and falls back on some arbitrary canon, such as the authority
            of the copy-text, is in fact abdicating his editorial function. Yet this is what has
            been frequently commended as 'scientific'&mdash;'streng wissenschaftlich' in the
            prevalent <pb n="003.029"/> idiom&mdash;and the result is that what many editors have
            done is to produce, not editions of their authors' works at all, but only editions of
            particular authorities for those works, a course that may be perfectly legitimate in
            itself, but was not the one they were professedly pursuing.</p>
          <p>This by way, more or less, of digression. At the risk of repetition I should like to
            recapitulate my view of the position of copy-text in editorial procedure. The thesis I
            am arguing is that the historical circumstances of the English language make it
            necessary to adopt in formal matters the guidance of some particular early text. If the
            several extant texts of a work form an ancestral series, the earliest will naturally be
            selected, and since this will not only come nearest to the author's original in
            accidentals, but also (revision apart) most faithfully preserve the correct readings
            where substantive variants are in question, everything is straightforward, and the
            conservative treatment of the copy-text is justified. But whenever there is more than
            one substantive text of comparable authority,<ref target="f003.02.16" n="16"><hi
                rend="super">16</hi></ref> then although it will still be necessary to choose one of
            them as copy-text, and to follow it in accidentals, this copy-text can be allowed no
            over-riding or even preponderant authority so far as substantive readings are concerned.
            The choice between these, in cases of variation, will be determined partly by the
            opinion the editor may form respecting the nature of the copy from which each
            substantive edition was printed, which is a matter of external authority; partly by the
            intrinsic authority of the several texts as judged by the relative frequency of manifest
            errors therein; and partly by the editor's judgement of the intrinsic claims of
            individual readings to originality&mdash;in other words their intrinsic merit, so long
            as by 'merit' we mean the likelihood of their being what the author wrote rather than
            their appeal to the individual taste of the editor.</p>
          <p>Such, as I see it, is the general theory of copy-text. But there remain a number of
            subsidiary questions that it may be worth-while to discuss. One is the degree of
            faithfulness with which the copy-text should be reproduced. Since the adoption of a
            copy-text is a matter of convenience rather than of principle&mdash;being <pb
              n="003.030"/> imposed on us either by linguistic circumstances or our own philological
            ignorance&mdash;it follows that there is no reason for treating it as sacrosanct, even
            apart from the question of substantive variation. Every editor aiming at a critical
            edition will, of course, correct scribal or typographical errors. He will also correct
            readings in accordance with any errata included in the edition taken as copy-text. I see
            no reason why he should not alter misleading or eccentric spellings which he is
            satisfied emanate from the scribe or compositor and not from the author. If the
            punctuation is persistently erroneous or defective an editor may prefer to discard it
            altogether to make way for one of his own. He is, I think, at liberty to do so, provided
            that he gives due weight to the original in deciding on his own, and that he records the
            alteration whenever the sense is appreciably affected. Much the same applies to the use
            of capitals and italics. I should favour expanding contractions (except perhaps when
            dealing with an author's holograph) so long as ambiguities and abnormalities are
            recorded. A critical edition does not seem to me a suitable place in which to record the
            graphic peculiarities of particular texts,<ref target="f003.02.17" n="17"><hi
                rend="super">17</hi></ref> and in this respect the copy-text is only one among
            others. These, however, are all matters within the discretion of an editor: I am only
            concerned to uphold his liberty of judgement.</p>
          <p>Some minor points arise when it becomes necessary to replace a reading of the copy-text
            by one derived from another source. It need not, I think, be copied in the exact form in
            which it there appears. Suppose that the copy-text follows the earlier convention in the
            use of <hi rend="italic">u</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v</hi>, and the source from which
            the reading is taken follows the later. Naturally in transferring the reading from the
            latter to the former it would be made to conform to the earlier convention. I would go
            further. Suppose that the copy-text reads 'hazard', but that we have reason to believe
            that the correct reading is 'venture': suppose further that whenever this word occurs in
            the copy-text it is in the form 'venter': then 'venter', I maintain, is the form we
            should adopt. In like manner editorial emendations should be made to conform to the
            habitual spelling of the copy-text.</p>
          <p>In the case of rival substantive editions the choice between <pb n="003.031"/>
            substantive variants is, I have explained, generally independent of the copy-text.
            Perhaps one concession should be made. Suppose that the claims of two readings, one in
            the copy-text and one in some other authority, appear to be exactly balanced: what then
            should an editor do? In such a case, while there can be no logical reason for giving
            preference to the copy-text, in practice, if there is no reason for altering its
            reading, the obvious thing seems to be to let it stand.<ref target="f003.02.18" n="18"
                ><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref></p>
          <p>Much more important, and difficult, are the problems that arise in connexion with
            revision. McKerrow seems only to mention correction, but I think he must have intended
            to include revision, so long as this falls short of complete rewriting: in any case the
            principle is the same. I have already considered the practice he advocated (pp.
            23-25)&mdash;namely that an editor should take the original edition as his copy-text and
            introduce into it all the substantive variants of the revised reprint, other than
            manifest errors&mdash;and have explained that I regard it as too sweeping and
            mechanical. The emendation that I proposed (p. 26) is, I think, theoretically
            sufficient, but from a practical point of view it lacks precision. In a case of revision
            or correction the normal procedure would be for the author to send the printer either a
            list of the alterations to be made or else a corrected copy of an earlier edition. In
            setting up the new edition we may suppose that the printer would incorporate the
            alterations thus indicated by the author; but it must be assumed that he would also
            introduce a normal amount of unauthorized variation of his own.<ref target="f003.02.19"
              n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> The problem that faces the editor is to
            distinguish between the two categories. I suggest the following frankly subjective
            procedure. Granting that the fact of revision (or correction) is established, <pb
              n="003.032"/> an editor should in every case of variation ask himself (1) whether the
            original reading is one that can reasonably be attributed to the author, and (2) whether
            the later reading is one that the author can reasonably be supposed to have substituted
            for the former. If the answer to the first question is negative, then the later reading
            should be accepted as at least possibly an authoritative correction (unless, of course,
            it is itself incredible). If the answer to (1) is affirmative and the answer to (2) is
            negative, the original reading should be retained. If the answers to both questions are
            affirmative, then the later reading should be presumed to be due to revision and
            admitted into the text, whether the editor himself considers it an improvement or not.
            It will be observed that one implication of this procedure is that a later variant that
            is either completely indifferent or manifestly inferior, or for the substitution of
            which no motive can be suggested, should be treated as fortuitous and refused admission
            to the text&mdash;to the scandal of faithful followers of McKerrow. I do not, of course,
            pretend that my procedure will lead to consistently correct results, but I think that
            the results, if less uniform, will be on the whole preferable to those achieved through
            following any mechanical rule. I am, no doubt, presupposing an editor of reasonable
            competence; but if an editor is really incompetent, I doubt whether it much matters what
            procedure he adopts: he may indeed do less harm with some than with others, he will do
            little good with any. And in any case, I consider that it would be disastrous to curb
            the liberty of competent editors in the hope of preventing fools from behaving after
            their kind.</p>
          <p>I will give one illustration of the procedure in operation, taken again from Jonson's
              <hi rend="italic">Masque of Gipsies</hi>, a work that is known to have been
            extensively revised for a later performance. At one point the text of the original
            version runs as follows, <q>a wise Gypsie . . . is as politicke a piece of Flesh, as
              most Iustices in the County where he maunds</q> whereas the texts of the revised
            version replace <hi rend="italic">maunds</hi> by <hi rend="italic">stalkes</hi>. Now,
              <hi rend="italic">maund</hi> is a recognized canting term meaning to beg, and there is
            not the least doubt that it is what Jonson originally wrote. Further, it might well be
            argued that it is less likely that he should have displaced it in revision by a
            comparatively commonplace <pb n="003.033"/> alternative, than that a scribe should have
            altered a rather unusual word that he failed to understand&mdash;just as we know that,
            in a line already quoted (p. 27), a scribe altered <hi rend="italic">flirted</hi> to <hi
              rend="italic">blewe</hi>. I should myself incline to this view were it not that at
            another point Jonson in revision added the lines, <q>
              <l>And then ye may stalke</l>
              <l>The <hi rend="italic">Gypsies</hi> walke</l>
            </q> where <hi rend="italic">stalk</hi>, in the sense of going stealthily, is used
            almost as a technical term. In view of this I do not think it unreasonable to suppose
            that Jonson himself substituted <hi rend="italic">stalkes</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
              >maunds</hi> from a desire to avoid the implication that his aristocratic Gipsies were
            beggars, and I conclude that it must be allowed to pass as (at least possibly) a
            correction, though no reasonable critic would <hi rend="italic">prefer</hi> it to the
            original.</p>
          <p>With McKerrow's view that in all normal cases of correction or revision the original
            edition should still be taken as the copy-text, I am in complete agreement. But not all
            cases are normal, as McKerrow himself recognized. While advocating, in the passage
            already quoted (p. 25), that the earliest 'good' edition should be taken as copy-text
            and corrections incorporated in it, he added the proviso, 'unless we could show that the
            [revised] edition in question (or the copy from which it had been printed) had been gone
            over and corrected <hi rend="italic">throughout</hi> by' the author (my italics). This
            proviso is not in fact very explicit, but it clearly assumes that there are (or at least
            may be) cases in which an editor would be justified in taking a revised reprint as his
            copy-text, and it may be worth inquiring what these supposed cases are. If a work has
            been entirely rewritten, and is printed from a new manuscript, the question does not
            arise, since the revised edition will be a substantive one, and as such will presumably
            be chosen by the editor as his copy-text. But short of this, an author, wishing to make
            corrections or alterations in his work, may not merely hand the printer a revised copy
            of an earlier edition, but himself supervise the printing of the new edition and correct
            the proofs as the sheets go through the press. In such a case it may be argued that even
            though the earlier edition, if printed from his own manuscript, will preserve the
            author's individual peculiarities more faithfully than the revised reprint, he must
            nevertheless be assumed <pb n="003.034"/> to have taken responsibility for the latter in
            respect of accidentals no less than substantive readings, and that it is therefore the
            revised reprint that should be taken as copy-text.</p>
          <p>The classical example is afforded by the plays in the 1616 folio of Ben Jonson's Works.
            In this it appears that even the largely recast <hi rend="italic">Every Man in his
              Humour</hi> was not set up from an independent manuscript but from a much corrected
            copy of the quarto of 1601. That Jonson revised the proofs of the folio has indeed been
            disputed, but Simpson is most likely correct in supposing that he did so, and he was
            almost certainly responsible for the numerous corrections made while the sheets were in
            process of printing. Simpson's consequent decision to take the folio for his copy-text
            for the plays it contains will doubtless be approved by most critics. I at least have no
            wish to dispute his choice.<ref target="f003.02.20" n="20"><hi rend="super"
              >20</hi></ref> Only I would point out&mdash;and here I think Dr. Simpson would agree
            with me&mdash;that even in this case the procedure involves some sacrifice of
            individuality. For example, I notice that in the text of <hi rend="italic">Sejanus</hi>
            as printed by him there are twenty-eight instances of the Jonsonian 'Apostrophus' (an
            apostrophe indicating the elision of a vowel that is nevertheless retained in printing)
            but of these only half actually appear in the folio, the rest he has introduced from the
            quarto. This amounts to an admission that in some respects at least the quarto preserves
            the formal aspect of the author's original more faithfully than the folio.</p>
          <p>The fact is that cases of revision differ so greatly in circumstances and character
            that it seems impossible to lay down any hard and fast rule as to when an editor should
            take the original edition as his copy-text and when the revised reprint. All that can be
            said is that if the original be selected, then the author's corrections must be
            incorporated; and that if the reprint be selected, then the original reading must be
            restored when that of the reprint is due to unauthorized variation. Thus the editor
            cannot escape the responsibility of distinguishing to the best of his ability between
            the two categories. No juggling with copy-text will relieve him of the duty and
            necessity of exercizing his own judgement.</p>
          <p>In conclusion I should like to examine this problem of revision <pb n="003.035"/> and
            copy-text a little closer. In the case of a work like <hi rend="italic">Sejanus</hi>, in
            which correction or revision has been slight, it would obviously be possible to take the
            quarto as the copy-text and introduce into it whatever authoritative alterations the
            folio may supply; and indeed, were one editing the play independently, this would be the
            natural course to pursue. But a text like that of <hi rend="italic">Every Man in his
              Humour</hi> presents an entirely different problem. In the folio revision and
            reproduction are so blended that it would seem impossible to disentangle intentional
            from what may be fortuitous variation, and injudicious to make the attempt. An editor of
            the revised version has no choice but to take the folio as his copy-text. It would
            appear therefore that a reprint may in practice be forced upon an editor as copy-text by
            the nature of the revision itself, quite apart from the question whether or not the
            author exercized any supervision over its printing.</p>
          <p>This has a bearing upon another class of texts, in which a reprint was revised, not by
            the author, but through comparison with some more authoritative manuscript. Instances
            are Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi> and <hi rend="italic">King
              Lear</hi>. Of both much the best text is supplied by the folio of 1623; but this is
            not a substantive text, but one set up from a copy of an earlier quarto that had been
            extensively corrected by collation with a manuscript preserved in the playhouse. So
            great and so detailed appears to have been the revision that it would be an almost
            impossible task to distinguish between variation due to the corrector and that due to
            the compositor,<ref target="f003.02.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref> and an
            editor has no choice but to take the folio as copy-text. Indeed, this would in any case
            be incumbent upon him for a different reason; for the folio texts are in some parts
            connected by transcriptional continuity with the author's manuscript, whereas the
            quartos contain only reported texts, whose accidental characteristics can be of no
            authority whatever. At the same time, analogy with <hi rend="italic">Every Man in his
              Humour</hi> suggests that even had the quartos of <hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi>
            and <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> possessed higher authority than in fact they do,
            the choice of copy-text must yet have been the same.</p>
          <p>I began this discussion in the hope of clearing my own mind as well as others' on a
            rather obscure though not unimportant matter <pb n="003.036"/> of editorial practice. I
            have done something to sort out my own ideas: others must judge for themselves. If they
            disagree, it is up to them to maintain some different point of view. My desire is rather
            to provoke discussion than to lay down the law.</p>

            <p>The more naive the scribe, the more often will the assumption prove correct; the more
              sophisticated, the less often. This, no doubt, is why critics of this school tend to
              reject 'the more correct but the less sincere' manuscript in favour of 'the more
              corrupt but the less interpolated', as Housman elsewhere observes ('The Application of

            <p>It will, no doubt, be objected that punctuation may very seriously 'affect' an
              author's meaning; still it remains properly a matter of presentation, as spelling does
              in spite of its use in distinguishing homonyms. The distinction I am trying to draw is
              practical, not philosophic. It is also true that between substantive readings and
              spellings there is an intermediate class of word-forms about the assignment of which
              opinions may differ and which may have to be treated differently in dealing with the
              work of different scribes.</p>

              least something of the character of the original. Experience, however, shows that
              while the distribution of substantive variants generally agrees with the genetic
              relation of the texts, that of accidental variants is comparatively arbitrary.</p>

            <p>A 'substantive' edition is McKerrow's term for an edition that is not a reprint of
              any other. I shall use the term in this sense, since I do not think that there should
              be any danger of confusion between 'substantive editions' and 'substantive readings'.
              I have above ignored the practice of some eccentric editors who took as copy-text for
              a work the latest edition printed in the author's lifetime, on the assumption,
              presumably, that he revised each edition as it appeared. The textual results were
              naturally deplorable.</p>

            <p>Nashe, ii.197. The word 'reprint' really begs the question. If all an 'editor' aims
              at is an exact reprint, then obviously he will choose one early edition, on whatever
              grounds he considers relevant, and reproduce it as it stands. But McKerrow does emend
              his copy-text where necessary. It is symptomatic that he did not distinguish between a
              critical edition and a reprint.</p>

            <p>Or consider the following readings: 1604, 1609 'Consissylogismes', 1611 'subtile
              sylogismes', 1616 'subtle Sillogismes'. Here 'subtile', an irresponsible guess by the
              printer of 1611 for a word he did not understand, was taken over in 1616. The correct
              reading is, of course, 'concise syllogisms'. Boas's refusal to take account of the
              copy used in 1616 led him here and elsewhere to perpetuate some of its manifest
              errors. In this particular instance he appears to have been unaware of the reading of
              1611.</p>

            <p>This is the course I recommended in the Prolegomena to <hi rend="italic">The
                Editorial Problem in Shakespeare</hi> (p. xxix), adding that it 'at least saves the
              trouble of tossing a coin'. What I actually wrote in 1942 was that in such
              circumstances an editor 'will naturally retain the reading of the copy-text, this
              being the text which he has already decided is <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> the
              more correct'. This implies that correctness in respect of substantive readings is one
              of the criteria in the choice of the copy-text; and indeed I followed McKerrow in
              laying it down that an editor should select as copy-text the one that 'appears likely
              to have departed least in wording, spelling, and punctuation from the author's
              manuscript'. There is a good deal in my Prolegomena that I should now express
              differently, and on this particular point I have definitely changed my opinion. I
              should now say that the choice of the copy-text depends solely on its formal features
              (accidentals) and that fidelity as regards substantive readings is
              irrelevant&mdash;though fortunately in nine cases out of ten the choice will be the

          <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY CONCERNS ITSELF WITH EDITORIAL problems not as a usurper of the functions
            of legitimate criticism, but instead as the necessary foundation on which, in certain
            investigations, textual criticism must be based and to which criticism must constantly
            refer for more or less definitive judgments. Bibliography, in W. W. Greg's acute phrase,
            is the grammar of literary investigation. This position was strikingly advanced in
            Greg's classic address on the relations of bibliography to literature which appeared
            some time ago in <hi rend="italic">Neophilologus</hi>, and, again, in his
            "Bibliography&mdash;An Apologia" (<hi rend="italic">The Library</hi>, 4th ser. XIII
            [1932], 113 ff.). Any attempt merely to restate Greg's views here would be quite
            superfluous. For some years, at least among scholars, the inferential identification of
            bibliography with textual criticism has been so firmly established that to talk about
            the contribution of one to the other might appear to be like a solemn discussion of the
            usefulness of the arm to the hand.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, it is possible to suspect that, as more and more scholars have come to
            deal with these twin methods, the popularizing of their disciplines may have led, by
            subtle degrees, to a rather over-simplified view of the basic provinces of bibliography
            and textual criticism, especially as applied to editorial problems. Certainly the theory
            that every bibliographer is professionally qualified to be a full-fledged textual critic
            and editor is quite wrong. Correspondingly, there are a number of distinguished <pb
              n="003.038"/> textual critics whom, according to any strict accounting, we might
            hesitate to call bibliographers.</p>
          <p>Some fortunate scholars like Pollard, McKerrow, Greg, and Percy Simpson may happily
            combine in themselves both functions, although perhaps in unequal proportions; but this
            two souls in body one is certainly the exception rather than the rule. On the other
            hand, the most prominent Elizabethan textual critic now living&mdash;I refer to Mr.
            Dover Wilson&mdash;often operates in that dark region of the ur-state of a text which
            McKerrow rightly hesitated to identify with bibliography. One should comment, however,
            that not all of Wilson's readers&mdash;or his critics&mdash;are completely aware of the
            distinction. It is somewhat perturbing, for example, in Hereward Price's admirable
            "Towards a Scientific Method of Textual Criticism in the Elizabethan Drama"<ref
              target="f003.03.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> to find his chief whipping
            boy, Dover Wilson, consistently referred to as representing the bibliographical school.
            Save for his impatience at various of Wilson's well-known aberrations, Mr.
            Price&mdash;no more than the rest of us&mdash;would, I should think, completely discount
            such investigations. But we may agree with McKerrow and Greg that this scholarship is
            not usually bibliographical in any sense in which we should be prepared to use the
            term.</p>
          <p>Bibliography is likely to be a vague and misused word because it has come to be
            employed for too many different purposes. For the present discussion we may rule out
            enumerative bibliography&mdash;the making-up of finding or reference lists of books on
            various subjects&mdash;and use the term to mean analytical bibliography, the
            investigation and explanation of a book as a material object. Yet even within this
            narrower limitation there are various strata and subdivisions of research. For example,
            we have such forms of bibliographical spadework as the identification and recording of
            type-faces as by Haebler, or of <hi rend="italic">STC</hi> printers' ornaments as is now
            in progress by F. S. Ferguson, with their dates and history.</p>
          <p>But when we move from such essential preliminary investigation, and from the recording
            of material data as a part of publishing history, to another sort of bibliography, more
            specifically of the kind we designate as <hi rend="italic">analytical</hi>, we come to a
            field in which all our accumulated knowledge of printing practice and history is <pb
              n="003.039"/> devoted to the examination of individual or related books as material
            objects, with a view to determining the facts of their production. Is there or is there
            not a cancel in a certain gathering; were the various sheets of a book printed <hi
              rend="italic">seriatim</hi> or simultaneously in two or more sections; did one or two
            compositors, one or more presses, work on this book, and if so which parts did they do;
            was a cancel title-page or a cancel in the text printed later or as a part of the
            continuous printing of the book. Are variants in the sheets of the book the result of
            different impressions, or do they result from different typesettings or from simple
            correction at the press. If some of the sheets are of a single impression but certain
            others exhibit variant typesettings, which setting is the original, and why was the
            resetting made. If there are variant imprints, which was first through the press. And so
            on. It will be seen that correct answers to some of these questions depend not only on
            the simple discovery of the facts themselves, but more particularly on the satisfactory
            explanation of the ascertained facts. From specific analyses of this kind, some
            speculatively minded bibliographers may endeavor to evolve new techniques for bringing
            to light yet further secrets in printed books, techniques which may enable us to attack
            successfully some general problems which have heretofore been thought insoluble.</p>
          <p>Such technical examinations of individual books for their own sake are proceeding very
            swiftly these days, and they are being matched step by step by the parallel development
            of techniques for determining with greater precision the relation of the printed book to
            its underlying manuscript.<ref target="f003.03.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>
            No textual critic can afford to ignore the results of these investigations. From
            Willoughby's and Hinman's explorations of spelling tests,<ref target="f003.03.03" n="3"
                ><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> assisted in certain cases by evidence from the
            varying length of the compositor's stick,<ref target="f003.03.04" n="4"><hi rend="super"
                >4</hi></ref> we are now able to distinguish with some certainty in the <hi
              rend="italic">STC</hi> period and the following years the precise pages of a book set
            by different compositors. By an equation of these compositors' <pb n="003.040"/> habits
            we can thereupon make certain assumptions about the characteristics of the manuscript
            from which they were setting. The cooperative efforts which have been made in the
            analysis of the evidence of headlines<ref target="f003.03.05" n="5"><hi rend="super"
                >5</hi></ref> have opened up possibilities, in combination with this compositor
            evidence, for determining sometimes quite minute but necessary questions of the
            presswork and proofreading. To these may be added&mdash;among many other
            investigations&mdash;the classic Carter and Pollard examination of paper and type which
            exposed the Wise forgeries, Hazen's use of identified paper to detect Strawberry Hill
            forgeries, and Stevenson's technique for aligning watermarks with presswork.<ref
              target="f003.03.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> The unexpected uses of
            bibliography have been demonstrated in Bond's assignment of authorship to certain
            doubtful <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> papers, the whole argument resting ultimately
            on type left standing in advertisements and headings.<ref target="f003.03.07" n="7"><hi
                rend="super">7</hi></ref></p>
          <p>Astonishing results have recently accrued from certain research on eighteenth-century
            press figures, which had been earlier dismissed by McKerrow as of little bibliographical
            significance. Knotts<ref target="f003.03.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> has
            added a chapter to the work of Sale, Chapman, and others; and W. B. Todd's latest
            interpretation of the evidence of these figures in a number of books demonstrates some
            most exciting things one can learn of printing.<ref target="f003.03.09" n="9"><hi
                rend="super">9</hi></ref> From this evidence a whole new area of research has been
            opened up of such importance for distinguishing impressions, partial re-impressions, and
            editions, as well as various other important textual matters, that we may well believe
            in many cases press figures alone will come to be the most valuable tool for penetrating
            the extreme difficulties of textual problems in frequently reprinted popular
            eighteenth-century authors.</p>
          <pb n="003.041"/>
          <p>I should be less than candid if I tried to pretend that the immediate or even the chief
            aim of these and of many other bibliographical scholars was to serve as the sons of
            Martha to textual criticism. Without question, a number of bibliographical
            investigations which eventually proved invaluable to textual criticism were not
            undertaken with this end immediately in view and almost by accident arrived at their
            textual applications. Thus a real difference from textual criticism must always be felt,
            I suspect, in bibliographical research in its purest aspect. To defend themselves
            against doubters, bibliographers are accustomed to argue that the ultimate aim of all
            bibliographical research, and therefore its justification, is the definitive account of
            books in a descriptive bibliography, or the direct application of their findings to
            textual criticism. But I make bold to say that&mdash;at least as I view it&mdash;the <hi
              rend="italic">immediate</hi> end of a great deal of research is no such thing.
            Although I believe that the conventional justification is valid for the ultimate aims,
            and that this rationale is deeply felt by almost every bibliographical student,
            nevertheless, even though eventual application is the ideal, ordinarily textual
            criticism has not provided the immediate spur to the investigation and no specific
            textual use is often anticipated, at least in the early stages of the work. This
            attitude develops, in part, because many technical studies that are absolutely necessary
            yet require no interest in textual criticism on the part of the investigator. In part,
            because various of these studies are concerned only with a fragment of some total
            problem, the whole of which must be unraveled before any of it can be made of practical
            use to textual criticism.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, in spite of the various legitimate reasons which may be advanced to
            explain the rationale for much technical work in bibliography, the point of view does in
            fact serve to separate many bibliographers from textual critics; indeed, it would be
            tempting to say <hi rend="italic">most</hi> bibliographers were it not an increasing
            tendency for a number of analysts, with or without due training, to cross over the line
            and to concern themselves directly with the editing of texts. Others, though not
            editors, may develop so great an interest in textual questions that they direct their
            research specifically towards bibliographical problems which do have an immediate
            textual application and thus underlie accurate criticism. The record, while respectable,
            has not been one of unalloyed <pb n="003.042"/> success, perhaps, and when
            bibliographers have concerned themselves with matters of textual criticism that were not
            primarily bibliographical, they have sometimes floundered pitifully if they lacked the
            training and the qualities of mind which are necessary for textual criticism in <hi
              rend="italic">its</hi> purest state.</p>
          <p>I use this statement of a point too often overlooked, in our current tendency to exalt
            the bibliographer, as an aid towards a cursory glance at the nature of textual
            criticism, a subject on which I can speak with little authority and on which I shall
            anticipate correction. It is perhaps absurd to set up too sharp a distinction between
            textual critics and textual bibliographers. Anyone, we may suppose, who is concerned
            with the origin, derivation, authority, and correctness of a text, in whole or in part,
            is a textual critic, no matter what his method of approach. Some scholars tackle
            problems through bibliography, some through what Greg has called metacriticism, some
            through an attempted or actual combination of bibliography and criticism. For purposes
            of distinction I must deal in blacks and whites more starkly than is perhaps realistic.
            Nevertheless, I am sure that when we distinguish between a McKerrow and a Dover Wilson,
            both brilliant examples of different schools, we are in fact implying a greater
            fundamental difference than exists between the conservative and speculative wings of the
            same method.</p>
          <p>Greg&mdash;and in this he is frequently misunderstood&mdash;insists that the
            bibliographer must view a book only as a material object.<ref target="f003.03.10" n="10"
                ><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> This is a far cry from the aims of a textual critic.
            Historically, textual criticism developed long before analytical bibliography; and it
            evolved its own rules, especially for dealing with manuscripts, both classical and
            vernacular, according to certain principles which are outside the strictly
            bibliographical range, if for our purposes we continue to limit the definition of
            bibliography to analytical bibliography. These principles, or something like them, were
            also applied to printed books, again before bibliography was more than a gleam in the
            eye, and&mdash;as Greg has shown in his paper for this series&mdash;they are still in
            part applicable to certain problems. Thus there has been established in the past a firm
            tradition for dealing with texts; and it would be foolish <pb n="003.043"/> for us to
            believe that analytical bibliography has displaced this tradition, or even that in many
            cases it could. Nevertheless, analytical bibliography has demonstrated that in some
            circumstances the classical tradition is not completely self-sufficient. We may put it,
            therefore, that bibliography is neither a usurper nor a poor relation in the field of
            textual criticism, but rather its foundation, the grammar of the subject.</p>
          <p>If, in the interests of brevity, we pass over the important field of manuscript texts
            and concern ourselves with textual criticism based chiefly on printed books, we may,
            perhaps, discern three main but by no means mutually exclusive lines of endeavor. The
            first concerns itself with the authorship, origin, and characteristics of the lost
            manuscript behind a printed book both in whole and in part. I am thinking first of
            various studies in the attribution of anonymous works, or of the solution of problems in
            multiple authorship as in the Beaumont and Fletcher plays, Massinger, and Dekker; and
            secondly of such studies as Mr. Duthie has made in the bad quarto of <hi rend="italic"
              >Hamlet</hi> and more recently in the Pide Bull <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>.
            Dover Wilson's reconstructions of the manuscript copy for <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>
            and other texts should be placed here, as also various studies such as Hoppe's of <hi
              rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi> but especially Greg's of <hi rend="italic">Doctor
              Faustus</hi>. As with the <hi rend="italic">Faustus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
              >Lear</hi> investigations, according to the circumstances this division may merge
            imperceptibly with the second, which I take to be concerned with the critical analysis
            of texts in known manuscripts or printed exempla. Here we might place studies like
            Grierson's on the text of Donne, Wolf's on commonplace books, Shaaber's on <hi
              rend="italic">2 Henry IV.</hi> The determination of the order and authority of printed
            texts after the first also applies, and we must certainly include the very difficult
            task of separating from compositor's, proof-reader's, and printing-house editor's
            alterations those true revisions from an authoritatively corrected copy used as the
            basis for a later edition. The relation of the variants in the Quarto and Folio of <hi
              rend="italic">King Lear</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> is such a
            problem. In all of these divisions various special studies may enter in one form or
            another. I list as examples a few of the inquiries which Mr. Price sets up as among the
            subjects for textual criticism: vocabulary tests of authorship, and also of plagiarism,
            metrical tests including study of broken lines, deficient lines, redundant syllables,
            feminine endings, <pb n="003.044"/> prose as blank verse, and so on, applied to form an
            opinion of a text.</p>
          <p>Finally, perhaps we may assign as a third general division the orderly bringing
            together of all this information in an editorial capacity, and the consequent evolution
            of a modern critical text designed to represent the intentions of the author more
            faithfully than any single preserved manuscript or printed copy. Whereas the findings of
            analytical bibliography may or may not be applicable in the first two divisions, the
            claims of analysis enter full force in the editorial third.</p>
          <p>In the first two divisions, it is true, the investigations lead hopefully towards the
            ideal of a definitive text, but, as with pure bibliography, much textual criticism is
            undertaken either for its own sake or else to attack only a fragment of the total
            problem, so that the immediate end of the research may not be the formation of a text.
            For example, Mr. Duthie did not edit <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> after he had solved
            the problem of the bad quarto. It will be convenient, however, to treat textual
            criticism and its relations to bibliography in its narrower application to the evolution
            of an edited text and to the various delicate problems that arise before this text can
            eventually be fixed. Moreover, the limitation may be extended to cover only the specific
            problem of old-spelling critical texts, for&mdash;as Greg's paper has shown&mdash;these
            are subject to certain criteria which do not always apply to modernized versions, even
            though the basic problems are shared in common.</p>
          <p>At the start one should distinguish certain editorial problems that have no necessary
            connection with bibliography. An editor of the literature of the past must have
            considerable linguistic attainments, or ready access to professional advice. Through
            long familiarity he must grow to be a native in the characteristic thought, usage,
            speech patterns, and customs of his period. Although bibliography may occasionally
            assist in the solution of some problems, or offer a convincing after-the-event
            confirmation, much emendation&mdash;or refusal to emend&mdash;much estimate of
            authenticity, must be made quite independently of bibliographical considerations and
            instead on a philological basis. This aspect has no relation to bibliography, and it
            requires a discipline and study which leave little time for bibliographical
            investigations not concerning the problem immediately at hand. Moreover, if <pb
              n="003.045"/> we speak of only one characteristic, the great emendations have been
            inspired art and not systematic science. One can give a rational palaeographical
            explanation to derive "a table of green fields" set in type from the crabbed script of
            "a" babld of green fields," but I beg leave to doubt that this famous emendation would
            to the present day ever have been arrived at by strictly palaeographic reasoning. Greg,
            I believe, has no very high opinion of palaeography as giving more than a hint for
              emendations,<ref target="f003.03.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> although
            its confirmation is often most valuable. Usually, I suspect, one arrives at an
            emendation of any subtlety by inspiration, memory, and a strong sense of analogy, and
            then one brings in palaeography if possible to justify one's conclusions.</p>
          <p>Many other considerations of text are too frequently confused as soluble by
            bibliography. For example, bibliography can establish that edition <hi rend="italic"
              >B.</hi> was printed from edition <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>, and not from an
            independent manuscript; but if revisions appear in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi>, there is
            no bibliographical technique for determining except in isolated cases whether they
            derive from the author himself, a scribe revising the text of <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>
            from a manuscript, or an editor of some kind. Such problems in one way or another
            involving emendation or the acceptance of variant readings fall to the lot of the
            textual critic once bibliography has cleared his way to the limit of its ability.</p>
          <p>This critical acumen, which we cannot value too highly as applied to text, is, of
            course, the product of a keen and imaginative mind; but, again, it is materially aided
            by a very close acquaintance with one's period in general philological considerations.
            This acquaintance gradually develops an opinion about speech and imagery which, in
            mature and thoughtful hands, has its own authority not only in questions of emendation
            but in any division of textual criticism. We may note that even the conservative,
            bibliographical McKerrow does not disdain in certain circumstances to write about the
            authority of variants between editions which best seem to have the greatest internal
            harmony with an author.<ref target="f003.03.12" n="12"><hi rend="super"
            >12</hi></ref></p>
          <p>This strong and subtle imagination necessary for close inquiries <pb n="003.046"/> into
            texts may apply itself to studies in attribution, plagiarism, or multiple authorship, or
            to studies in an author's speech and metrical characteristics, or it may be found in
            Dover Wilson's various attempts&mdash;whether rightly or wrongly&mdash;to discover
            layers of revision in the pre-printing history of a manuscript, or it may be utilized in
            the scrupulous examination of the sources and methods of corruption in a text which
            Duthie has demonstrated in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">King
              Lear</hi>. Such striking deductions as those Duthie makes about the composition of
            memorial texts from tag ends of general recollections exhibit a critical virtuosity
            which has its own discipline and rigorous training.</p>
          <p>If I were a textual critic concerned with such matters as I have been sketching,
            problems involving my total powers as a critic, I fancy I should be rather impatient
            with a bibliographer who insisted that I should be all this and McKerrow too. And I
            should be strongly inclined to reply: you are a technician&mdash;you do the technical
            part of this business and I shall apply your findings, taking care that I have studied
            the principles and general methods of your craft seriously enough so that I can follow
            your arguments and understand the applicability of what you are saying.</p>
          <p>This is roughly what has happened, and as a consequence something like the following
            rationale is commonly accepted. The bibliographer's function is to prepare the general
            material of the texts, when bibliographical investigation is necessarily involved; and
            the textual critic, in the light of bibliographical findings, can then proceed to apply
            the discovered relationships, and to add his own art, to achieve the finished,
            definitive result.</p>
          <p>Since we are an age of specialists, this separation of function seems reasonable to us.
            Indeed, in various cases it may work very well, and in some it may even be positively
            necessary. Yet I must confess it is a position I held with more conviction in the past
            than I do today, and I anticipate holding it with even less conviction in the future,
            especially if certain far-reaching bibliographical speculations and experimental
            techniques for dealing with the accidentals in an old-spelling text ever reach success.
            This change in attitude, I am conscious, may have been dictated too much by various
            experiences with amateur editors, from whom the good Lord deliver us, by a tendency to
            over-emphasize the importance of a close reconstruction of accidentals, and by allowing
            the <pb n="003.047"/> special problems of distinctly unusual texts to bulk too large in
            my mind so that the uncomplicated, run-of-the-mill variety is obscured.</p>
          <p>Whatever the cause, I have here what is only a selection of examples to illustrate that
            a textual critic, when he is himself incapable of applying advanced bibliographical
            techniques to every detail of an old-spelling text, can seldom achieve absolute
            authority in his results, and may indeed be led into serious error through the false
            confidence induced in him by the notion that bibliography has sufficiently prepared the
            way before his labors have begun.</p>
          <p>This hypothetical critic can ordinarily be prepared only to follow and apply
            bibliographical arguments: his training has not prepared him to evaluate their
            correctness on technical grounds. A small but rather interesting example occurs in
            Thomas Southerne's <hi rend="italic">Disappointment</hi> of 1684. Here the case for a
            cancel to abridge a censored scene was very plausibly advanced in 1933, and in 1946 was
            vetted by a good bibliographer who made some necessary modifications but in no way
            questioned the central thesis. Yet in the last sixteen years if any textual critic had
            treated the scene in the light of this apparently authoritative evidence, without
            testing it bibliographically for himself, he would have been quite wrong, for no cancel
            exists and the scene is not abridged.<ref target="f003.03.13" n="13"><hi rend="super"
                >13</hi></ref></p>
          <p>Secondly, this critic may often be forced to enter upon subjects where rigorous
            bibliographical investigation has not yet been made, although he may not be aware of
            that fact. A really egregious case of false bibliography has only recently been
            corrected by W. B. Todd's study of <hi rend="italic">The Monk</hi>.<ref
              target="f003.03.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref> The full story is very
            involved, but the point is brief. If between 1935 and 1949 any critic had blindly relied
            on the accepted ordering of the publishing history which pseudo-bibliography had set up,
            he would have been led to evolve a text which treated Lewis's revisions as the original
            readings, and the readings which Lewis had discarded as in fact his later revisions. <hi
              rend="italic">Q. E. D.</hi> Don't trust all the bibliographers.</p>
          <pb n="003.048"/>
          <p>This is a pretty fix for a textual critic, since he is damned if he does and damned if
            he doesn't. And in fact, in many cases no solution for his dilemma is possible unless he
            is himself also a trained bibliographer who is capable of re-examining technically a
            fouled-up problem. Yet he must do something. One course is to trust only <hi
              rend="italic">some</hi> bibliographers. The very best butter. Nonetheless we may well
            remember in this connection Curt B&uuml;hler's favorite quotation of the observation
            made by A. W. Pollard on his colleague Robert Proctor, a great pioneer in incunabula
            studies, "that in matters of bibliography he would not have taken the results of an
            archangel upon trust." As an example we may survey two specific but fortunately minor
            instances in which Mr. Duthie in his new edition of <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> was
            misled by untested bibliography. A small part of his arguments concerning certain
            peculiarities of the quarto rests on Greg's speculation that two compositors with
            different habits might have been engaged with the book. Now in this case Greg was not
            speaking <hi rend="italic">ex cathedra</hi> as the result of a detailed bibliographical
            examination, but only in terms of possibilities. Fortunately the point was of no very
            great consequence for Duthie's conclusions, because he accepted the speculation on trust
            and did not test it. We know now, however, from a recent bibliographical study, which
            can be confirmed by even stricter bibliographical evidence,<ref target="f003.03.15"
              n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> that only one compositor set the book. These
            peculiarities, therefore, require another explanation.</p>
          <p>In the second instance the point of discussion is the mislining of the verse at the
            opening of Act III, Scene 2, the great storm scene. Greg took the view that the early
            part is mislined because the compositor was setting the text as prose, and it was not
            until he reached a certain point that he recognized he was dealing with verse and
            thereafter proceeded to line correctly. Duthie, naturally, accepted Greg's explanation
            as 'bibliographical,' and quite properly added that of course the compositor must have
            gone back to insert capitals at the beginning of each line in the prose section to give
            it the appearance of verse that it assumes in the printing. However, a single piece of
            bibliographical evidence demonstrates the mechanical impossibility of such a procedure.
            Throughout <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> the compositor of the quarto used a short stick
            for verse and <pb n="003.049"/> a longer stick for prose; and he never sets prose in his
            short or verse measure. Since the opening lines of this scene were set in the verse
            measure, not the prose, the explanation for the mislineation must be sought elsewhere,
            for from the start the compositor intended to set verse. But other consequences resulted
            from this failure to see the bibliographical evidence. Because the implications of the
            short measure were not recognized, in these lines Duthie over-conservatively retained a
            corrupt lack of punctuation which succeeds in destroying, almost completely, not only a
            successful flower of rhetoric but also one of the mightiest images of this great storm
              scene.<ref target="f003.03.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref></p>
          <p>If the critic finding himself thus abused hurls a curse on this treacherous science of
            bibliography and betakes himself to his own estimates&mdash;to what Greg calls
            metacritical evidence&mdash;he may find himself in a rather vulnerable position. A
            simple, though typical, case occurs in <hi rend="italic">The Dumbe Knight</hi> of 1608
            which is preserved with either one of two title-pages, the major difference between them
            being that one gives the author's name whereas the other does not. Metacritics worked up
            a pretty romance about this play, conjecturing that Gervase Markham, the author, was so
            disgusted when he found his play printed with an inferior under-plot by another hand
            that he withdrew his name from the title. On the contrary, bibliography demonstrates
            that the title with the name is the true cancel leaf so that the name was added rather
            than excised.<ref target="f003.03.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref></p>
          <p>Vulnerability increases when the problem is one of any complexity. Here is a small
            problem yet one in which an old-spelling editor must make a decision. The inner forme of
            text sheet A of George Sandys's <hi rend="italic">Christs Passion</hi>, a translation in
            1640 from Grotius, was reset in the course of enlarging the edition. One typesetting of
            this inner forme agrees largely with the invariant outer forme in making up capital W's
            from two V's, whereas the other uses regular W's. Aha, says the critic, I'm not so bad
            at bibliography myself: obviously the setting of inner A which is consistent with outer
            A must be the original for me to reprint. The only trouble is, he is wrong. A rather
            technical interpretation of the evidence <pb n="003.050"/> of the headlines demonstrates
            that this setting must have been printed a sheet or so later.<ref target="f003.03.18"
              n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref> The inconsistent forme is the authoritative
            original which must be taken for the copy-text, and it is probably inconsistent because
            we may be dealing with two compositors casting off copy and setting by formes in order
            to get the book started in a hurry.</p>
          <p>We do not need the example of nineteenth-century editors basing Shakespeare texts on
            the Pavier Quartos to indicate some of the larger dangers of inferences about the
            relations of texts made on purely metacritical grounds. But lest we feel too confident
            about our present abilities to cope with matters more properly the province of textual
            criticism, such as our ability to construct a correct family tree of editions on the
            basis of their readings alone, we may consider the case of the ninth edition of Dryden's
              <hi rend="italic">Indian Emperour</hi> in 1694. Certain of its readings are drawn
            apparently at random from those which are unique in the seventh edition and are not
            found in the eighth. Others derive from equally random readings unique in the eighth and
            not found in the seventh. There are three reputable critical interpretations of this
            phenomenon: (1) the ninth edition comes from an independent manuscript; (2) the seventh
            and eighth editions were collated at the printing house and the conflation of readings
            thus results from editorial intervention&mdash;or one might even introduce collation of
            one of these editions against a prompt copy or other manuscript; (3) the ninth is set
            from a lost edition which may be placed in between the seventh and eighth and on which
            the eighth is also based. This last would be a favorite with critics accustomed to
            dealing with manuscripts, and it is certainly the most plausible.</p>
          <p>At least the first two of these quite reputable explanations might cause some critical
            perturbation, since fresh authority could have been introduced into the text, and the
            various new readings in the ninth not found in either the seventh or eighth might demand
            critical acceptance on their merits. However, when analytical techniques are applied,
            the answer is not hard to find. Two compositors were employed on the ninth edition,
            but&mdash;perhaps because only one press was available&mdash;instead of chopping the
            reprint up into two sections to be set and printed simultaneously, <pb n="003.051"/>
            they set the book <hi rend="italic">seriatim</hi> but working in relay. One would
            compose from four to five type-pages, or only one or two, and then be relieved by the
            other while he distributed his type, and so on in turn. Since the eighth edition was a
            paginal reprint of the seventh, what actually happened was that one compositor set from
            a copy of the seventh, and the other from a copy of the eighth, and so they worked
            merrily along in relay to the confusion of scholarship, conflating the two editions to
            form the ninth. The answer is very easy after bibliographical analysis.<ref
              target="f003.03.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref></p>
          <p>I do not wish to infer that in all cases bibliographical evidence is applicable. To be
            properly bibliographical, evidence must concern itself with only certain relations
            between preserved printed or inscribed pieces of paper. For example, a form of textual
            criticism linked with bibliography can usually decide on an over-all basis whether
            variations in a later edition are compositors' variants or editorial revisions; and pure
            bibliography can demonstrate whether or not this later edition was otherwise set from a
            copy of an earlier. But whether these revisions were the author's or someone else's can
            never be decided by bibliography under ordinary circumstances; that is for textual
            criticism pure and simple. The case is usually not demonstrable by any form of
            bibliographical evidence. Some critics may deal extensively with evidence which is
            probably bibliographical at bottom because it is founded on the peculiarities of printed
            inscriptions on paper; but the inferences they draw may have no relation to the laws of
            bibliographical evidence. As I shall indicate in a moment, strictly bibliographical
            deduction is not always possible from bibliographical facts. It is this common confusion
            about the difference between the strictly bibliographical and the metacritical
            interpretation of the evidence offered by a book as a material object which places,
            wrongly I believe, a number of Dover Wilson's ingenious arguments in the field of
            bibliography. Larger examples may be cited. The <hi rend="italic">Taming of the
              Shrew</hi> problem can have no bibliographical basis, for whatever relation existed
            between <hi rend="italic">A Shrew</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Shrew</hi> antedates
            their printing, and the manuscripts behind the printed copy of each have no
            bibliographical relation. Somewhat less clearly, perhaps, the formation of a critical
            text of <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>
            <pb n="003.052"/> is not, basically, a bibliographical investigation. There is no direct
            relationship between the three printed texts.</p>
          <p>But when pure textual criticism concerns itself with problems in which bibliographical
            investigation is possible, it can seldom be equally definitive as in this other field,
            for critical interpretation of evidence is at best inferential, and the logic of the
            argument is frequently reversible. Until the problem was directly tackled by
            bibliographical methods, the question of whether <hi rend="italic">Troilus and
              Cressida</hi> in the Folio was set from an annotated copy of the quarto or from an
            independent manuscript had yielded no convincing answer from the critical approach. Yet
            Mr. Williams has made the problem seem like child's play,<ref target="f003.03.20" n="20"
                ><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref> and we may find his study very illuminating for the
            relative validity of bibliographical and critical methods in such situations. Similarly,
            Mr. Hinman's authoritative study of <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> and its second quarto
            contains a most ingenious bibliographical solution of another long-vexed critical
              problem.<ref target="f003.03.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref></p>
          <p>There are other problems involving the relations between editions. Greg, I think, has
            remarked that given two editions only, the critical method could never satisfactorily
            establish their relationship or indeed, if they are similarly dated, as with certain of
            the Pavier quartos, their priority. I may be making this more positive or detailed than
            his original statement, but when we realize that Greg is not thinking in terms of
            inferences establishing high probability but instead of absolute proof, then we must
            admit that true demonstration is impossible because of the reversibility of the critical
            evidence. Is a variant a correction or rationalization in one edition, or a corruption
            in the other&mdash;frequently the case may be argued either way.</p>
          <p>An example is Dryden's <hi rend="italic">Wild Gallant</hi>, which has two editions in
            1669, the year of its first appearance in print. One is clearly a paginal reprint of the
            other, but the question is&mdash;which? On the one side we have Macdonald setting up his
            number 72a as the first edition, whereas Griffith, backed by Osborn, argues for 72b, or
            Macdonald's second edition. As a part of a fresh bibliographical examination of this
            play I have elsewhere tried to show in detail <pb n="003.053"/> too lengthy to be
            summarized here that while the basic fact on which each hinges his argument is
            bibliographical, the arguments from this fact are only inferential and therefore do not
            conform to the strictest requirements of bibliographical reasoning, that is, to a
            mechanical demonstration for which there is no possible alternative save in the realm of
            purest fantasy.<ref target="f003.03.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref></p>
          <p>It will be pertinent, however, to consider more fully in this play certain kinds of
            evidence which, for a very good reason, have not been published. The expos&eacute;, I
            hope, will offer an enlightening example, though at my own expense, of what
            bibliographical evidence is and what it is not. I can speak very feelingly on the
            subject because when I came to the problem as an editor I was completely booby-trapped,
            and at first I arrived at certain conclusions on grounds which I gullibly persuaded
            myself were bibliographical only to have the whole argument blow up in my face when at
            length the true evidence became apparent.</p>
          <p>A textual collation of the two editions quickly established that there had been no real
            rewriting between them, but that in a score of places&mdash;if 72a were
            first&mdash;corrections, possibly even revisions, had certainly been made in 72b, a few
            of which could have come only from the author himself. On the other hand, if 72b were
            first, in various readings the text had undergone a corruption rather more serious than
            one might expect in a first reprint. Mr. Osborn in his notes to Griffith's argument had
            confidently pronounced <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> the first on the evidence of this
            textual degeneration in <hi rend="italic">A</hi>.<ref target="f003.03.23" n="23"><hi
                rend="super">23</hi></ref> This is a critical touchstone which experience has shown
            to be sound, provided the further inference is made that the author had no part in
            producing the reprint. However, I approached the <hi rend="italic">Gallant</hi> fresh
            from a study of <hi rend="italic">The Indian Emperour</hi>, in which without question
            Dryden had directly concerned himself with revising not only the second but also the
            third edition, the year before and after <hi rend="italic">The Wild Gallant</hi>
            respectively. With this example before me, I felt hesitant to accept Osborn's
            conclusions without further inquiry, for the second inference could not be automatically
            applied. Indeed, I came to feel that there was just about as much chance that the
            careless errors of <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> had been rectified <pb n="003.054"/> in <hi
              rend="italic">B.</hi> by an errata list sent to the printer as that <hi rend="italic"
              >A.</hi> represented a careless and unauthoritative reprint of <hi rend="italic"
              >B.</hi> And I still do not think that the priority of one or other edition can be
            positively demonstrated on the readings alone. Whether one is corruption or the other
            correction is not demonstrable in the very strictest sense once we know that Dryden had
            concerned himself at this date with correcting reprints of at least one other play.</p>
          <p>I approached the two editions, therefore, not on the basis of the respective 'goodness'
            of their readings, but in search of some material evidence that one had been printed
            from the other. Here are some of the highlights of the preliminary case I evolved for
            the priority of <hi rend="italic">A.</hi></p>
          <p>In the <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> edition, the shortened name <hi rend="italic"
              >Will</hi> is almost invariably followed by a period to indicate that it is an
            abbreviation for <hi rend="italic">William</hi>, and this period substitutes for other
            necessary punctuation such as commas, semi-colons, or even question marks. In <hi
              rend="italic">B., Will</hi> is treated as a simple familiar name and no period is ever
            found except once&mdash;and significantly this once is the first time the name appears.
            Inadvertent following of copy by <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> in this single initial
            instance seemed the best answer.<ref target="f003.03.24" n="24"><hi rend="super"
              >24</hi></ref> Given this hint, I continued looking for what one might describe as
            fossils in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> of strong characteristics present in <hi
              rend="italic">A.</hi> but not in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> Twice in <hi rend="italic"
              >A.</hi> one compositor set the extreme contraction <hi rend="italic">b's</hi> for <hi
              rend="italic">be's</hi>, and, once later, <hi rend="italic">h'll</hi> for <hi
              rend="italic">he'll</hi>. In <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> the two <hi rend="italic"
              >h's</hi> are normalized to the conventional <hi rend="italic">he's</hi>, but the
            fossil <hi rend="italic">h'll</hi> retained. More evidence appeared of what was
            apparently inadvertent following of copy. For example, the two compositors of <hi
              rend="italic">A.</hi> spelled the conjunctive adverb <hi rend="italic">than</hi>
            indifferently as <hi rend="italic">then</hi> or as <hi rend="italic">than</hi>. In <hi
              rend="italic">B.</hi> the invariable spelling is <hi rend="italic">than</hi>, even
            when <hi rend="italic">then</hi> appears in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>, except for two
            cases, and one of these turned out to be in the uncorrected state of a press-variant
            forme in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> where the <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> spelling <hi
              rend="italic">then</hi> originally appeared in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> but was
            changed by the proof-reader to <hi rend="italic">than</hi>. There were various other
            instances in which the isolated appearance in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> of marked
            characteristics in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> seemed significant, especially since the
            two pairs of compositors were different in each edition. <pb n="003.055"/> Moreover, on
            the textual principle that the 'harder' reading is the original, there were at least two
            cases which seemed to point to the priority of <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the first,
            the form <hi rend="italic">wall</hi> in the phrase in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "she
            wall write" seemed to derive more plausibly from a manuscript colloquialism <hi
              rend="italic">wall</hi> or <hi rend="italic">wull</hi> than from a misprint of the <hi
              rend="italic">B.</hi> "she shall write." In the second, Constance is deceiving Lord
            Nonsuch that she is with child, and when he demands the name of the father she responds
            that she does not know. He exclaims, "Not know! went there so many to't?" and in <hi
              rend="italic">A.</hi> she answers, "So far from that, that there were none at all, to
            my best knowledge, Sir." In <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> the repetition <hi rend="italic"
              >went</hi> substitutes for <hi rend="italic">were</hi>, and it seemed a plausible
            hypothesis that the 'harder' reading was <hi rend="italic">were</hi>, and that memorial
            failure in the <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> compositor carried over the repetition of <hi
              rend="italic">went</hi> from Nonsuch's line. That the <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>
            compositor in such a circumstance, where the repetition seems most natural, saw <hi
              rend="italic">went</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> copy and set <hi
              rend="italic">were</hi> seemed more difficult to believe.</p>
          <p>There is not time to go into this next evidence, but in the light of general experience
            that irregularities between catchword and following word in an original edition usually
            tend to be normalized in reprints, it seemed to me at first highly probable that certain
            irregularities in the <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> catchwords were much better explained on
            the belief that it was the first edition rather than the second.</p>
          <p>Finally, I attacked the gap of eight pages in the pagination which appears between
            sheets G and H in both editions. In one edition this identical error could have resulted
            only from slavish following of copy. Hence if I could establish a reason for the gap in
            one edition, but no reason in the other, I felt I should have my original. Analysis
            disclosed that edition <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> was set by two compositors in sections
            of one or more full sheets and that their respective sections can be identified not only
            by the different lengths of their sticks but also by the difference in the use of
            skeleton-formes which is associated with each.<ref target="f003.03.25" n="25"><hi
                rend="super">25</hi></ref> In <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> there is no evidence for any
            interruption in the presswork between sheets G and H, and indeed it seems likely that
            one compositor set the last pages of G and continued over into the first pages of H as
              <pb n="003.056"/> part of his stint. On the contrary, in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> the
            gap in pagination occurs between one of the clearly marked sections where the
            compositors shifted, and it seemed a reasonable inference that when the compositor of
            sheet H returned to duty and came to make his first impositions, he forgot the system
            under which he was working and miscalculated the pagination.</p>
          <p>I had, then, among various other pieces of evidence, the apparent survival in unique
            forms in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> of strongly marked compositorial habits manifested in
              <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>, among such fossils being the abbreviation of <hi
              rend="italic">Will</hi>, the survival of the form <hi rend="italic">h'll</hi> and of a
            random <hi rend="italic">then</hi> spelling. I may also mention a few cases in <hi
              rend="italic">B.</hi> of the very common practice in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> of
            using a semi-colon for a question mark, the setting in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> of a
            period in over a dozen cases where a necessary question mark was used in <hi
              rend="italic">B.</hi>, and a very odd but marked use of the full -<hi rend="italic"
              >ed</hi> ending in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> for the elided form <hi rend="italic"
              >apostrophe d</hi> in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi>, an expansion difficult to account for
            with such frequency in a reprint. Then there were such cases as this. The colloquial
            form <hi rend="italic">u'm</hi> for <hi rend="italic">them</hi> is absolutely consistent
            throughout both editions except for one single late use of <hi rend="italic">them</hi>
            in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> where <hi rend="italic">u'm</hi> appears in <hi
              rend="italic">B.</hi> The probability seemed much higher that <hi rend="italic"
              >B.</hi> had normalized <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> than that <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>
            had wilfully departed from its copy <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> There were also two cases
            where proper names were found in italic in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi>, as customary, but
            in roman in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>, a reversal hard to account for. Finally, the
            evidence of the catchwords possibly, but almost certainly that of the mispagination,
            seemed to point to <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> as the original.</p>
          <p>I hope I have made this case reasonably convincing, even in an incomplete and digested
            form, because I am ashamed to confess that initially&mdash;before I began to prepare the
            text for an edition&mdash; it had me thoroughly convinced. Yet I hasten to point out
            that all these conclusions are quite wrong, that Griffith and Osborn are right. Edition
              <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> indeed precedes <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>; and this case I
            have presented for Macdonald's order, though based mostly on 'bibliographical' facts,
            has been one only of inference and probability but never of true bibliographical
            demonstration.</p>
          <p>This, briefly, is the real evidence for <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> as the first edition
            which my subsequent investigation revealed. Only one press-variant forme emerged from
            collation of eleven copies of <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>, but from ten copies of <hi
              rend="italic">B.</hi> I finally turned up seven formes which had <pb n="003.057"/>
            undergone stop-press correction. Of these, two are indifferent since the uncorrected
            state agrees with <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> for one, and the other is the variant
            act-heading noticed by Professor Griffith in the apparently unique Texas copy. Of the
            remaining five, all&mdash;in their significant <hi rend="italic">B.</hi>
            readings&mdash;have an agreement between the <hi rend="italic">corrected</hi> state of
            the formes and <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is no need to elaborate the
            bibliographical argument here.<ref target="f003.03.26" n="26"><hi rend="super"
              >26</hi></ref> Almost inevitably, <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> must have been set from
              <hi rend="italic">B.</hi></p>
          <p>Finally, to clinch the case, this evidence developed. On one occasion in <hi
              rend="italic">A.</hi> the verb <hi rend="italic">tells</hi> in the phrase <hi
              rend="italic">she tells me</hi> is misprinted as <hi rend="italic">tel's</hi>. We can
            demonstrate the source of this misprint in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> when we find that
            in the corresponding place in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> the second letter <hi
              rend="italic">l</hi> in <hi rend="italic">tells</hi> inks so very slightly in all
            observed copies that only its tip is visible without a magnifying glass; and since this
            inked tip would almost inevitably be taken as an apostrophe, the compositor of <hi
              rend="italic">A.</hi> read it as one and faithfully followed what he thought was the
            spelling of his copy. Correspondingly, in three places in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>
            where rather essential punctuation is missing, we find that the actual commas are so
            lightly inked in some copies of <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> as scarcely to be seen. The
            evidence of the <hi rend="italic">tel's</hi> alone is sufficient on which to rest one's
            whole case for the order of the editions; but especially when so powerfully confirmed by
            the evidence of the press-variant formes in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> followed by <hi
              rend="italic">A.</hi>, one could take the dispute to a court of law and secure a
            judgment for the priority of <hi rend="italic">B.</hi></p>
          <p>From this detailed example I draw a moral which applies to much of what I have been
            trying to say in this paper. Textual and pseudo-bibliographical evidence can seldom if
            ever afford more than a high degree of probability, and this is essentially different
            from positive demonstration. A very plausible chain of inferences can be built up, if
            the person is as stupid as I seem to have been; and if only the same line of evidence is
            employed to attack such a case, nothing but an indecisive stalemate can result. On the
            contrary, strictly bibliographical evidence such as that about the <hi rend="italic"
              >tel's</hi> and the press variants&mdash;evidence which usually appears in <pb
              n="003.058"/> texts if one digs deep enough&mdash;crosses the line of probability into
            something close to the field which in science would be regarded as controlled experiment
            capable of being reproduced. Instead of high probability we have, in fact, practical
            demonstration on physical evidence of a mechanical nature, demonstrable by a mechanical
            process, evidence like the prose and verse measures of <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>,
            and this is what Greg means by bibliography's treatment of a book as a material object.
            To every point in my construction of the case for 72a as the first edition, alternatives
            could have been suggested, and therefore any credibility it possessed depended on the
            cumulative bulk of the inferences. Yet when actual bibliographical evidence enters the
            scene, one little <hi rend="italic">tel's</hi> sweeps all before it.</p>
          <p>I draw the further moral as this applies to editing. Such minute yet crucial evidence
            on which the case hinges would normally be discoverable only by an editor. For example,
            the ordinary tests which a descriptive bibliographer would apply could not determine the
            truth; hence, if a textual critic, faced with the problem of corruption versus
            correction, felt that the standard bibliography of Dryden had sufficiently set up the
            material for him to proceed with 72a as his copy-text (and he could very well do so), he
            would be most seriously misled if he failed to come upon the bibliographical points
            which destroy Macdonald's case.</p>
          <p>In this paper I seem to have given a considerable number of examples where
            bibliographers were wrong. I have not intended to cast doubts on the validity of
            bibliographical findings, or to speak in a way to discourage the faint-hearted from
            depending upon bibliographical evidence. Quite the reverse. What has been paramount in
            my mind is, first, that bibliography may sometimes be imperfectly practised; and unless
            a textual critic is himself enough of a bibliographer to make his own discoveries
            independently, or else to submit existing bibliographical conclusions about his material
            to the acid test of his own bibliographical re-evaluation&mdash;unless he can do this,
            in many cases he will be living in a fool's paradise, either believing that there are no
            bibliographical problems, or else that the bibliographers have authoritatively worked
            over the material for him and he can go ahead on his own line without further
            consideration.</p>
          <p>Secondly, this principle seeps down from the very top, or the <pb n="003.059"/> choice
            and treatment of the copy-text, to the very bottom of the last, minute detail of an
            old-spelling critical edition which must be exhausted bibliographically before pure
            criticism can properly operate.</p>
          <p>Thus I think we may freely say that the bibliographer's text is by no means always the
            best that can be contrived if the editor has not got the mind of a true textual
            critic&mdash;only perhaps that such a text does the minimum of harm. On the other hand,
            as a practising bibliographer I do object mightily to critics who often nullify the
            brilliance of their substantive text by failing to observe bibliographical principles
            when they engage themselves to an old-spelling edition. I should be inclined to set up
            four operations which an old-spelling editor should perform, for the interpretation and
            application of the evidence discovered by these investigations lie at the heart of a
            sound edition. It is astonishing to a bibliographer to find how often various of these
            have been omitted by an editor who otherwise has exhibited every desire to be scrupulous
            in the details of his work. First, the determination of authority in all early editions
            and, on this evidence, the proper choice and treatment of the copy-text as we have heard
            it described by Greg. Second, the collation of multiple copies of each authoritative
            edition to disclose proof-corrections for analysis. Third, the analysis of
            running-titles for the interpretation of the presswork, a matter which is closely linked
            with the fourth, or compositor analysis, this last being positively essential, at least
            in Elizabethan texts, for any consideration of the variants between two or more
            authoritative editions in a direct line of derivation.</p>
          <p>These few demands are not especially severe and need not require any extraordinary
            technical training. But I place them as the basis for any bibliographical preparation of
            an individual text by an editor once the larger questions have been settled. And until
            they become standard procedure, at least in cases of any complexity where their chief
            value is found, our old-spelling texts are not going to be definitive in any real sense.
            Critical brilliance can settle many a substantive crux, although by no means all of
            them; but if these excellent major substantives are placed in a semi-substantive
            old-spelling background which is not itself accurate, then the reason for old-spelling
            texts degenerates into sentimentality or ostentation. Moreover, by an accurate
            background <pb n="003.060"/> of accidentals and minor substantives, much more should be
            implied in many cases than the mechanical ability to copy and then proofread accurately
            from an old edition. If we are to learn to reconstruct the accidentals and minor
            substantives of an author's manuscript with as much care as we labor over reconstructing
            his correct major substantives, a whole new and delicate biblio-critical art is involved
            in which criticism by itself can never be a sufficiently scientific instrument.</p>
          <p>I shall try to summarize the main points at which I have glanced. First, both textual
            criticism and analytical bibliography in their purest states are, in my opinion,
            independent arts which have no necessary relation in their disciplines, or frequently in
            the subjects with which they concern themselves. Textual criticism must deal with words
            and their meanings, with stylistic and linguistic considerations, and with the basic
            questions of authority in texts, both in whole and in part. Pure analytical
            bibliography, on the other hand, deals with books as material objects formed by the
            mechanical process of printing. In many investigations it is not concerned with texts as
            such; but when it does approach texts it endeavors to treat them not from the literary
            or critical point of view, which is that of the 'goodness' of readings, but instead as
            pieces of paper mechanically impressed with certain symbols. The mechanical relation
            between these sets of symbols is thereupon its chief concern.</p>
          <p>Second, although the two methods are essentially independent, textual criticism cannot
            controvert accurate bibliography in its findings when the subject is one on which
            bibliography can properly operate. However, the two often join in attacking certain
            problems of texts. These problems are by no means limited to editing, but nevertheless
            the construction of a critical text is most commonly the point at which the two methods
            cross.</p>
          <p>Third, even though the first and the last approach to a text must be the
            bibliographical one, neither method can achieve definitive textual results in any
            detailed manner if utilized without reference to the other. On a broad scale it is
            bibliography which establishes the physical facts of the derivation of texts from one
            another and which wrings from a given book every last drop of information about the
            mechanical process of its printing that may be of service in determining the relation of
            the printed result to <pb n="003.061"/> the manuscript or printed copy used by the
            printer. Still on a broad scale, it is the function of textual criticism to evaluate the
            authority of this manuscript and then to proceed to the correctness and the authority of
            the words in the text in the light of the ascertained physical facts which bibliography
            has furnished. Thereupon, in the process of fixing the text of a modern critical edition
            in every possible detail, the two methods are often so closely conjoined that an attempt
            to separate their respective functions would be futile.</p>
          <p>When we come to criticize the average edited text produced today, we find that the
            usual source of error lies in the insufficient bibliographical training of the editor.
            Either he has little concept of textual problems, and&mdash;scornful of the minutiae
            which sometimes concern the bibliographer&mdash;is content to have any kind of a text,
            because what he really wants is only a peg on which to hang his annotations; or else he
            is overconfident in his purely critical abilities to solve any problems which may arise.
            In either case he has ventured on a delicate literary task without knowing his grammar,
            and hence his results can seldom be definitive. Sometimes even greater harm is caused by
            a little knowledge than by none. It is enough to make the angels weep to find
            Saintsbury, for example, throwing out various correct readings in Scott's text of <hi
              rend="italic">The Wild Gallant</hi>, derived from edition 72b through the Folio and a
            later edition, to substitute absolute corruptions from 72a under the illusion he was
            restoring the purity of the text from the first edition. Or to find Davenport in the new
            edition of Joseph Hall's <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> declining the editorial
            responsibility to make a choice of readings, and basing his text on the derived reprint
            of 1598 for the first six books of <hi rend="italic">Virgidemiarum</hi>, even though it
            was slightly revised, rather than the purer 1597 first edition.<ref target="f003.03.27"
              n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref> It is really the hardest job in the world for a
            bibliographer to convince a critic who is beginning to be conscious of old-spelling
            problems that an author did not set his own type, seldom proof-read his book and if he
            did cannot be taken as approving every minute detail of its accidentals, and that a
            printed book is a fallible second-hand report of the author's manuscript, not a
            facsimile of it set in type.<ref target="f003.03.28" n="28"><hi rend="super"
              >28</hi></ref> One of the chief functions of textual bibliography <pb n="003.062"/> is
            to try to pierce this veil of the printing process and to restore, however imperfectly,
            the authority of the manuscript, which we know only through its printed and thus
            secondary form.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, a bibliographer who tackles the problems of text with insufficient
            critical and philological training is also in danger of false judgments in decisions
            which are not material and are therefore not strictly the business of bibliography. The
            usual result is that he may retreat to the narrowest conservatism to avoid having to
            face up to problems which are not wholly factual. And this timidity is as unbalanced as
            a critic's rashness in proceeding without the counterweight of bibliography. Such
            critical uncertainty may lead to good reprints of a single authority for a text but by
            no means to a true edition of the best text of an author.</p>
          <p>It seems to me that for an ideally definitive work an editor must combine in himself
            the knowledge of both methods, and the training to put both into practice, or else he
            must resort to an almost impossible attempt at collaboration. Collaboration can be
            effective between a bibliographer and a literary critic who will handle all problems of
            biography, attribution of authorship, literary estimates, and who will write the
            critical introductions and illustrative notes. In such a case each has his relatively
            independent responsibilities; and indeed Greg is inclined to recommend this procedure
            for many editions. But I find it harder to imagine save in the most exceptional
            circumstances an effective collaboration of bibliographer and critic on the minutiae of
            the text.</p>
          <p>I disclaim bibliography as the usurper of editorial privilege, and indeed I am
            concerned to aid the textual critic against the increasing pressure which
            editor-bibliographers are exerting on him. But if this potentially most valuable kind of
            an editor is to produce texts which in every detail will stand up under the increasingly
            exact and rigorous standards which are now being applied to this form of scholarship, he
            must learn his bibliography with a thoroughness not previously thought necessary. Only
            by this wider extension of scholarship can texts be achieved which will not need to be
            done all over again by the next generation.</p>

          <p>TEXTS WHICH ARE PRESERVED IN MORE THAN one form are objects of study.</p>
          <p>I. One legitimate aim of such study is the formulation of a consistent way of dealing
            with variants, and so to make an orderly selection among them, in such a fashion that
            another student to whom the method has been explained, would be able to make reasonable
            predictions about which alternatives would be selected by the editor in given
            situations. This type of study can be called scientific textual study, and is separate
            from such types of textual study as have for their purpose the improvement or
            modernization of texts.</p>
          <p>II. The study of texts can be pursued along more than one line, or by various
            combinations of lines. There are four principal approaches.</p>
          <p>1. The arrangement of differences in the surviving texts can be studied, without
            attention to the nature of the differences. This constitutes distributional study.</p>
          <p>2. Individual differences can be compared with each other in the hope of discovering
            the direction of change. This constitutes genealogical study.</p>
          <p>3. The physical characteristics of the various versions can be studied in the hope of
            throwing light on the process of copying. This constitutes external study.</p>
          <pb n="003.064"/>
          <p>4. Differences can be compared for the purpose of selecting those which are
            stylistically preferable, offer the best sense, are free of mistakes of grammar or fact.
            This constitutes literary study.</p>
          <p>III. Each of the above methods of study rests on certain basic assumptions.</p>
          <p>1. Distributional study rests on the assumption that it is more likely that unity of
            manuscripts represents unity in their source than that it represents coincidence. For
            convenience this assumption will hereafter be called the postulate of unity.</p>
          <p>2. Genealogical study rests on the assumption that certain differences are more likely
            to have been produced by a given direction of change than by another, and the second
            assumption that differences of this type can be identified by examination.</p>
          <p>3. External study rests on the assumption that human or other activity involving
            physical objects leaves physical effects by which the activity can be traced.</p>
          <p>4. Literary study rests on the assumption that an author is less likely to make
            mistakes than is a copyist, and conversely that an author is more likely to produce a
            positive excellence than is a copyist.</p>
          <p>IV. These assumptions are not all equally probable, or equally necessary.</p>
          <p>1. The postulate of unity can not be evaluated in terms of controlled probabilities.
            Further, coincidence does indeed occur, both in manuscript transmission and daily life.
            The postulate is therefore an axiom, which like other axioms can be tested only by the
            partially effective device of reversal. That is, we can make the reverse assumption that
            unity is more likely to reflect coincidence than unity of source. It is immediately
            evident that the result of such a reverse assumption would be to group together the most
            dissimilar manuscripts, rather than the most similar. In actual fact, moreover, we act
            on the postulate of unity in our daily lives. When two students turn in identical
            examinations, we do not assume that likeness is the result of coincidence.</p>
          <p>2. The genealogical assumptions given above would be reasonably easy to establish
            empirically if no scribe ever deliberately <pb n="003.065"/> improved his text, but
            unfortunately the order of correction can reverse that of mechanical change. The
            assumptions, more generally stated, are contained in those underlying external study,
            and differ from those of external study only in that they are applied to language
            material, where those of external study are applied to physical (non-language)
            characteristics.</p>
          <p>3. The assumption underlying external study is the most far reaching of those here
            given, and is actually the assumption underlying the investigation of all past activity.
            We act on it so constantly that we scarcely realize it is an assumption, capable of
            being tested only by reversal&mdash;namely by assuming that activity never leaves
            observable traces.</p>
          <p>4. The assumption on which literary study rests is the least likely and the least
            necessary of the group. It is, however, often the basic assumption of an editor, either
            explicitly or implicitly held. It has been used as a reason for rejecting the results of
            bibliographical study by no less a scholar than the late Professor Kittredge.<ref
              target="f003.04.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> The assumption would be
            reasonable were authors different from other men (more particularly scribes) in being
            free from mistakes and stupidities. Unfortunately they are not, as we know if we
            remember Keats' "stout Cortez."<ref target="f003.04.02" n="2"><hi rend="super"
              >2</hi></ref> The assumption is not even acceptable if, as with such recent manuscript
            studies as those of Hitchcock and Wolf, it is made in the more limited form of a means
            of separating significant variants (mistakes) from nonsignificant variants.<ref
              target="f003.04.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> Essentially, such an
            assumption leads to <pb n="003.066"/> circularity. Variants are first judged as right or
            wrong. Rightness and wrongness is then used as a means of establishing authority, which
            in turn is used to establish rightness or wrongness. In other words, if it is possible
            to judge readings as right or wrong independent of authority, then no attention need be
            paid to authority.<ref target="f003.04.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref></p>
          <p>An even more important objection to the literary method is that as yet there is no
            convergence among critics as to what constitutes literary excellence. It is perhaps to
            be hoped that such convergence may emerge, but until it does, literary excellence can
            hardly be a tool in scientific investigation.</p>
          <p>I wish to be understood&mdash;I am not depreciating literary study, or literary
            criticism. Both have their own proper sphere, and both are legitimate forms of
            endeavour. I am merely saying that if the student of texts takes as his aim the orderly
            and methodical presentation of variants, he does well to ignore literary considerations.
                <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. In ignoring literary considerations I am following
              the practice of the most important of all general considerations of manuscript study,
              a work to which I owe a heavy debt throughout, <hi rend="italic">The Calculus of
                Variants</hi>, W. W. Greg, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1927.</q></p>
          <p>V. After the elimination of literary study, the remaining methods of study can be
            combined in various ways.</p>
          <p>1. Study of texts surviving in manuscript usually makes use of distributional and
            genealogical evidence. This method can be called, for lack of a better name, comparative
            study. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. I am here departing from traditional terminology
              as used by Greg and other students. The traditional term "genealogical" corresponds to
              my term "comparative," while "distributional" is not used.</q></p>
          <p>2. Study of printed texts often makes no use of distributional <pb n="003.067"/>
            evidence, since for reasons which will be supplied, such evidence is inapplicable. On
            the other hand, modern bibliography makes great and brilliant use of external evidence.
            Any method which makes use of external evidence, whether or not genealogical evidence is
            added to it, can be called bibliographical.</p>
          <p>3. Some term which would include all three methods, or any combination of them, is
            obviously needed. This is particularly so, since bibliographers are apt to think of
            their discipline as different from the study of books in manuscript, and are also apt to
            complain of the term bibliography because it is likely to be mistaken for the
            preparation of hand-lists. The matter is perhaps unimportant, but I should suggest <hi
              rend="italic">biblistics</hi>, or if this has too religious a sound, <hi rend="italic"
              >libristics</hi>. Both terms are on the analogy of such others as <hi rend="italic"
              >ballistics, linguistics</hi>.</p>
          <p>VI. It has been stated that the various methods of study can be combined to give
            complex methods. The various methods can not be combined in a random and inconsistent
            order, jumping from one to the other at will, unless the results are also to be random
            and inconsistent. It is then obvious that the student must know the advantages and
            limitations of each method, and be able to recognize which one he is using. Otherwise he
            will fail to exhaust a given method systematically before he passes on to another.</p>
          <p>VII. In all cases where all three types of evidence apply, the normally best order of
            application is distributional evidence first, then genealogical evidence, and external
            evidence last of all.</p>
          <p>1. Distribution of variants is an objective and readily verifiable set of facts.
            Further, if the student is lucky, it can lead to a complete and satisfactory conclusion,
            needing only checking from other types of evidence.</p>
          <p>2. Geneological evidence is less trustworthy than distributional evidence, since as has
            been said, the direction of change is different in processes of correction from what it
            is in mechanical copying. Geneological evidence needs, therefore, to be used in accord
            with conclusions drawn from previously studied distributional evidence. An example of a
            reading from <hi rend="italic">Philaster</hi> may make this statement clear. In Act III
            scene 1, line 201, appears a set of <pb n="003.068"/> variants, <hi rend="italic"
              >parallesse</hi> and <hi rend="italic">parallelless</hi> (there is a third variant
            which need not concern us). Arguing genealogically, one would suppose that the form
            which drops out one of the two identical series of letters is the younger variant. Yet
            if we check this genealogical conclusion by the distributional evidence it becomes
            untenable. The fuller form occurs only in a late and unauthoritative edition, and is
            therefore a correction which reverses the order of mechanical change. The mechanical
            change, in other words, occurred somewhere in the limbo of versions of the text which
            are beyond our reach.<ref target="f003.04.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref></p>
          <p>3. External evidence might be presumed to be better studied first, and indeed, for
            reasons of convenience, it is often at least presented in that position. However there
            are reasons why at least some of the results of external evidence can be disregarded in
            manuscript work, if comparative evidence applies.<ref target="f003.04.06" n="6"><hi
                rend="super">6</hi></ref> It should not be thought that the results of external
            evidence can be safely disregarded in their entirety, but since some of them can be thus
            disregarded, there is a danger of confusing the comparative study unless it is exhausted
            before an external approach is used.</p>
          <p>VIII. The types of evidence are not equally applicable to every situation. The
            frequency of applicability is the reverse of the proposed order of study.</p>
          <p>1. Since all texts must be preserved in some form, external evidence always applies. It
            is worth noting that the mere statement that a text is preserved only in memory is a
            piece of external evidence quite worth having, since it leads to a conclusion about the
            reliability of the text.</p>
          <p>2. Geneological evidence can be applied at any point where a text survives in differing
            form, but not at any point where a text survives in unity, no matter whether this unity
            is produced by the fact that there is only one manuscript, or because there is unity
            among multiple manuscripts. To apply genealogical methods at a point of unity becomes
            the same thing as the improvement of texts. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. The
              application of genealogical methods in the face of unity of the <pb n="003.069"/>
              manuscripts is inherent in the "common mistake" method which is the classical
              Lachmannian technique. Thus E. K. Rand, "Dom Quentin's Memoir on the Text of the
              Vulgate," <hi rend="italic">Harvard Theological Review</hi>, XVII (1924), 209, "The
              first thing for which I look in the apparatus is the presence of errors common to all
              the manuscripts, and I find . . . that there are no common errors. Our 21 manuscripts,
              then, do not descend from one faulty archetype." In other words, an editor in Rand's
              view, is perfectly justified in disregarding all manuscript evidence if he can find
              fault with it. Rand would almost have been forced to emend "stout Cortez" in Keats'
              sonnet.</q></p>
          <p>3. Distributional study can be used only in texts which survive in more than one form.
            It is often assumed that distributional evidence is valuable only if there are more than
            two manuscripts, but this assumption is not strictly true since when there are only two
            manuscripts, the editor must at least record the occurrence of unity and difference, and
            accept the unities.<ref target="f003.04.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref></p>
          <p>Distributional studies are powerless to deal with differences unless there are at least
            three surviving manuscripts, since in the two-text situation no variant has a better
            chance of having been in the original than another.</p>
          <p>Distributional studies, further, are not applicable to all texts which survive in
            multiple form. Before distributional study can be applied, the student must make the
            assumption that his text goes back to a single original, and that each version of it has
            been produced by a unified process of copying. If these are not reasonable assumptions,
            the method can not be applied. For instance we now know that the variant forms of
            differing exemplars of the same edition of an Elizabethan book are not the product of
            unified acts of copying, but are a nearly random arrangement of corrected and
            uncorrected press-variants. A student who attempted to draw a tree for such exemplars
            would be in a hopeless situation.</p>
          <p>Distributional studies become valueless when any type of evidence shows that the
            variant forms are the result of material revisions by the author or another. They
            remain, however, valuable up to the point at which such a conclusion is proved, and
            often distributional evidence at least contributes to such a conclusion. Thus the <hi
              rend="italic">Piers Plowman</hi> controversy arose because the distributional evidence
            had not been exhausted, so that it became possible to use genealogical evidence both to
            affirm and deny <pb n="003.070"/> multiple revision. An example of the effect of
            persistence in a distributional approach can be constructed with the aid of Meredith's
              <hi rend="italic">Evan Harrington</hi>, known to have been revised by the author. A
            passage in chapter eleven of that novel appears thus in the early form: <q>Eyes were on
              him, he could feel. It appeared that the company awaited his proceedings; . . .</q>
            And thus in the revised form: <q>Eyes were on him. This had ever the effect of causing
              him to swell to monstrous proportions in the histrionic line.</q> Were the fact of
            revision unknown, and were an editor sufficiently unwary, he might produce the following
            version, on the assumption that anything absent from either version was an omission from
            the original of both. <q>Eyes were on him, he could feel. This had ever the effect of
              causing him to swell to monstrous proportions in the histrionic line. It appeared that
              the company awaited his proceedings; . . .</q> In such a conflated passage, every word
            is genuine in the sense that it was written by Meredith, yet the totality of the passage
            is false.<ref target="f003.04.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref>

                rend="italic">Yale Studies in English</hi>, no. 96, 1942) a clear example of this
              principle. His study is of the manuscripts of Petrarch's Latin version of the story of
              Griselda. He begins by grouping certain manuscripts which lack material found in all
              the others. This group he sets up as family <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> He then goes on
              to set up a complete, but tentative tree not only for <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, but
              for all other families. All this he does on distributional evidence. He then turns to
              a genealogical study of the material lacking in <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. It is first
              of all striking that the text reads equally well with or without the additional
              material. He next turns to a further distributional fact, and its genealogical
              interpretation. The fact is that all the manuscripts which belong to <hi rend="italic"
                >d</hi> lack an accompanying letter of introduction which tells how the first
              version of the letter had gone astray, and that Petrarch had therefore found it
              necessary to rewrite it. From all this evidence he then rightly concludes that the
              longer manuscripts represent an author's revision, and that it is therefore necessary
              to draw two trees, one for <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, and one for all other
              manuscripts. Such orderly procedure seems a model of clarity.</q></p>
          <pb n="003.071"/>
          <p>IX. If it can be assumed that the distributional approach is valid, the student makes
            the following operational assumptions in applying it.</p>
          <p>1. Each manuscript before him is the result of copying from one exemplar, though this
            exemplar is not assumed to be the same for all manuscripts. Mixing of exemplars is
            assumed not to have taken place unless the variants can be explained in no other
            way.</p>
          <p>2. All manuscripts before him spring from some one ultimate exemplar, present or
            hypothetical, by one or more steps of derivation. This also will be assumed to be true
            unless proved otherwise.</p>
          <p>X. In collecting distributional evidence the student handles the following types of
            phenomena:</p>
          <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Unity</hi>. Whenever the same language symbol occurs at the same
            place in two or more manuscripts, this occurrence can be called a unity. The term "at
            the same place" is taken to mean "at the same position in a series of surrounding
            language symbols, whether or not the surrounding symbols constitute a unity."</p>
          <p>Unfortunately "language symbol" is not a transparently clear term, since such symbols
            are arranged in a hierarchical series of entities, which for our purposes can be defined
            as letters, words, sentences, and still larger units such as verses or paragraphs. Thus
            the occurrence of <hi rend="italic">honor</hi> in two manuscripts, once with a <hi
              rend="italic">u</hi>, and once without, is a word unity, though not a letter unity.
            Usually editors find themselves working on the word level, since most of the time the
            evidence from letters can not outweigh the evidence from words, and since the evidence
            from words will fully describe the evidence from larger units. It should be understood
            that I am using a definition of word which would be unsatisfactory in other contexts:
            namely that a word is any group of letters with a space before and after them, or
            habitually so written in forms later than the manuscript under discussion if the
            manuscript does not divide words.</p>
          <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Variation</hi>. The occurrence at the same place in two or more
            manuscripts, of differing language symbols, of zero and a language symbol, or of
            something not a language symbol and a language symbol, can be defined as variation or
            difference. The sum total of things occurring is a set of variants, and each thing which
            occurs is a variant.</p>
          <pb n="003.072"/>
          <p>XI. Both variation and unity, for purposes of comparative study, must be supposed to
            contain occurrences of language symbols. Examples of either unity or variation which do
            not contain language symbols belong rather to external than to comparative study. Things
            which are not considered to be language symbols can be exemplified by blots, tears,
            ornaments, <hi rend="italic">etc.</hi></p>
          <p>XII. Sets of variants are of differing sorts.</p>
          <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Positive sets</hi>. These are sets of variants consisting of
            different language symbols.</p>
          <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Variants consisting of a language symbol opposed to its
              absence</hi>. These are variants which include material which may be later defined as
            being either omissions, or additions. It is, however, important to avoid using the terms
            addition and omission until a conclusion has been reached. If the student is not using
            literary criteria, whether given variants are additions, omissions, or must remain
            undefined, can only be settled by all the distributional and other evidence. To use such
            a term as addition before that point, is to prejudge the evidence. A handy term which
            avoids the difficulty is "add-omission." <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. The general
              clarity of Severs' exposition of the manuscripts of Petrarch (<hi rend="italic">loc.
                cit.</hi>) is perhaps slightly marred by the fact that he sets up his family <hi
                rend="italic">d</hi> on the basis of "omissions." At worst the difficulty is only
              one of presentation, since at the end of his chapter he clears up the nature of this
              omitted material fully. But in reading the chapter for the first time, one is left in
              doubt as to the validity of his procedure, since if the missing material were genuine,
              omission would prove that <hi rend="italic">d</hi> was a late sub-family with an
              exclusive common ancestor, whereas if the material had been added later, the exclusive
              common ancestor would belong to the other manuscripts, not to <hi rend="italic"
              >d</hi>, and the common ancestor of <hi rend="italic">d</hi> would be the original of
              all manuscripts. Such a term as that I have proposed would avoid this
            difficulty.</q></p>
          <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Sets which contain one member which is not a language symbol</hi>.
            These sets can be of significance only if the variants resemble each other physically or
            otherwise. Thus if one manuscript shows a small stain, and the other a comma, or if one
            shows an illustration, and the other substitutes a description of the illustration's
            contents, the conditions are fulfilled.</p>
          <p>XIII. The following phenomena do not constitute either <pb n="003.073"/> unities or
            sets of variants for comparative study, though some may be significant for external
            study.</p>
          <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The occurrence of zero in two or more manuscripts</hi>. Obvious as
            the statement may be, it is impossible to argue that two manuscripts are different
            because one leaves out <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, and the other leaves out <hi
              rend="italic">which</hi>. It is likewise impossible to argue, as emenders do, that all
            manuscripts of a text are descended from a single corrupt ancestor, differing from an
            unrecoverable original, because all manuscripts leave out something.</p>
          <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The occurrence of non-language objects in two or more
              manuscripts</hi>. Thus the occurrence of the same ornament does not constitute a unity
            for comparative purposes (however significant externally), nor does the occurrence of
            two blots.</p>
          <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The occurrence of a non-language object at the same place with a
              language symbol to which it bears no resemblance</hi>. For instance, a scribble may
            occur in one manuscript where the other has a line of verse. Such phenomena become
            simply add-omissions.</p>
          <p>XIV. The first step in actual study is the tabulation of all sets of variants,
            disregarding unities. Unities can merely reflect the single original of all manuscripts,
            and so are worthless for showing differences of derivation, no matter how much the
            student is forced to rely on them in his final critical text. <q><hi rend="italic"
                >Note</hi>. Elaborate directions for the tabulation of variants are given in the
              writings of Dom Quentin and the various treatises derived from his work. See
              particularly, Henri Quentin, <hi rend="italic">Memoire sur l'Etablissement du Texte de
                la Vulgate</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Collectanea Biblica Latina</hi> VI; Rome and
              Paris: Descl&eacute;e and Gabalda), 1922, page 227, Quentin, <hi rend="italic">Essais
                de Critique Textuelle</hi> (Paris: Picard, 1926), pp. 63-72. The presentation of
              such statistical tables has been strongly attacked, but seems to me one of the great
              virtues of Quentin's method.</q></p>
          <p>XV. When the tabulation of variants is complete, the next step is an attempt to
            assemble groups of manuscripts. The set of concepts used here are as follows:</p>
          <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Derivation</hi>. I have refrained from using the word copying,
            since the two things are different. The distributional student is forced to assume a
            working hypothesis of copying whenever the arrangement of variants is such as to be
            compatible with it. Actual copying, on the other hand, is a physical fact, provable <pb
              n="003.074"/> only by external evidence. Suppose that our distributional student has
            this situation: manuscript <hi rend="italic">A</hi> shares readings with all individual
            manuscripts, and has no unique readings. Manuscript <hi rend="italic">B</hi> shares
            readings only with A, and has some unique readings. Such a state of affairs is not
            compatible with supposing that <hi rend="italic">A</hi> is copied from <hi rend="italic"
              >B</hi>, since then the shared readings of <hi rend="italic">A</hi> are left
            unexplained. The supposition that <hi rend="italic">B</hi> is copied from <hi
              rend="italic">A</hi> is not contradicted by this arrangement of variants, and the
            student will therefore adopt it. It is, however, merely a hypothesis adopted for the
            sake of describing the relationship of variants, and is in no case proof that actual
            copying occurred, since a long series of lost manuscripts may intervene. Further, if a
            new series of manuscripts is discovered whose variants change the relationship of the
            whole group, the student will be forced to change his hypothesis. Thus in all such
            situations it is advisable to speak of derivation&mdash;defined as a state of affairs
            compatible with a hypothesis of copying&mdash;rather than to speak of copying. The
            terminology is more important than it seems, since if copying is the term used, there is
            grave danger of misunderstanding the nature of the diagram in which the comparative
            student states his results.</p>
          <p>Another way of stating the operational hypothesis or procedure here described, is to
            say that the student begins by supposing, in turn, that each manuscript is derivable
            from each other, and rejects that supposition each time that he finds evidence to
            contradict it.</p>
          <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Absolute unity</hi>. Whenever two manuscripts are absolutely alike
            in the language symbols contained, they can be treated as one, and it makes no
            difference which one is chosen to exemplify the pair. This obvious statement is
            necessary to justify the practise of modern students who often work with photostatic
            copies rather than originals. The practise is interesting, since to say that an original
            mediaeval manuscript is copied from a modern photostat is nonsense, but to say that its
            readings are derivable from those of the photostat is acceptable enough. Once again,
            derivation and copying are different things.</p>
          <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Families</hi>, <hi rend="italic">sub-families</hi>, <hi
              rend="italic">lines of descent</hi>. Every group of manuscripts which share a group of
            variants in opposition to those found in others will be spoken of as a family, derivable
            from some one manuscript, extant or hypothetical, spoken of as an <pb n="003.075"/>
            ancestor. A sub-family is a family whose ancestor is derivable from a manuscript which
            is the ancestor of still other manuscripts. A line of descent is a family, or family and
            sub-family, which share no ancestor with other families except the original from which
            all manuscripts are derived.</p>
          <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Hypothetical manuscript</hi>. A hypothetical manuscript is one
            which must be posited to explain similarities between two or more other manuscripts,
            extant or hypothetical. The explanation of such unities is the only reason for which a
            distributional or comparative student can posit such a manuscript. All other reasons are
            outside the reach of comparative evidence. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. This
              terminology differs slightly from that employed by Greg, <hi rend="italic">op.
                cit.</hi>, pp. 2-3. Greg speaks of inferential manuscripts defined as are my
              hypothetical manuscripts, and then of others whose existence is suggested by
              non-comparative evidence, which he calls potential manuscripts. The essential
              difference is that I am denying that the comparative student can ever take account of
              potential manuscripts, so that Greg's distinction is unnecessary in my
            approach.</q></p>
          <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Original</hi>. This is the manuscript, hypothetical or extant, and
            presumed to be single unless proved otherwise, from which all extant and hypothetical
            manuscripts are derived. It is important to understand its nature. Since all that we
            know of it is ultimately derived from extant manuscripts, the original can have no
            characteristics not found in some at least of the extant manuscripts. The original,
            therefore, must be presumed to be the last version of the text produced before copying
            of the extant manuscripts and their ancestors began. Any number of lost versions may
            intervene between it and the author's original, which is forever out of our reach.
                <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. This view of the original has been held by many of
              the ablest students of texts, e.g. Greg, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi>, and John M.
              Manly and Edith Rickert, <hi rend="italic">The Text of the Canterbury Tales</hi>
              (University of Chicago Press, 1940), II, pp. 40-41. The view is also in accord with
              the view of the nature of starred ancestral forms held by modern linguists in the
              closely similar activity of linguistic reconstruction. For all that, the view is not
              universally held, necessary as it would seem to be. Note the explicit statement of
              Wolf, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi>, that the aim of his study was to recover the
              author's original. What I have called the original is what is called the archetype in
              Lachmannian textual criticism. I am, of course, denying that the "original" in the
              Lachmann sense is recoverable.</q></p>
          <pb n="003.076"/>
          <p>Well known as such statements about the nature of the original may be, they are still
            necessary since they close the door to much speculative tampering with texts. If the
            author's original is out of our reach, how much further out of our reach the author's
            intention&mdash;what he meant to write, but did not&mdash;must be! Yet, for instance,
            modern editors still defend Theobald's famous "'a babbled of green fields" on the ground
            that this is what Shakespeare must have meant to write.<ref target="f003.04.09" n="9"
                ><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> I am not, of course, denying that Theobald's words
            are infinitely superior to those of the old text, nor that I should experience a sense
            of loss in a reading text which did not adopt the emendation. Yet it remains true that
            the emendation is without authority.</p>
          <p>XVI. Distributional evidence can establish the fact of derivation from a common
            ancestor. When, however, a single group of manuscripts is being considered in relation
            to the rest, agreement merely offers proof of some common ancestor, and does not define
            the relationship of that ancestor to manuscripts outside the group showing agreement.
            Thus if <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi> agree 99 times against the
            rest, <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi> have a common ancestor, but
            this ancestor may be derived from one of the other manuscripts, hypothetical or extant,
            or may even be the ancestor of all texts. Only the sum total of distributional evidence
            for all families offers any conclusion, or possibility of conclusion, about the exact
            nature of derivational relationships. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. It is exactly this
              sort of situation which faced Severs (<hi rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi>), in his
              development of family <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. The eight manuscripts which he set up
              as family <hi rend="italic">d</hi> agreed 13 times against all others. All but two of
              these agreements consisted of add-omissions absent in <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> Not
              until all the distributional evidence had been surveyed, and then only with
              considerable appeal to genealogical evidence, could Severs conclude that in effect the
                <hi rend="italic">d</hi> manuscripts were descended from <hi rend="italic">O</hi>,
              and that all others were descended from a later revision.</q></p>
          <pb n="003.077"/>
          <p>XVII. Normally some distributional evidence will be contradictory. Suppose that
            manuscript <hi rend="italic">A</hi> shares 99 readings with <hi rend="italic">B</hi> and
              <hi rend="italic">C</hi>, which form a group that has previously been defined as
            exclusive. There are 4 readings which <hi rend="italic">A</hi> shares with <hi
              rend="italic">D</hi> and <hi rend="italic">E</hi>, also previously defined as
            exclusive. For the neatness of manuscript diagrams, it would be convenient if such
            difficulties did not arise, but all manuscript experience leads the student to resign
            himself to them.</p>
          <p>XVIII. The postulate of unity was given in the form "it is more likely that unity among
            manuscripts reflects unity of source than that it reflects coincidence." The form of the
            postulate carefully avoids denial that coincidence&mdash;whether caused by convergence
            of change or by contamination&mdash;can and does occur. Yet if coincidence is less
            likely, it ought to occur less often, even though there is no accurate way of measuring
            what the proportions of occurrence should be. All that can be said is that the greater
            the disparity in frequency, the more likely it is that the smaller group represents
            coincidence. The proportion of 4 to 99 would probably trouble no wise editor. The closer
            the frequency comes to equality, then, the more suspicious the conclusion becomes. As a
            result of the fact that frequency of agreement and disagreement is a check on
            conclusions as to which readings reflect unity and which reflect coincidence, it becomes
            important for a student always to present a statement of the total distributional
            evidence in statistical form.</p>
          <p>XIX. Distributional facts settle some questions about the nature of derivation. Thus if
            in a group of more than two manuscripts having a common ancestor, all manuscripts have
            unique readings, and all manuscripts have shared readings in no constant arrangement,
            these facts are compatible only with derivation of the type known as radiation, in which
            all manuscripts are derived directly from the ancestor with no intervening
              sub-ancestors.<ref target="f003.04.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> On the
            other hand, if the relationship is constant, so that the shared readings of <hi
              rend="italic">A</hi> are always shared only with <hi rend="italic">B</hi>, the facts
            can be taken to be incompatible with radiation. <pb n="003.078"/>
            <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. For our purposes, it makes little difference whether the
              student works directly with an arrangement of manuscripts thought of as proving or
              disproving a given kind of derivation, or if he works with the Quentin concept of
              "intermediaries." The Quentin term is a useful tool, but eventually arrives at
              essentially the same result as is stated in this paragraph. After the intermediaries
              have been studied and interpreted in terms of derivation, it is again shown that
              distributional evidence can prove the existence or non-existence of radiation, but can
              not settle the exact type of derivation if radiation is non-existent. The Quentin term
              "intermediary" can be briefly defined as a manuscript from a group of three related
              manuscripts chosen for comparison, of such a character that the other two manuscripts
              do not agree against it. Thus if manuscripts <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, <hi
                rend="italic">B</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">C</hi> constitute a family, Quentin
              would study the agreements and disagreements among them. If <hi rend="italic">A</hi>
              and <hi rend="italic">B</hi> agree in some readings against <hi rend="italic">C</hi>,
              and <hi rend="italic">B</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C</hi> agree in some readings
              against <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                >C</hi> never agree against <hi rend="italic">B</hi>, <hi rend="italic">B</hi> is
              then defined as an intermediary. But the statement that it is an intermediary is not
              the same thing as saying that it is the ancestor, since it may be the ancestor of the
              other two, may be the middle term in a straight line derivation, or may be in still
              other relations to <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C</hi>. The concept
              can, however, be used to establish radiation. Suppose that there are four manuscripts,
                <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, <hi rend="italic">B</hi>, <hi rend="italic">C</hi>, and
                <hi rend="italic">D</hi>. If <hi rend="italic">A</hi> is intermediary in every
              combination of three, then all manuscripts are in radiation from <hi rend="italic"
                >A.</hi> If the relationship is not radiation, then the most that determination of
              the intermediaries can do is to place some limitation on the possible relationships.
              Thus if the family of three is in a straight line derivation and <hi rend="italic"
                >B</hi> is the intermediary, as above, either <hi rend="italic">A</hi> or <hi
                rend="italic">C</hi> can be the original of the other two, but <hi rend="italic"
                >B</hi> can not. Much the same sort of limitation, however, is arrived at by other
              means of studying distribution, as will be shown later. The wise student will, then,
              use whatever means of comparative study offers him the best possibility of reaching
              conclusions. The Quentin method is developed in the works by him already cited, but is
              perhaps most clearly explained in Severs, "Quentin's Theory of Textual Criticism," <hi
                rend="italic">English Institute Annual 1941</hi> (Columbia University Press, 1942),
              pp. 65-93.</q></p>
          <p>XX. Distributional facts do not settle all questions of the nature of derivation. As
            stated above, distributional facts can establish radiation or the absence of it, but if
            radiation is absent, distribution can not establish the nature of derivation more
            narrowly. That is to say, distributional facts make the presence of sub-families
            evident, but will not demonstrate which groups are families and which sub-families,
            unless in turn the ancestral manuscripts can be shown to be derived by radiation.</p>
          <p>An example may make the statement that distributional facts <pb n="003.079"/> can not
            offer a complete solution unless the relationship of groups is radiational, somewhat
            clearer. Suppose that <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi> agree 99
            times against <hi rend="italic">C</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D</hi> where <hi
              rend="italic">C</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D</hi> disagree with each other. <hi
              rend="italic">C</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D</hi> agree against <hi rend="italic"
              >A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi> 101 times where <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi
              rend="italic">B</hi> disagree with each other. These facts can be taken as
            incompatible with radiation. That is to say, <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi
              rend="italic">B</hi> have an ancestor which we can call <hi rend="italic">x</hi>, and
              <hi rend="italic">C</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D</hi> have an ancestor which we can
            call <hi rend="italic">y</hi>. The possibility that <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi
              rend="italic">y</hi> are descended by radiation from the original, <hi rend="italic"
              >O</hi>, can be disregarded as uneconomical (as I will show), but two other
            possibilities remain, namely that <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is derived from <hi
              rend="italic">y</hi>, and that <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is derived from <hi
              rend="italic">x</hi>. No further arrangement of readings within <hi rend="italic"
              >ABCD</hi> will establish one of these alternatives. If, for instance, there are some
            readings where <hi rend="italic">B</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C</hi> agree against
            diversity in <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D</hi>, the most that can be
            said is that this suggests that in these instances the readings of <hi rend="italic"
              >x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> were like those now found in <hi rend="italic"
              >B</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C</hi>. Further, if there are some readings where <hi
              rend="italic">B</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C</hi> agree against unity in <hi
              rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D</hi>, we are forced to say that one set
            of agreements is the result of coincidence, and have still learned nothing about the
            relationship of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi>. <q><hi
                rend="italic">Note</hi>. It is this sort of difficulty that Joseph Bedier perceived
              and made use of as one of his most telling arguments against the whole of comparative
              study. In his <hi rend="italic">La Tradition Manuscrite du Lai de l'Ombre</hi>
              (reprint from <hi rend="italic">Romania</hi>; Paris: Champion, 1929), pp. 51-52,
              occurs this possible tree for the <hi rend="italic">Lai</hi>: <!--<figure entity="sb03791"
                /> --> In this tree <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is a manuscript posited merely for sake of
              argument, not actual or hypothetical. Bedier sets it up as differing from <hi
                rend="italic">w</hi> five times only, and makes the further condition that in all of
              these readings it agrees with <hi rend="italic">z</hi>. It is thus, in Quentin's
              terms, intermediate between <hi rend="italic">w</hi> and <hi rend="italic">z</hi>.
              Bedier then goes on to say that all the relationships expressed by the tree above
              would be equally well expressed by this alternate tree, with <hi rend="italic">r</hi>
              made the archetype. <pb n="003.080"/>
              <!--<figure entity="sb03801"/>  --> In spite of the fact that these two trees as drawn by
              Bedier are open to some criticism, he is quite right in his main statement, since it
              amounts to no more than saying that distributional evidence will not settle whether it
              is <hi rend="italic">w</hi> or <hi rend="italic">r</hi> which equals <hi rend="italic"
                >O</hi>. To settle this question he would have had to give us the five readings, and
              let us decide on genealogical grounds which tree was better.</q></p>
          <p>If, however, we discover a new group of manuscripts which have a common ancestor <hi
              rend="italic">z</hi>, we can now compare the readings of <hi rend="italic">x</hi>, <hi
              rend="italic">y</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">z</hi>, and may be able to establish that
            contrary to our earlier necessary assumption, all three are derived by radiation from
              <hi rend="italic">O</hi>. We should not, of course, be troubled by the fact that new
            evidence upsets a previous hypothesis, but should on the other hand be thankful that our
            problems are now fully settled. If, however, the relationship of <hi rend="italic"
              >x</hi>, <hi rend="italic">y</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">z</hi> is not radiation,
            there will be a constant grouping of two (<hi rend="italic">xy</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
              >xz</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">yz</hi>) and the only economical hypothesis is that one
            of the members of the constant group of two is identical with <hi rend="italic">O</hi>.
            But there is again no distributional evidence which will identify for us which of the
            two manuscripts is <hi rend="italic">O</hi>; in other words, we can not define
            distributionally which is derived from the other.</p>
          <p>XXI. The above discussion of ancestral relationships has implied the existence of a
            tool which has not yet been defined. This is the reconstructed or ancestral reading,
            which is the result in individual instances of the postulate of unity. The purpose of
            setting up ancestral readings is twofold. First, only by setting up such readings is it
            possible to examine whether the readings of possible daughter manuscripts are really
            compatible with a hypothesis of derivation; and second, the setting up of ancestral
            readings reduces the number of variants with which the student <pb n="003.081"/> must
            deal, so that when ancestral readings have been set up in successive stages, the student
            can eventually begin to set up the readings of <hi rend="italic">O</hi> by a relatively
            simple process of selection. The reconstruction of readings on distributional evidence
            can be reduced to a few type situations.</p>
          <p>1. If there are only two manuscripts, the ancestral readings can be given only where
            the manuscripts agree. This statement holds also for any situation where more than two
            manuscripts have been previously reduced to two ancestral manuscripts. <q><hi
                rend="italic">Note</hi>. It should be pointed out that an ancestral reading is
              simply the reading of an ancestral manuscript, and need not be the reading of a
              hypothetical ancestral manuscript. In the two-text situation, as will develop later,
              ancestral readings are commonly the readings of one of the extant manuscripts.</q></p>
          <p>2. If there are more than two manuscripts in radiational relationship, the ancestral
            readings can be given where all the manuscripts agree, and also where some of the
            manuscripts agree against diversity in the rest.</p>
          <p>3. If the group concerned is a sub-family, its ancestral readings can be given where
            all the manuscripts of the sub-family agree, or wherever one or more manuscripts of the
            sub-family show a reading supported outside the sub-family at a point where the other
            members of the sub-family show divergence from each other.</p>
          <p>4. In all other situations where reconstruction of readings is possible, some reliance
            must be placed on genealogical or other non-distributional evidence.</p>
          <p>XXII. When distributional evidence has been exhausted, the student must proceed to
            genealogical evidence. Geneological evidence can be summed up as the examination of the
            content of sets of variants for the purpose of answering the following generalized
            question: Is it more likely that <hi rend="italic">A</hi> is derived from <hi
              rend="italic">B</hi>, that <hi rend="italic">B</hi> is derived from <hi rend="italic"
              >A</hi>, or are the probabilities equally balanced? Readings where the change seems
            equally likely to have occurred in either direction can be called reversible, those in
            which the order of change seems more likely in one direction than the other can be
            called non-reversible. The first task of the student is to separate the reversible
            readings from the non-reversible. Thereafter the reversible readings are to be
            disregarded.</p>
          <pb n="003.082"/>
          <p>XXIII. It is not my purpose to summarize the nature of nonreversible readings, since
            bibliographers who deal with such entities can be expected to know much more about them
            than can a strayed linguist like myself. There are, however, two types which I should
            like to discuss.</p>
          <p>1. Instances where a non-language object varies with a language symbol, over a bridge
            of similarity between the two. A brilliant piece of genealogical reasoning which
            illustrates this type of variation is Brusendorff's conclusion that the unique reading
            in one manuscript of Chaucer's <hi rend="italic">Purse</hi> "that of eye lowness hath no
            peer" can be derived from the usual reading "yellowness" by the bridge of an ancestral
            manuscript which read "yelowness" with accidental obliteration of the first <hi
              rend="italic">l</hi>. That is to say the non-language characteristic of faintness of a
            letter was interpreted as a meaningful space between words.<ref target="f003.04.11"
              n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> Similar would be the not infrequent instances of
            variation between a smudge and a mark of punctuation. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>.
              Probably the <hi rend="italic">locus classicus</hi> of genealogical evidence of this
              particular type is to be found in the manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic"
                >Dialogues</hi> of Epictetus. One manuscript (<hi rend="italic">Bodleianus, Cod.
                Graec. Miscellanei</hi> 251) has a greasy stain which covers text at the beginning
              of chapter 18 of the first book. All other manuscripts have a blank corresponding
              exactly to the number of letters covered by the stain, or present the letters which
              appear on either side of the stain, without recognition of missing material. In
              consequence editors have recognized <hi rend="italic">Bodleianus</hi> as the archetype
              of all known manuscripts. The course of the reasoning leading to such a conclusion is
              clear. It is more easily believable that copyists of manuscripts derived from <hi
                rend="italic">Bodleianus</hi> should have come upon the stain and been unable to
              decipher the letters which it covered, than that the copyist of <hi rend="italic"
                >Bodleianus</hi> should have worked from a manuscript containing a blank, and have
              then concealed his inability to fill in the blank by putting text into it and covering
              it with a stain which made the text illegible. For the material on this manuscript
              family consult Joseph Souilh&eacute;, ed. and trans., <hi rend="italic"
                >Epict&egrave;te Entretiens</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Livre I</hi> (Paris:
              Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'&Eacute;dition "Les Belles Lettres," 1943), p. lxxii.</q></p>
          <p>2. If a set of variants consists of a non-existent and an existent language form, and
            if further, the non-existent form can be explained as the result of a known type of
            mechanical error such as <pb n="003.083"/> eye-skip, haplography, or the like, the
            existent form can be presumed to be the earlier, unless the distributional evidence
            proves otherwise. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. A typical, if somewhat extreme,
              example of a non-existent form fully explainable by a series of mechanical errors, is
              cited by Havet, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> p. 25. A single palimpsest manuscript
              of Cicero has the startling form COSOSNECVTVTVTVSEGVTVS . Part of this multiple error,
              resulting in a form which is both unique and scarcely conceivable as an existent Latin
              form, is due to misinterpretation of abbreviations ("coss. consecutus," <hi
                rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, "consulibus consecutus"), and part to the well known
              mechanical error of perseverence. It is no wonder that Collomp (<hi rend="italic">op.
                cit.</hi> p. 9) remarks that this scribe must have been overcome by sleep. The
              reading of this manuscript is unique, so that an editor would be justified in
              rejecting it out of hand. Were it, on the contrary, supported in a large number of
              manuscripts, the distributional evidence might force the conclusion that the mistake
              was in the original. The presence of a known type of error can, of course, be used to
              decide the direction of change, even if all the several forms are existent, and offer
              perfect sense. An example of this sort of conclusion is found in Rand, (<hi
                rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> pp. 257-58, quoting Quentin <hi rend="italic"
                >Memoire</hi> p. 477, and <hi rend="italic">Genesis</hi> 19,8). In this passage the
              variants, all of which offer sense, are as follows: <l>sub umbra culminis mei (9
                mss.)</l>
              <l>sub umbraculum culminis mei (2 mss.)</l>
              <l>sub umbraculum tegminis mei (5 mss.)</l> Quentin regards "umbra culminis" as
              derived from "umbraculum tegminis" by the omission of "-um teg-." Rand properly
              derives "umbra culminis" not from the source suggested by Quentin but from "umbraculum
              culminis" by omission of "-um cul-," which can be accounted for by eye-skip, where the
              omission suggested by Quentin can not be correlated with such a type of known
              error.</q> The caution given above is necessary, since the mistake may have been in
              <hi rend="italic">O</hi>, and the existent form produced by later correction; the
            relation of the readings <hi rend="italic">parallesse</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
              >parallelless</hi> cited earlier is an example of this sort of reversal. Nonetheless,
            it seems a safe assumption that the number of mechanical mistakes will exceed the number
            of conscious corrections&mdash;at least my own experience with secretaries seems to bear
            it out.<ref target="f003.04.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref></p>
          <p>The terms existent and non-existent used above need some <pb n="003.084"/> explanation.
            I have purposely avoided such terms as right, expected, or understandable, since to use
            them would be to reintroduce the literary criterion which I have attempted to avoid.
            Further, a form may obviously be existent without being understandable, as Professor
            Menner has shown with the unintelligible "lad hem bi lag mon" of <hi rend="italic"
              >Gawain and the Green Knight</hi>.<ref target="f003.04.13" n="13"><hi rend="super"
                >13</hi></ref> To use the term non-existent, however, necessitates an assumption
            which is inescapable, even though we know it to be false. To say that a form is
            non-existent in Middle English actually supposes that we know all about Middle English,
            when in fact we do not. We are, in short, using negative evidence which is always
            dangerous. There is, however, nothing we can do about it except to be sure that we have
            made a diligent search before we say that a given form is non-existent.</p>
          <p>3. The result of these statements is this: I regard individual pieces of genealogical
            evidence with distrust, and am firmly convinced that they should be used only after the
            distributional evidence has limited the alternatives. Also, genealogical evidence should
            be presented statistically, since some of it will be contradictory, as was
            distributional evidence. If the non-reversible readings have been well chosen, however,
            the group of them which is most frequent ought to give trustworthy evidence of the
            direction of derivation.</p>
          <p>XXIV. At the end of all his labors, the editor presents his results in the shape of a
            family tree, leading back to <hi rend="italic">O</hi>, whose reconstructed readings he
            will follow in his text. I should repeat that a tree is a description of the
            relationship of readings found in manuscripts, and ought never to be understood as a
            statement that <hi rend="italic">A</hi> was copied from <hi rend="italic">B</hi>. It
            merely states that the readings now found in <hi rend="italic">A</hi> are derivable from
            readings now found in <hi rend="italic">B</hi>, after examination of all the extant
            evidence. The fact that the readings now found in <hi rend="italic">B</hi> were in
            historical fact taken from a now irrecoverable manuscript is quite irrelevant to any
            study of readings and their distribution. I am laboring the point, since <pb n="Errata"/>
            <pb n="Errata verso"/>
            <pb n="003.085"/> students seem sometimes unnecessarily timid in the face of external
            evidence, particularly of chronology. Even such a soundly courageous student as Germaine
            Dempster, in arguing for a certain type of descent, finds it necessary to say that the
            date of copying of extant manuscripts is not out of keeping with her view of the descent
              studied.<ref target="f003.04.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref> Actually an
            editor who has derived <hi rend="italic">A</hi> from <hi rend="italic">B</hi> should be
            quite unmoved by external evidence that <hi rend="italic">B</hi> is on twentieth century
            paper, while <hi rend="italic">A</hi> is on mediaeval vellum. <q><hi rend="italic"
                >Note</hi>. The irrelevancy of date of copying for conclusions about the derivation
              of manuscript readings is a product of the fact that all families of manuscripts must
              be presumed to have been decimated. The date of copying is, however, relevant in
              drawing up a tree for printed books which are preserved in multiple copies, so that
              decimation is much less likely. It is probably a failure to realize the necessary
              differences between the decimated families of manuscript work, and families presumed
              to be complete, which is responsible for the fact that the Lachmannian type of student
              regularly assumed that the oldest manuscript was the best. An example of the way in
              which decimation can affect a tree is the following from Havet, <hi rend="italic">op.
                cit.</hi> pages 8 and 27. Havet cites a print of the <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi>
              of Hyginus of 1535, which can be shown to be a direct copy of a ninth century
              manuscript which now exists only in fragments. Not only is such a time-spread a clear
              indication of the unreliability of guesses about authority based on date of copying,
              but since the ninth century manuscript is incomplete a student would be justified in
              deriving the readings of, say, an eleventh century manuscript from readings now found
              only in the print of 1535. The clearest statement of this principle is to be found in
              the Quentin <hi rend="italic">Essais</hi>, p. 103, in answer to one of his many
              critics. ". . . 'on sera &eacute;tonn&eacute;,' &eacute;crit-il, 'de voir une
              g&eacute;n&eacute;alogie o&ugrave; le Ms. <hi rend="italic">Laud</hi>, du IXe
              si&egrave;cle [et autres] . . . d&eacute;rivent de <hi rend="italic">Leg</hi> qui
              n'est que du Xe si&egrave;cle. . . .' La v&eacute;rit&eacute;, c'est que mes
              g&eacute;n&eacute;alogies s'appliquent non aux manuscrits eux-m&ecirc;mes, mais aux
              types de transmission du texte qu'ils representent." An astonishing and most
              misleading misunderstanding of the conditions under which date becomes a good guide is
              in E. K. Rand's attack on Quentin, already cited, on pages 208-11. Quentin had
              performed the interesting experiment of copying out a Latin passage twenty-two times,
              labelling the copies from <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, the original, to <hi rend="italic"
                >Z</hi>, the copy farthest removed from it. This known tree he then used as a test
              for the validity of his methods. Rand attempted to show that the classic "common
              mistake" technique gave surer results far more quickly than did the Quentin system. To
              do this he assumed that manuscripts labelled with letters late in the alphabet were
              late and corrupt, manuscripts labelled with letters early in the alphabet were older
              and more authoritative. Not unnaturally <pb n="003.086"/> he was able to reconstruct
              Quentin's experimental tree very quickly, since under these circumstances a mistake
              was readily and correctly defined as any reading which appeared for the first time in
              a manuscript labelled with a late letter. Such an attempt, however, is little more
              than a copying of the tree already given, and can not be accepted as a refutation of
              Quentin's theories. Rand had strangely failed to recognize that he was working with a
              family known to be complete, an assumption which would never apply in actual
              manuscript work. One can not wonder at the tone of slightly aggrieved patience with
              which the good Dom describes this treatment in his <hi rend="italic">Essais</hi>, page
              55.</q></p>
          <p>XXV. A manuscript tree is a diagrammatic description, and is to be judged like other
            instances of description in science&mdash;by the same criteria that we apply, for
            instance, to a description of phonemes. It follows, therefore, that like other
            descriptive statements, a tree is non-unique. That is to say, some other description
            might also contain and present the facts and be quite different in shape from our own
            diagram. To say that a tree is non-unique is not, however, to state that all trees are
            equally good. Two trees are equally good only if they differ at points where choice is
            truly arbitrary, and in such instances the general similarity between the two should be
            very considerable. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. The non-uniqueness of manuscript
              trees was the basis of Bedier's famous attack on comparative study of manuscripts,
              from which he concluded that the only defensible method of editing was to select a
              single good text and depart from it as taste and judgment dictated. The attack is
              found in its fullest form in <hi rend="italic">La Tradition Manuscrite du Lai de
                l'Ombre</hi>, previously cited. He here attempts to reduce all investigations of
              authority to an absurdity by drawing no less than eleven different trees for this
              single text. It is true that all of these trees would explain the arrangement of
              readings, but Bedier made no attempt to judge between them, in spite of the fact that
              many of them are rather obviously unlikely.</q></p>
          <p>The relative worth of alternate trees can be judged by the criteria universal in
            descriptive science; completeness, consistency, and simplicity.<ref target="f003.04.15"
              n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> The first two of these are relatively simple to
            apply, and are universally acknowledged in manuscript work; the third will need special
            discussion.</p>
          <p>1. A tree is incomplete if it leaves any body of readings out <pb n="003.087"/> of
            account, or if its author has failed to compare the readings of any manuscript, extant
            or hypothetical, with those of any other manuscript, extant or hypothetical.</p>
          <p>2. A tree is inconsistent if the same evidence, or type of evidence, is used to give
            contrary results. A startling example of inconsistency is pointed out by Mrs. Dempster
            in discussing the tree of Manly and Rickert for a part of the <hi rend="italic"
              >Canterbury Tales</hi>.<ref target="f003.04.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref>
            For a part of a sub-family Manly and Rickert use the presence of unique readings in each
            manuscript, and the absence of readings shared with other individuals within the group,
            to establish that the manuscripts are in radiation. Yet there is a smaller group of
            manuscripts which belong to the sub-family which they set up as a sub-family within the
            sub-family, in spite of the fact that this group has no constant body of readings
            necessitating the setting up of an ancester for it. Manly and Rickert meet the
            difficulty by assuming that the ancestor of the smaller group which they set up must
            have copied the ancestor of the whole family without making any mistakes. Thus they have
            used unique readings and the absence of shared readings to establish radiation, and used
            exactly the same set of relationships to set up an unnecessary sub-family.</p>
          <p>XXVI. The criterion of simplicity needs special discussion both because it has not been
            explicitly used in manuscript work, and because it will be useful to work out the
            definition in such a way as to give a simple operational procedure. Simplicity will be
            assumed to be inversely proportional to the number of hypotheses involved in a given
            explanation. That is to say, if two explanations equally well fit the facts, that which
            does so with fewer hypotheses will always be judged preferable. <q><hi rend="italic"
                >Note</hi>. While it is true that (to my knowledge) simplicity has never been
              explicitly used as a criterion in manuscript study, it has, curiously enough, been at
              least once explicitly denied. Bedier (<hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> pp. 66-67) says
              of some of his less probable trees, "Certes, supposer un <hi rend="italic">O</hi>2,
              puis un <hi rend="italic">O</hi>3, c'est aller en compliquant toujours davantage. Mais
              ni la simplicit&eacute; d'une hypoth&egrave;se n'est un gage de sa justesse, ni sa
              complexit&eacute; n'est une marque de sa fausset&eacute;." Such a startlingly unique
              assumption goes far to explain how Bedier could revolt against nearly a century of
              literary scholarship.</q></p>
          <pb n="003.088"/>
          <p>1. A basic hypothesis which equally underlies all trees can not be used to compare one
            tree with another, unless there is a difference in the number of times the hypothesis is
            used. At the outset, then, it is necessary to point out that all manuscript work assumes
            the existence of a single original, which we have called <hi rend="italic">O</hi>. In
            other words, the minimum number of manuscripts with which a student must deal is always
            one more than the extant number. Even in trees which do not end in <hi rend="italic"
              >O</hi>, the student has assumed its existence, but has made the further conclusion
            that <hi rend="italic">O</hi> is identical with an extant manuscript. At the moment,
            then, it is important to note that the existence of <hi rend="italic">O</hi> is not a
            special hypothesis inherent in only some trees.</p>
          <p>2. A second general assumption is, of course, that manuscripts assume their present
            shape by copying. In other words, no tree can be drawn without showing lines of
            derivation. But each such line of derivation is a separate hypothesis, and the general
            statement of simplicity given above means that the tree which shows the fewest lines of
            derivation is the simplest.</p>
          <p>This fact can be used to express simplicity by a simple device of scoring. Suppose that
            our arrangement of readings for three extant manuscripts is such as to permit either of
            the following trees: <!--<figure entity="sb03881"/> --> Scoring each line as one, the first tree
            has a score of three, while the second tree has a score of two. Both trees have assumed
            that <hi rend="italic">O</hi> exists, but the second tree has been simplified by making
            the separate existence of <hi rend="italic">O</hi> unnecessary. In other words, other
            things being equal, whenever an extant manuscript can be identified with <hi
              rend="italic">O</hi>, a simpler tree results, and this simplicity will always be
            reflected in the number of lines of derivation.</p>
          <p>3. Another type of hypothesis made in trees is that of the existence of hypothetical
            ancestral manuscripts. Except for <hi rend="italic">O</hi>, such hypothetical ancestors
            are not equally necessary for all trees, so that their presence or absence becomes a
            measure of comparative simplicity. Further, the setting up of a hypothetical manuscript
              <pb n="003.089"/> other than <hi rend="italic">O</hi> is a double hypothesis, first of
            the existence of one more manuscript, and second of derivation from it. Thus in our
            scoring device, we will count any line of derivation connecting a manuscript with a
            hypothetical manuscript other than <hi rend="italic">O</hi> as having a value of two.
            Suppose that our tree can be either of the following: <!--<figure entity="sb03891"/> --> The
            number of lines of derivation is equal, but the simplicity is not. Actually the first
            tree has dealt with four manuscripts (the three extant ones and <hi rend="italic"
            >O</hi>), the second with five (the three extant ones, <hi rend="italic">O</hi> and <hi
              rend="italic">x</hi>). Our scoring device reflects this by giving the first tree a
            total of three, the second a total of six.<ref target="f003.04.17" n="17"><hi
                rend="super">17</hi></ref> The first tree is then preferable.</p>
          <p>XXVII. Such a measure of simplicity, rough though it may be, gives the student a
            powerful tool in dealing with situations which have often been thought to be hopelessly
            ambiguous.</p>
          <p>1. In any two-text situation, or any situation which has been reduced to a two-text
            situation, either one manuscript must be descended from the other, or both from <hi
              rend="italic">O</hi>. If one manuscript is descended from the other, the resultant
            tree has a score of one; if both are descended from <hi rend="italic">O</hi> the tree
            has a score of two. Thus unless there is some evidence which positively contradicts the
            hypothesis, the student will assume that one manuscript is descended from the other, and
            proceed to genealogical evidence to decide which way the derivation goes. Later evidence
            may show that his hypothesis was false, but that danger is inherent in all decisions
            based on evidence. In the mean time, his decisions have been consistent and orderly, and
            so have a greater probability of being right than if they had been inconsistent and
            disorderly&mdash;unless, <pb n="003.090"/> of course, one is prepared to defend the
            horrifying position that there is no order at all in human experience. <q><hi
                rend="italic">Note</hi>. The statement here given constitutes an answer for one of
              the major objections raised by Bedier in the work previously cited. He surveyed a
              large number of trees drawn up by scholars using the Lachmann method. He found that a
              large majority of them, almost amounting to unanimity, were two-forked trees. Such a
              state of affairs, depriving the editor of the opportunity of bringing supported
              readings to bear against unique readings, could not, he felt, be either the result of
              chance or of falsification on the part of scholars. He concluded therefore that the
              almost unanimous choice of two-forked trees reflected a weakness in the method itself.
              If the criterion of simplicity is applied, the student is under a genuine obligation
              to resolve all two-forked trees, so that Bedier's objection would be met.</q></p>
          <p>2. In practice this statement means that a tree of the type <!--<figure entity="sb03901"/>  -->
            will always be rejected in favor of one of the types given below, which identify <hi
              rend="italic">O</hi> with an extant manuscript. <!--<figure entity="sb03902"/>  --> It is for
            this reason that it was stated earlier that in a situation where both <hi rend="italic"
              >AB</hi> and <hi rend="italic">CD</hi> had ancestors, it is inadmissible to draw a
            tree in the form: <!--<figure entity="sb03903"/>  --> Such a tree is one which reduces a group to
            a two-text situation, wherefore it will always be assumed that either <hi rend="italic"
              >x</hi> or <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is identical with <hi rend="italic">O</hi>.</p>
          <pb n="003.091"/>
          <p>XXVIII. Of the three text situation Greg has said: <q>. . . it is clear that, where
              three manuscripts only are concerned, no merely formal process can throw light on the
              relationships between them. Either the readings will be all divergent or else the
              variants will be of the type . . . where one group is represented by one MS only . . .
              and since, in the latter case, the reading of the single divergent manuscript may
              always (theoretically at least) be unoriginal, it will never be possible to establish
              a common source for any pair of manuscripts to the exclusion of the third. Given three
              manuscripts, therefore, it is impossible either to prove or to disprove independent
              derivation. This fact, which I call the <hi rend="italic">ambiguity of three
                texts</hi>, we shall find meet us at every turn of the discussion. . . .<ref
                target="f003.04.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref></q> The measure of
            simplicity gives us a way of dealing with this situation which no longer leaves it
            ambiguous. We shall partly accept Greg's statement, partly deny it.</p>
          <p>1. There are two types of tree involving a common ancestor for two out of three
            manuscripts. They differ only in that the second has identified <hi rend="italic">O</hi>
            with an extant manuscript. Both trees are of course types, so that the labels attached
            to given branches are of no significance. <!--<figure entity="sb03911"/>  --> There is a slight
            difference in simplicity between these two, since the first has a score of seven and the
            second one of six. The fact that the second is slightly preferable is, however,
            irrelevant, since the choice is between these two and still simpler types.</p>
          <p>The simpler types are <!--<figure entity="sb03912"/>  -->
            <pb n="003.092"/> The first of these has a score of three, and the last two a score of
            two. By Greg's own statement the more complex trees can offer no explanation of the
            relationship of readings which is not equally well given by one of the three simpler
            trees. Therefore, the more complex trees are always unnecessary, and will never be used
            by a consistent student, no matter if there is a danger that later evidence might show
            him that his assumption of a simpler tree was actually false.</p>
          <p>2. If the three-text situation were truly ambiguous, it would be further impossible to
            decide between the simpler trees, that is to say, the type employing a separate <hi
              rend="italic">O</hi> and the two types in which <hi rend="italic">O</hi> is identified
            with an extant manuscript. This question also can be resolved.</p>
          <p>3. The tree which has a separate <hi rend="italic">O</hi> is less simple, it is true,
            than the other two trees, but it is also true that distributional evidence can establish
            the fact of radiational derivation. A generalized example will make this clear. Let <hi
              rend="italic">A, B, C</hi> represent the three manuscripts. Let <hi rend="italic"
              >a</hi> represent supported readings, and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> represent unique
            readings. We can thus represent a situation in three differing text positions thus <table>
              <row>
                <cell><hi rend="italic">A</hi></cell>
                <cell><hi rend="italic">B</hi></cell>
                <cell><hi rend="italic">C</hi></cell>
              </row>
              <row>
                <cell><hi rend="italic">a</hi></cell>
                <cell><hi rend="italic">a</hi></cell>

                <cell><hi rend="italic">b</hi></cell>
                <cell><hi rend="italic">a</hi> position two</cell>
              </row>
              <row>
                <cell><hi rend="italic">b</hi></cell>
                <cell><hi rend="italic">a</hi></cell>
                <cell><hi rend="italic">a</hi> position three</cell>
              </row>
            </table> If, in this situation, any one of the three extant manuscripts is taken to be
            the ancestor of the other two, one of the three text positions is unexplained. Thus if
            we draw the tree in the form <!-- <figure entity="sb03921"/> --> the readings in position three
            must represent coincidence, which is contrary to the postulate of unity. The same
            statement would apply to any tree placing either <hi rend="italic">B</hi> or <hi
              rend="italic">C</hi> as the ancestor. Thus in the situation where there are always two
            readings against one, but the grouping is not constant, the only reasonable conclusion
            is radiation from a hypothetical ancestor. <pb n="003.093"/>
            <q><hi rend="italic">Note.</hi>. An example of the way in which the procedure I have
              been trying to outline modifies the results of previous methods can be drawn from the
              following short Latin poem, to be found in Heinz Pflaum, "<hi rend="italic">Sortes,
                Plato, Cicero</hi> satirisches Gedicht des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts," <hi
                rend="italic">Speculum</hi>, VI (1931), 499-533. There are three manuscripts only,
              and at page 525 the editor gives the following Lachmannian tree: <!--<figure
                entity="sb03931"/>  --> The reasons for this tree are clearly given on the same page:
                "<hi rend="italic">N</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P</hi> bilden eine besondere Klasse,
              da sie, gegen&uuml;ber der richtigen Lesart von <hi rend="italic">T</hi>, an vier
              Stellen charakteristische gemeinsame Fehler haben . . . w&auml;hrend <hi rend="italic"
                >T</hi> nirgendwo in einem unzweifelhaften Fehler mit der einen gegen die andere
              &uuml;bereinstimmt. <hi rend="italic">T</hi> is durchaus die beste Handschrift, obwohl
              Str. 35 in ihr fehlt; <hi rend="italic">P</hi>, die j&uuml;ngste Hs., is ziemlich
              stark verderbt." The tree above gives a stage beyond that recoverable by comparative
              study, since it separates <hi rend="italic">O</hi> and <hi rend="italic">OI</hi>.
              Second, it draws a needlessly complex tree, as the discussion of the three text
              situation has attempted to show. I give the first verse of the critical test, with
              variants, as follows: <l>Sortes pre consortibus currit in consorcio;</l>
              <l>in equis et curribus non est dispensacio.</l>
              <l>Platonis in manibus sonat disputacio</l>
              <l>et de sortis cursibus longa demonstracio.</l> In line 2 <hi rend="italic">T</hi>
              has <hi rend="italic">canibus</hi>, corrected to <hi rend="italic">curribus</hi>, the
              reading of <hi rend="italic">N</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P</hi>. In line 4, <hi
                rend="italic">P</hi> has <hi rend="italic">corsibus</hi>, <hi rend="italic">N</hi>
              and <hi rend="italic">T</hi> have <hi rend="italic">cursibus</hi>. In line 4, <hi
                rend="italic">N</hi> has <hi rend="italic">longa</hi>, <hi rend="italic">T</hi> and
                <hi rend="italic">P</hi> have <hi rend="italic">magna</hi>. I am not attempting to
              draw a complete tree for this poem, but it is striking that the first three variants
              exactly illustrate the scheme drawn for a three-text situation compatible with
              radiation from <hi rend="italic">O</hi>. It is curious, finally, that the editor in
              printing <hi rend="italic">longa</hi> in line 4, has adopted a reading which his own
              tree disproves.</q></p>
          <p>4. If, on the other hand, the readings are constantly arranged in a fashion which can
            be generalized thus: <pb n="003.094"/>

            </table> the hypothesis of radiation from a hypothetical ancestor becomes unnecessary,
            and the student will adopt the simpler type of tree. As to which of the types of tree
            employing no hypothetical ancestor he will choose, distributional evidence will offer
            him no help, and he must base his choice on genealogical evidence. <q><hi rend="italic"
                >Note</hi>. The first of the two schemes given in this paragraph places some
              limitation on possible trees, just as the Quentin "intermediary" does. The ancestor
              can be either <hi rend="italic">A</hi> or <hi rend="italic">B</hi> but not <hi
                rend="italic">C</hi>, if the copied manuscripts are independently derived. If the
              derivation is in a straight line, either <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                >B</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">C</hi> can be the ultimate ancestor, but <hi
                rend="italic">C</hi> can not be the middle term. The second scheme, which represents
              a relatively rare state of affairs, places no limitation on the possible trees, except
              that radiation from <hi rend="italic">O</hi> is an unnecessary hypothesis.</q></p>
          <p>XXIX. It is, I believe, of no use to carry this analysis of the effects of measuring
            simplicity into situations involving more texts than three, since such situations will
            resolve themselves into larger radiational groups, two- or three-text groups, two- or
            three-text groups mixed with larger radiational groups. In any case, it is easy to carry
            the suggestions I have made into situations involving more manuscripts.</p>
          <p>XXX. A brief summary of what has been done may be useful. I have first of all tried to
            follow Greg and Quentin in setting up a method of dealing consistently with variants,
            making the minimum use of variants preclassified into right readings and wrong readings.
            In this I differ from the implicit assumptions of many editors, and the explicit
            assumptions of such students as Hitchcock and Wolf. Second, I have tried to make a few
            basic assumptions, <pb n="003.095"/> in themselves as simple as possible&mdash;indeed
            sometimes so simple as to be obvious&mdash;and see how far it is possible to carry them.
            Third, I have broken with Greg, whose view of a tree is that it must be unique before it
            can be regarded as free of ambiguity. Instead of accepting uniqueness as the only
            criterion, I have stated that trees are often necessarily non-unique (as Greg well
            knew), but that in instances where a simple tree and a complex tree both explain the
            arrangement of variants, the student can choose the simple tree. To do so will be as
            acceptable as if the simpler tree had been fully proved, since to do so will achieve the
            aim of distributional study, which is to set up an orderly and consistent method of
            dealing with the extant variants, subject always to the reservation that when more
            variants are discovered, the results will have to be re-examined.</p>

            <p>This statement of circularity is not without precedent, since it is inherent in the
              writings of the learned Dom Quentin, who made a determined effort to avoid treating
              readings as right and wrong, and to study them all equally as variants. Curiously
              enough, however, the clearest statement of the circularity of the method based on
              "common mistakes" is found not in Quentin's writings but in the unfriendly book of P.
              Collomp, <hi rend="italic">La Critique des Textes</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Publications

              l'on construit le stemma, par le stemma qu'on retrouve le vrai texte. . . ." Collomp
              then goes on to reject the charge of circularity, not I think with clarity equal to
              that with which he has stated the charge.</p>

          <p>THE TWO CAXTON VARIANTS WHICH PROVIDE the topic of discussion for the present
            investigation are by no means recent discoveries; quite to the contrary, they have been
            noted for many years in the standard books of reference. It is most strange, therefore,
            that these well-known variant states have been subjected neither to critical study nor
            to thorough technical analyses, especially since, as distinct from many other Caxton
            variants, it is absolutely certain in each instance which is the earlier state and which
            the later. This circumstance further permits the investigator to ascertain specific
            details as to the workings of Caxton's printing office, with special reference to the
            resetting of copy previously printed at the same press.<ref target="f003.05.01" n="1"
                ><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> The two variant states to be discussed here are found
            in: Lydgate, <hi rend="italic">The Pilgrimage of the Soul</hi>, Westminster, 6 June 1483
            (Duff 267) and Christine de Pisan, <hi rend="italic">The Book of the Fayttes of Armes
              and of Chyvalrye</hi>, [Westminster], 14 July 1489 (Duff 96). The separate states are
            identified by the fact that one sheet in each book appears in two different settings of
            type.</p>

          <p>In E. Gordon Duff's <hi rend="italic">Fifteenth Century English Books</hi>
            (Bibliographical Society, Illustrated Monograph No. XVIII, 1917), one finds the
            following note appended to his description of No. 267: <q>There are two issues of this
              book: in the original issue (B.M.) the two inner pages of sheet f3 have been imposed
              wrongly, so that what should be on f3<hi rend="super">b</hi> is <pb n="003.098"/> on
                f6<hi rend="super">a</hi> and what should be on f6<hi rend="super">a</hi> is on
                f3<hi rend="super">b</hi>, and the whole book is in type 4. In the second issue
              (Britwell) this whole sheet has been reprinted in type 4<hi rend="super">*</hi>, so as
              to read correctly.<ref target="f003.05.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></q></p>
          <p>Of the six copies that have survived to our day,<ref target="f003.05.03" n="3"><hi
                rend="super">3</hi></ref> the British Museum is the only one to have sheet f3.6 in
            the original state,<ref target="f003.05.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> the
            remaining copies all belonging to the later "issue" (contrary to the opinion expressed
            in <hi rend="italic">STC</hi> 6473).</p>
          <p>Since it is absolutely certain that the Museum copy belongs to the earlier state, one
            may well ask how it compares with the "corrected" later form of sheet f3.6? The ready
            answer to this query is that the resetting (though corrected so far as the imposition is
            concerned) is much the more inferior text. Not only does the reprint contain eleven
            misprints to seven found in the original setting<ref target="f003.05.05" n="5"><hi
                rend="super">5</hi></ref> but it also omits nineteen words found in the
            original&mdash; a fact of much greater significance. To be exact, twenty words are
            omitted by the reprint but, by way of partial compensation, one word<ref
              target="f003.05.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> not found in the first setting
            is added by the second.</p>
          <p>Almost half the words wanting in the later sheet are clearly omitted because of
            careless type-setting. The compositor of the reprint, although he was setting type from
            printed copy, did not follow his original line for line.<ref target="f003.05.07" n="7"
                ><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> On the verso of signature f3 (of the reprint) he
            departed so far from his copy that when he reached the bottom of the page he found that
            he had less than half a line to accommodate a full line of the original text. By making
            radical omissions, the compositor succeeded in having his page end at the proper place
            but not without doing violence to the text. In the original state (f6) the passage in
            question reads: <pb n="003.099"/>
            <q>. . . And leue &verbar;&verbar; it wel y<hi rend="super">t</hi> though the

              wold / ne &verbar;&verbar; harmen none persone / but by his owne assent . . .</q> In
            the reprint, the same text (f3 verso) appears as: <q>. . . &amp; &verbar;&verbar; leue
              hit wel that thong (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) the passion of Jhesu crist prouffite

              tormenten none Innocent / as their malyce wold / ne &verbar;&verbar; harmen none
              persone / but by his owne assent . . .</q> In making these omissions the compositor
            succeeded in having his text end with the correct word, but in order to achieve this
            both sense and grammar were sacrificed to expediency.</p>
          <p>Apart from this instance, the textual differences are slight and occasionally reflect
            no more than the spelling habits of two different compositors;<ref target="f003.05.08"
              n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> for example, the British Museum state has "nought"
            eight times where the reprint has "not." In those cases where a choice can be made,
            however, the British Museum setting is always the better. Thus where the soul <hi
              rend="italic">asks</hi> the body "how hast thou lost al thy queyntyse" (BM, f3<hi
              rend="super">v</hi>, l. 33), the reprint offers "how thou hast lost al queyntyse."
            Clearly then, instead of seizing upon the opportunity to improve the text, a careless
            compositor has permitted the text of the reprint to deteriorate.</p>
          <p>Curiously enough, the reprint exhibits a technical&mdash;as well as a
            textual&mdash;deterioration. Concerning the use of "guide-letters" or "directors,"
            Konrad Haebler<ref target="f003.05.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> observes that
            in order "to lighten the rubricator's work, the custom was gradually adopted of printing
            in small type (usually in lower-case), in the space left to be filled in by hand, the
            initial which the rubricator was to add in colors." This had been common practice on the
            Continent from as early as 1471-2, and directors appear in books printed at Caxton's <pb
              n="003.100"/> press even in the days of its activity at Bruges.<ref
              target="f003.05.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> In the <hi rend="italic"
              >Pilgrimage</hi>, guide-letters were used throughout the volume including the first
            setting of sheet f3.6, but directors are not present in the reprint of this sheet. Thus
            the reprint demonstrates the return to a more primitive practice of type-setting where
            such reminders were not considered necessary for the benefit of the rubricator.</p>

          <head type="sub">BOOK OF THE FAYTTES OF ARMES</head>
          <p>To its description of this edition (No. 6648), the <hi rend="italic">Gesamtkatalog der
              Wiegendrucke</hi> adds the note: "Das Doppelblatt 140 u. 143 ist neu gesetzt worden."
            This appears to be the first notification that sheet S2.5 is known in two different
            settings, a fact that (apparently) escaped the attention of the editor of this work for
            the Early English Text Society's edition.<ref target="f003.05.11" n="11"><hi
                rend="super">11</hi></ref> Of the twenty-one copies of this book known to me, only
            four have the variant sheet specified by the <hi rend="italic"
            >Gesamtkatalog</hi>&mdash;G&ouml;ttingen, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Bodleian (S.
            Selden d 13) and the Grenville Kane copy now at Princeton University Library.<ref
              target="f003.05.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> Thirteen copies have the
            text as printed in the Early English Text Society series, while three copies want (among
            others) the pertinent leaves&mdash;Windsor, Bodleian (Auct. QQ supra l. 25) and the York
            Minster copy now in the collection of Phyllis Goodhart Gordan and Howard L. Goodhart of
            New York. Seymour de Ricci informs us that the Sion College copy lacks S5, but I have
            been unsuccessful in my attempts to obtain information as to the state of S2 in this
            copy.</p>
          <p>Although the <hi rend="italic">Gesamtkatalog</hi> simply assumes without further proof
            that the G&ouml;ttingen state is that which was "neu gesetzt," there is plenty of
            evidence to prove that this is certainly the case.<ref target="f003.05.13" n="13"><hi
                rend="super">13</hi></ref>
            <pb n="003.101"/> In this instance, positive proof is supplied by the different systems
            of punctuation employed by the two compositors. As will be seen from a perusal of the
            modern reprint, the enormously preponderant punctuation mark used in the <hi
              rend="italic">Fayttes</hi> is the virgule (/). For example, on signatures S1, S3, and
            S4 (six pages common to all copies), there are 164 punctuation marks of which 163 are
            virgules, the remaining one being a semi-colon. In the first setting as represented by
            the copy in The Pierpont Morgan Library (PML 781), there are 118 instances of
            punctuation on S2 and S5; of these 117 are virgules and the remaining one is a
            semi-colon.</p>
          <p>For the other setting, the Kane-Princeton copy shows (on sheet S2.5) 105 cases of
            punctuation, of which 96 are periods, 6 are semi-colons and only 3 are virgules.
            Obviously the text of this sheet was set by a different compositor&mdash;one following
            his own rules of punctuation&mdash;than the one who had composed all the rest of the
            volume. Thus it is quite certain that sheet S2.5 of the Morgan copy belongs to the
            original setting and that the Princeton one is the reprinted sheet.</p>
          <p>Again we may enquire what a comparison of the two states reveals and again we will note
            that the reprint shows a deterioration of text. The state of the Morgan copy has six
            misprints, while the total in the Princeton setting amounts to some seventeen such
            errors; two misprints are common to both states.<ref target="f003.05.14" n="14"><hi
                rend="super">14</hi></ref> Characteristic of the better text of the first is the
            reading "Consules of Mountpellyer" (S2, l. 4) where the reprint specifies "Consules
            Mountpollyer." Conversely, however, the second setting has the more correct last lines
            in the colophon which read: ". . . he may &verbar;&verbar; atteyne to euerlastyng lyf in
            heuen. whiche god graunte to &verbar;&verbar; hym and to alle his lyege peple. AMEN.
            &verbar;&verbar; Per Caxton &verbar;&verbar;". The first contained the misprints
            "euerlastpng" and "gaunte." However, since the far greater number of misprints is found
            in the form as represented by the Princeton copy, we must consider this second setting
            as the more inferior text.</p>
          <pb n="003.102"/>
          <p>A most singular peculiarity of the Princeton volume requires special mention. The blank
            last leaf (S6 recto) in this copy shows a distinct off-set of the text of S5 verso, a
            condition often encountered among Caxton imprints. But the startling fact here is that
            the Princeton leaf shows an off-set of the original setting, <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
            of the resetting which now faces it in the volume. There seem to be only two logical
            explanations for this phenomenon, either that the copy was "made up," perhaps when it
            was rebound by Bedford,<ref target="f003.05.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> or
            that the off-setting took place in Caxton's workshop. If the latter assumption be the
            correct one, we would have certain evidence that the copies of the <hi rend="italic"
              >Fayttes</hi> were not bound up as soon as printed but that the sheets were stored
              unbound.<ref target="f003.05.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> Thus it would
            have to be argued that the Princeton sheet S1.6 came into contact soon after printing
            (possibly by being gathered with it) with a sheet of the earlier setting of S2.5, but
            that, in the long run, it was not bound up with this particular sheet.</p>
          <p>Turning to the other alternative, it seems highly improbable that the blank leaf was
            added to this copy,<ref target="f003.05.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> since
            no one would ever have considered it necessary to supply such a leaf in order to create
            a "perfect and complete" example. Again one cannot assume that only leaf S5 was
            supplied, since S2 is its proper conjugate; therefore, if anything was added to the
            Princeton volume, it must have been the whole sheet (S2.5). Furthermore, if the blank be
            the original one, as we have good reason to believe, it seems unlikely that the
            important printed leaf just ahead of the useless blank could have been missing from this
            copy at any time; surely, if S5 was lost, S6 would have disappeared too. One must
            believe, then, that if the volume is not in the same condition as it was when sold by
            Caxton (at least, as far as the identity of leaves is concerned), one must assume that
            the Princeton book was so "made up" that S1.6 was supplied from one copy and S2.5 from
            another. This seems to be so highly improbable a hypothesis that <pb n="003.103"/> the
            first explanation for the presence of the off-set in the Princeton <hi rend="italic"
              >Fayttes</hi> appears the more acceptable.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, a word should (I think) be said on the subject of the origin of these
            two variant settings. In the case of the <hi rend="italic">Pilgrimage</hi>, of course,
            the sheet was reprinted in order to correct an error of imposition;<ref
              target="f003.05.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref> a similar technical
              error<ref target="f003.05.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> occurs in the very
            first book credited to Caxton's press&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">Recuyell of the
              Histories of Troy</hi>, [Bruges, <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 1475]. The cause for the
            reprint of sheet S2.5 in the <hi rend="italic">Fayttes</hi> is less obvious. It
            illustrates, however, a phenomenon previously noticed in several volumes printed by
            England's prototypographer. Since the second setting contains more misprints than the
            first, it was probably not called into being through a desire to improve the text. True
            enough, two glaring errors in the colophon were corrected by the second setting, but
            this improvement could have been achieved by simple stop-press corrections and certainly
            would not have required the resetting of four entire pages.<ref target="f003.05.20"
              n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref> It seems likely that the reprinting was
            necessitated either because something happened in Caxton's workshop which required the
            resetting of sheet S2.5, or that Caxton failed to print the correct number of sheets to
            complete the copies in hand and was thus obliged to make good the deficiency after the
            original formes had been distributed.</p>
          <pb n="003.104"/>
          <p>One must, then, assume that the reprinting of sheet S2.5 was the result either of an
            accident in the printing office or of a short count when the sheet was being machined.
            If an accident necessitated the reprint, it is scarcely probable that this took place
            during the printing of the sheet since it would be an incredible coincidence for both
            inner and outer formes to "pie" at approximately the same stage in the course of
              production.<ref target="f003.05.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref> If sheet
            S2.5 was not reprinted because a short count made this necessary, one must believe that
            some accident took place at the press <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the full number of
            sheets had been printed and the formes distributed, for the loss of a sufficient number
            of sheets would have compelled Caxton to reset the text and supply the necessary number
            in a new setting. While this would be a perfectly reasonable explanation for the
            reprinting of sheet S2.5 in the <hi rend="italic">Fayttes</hi>, one can only with
            difficulty credit a theory which assumes that Caxton permitted such accidents to happen
            again and again. There are reprinted sheets of precisely this sort in the <hi
              rend="italic">Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers</hi> (Duff 123), the <hi
              rend="italic">Morte d'Arthur</hi> (Duff 283), the <hi rend="italic">House of Fame</hi>
            (Duff 86), and probably elsewhere, for aught I know.<ref target="f003.05.22" n="22"><hi
                rend="super">22</hi></ref> Surely these could not all be the results of physical
            accidents. On the other hand, contemporary accounts prove beyond question that short
            printing was a common enough occurrence to be a source of annoyance and trouble to both
            printers and publishers. Neither of these explanations for the presence of the variant
            setting in the <hi rend="italic">Book of the Fayttes of Armes and of Chyvalrye</hi> is
            completely convincing, but if there be a more satisfactory one, it is not apparent to
            me.</p>

            <p>The first line on folio B7 recto normally reads: "sw&imacr;my&imacr;g ouer a gret

              caused by a desire to improve the text or it may be no more than a mechanical variant
              brought about by having the type pulled out by the ink-ball and incorrectly restored.
              Another minor variant indicating stop-press corrections may be found on N6; here the
              "Capytulo" should be numbered 16 but no copy seems to have this number. Some copies
              (for example: Morgan, Columbia, Yale, Queens [Oxford], etc.) have "Capytulo xiiij"
              while others (Huntington, Princeton, Bodleian, University Library Cambridge, etc.)
              have the number "xv." It is not clear which is the earlier setting in this case.</p>

            <p>The modern binding makes it impossible to be entirely certain, but S1 and S6 appear
              to be conjugates. Whether conjugacy can be proved or not is immaterial, since it is
              shown above that no one would supply a blank leaf anyway. Accordingly it is reasonable
              to assume that S6 is the conjugate of S1.</p>

            <p>It has been suggested to me that Caxton might have suppressed the first setting of
              S2.5 because of the errors in the colophon (representing the printer's official
              statement) and that the incorrect sheets were withdrawn from the made-up copies and
              the new sheets substituted for those suppressed. Thus the off-set in the Princeton
              copy could have come from the first sheet S2.5 before the corrected one was
              substituted for it. However, this seems to me an untenable theory in view of the fact
              that only four copies of the second setting are known against the thirteen of the
              first. If Caxton reprinted and substituted sheet S2.5 in order to correct the
              colophon, one would (I should judge) expect the <hi rend="italic">majority</hi> of
              copies to have the second (official) setting and only the occasional (overlooked)
              example to preserve the original reading. If, however, extra sheets of the second
              setting of S2.5 were printed because of an original short count, it may be argued that
              these were substituted (because of the superior colophon) for sheets of the first
              setting to the extent that these correct sheets were available; this also would
              explain the presence of the "wrong" off-set in the Princeton copy. But one should
              observe that errors in the colophon did not seem to disturb Caxton unduly; note the
              many instances of such misprints cited by W. J. B. Crotch, <hi rend="italic">The
                Prologues and Epilogues of William Caxton</hi> (Early English Text Society, Original
              Series 176, 1928). Other Caxton editions with errors in the colophons include: <hi
                rend="italic">Ars moriendi</hi> (Duff 33), two <hi rend="italic">Chronicles of
                England</hi> (Duff 97-8), <hi rend="italic">Doctrinal of Sapience</hi> (Duff 127),

            </seg>
            <p>Furthermore one would then be obliged to assume that Caxton employed two presses, one
              to print one forme and the other to perfect the sheets. In that case it is easy enough
              to believe that one forme might go to pie but that both should do so about the same
              time passes the bounds of credibility.</p>

          <p>FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE SEAT OF THE Przemysls, royal family of the Czechs, and, in
            the fourteenth century, simultaneously the capital of the Holy Roman Empire, Prague owes
            her reputation in the various branches of learning in large measure to the founding of
            her University in 1348. As a royal residence from the tenth until the beginning of the
            seventeenth century, the city contained a considerable number of libraries established
            by the religious orders, the Metropolitan Chapter, the University, and the nobility.
            With a single exception, the rich collections of old manuscripts and printed books which
            existed in an earlier day were sacrificed to the ravages of war and other vicissitudes
            and were not brought together again until much later. The greatest losses were sustained
            at the end of the Thirty Years War when the Swedes took with them as booty all sorts of
            objects of art as well as the main parts of the libraries, especially the famous
            Rosenberg Library, at the time of their invasions of Bohemia and Moravia. Investigations
            conducted in Prague libraries in recent years in connection with studies of decorated
            mediaeval bindings have revealed clearly lacunae which have arisen in this manner.</p>
          <p>The wealth of the city in book collections is obvious in the following list of
            libraries whose holdings were examined for this study: The University Library with the
            libraries of the Princes Lobkowitz, Prince Moritz von Lobkowitz from Raudnitz, the
            Convent of the Knights of Malta (Hospitallers), and the Benedictine monastery Emaus; the
            library of the National Museum; the <pb n="003.106"/> library and the Museum of Arts and
            Crafts; the library of the Municipal Archives; the library of Prince Kinsky; the library
            of Strahow monastery; the library of the Metropolitan Chapter; the libraries of the
            Augustine, Capuchin, and Franciscan monasteries; and the library of the Convent of the
            Red Star Crusaders. A systematic investigation covered manuscripts, incunabula, and
            imprints prior to 1530, insofar as their bindings were decorated with blind stamps. From
            subsequent periods up to the eighteenth century only those books were chosen which were
            once in the possession of well known persons or could be differentiated from ordinary
            library books in some way or another.</p>
          <p>In all, 3,020 volumes were studied, of which sixty-nine belong to the period after the
            Reformation. 1,705 volumes belong to the University Library; 448 to the Metropolitan
            Chapter; 370 to Strahow monastery; 198 to the National Museum; eighty-four to the
            Augustines; seventy-nine to the Red Star Crusaders; fifty-nine to the Franciscans;
            thirty-two to the Capuchins; twenty-five to the Museum of Arts and Crafts; twelve to the
            Municipal Archives; and eight to the library of Prince Kinsky.</p>
          <p>The only library in Prague whose holdings go back to the time of its foundation and
            have not been diminished by wars, conflagrations, and other calamities is that of the
            Metropolitan Chapter. On the other hand, the famous library of Strahow monastery was not
            re-established until the second half of the seventeenth century, and virtually nothing
            remains of its original holdings. The provenance of the surviving portions of the oldest
            part of the library of Prince Moritz von Lobkowitz from Raudnitz may be traced to the
            founder, Bohuslaw Lobkowitz von Hassenstein, the greatest humanist of Bohemia. In the
            University Library there is also the former library of the Celestine monastery of Oybin
            near Zittau, dissolved in the sixteenth century and turned over at that time to the
            University Library in the Clementinum. Parts of the library of the Danish statesman
            Henrik von Rantzau are also preserved here, brought to Prague by Wallenstein after he
            had taken Rantzau's castle in Breitenburg near Itzehoe by storm in 1627.</p>
          <p>The oldest decorated binding in Prague adorns parchment manuscript A 133, a Latin
            psalter of the twelfth century, in the Metropolitan Chapter. Both covers, like the
            manuscript itself, <pb n="003.107"/> come from Paris and are reproduced by Podlaha.<ref
              target="f003.06.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> In addition, there is another
            parchment manuscript of about the same age, B 16;2, containing the <hi rend="italic">De
              libero arbitrio</hi> of Aurelius Augustinus, from the library of Johann Herttemberger
            de Cubito. Podlaha describes this manuscript on pages 162-165 of his study of the
            library of the Metropolitan Chapter, and he assigns it to the end of the twelfth
            century. The general aspects of the execution of the binding and the stamps identify it
            as contemporary with the manuscript, for it has the characteristic smooth spine with
            barely perceptible bands (two in this case) and thick covers common to Romanesque
            bindings. An additional characteristic that may be noted in Figs. 1-3 is the frequent
            use of stamps whose limits are not marked by special lines for this purpose. In contrast
            with Ms. A 133, richly decorated with fifteen different stamps of which half represent
            persons, only five ornamental forms are used (Fig. 1). The yellow leather binding is
            sparsely decorated. The rectangular middle field of the covers is enclosed by four
            frames, of which the second and the fourth (reckoned from the edge) are broader and set
            with stamps, while ribbon-shaped undecorated diagonals divide the middle. Each of the
            triangular areas formed by the diagonals is decorated with a single stamp. This
            arrangement of the rectangle is unusual, to judge from available illustrations of other
            Romanesque bindings. Two clasps closing towards the rear unite the two covers, which
            measure 198 mm. (height) by 142 mm. (breadth). Presumably the manuscript was bound in
            what was formerly German-speaking territory.</p>
          <p>The University Library also owns two parchment manuscripts whose Romanesque bindings,
            just as the preceding one, were hitherto unknown. The first, Ms. XIV G 48, which
            contains the <hi rend="italic">Summa Raymundi</hi>, is from the last quarter of the
            thirteenth century, while the second, Ms. XIV H 3, which contains G. Paraldus' <hi
              rend="italic">Tractatus de virtutibus</hi>, was probably written at the beginning of
            the fourteenth century. Their bindings, which are only decorated with a few stamps
            representing animals and flowers, are presumably contemporary with the manuscripts. Fig.
            2 reproduces the stamps on Ms. XIV G 48. The edges of the boards, covered with brown
            leather, are consistently rounded to a smooth surface <pb n="003.108"/> on the front
            covers. Two clasps which once hooked into place on the back cover were removed in later
            times. The spine is similar to that of the preceding book except that there are three
            double bands. Three frames, of which only the middle one is broad and decorated,
            surround a rectangle that is divided into two parts by a vertical middle band. Both of
            the two narrow rectangular areas are decorated with a vertical row of stamps. This type
            of decoration, quite common at the time, is found, for example, in Plates III and IV of
            the late G. D. Hobson's essay on "Some Early Bindings and Binders' Tools."<ref
              target="f003.06.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> The dimensions of the covers
            are 200 mm. by 130 mm. No definite evidence as to the provenance of the binding is
            available, since the stamps vary somewhat from previously identified forms. The five
            stamps depicted in Fig. 3 are found on the binding of XIV H 3, a French manuscript.
            Since the first stamp also appears in quite similar form on the binding of Cod. CCXLII
            of the Landesbibliothek in Karlsruhe,<ref target="f003.06.03" n="3"><hi rend="super"
                >3</hi></ref> it may be assumed that the book was bound in Paris. The boards are
            covered with red leather, and their edges are consistently rounded. Four clasps which
            once closed towards the rear and nine out of ten studs are lacking. The spine is
            distinctly rounded and reveals the well-defined forms of four double bands. This
            circumstance permits us to suppose that this binding was executed somewhat later than
            the two previously mentioned. On the front cover the rectangular middle area is
            surrounded by four frames, on the back cover by three, of which the first and the third
            (reckoned from the edge) are narrow and undecorated. The middle area of the front cover
            is divided in two parts by a vertical line drawn through the middle, while that of the
            back cover is divided by two vertical bands into three narrow rectangles, each of which
            is decorated by a row of stamps. The covers are 190 mm. by 132 mm. The rarity of these
            early decorated bindings, which have been repeatedly and exhaustively treated in the
            literature, is readily apparent from the fact that the latest study by Hobson<ref
              target="f003.06.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> reveals only 106 identified
            volumes in all. The reason lies partially in the fact that in the early period the
            decoration of leather bindings probably consisted predominantly of blind lines and
            partially in that a <pb n="003.109"/> large proportion of these older manuscripts were
            rebound towards the end of the fifteenth century.</p>
          <p>Some hundred years after the latest Romanesque binding, parchment manuscript C 104 in
            the Metropolitan Chapter was bound and decorated with only two stamps. According to a
            manuscript entry, the binding was executed in 1404. The binder of this book, <hi
              rend="italic">De diversitate novitiorum</hi>, dated by Podlaha<ref target="f003.06.05"
              n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> in the beginning of the thirteenth century,
            identifies himself as Prior Martinus from an unknown Bohemian monastery. His name
            appears again as a purchaser in the two manuscripts VIII B 16 and III D 15 of the
            University Library together with a note indicating that he came from Wyschehrad, a
            sector of Prague, with the dates 1412 and 1410 respectively. In Ms. VIII B 16 it is also
            indicated that he was a prior at that time. The fact that parts of a parchment record
            from the Strahow monastery were used as the protective leaf preceding the first page at
            the front of both manuscripts may not be accepted as definitive proof that the monk
            belonged to this monastery. The following thirteen manuscripts in the University Library
            came from the same shop: IX A 4, XVII A 1, IV B 25, III C 1, V C 8, IX C 1, X C 6, I D
            24, V D 6, XIII D 22, I F 29, X G 16, IV H 2. All were probably bound in the first
            quarter of the fifteenth century by Prior Martin or one of his colleagues. As decoration
            for their covers ten different stamps are used, among which the two-tailed, crowned lion
            rampant in a rhomboid frame appears in two versions, the later of which is enclosed with
            lines. Bindings from this early period also are numbered among the rarities and have
            been described only in individual instances in the literature.</p>
          <p>From the second half of the fifteenth century on we have the period of the Gothic
            binding with its extraordinarily great wealth of stamp forms, going up into the
            thousands, and decorations. While the stamps probably were cut only by secular
            craftsmen, both secular and clerical craftsmen executed the bindings. But provenance
            from definite shops is still largely unknown today, partially because these binders
            almost never entered their name in a book and partially because they had no proper
            guild. Therefore, the search for bookbinders, especially in the tax lists, is
            extraordinarily difficult. Name stamps of the masters and the <pb n="003.110"/>
            monasteries or their arms, which were ordinarily used in only a few of the bindings, are
            also quite rare. Erfurt is an exception, and A. Rhein has listed the twenty-five names
            identified thus far.<ref target="f003.06.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref>
            Individual names, for example, Bartholom&auml;us, Jodocus, Severinus, etc., usually
            refer to saints. Further data on the characteristics of the decorated German binding may
            be found in Ernst Kyriss, "Der verzierte gotische Einband des deutschen
              Sprachgebietes."<ref target="f003.06.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref></p>
          <p>In dealing with such a large quantity of books as the some 3,000 volumes examined in
            Prague, only those which fall in certain well defined groups may be mentioned and
            designated by call number, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, (1) those for which the name of
            the binder or the location of the shop is perfectly clear, (2) those bound for a known
            patron, or (3) those whose bindings are superior to the great majority of ordinary
            bindings. As far as the imprint date usually given in the following notes is concerned,
            it should be observed that it is only an approximate indication of the date of the
            execution of the binding, since books are not necessarily bound at the time of printing
            or may be rebound years later. The earliest date means only that the activity of the
            shop did not begin before this time, and the latest means that it continued at least
            until that time. All references to dates in the following notes are made with these
            limitations on their significance.</p>
          <p>Many monasteries had their own binderies, in some of which hundreds of bindings were
            executed. Thus I have been able to assign 430 bindings to the Heilsbronn monastery<ref

          <p>766 bindings were the work of 225 unknown binders who operated in Germany, although the
            exact location of their shops has not yet been ascertained. From foreign countries, six
            French and seventy-six Italian bindings were identified. Bindings decorated with ribbons
            containing inscriptions in German may be listed among those which have been repeatedly
            discussed and reproduced in the literature, most recently by K. Holter.<ref
              target="f003.06.30" n="30"><hi rend="super">30</hi></ref> They are ascribed to Austria
            in the region between Kremsm&uuml;nster-Wilhering and Krems-G&uuml;ttweig during the
            period from 1460 to the beginning of the 1490s. Although Podlaha<ref target="f003.06.31"
              n="31"><hi rend="super">31</hi></ref> reproduces the binding of Ms. D 6 of the
            Metropolitan Chapter in his Fig. 190, Ms. I C 15 and Ms. VI G 4b of the University
            Library are noted here for the first time. With these two bindings the number of
            previously identified bindings with inscriptions on ribbons is increased to
            forty-two.</p>
          <p>Of the nineteen cuir-cisel&eacute; bindings Bollert<ref target="f003.06.32" n="32"><hi

              n="34"><hi rend="super">34</hi></ref> are in the <q>Metropolitan Chapter: Ms. A LXXIX
              1 and C 5 (Figs. 134 and 181) and Inc. C 62 (Plate IV in Podlaha's <hi rend="italic"
                >Catalogus incunabulorum qu&oelig; in bibliotheca Capituli Metropolitani Pragensis

          <pb n="003.117"/>
          <p>The remaining eleven cuir-cisel&eacute; bindings are in the University Library (Ms. IX
            B 2, VII C 19, VIII C 5, VI D 19, Inc. 41 D 7, 41 F 12, and, in the Lobkowitz-Raudnitz
            Library, Inc. II Ab 19, II Da 25, IV Kb 22, VI Ba 23/1) and the Metropolitan Chapter
            (Inc. E 2). This volume was bound by B. Trnka, and the title "Decreta patr" is incised
            only on a cross strip at the upper edge of the front cover, whereas the remainder of the
            binding is decorated with individual stamps. The two rhomboid stamps, the crowned double
            eagle and the unicorn, indicate relations to the cuir-cisel&eacute; bindings described
            by H. Herbst<ref target="f003.06.35" n="35"><hi rend="super">35</hi></ref> and which
            appear in connection with the name stamp mair bb. The bindings are probably the work of
            several different artists of the cuir-cisel&eacute;. Mss. VII C 19, III D 22, and VI D
            19 may be assigned to a shop dating from the beginning of the fifteenth century. Mss. IX
            B 2 and A LXXIX 1 belong to a somewhat later period. Inc. 41 F 12, Ms. C 5, Ms. Liber
            contractuum, and the four volumes from Raudnitz date from the last quarter of the
            fifteenth century. Representations of musicians (Fig. 4), soldiers, school scenes, and
            animals in this last group undoubtedly make it one of the most interesting. The use of
            this technique on half-leather bindings is also unusual and unknown in the literature.
            The outer frame of the front cover of Inc. 41 D 7 contains the incised inscription
            "liber / domini / geor/gi plebani. The remaining bindings should probably be considered
            as individual jobs.</p>
          <p>Drawings on leather showing foliage forms are found in the University Library on Mss.
            VI A 11, XVII C 22, VI F 10, and Inc. 39 A 39 as well as Ms. A 58 of the Metropolitan
            Chapter and XVI D 8 of the National Museum. The last book differs from the others in
            that here only the abbreviated two-line title "Bn&#x033E;hard<hi rend="super">9</hi>
            sr&vtilde; c&vtilde;c&vtilde; / c&amacr;tico&#x2643; appears on the upper edge of the
            front cover. It has been pointed out elsewhere that the rarity of books with the
            cuir-cisel&eacute; and drawing on leather may be ascribed to the manner of their
            execution.</p>
          <p>Two half-leather volumes from the first half of the sixteenth century may be considered
            unica. They are Inc. F 32 of the Metropolitan Chapter, depicted by Podlaha in Plate XII
            of his catalogue of incunabula in the Metropolitan Chapter, and Ms. XII D 4 of <pb
              n="003.118"/> the National Museum. On the upper edge of the front cover of both the
            title appears in three lines and is carved in wood. In the case of the second volume the
            title reads "prima.pars / speculi. sancto/ralis.1.5.2.2." (Fig. 5). The background of
            the inscription is blue. Fig. 5 also shows rubbings of the three rolls with which the
            cover was decorated, significant for showing the transition from Gothic to Renaissance
            styles.</p>
          <p>A more detailed consideration of the shops to which we may assign any large proportion
            of the books described thus far leads us first to the Celestine monastery of Oybin.
            Volumes which came from this monastery may be found in the following libraries:
              <q>University Library, twenty-seven manuscripts dated between 1434 and 1504: Ms. III A
              1, A 4, IV A 10, A 20, X A 18, IV B 4, V B 15, B 19, VIII B 13, IX B 7, III C 4, IV C
              4, C 13, V C 16, IV D 11, D 23, IV E 7, E 15, X E 10, III F 17, V F 14, VIII F 19, XIV
              F 2, IV G 12, G 21, III H 2, X H 7, and twenty-six volumes printed between 1472 and
              1515: Inc. 44 A 12, A 24, 44 B 14, 44 C 1 (four volumes, H 3175; 1, 3, 4, 7), C 10, 39
              D 11, 40 D 18, D 19, 40 E 21, 42 E 10, E 11, 43 E 18, 39 F 20, 42 F 38, 43 F 24, 44 F
              35, 43 G 21, 44 G 17, G 38, 30 H 14, and 33 B 18, 34 B 85, 31 E 16/2.</q>
            <q>Strahow monastery: twenty-two incunabula printed between 1474 and 1500: DM IV 30, DN
              III 12, 13, 19, IV 2, 4, 17, V 17, 22, VI 31, DO II 21, 22, III 4, IV 6, 25, VI 14, DP
              III 13, VI 23, DQ II 11, III 16, VII 14, DR I 6.</q></p>
          <p>These seventy-five volumes are decorated with thirty-four different stamps, of which
            the most frequently used are reproduced in Fig. 6. Characteristic for this monastery is
            the letter S in a square with a semi-circular elevation at the top. It is always
            impressed in a special place and in most instances between the crown with five points.
            The Bohemian lion also appears on a few volumes in the form of a shield. The inscribed
            ribbon "h.lucas" was encountered only twice. This shop operated from about 1472 until at
            least 1515.</p>
          <p>The following books of the Augustine monastery of Segeberg near L&uuml;beck came to
            Prague with the library of Heinrich von Rantzau: <q>University Library: Ms. XIV A 8 (two
              volumes), XIII C 8, VII E 17, IX F 10, XVI F 23, and thirteen volumes printed between
              1483 and 1507: Inc. 44 B 15, 39 D 15, 44 D 3, 40 E 14, 44 E 4, E 42, 44 F 2, 42 G 15,
              44 G 57, G 73, G 77, G 79, and 9 A 30.</q>
            <q>Strahow monastery: Inc. DN VI 18 of 1486.</q></p>
          <pb n="003.119"/>
          <p>Of the twenty-eight stamps which appear on twenty volumes there is a roll of a foliate
            staff and a panel in pomegranate form as well as the letter m in a small rectangle. The
            active period of this bindery extended from about 1483 until 1507.</p>
          <p>Fifty-four early manuscripts were presumably rebound between 1478 and 1514 in the
            Premonstratensian monastery of Weissenau, located in Wuerttemberg between the mediaeval
            trade center Ravensburg and Lake Constance. The larger proportion has already been
            enumerated by P. Lehmann.<ref target="f003.06.36" n="36"><hi rend="super">36</hi></ref>
            While I was able to secure evidence of eighteen different stamps on ninety-seven
            bindings, only four were used here, among them a frequently employed roll showing a pair
            of dragons with their necks intertwined. This pictorial theme is not infrequently
            encountered on Gothic bindings of Southern Germany. With a single exception all of the
            manuscripts belong to the library of Lobkowitz-Raudnitz: Ms. 234, 241, 245, 247, 248,
            266, 411, 422, 424-435, 437, 438, 440-442, 444, 449, 469-472, 474, 476, 479-482, 484,
            486, 488, 489, 494, 496, 499-501, 506, 508, 521, 527, 528, 530, 539. In addition there
            is DA IV 42 from Strahow monastery.</p>
          <p>Of two binders who were residents of Prague, one was accustomed to signing his name on
            about half of his bindings with the stamp "bartholomeus," always in a special place. He
            was active between 1478 and 1489, and fifty-six volumes executed by him are in the
            following libraries: <q>Metropolitan Chapter: forty incunabula printed between 1478 and
              1489: Ab 3, 15, 35, 46, B 20, 25, 71, 86, 104, C 24, 30, 38, 44, 51, 53, 72, 77, D 1,
              4-6, 18, 29, E 6, 15, 17, 18, 29, 30, 32, 72, 76, 97, 107, 112, 120, F 3-5, J 60.</q>
            <q>University Library, ten incunabula printed between 1479 and 1489: 39 A 13, 40 A 17,
              39 B 32, 39 C 8, 40 C 27, 40 D 37, 40 E 32, 41 E 22, 40 F 9, 41 F 19.</q>

            <q>National Museum: Inc. 66 C 10 of 1486.</q>
            <q>Municipal Archives: Ms. 2212.</q> Of his twenty-five different stamps, the most
            commonly used are two versions of the Bohemian lion and the two-tailed mermaid.</p>
          <p>Half of the thirty-four volumes from the second binder are <pb n="003.120"/> decorated
            with the coat of arms of the city of Prague. His sixty-three stamps illustrate, <hi
              rend="italic">inter alia</hi>, the double-headed heraldic eagle and the Bohemian lion,
            which, like the municipal arms, are present in different versions. There are also a
            mermaid and a shield with the unidentifiable initials C W. The books of this master are
            in the following libraries: <q>University Library: Ms. IV B 24, XVII A 11, H 26, and
              twelve incunabula printed between 1487 and 1499: 41 C 28, 42 C 1, C 18, 42 D 12, 42 E
              22, 43 E 19, 42 F 8, 44 F 45, 43 G 20, 44 G 53.</q>

            <q>Museum of Arts and Crafts: Inc. C 5335 of 1487.</q>
            <q>Municipal Archives: Ms. 2097.</q> This binder flourished between 1487 and 1499. In
            the interest of completeness, it should be noted that Prague's municipal arms appear on
            bindings in various forms during the subsequent centuries, a fact which may be verified
            by investigations in the Municipal Archives.</p>
          <p>It was probably in the first quarter of the sixteenth century that Rev. Bartholomeus
            Trnka of Krumau was active as a binder. In a parchment manuscript of the University
            Library, VI B 9, containing the <hi rend="italic">Martyrologium fratrum minorum</hi>, he
            advises that this book was rebound by him in 1527. A quatrefoil stamp surrounds a coat
            of arms with a wreath and four initialed semi-circles. The initials BT in the upper
            semi-circle are unquestionably an abbreviation of his name. Of the seventeen stamps
            identified thus far Fig. 7 shows the ones most frequently used. The following eighteen
            bindings from his shop are in four different libraries: <pb n="003.121"/>
            <q>University Library: Ms. VI B 9, XVII C 19, C 23, F 29, H 5, and Inc. 44 D 43, 41 E 21
              of 1499.</q>
            <q>Knights of Malta: IV B 61; 1, 4-6, 9 (five volumes) of 1506.</q>

            <q>National Museum: Ms. III H 28 and 71 D 19 of 1518.</q></p>
          <p>The binder of the Helia Ssech was also a resident of Bohemia. According to his own
            statements in the first volume of Inc. 65 A 3 (Cop. 6241) of the National Museum, he was
            an "administrator" in Leitomischl and a minister of the Gospel. In addition to initials
            and entwined borders, the first printed page contains two coats of arms illuminated with
            gold and colors. They also appear on some of his bindings in the same design but as a
            single stamp. One coat of arms consists of a two-pronged fork, the other of a simple
            cross. Presumably this binder was active between 1481 and 1494 as revealed by a study of
            nineteen of his bindings in the following libraries: <q>University Library: Ms. VI B 6,
              I D 27, XVII D 31, and Inc. 41 E 27, 40 G 10, 41 G 51, 42 G 2, printed between 1484
              and 1493, and 33 B 19.</q>

            <q>Municipal Archives: Inc. G 1451 of 1483.</q> The inscribed ribbon with the word
            "maria" in two versions and the four rhomboid symbols of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John
            are found among the thirty-six different stamps.</p>
          <p>Two binders worked for Bohuslaw Lobkowitz von Hassenstein, probably in Komotau. The
            active period of the older one extends from 1475 to 1486, and thirty-four of his
            bindings are in the following libraries: <q>University Library: Ms. XVII B 6 and Inc. 44
              C 35b of 1475.</q>
            <q>Lobkowitz-Raudnitz Library: Ms. VI Fe 39 and thirty incunabula printed between 1476

          <p>The most productive Bohemian binder was the younger man with 171 identified bindings.
            Except for Inc. 43 D 8 and Lobkowitz II Ec 16 in the University Library, 73 D 6 in the
            National Museum, and Inc. C 1839 in the Museum of Arts and Crafts, all the books are

              >39</hi></ref> Of the sixty-two stamps that he used there is one round stamp which
            shows a rhomboid field and a lion rampant on a shield divided into four parts. Of the
            twelve stamps which are used on at least one-seventh of the bindings, nine are
            reproduced in Fig. 8. The roof-shaped Gothic chain of tendrils appears in five forms.
            This binder, like his predecessor, and in contrast with the customary style of the time,
            bound his books almost exclusively in half-leather and arranged the clasps in the
            Italian style (reaching from the front cover to the back cover). His active period dates
            from the end of the fifteenth century until 1510, when his patron died.</p>
          <p>Among the individual stamps which are characteristic for the Bohemian shops are the
            two-tailed lion, which appears in numerous variations, as well as the otherwise rather
            unusual mermaid with two fish-tails. One binder, who is presumed to have worked in
            Wittingau between 1474 and 1500, had among his forty-four different stamps (used on
            thirty-eight volumes) a small rectangular form with a group representing the Crucifixion
            and an inscribed ribbon with the name "ulricus". From the group the following bindings

            transverses as the upper and lower limits of the covers (Fig. 9).</p>
          <p>Two other shops, of which fifty and seventy volumes respectively have been identified,
            may be dated at the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries and
            reveal a heavy dependence on Leipzig with respect to the forms of the stamps, the
            division of the covers of the books, and the use of at most five different stamps on a
            single book. The first binder had eleven stamps, among which were an ornamental open

          <p>The remaining portion of this essay deals with books which were once in the possession
            of well-known persons. It includes the period from the fifteenth to the eighteenth
            centuries. The oldest volumes belonged to Johann von Kolowrat, a member of the old
            Bohemian noble family that appears as early as the beginning of the eleventh century. He
            was "administrator" of the archdiocese of Prague and died in 1483. Most of his books
            were richly illuminated in gold and other colors and adorned with his coat of arms.
            Pictures of these illuminations are reproduced by Podlaha in <hi rend="italic">Die
              Bibliothek des Metropolitankapitels</hi>, Figs. 294, 302, 309-311. In Inc. Ab 42, C 50
            and F 12 Kolowrat made a manuscript entry indicating that he had bought them in 1482.
            The Metropolitan Chapter has the following thirteen incunabula which belonged to him: A
            1, Ab 42, B 12, C 50, E 6, 12, 14, 114, F 6, 7, 12, G 10, J 11; and Inc. 40 A 7 of the
            University Library and Ms. XVI D 13 of the National Museum also were in his library
            originally.</p>
          <p>Of books which were once in the library of Canon Johann Herttemberger de Elbogen de
            Cubito the University Library owns Ms. A 79; 1 and Inc. 39 D 46, and the following
            thirteen volumes are in the Metropolitan Chapter: Ms. A 28; 2 (Podlaha <hi rend="italic"
              >Die Bibliothek des Metropolitankapitels</hi>, Fig. 103), A 28; 3 (Podlaha, Fig. 105),
            A 73; 2, B 16; 2 (<hi rend="italic">supra</hi>), and Inc. B 25, 71, C 8, 30, 31, 37, 94,
            J 20, 56. Inc. C 8 bears a manuscript notation that it was bought in 1493, while Ms. A
            73; 2 has a note that it was bought in 1495.</p>
          <p>Manuscript 418 of the library of the Princes Lobkowitz consists of medical treatises
            written in 1490 and 1491 by Dr. Ulrich Ellenbog in Memmingen, where he also had the book
            bound. Ellenbog was born around 1435 in Feldkirch and served, <hi rend="italic">inter
              alia</hi>, as episcopal physician in Augsburg and personal physician of Archduke
            Sigismund of Tirol, and died in 1499 as municipal physician in Memmingen.</p>
          <p>The National Museum owns Inc. 66 A 7 (GW 3114), printed before 1473 in Strassburg and
            bound in Erfurt, originally in the library of Ellenbog's Nuremberg contemporary and
            colleague, Dr. <pb n="003.126"/> Hartmann Schedel (1440-1514). Schedel, a Nuremberg
            physician, was accustomed to identifying all his books with a red mark of ownership,
            usually inside of the front cover. The family coat of arms, designed around a Negro's
            head, was usually painted on the lower edge of the first written or printed page. Most
            of his library, which once consisted of more than 600 works, is a well known treasure of
            the Staatsbibliothek in Munich. Accordingly, it is quite unusual to find his books in
            other libraries. Schedel is famous above all for his <hi rend="italic">Weltchronik</hi>,
            printed in 1493 in Nuremberg in two editions with Latin and German texts and illustrated
            with almost 1,800 woodcuts, the most richly decorated printed book of the fifteenth
            century.</p>
          <p>A third great book collector was the Nuremberg jurist and humanist, Dr. Christoph
            Scheurl. In his case, too, only scattered examples of his books may be located in public
            libraries, since the collection remained in the ownership of the family. Scheurl was
            born in Nuremberg in 1481 and died there in 1542. Inc. 42 D 35 of the University
            Library, containing three Venetian imprints of 1494 and 1495 (H 12220, HC 10824, and C
            4555), is in an Italian binding and has an ownership notation dated 1500. In addition,
            on the inside of the front cover is the wood-cut bookplate Scheurl-Tucher (Warnecke no.
              1896<ref target="f003.06.40" n="40"><hi rend="super">40</hi></ref>), while that of
            Scheurl and his two sons is pasted on the inside of the back cover.</p>
          <p>The student Andreas Schwob of Freystadt left nine books, of which four are in the
            University Library (Inc. 41 C 14, D 15, G 5, 42 G 27) and five in Strahow monastery
            (Inc. DN IV 5, DO II 14, VI 32, DQ III 1, 18). According to notes in his own hand, he
            bought them in 1490-1493 while he was a student in the University of Leipzig. It may be
            assumed that Schwob studied theology, since the books contain fifteen theological
            treatises, one historical and one legal work. Such notes, rather uncommon in general,
            can give (<hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>) information about the locality in which the
            bindings were executed.</p>
          <p>Far out ahead of other sixteenth century collectors, Peter Vok von Rosenberg holds
            first place with the rich library collected at his estates in Bechin, Krumau, and
            Wittingau. When he died without issue at the age of seventy-three, all his property
            reverted to the crown. In 1647 his books were transferred to Prague, <pb n="003.127"/>
            but in the next year they were sent to Sweden as booty of war.<ref target="f003.06.41"
              n="41"><hi rend="super">41</hi></ref> A book plate engraved by Aug. Sadeler in 1609
            was executed in three different sizes and is used as the mark of ownership. In general
            the largest was used for folios (Warnecke, Plate XVI), and only in Ms. VII F 25 of the
            University Library could an example of the smallest be found. In spite of the
            sequestration, a hundred volumes could be found in Prague: <q>University Library:

            Augustine monastery in Wittingau, nineteen that of the monastery in Borovany. The
            binding of the printed book 22 G 303 (1596) in the University Library has an oval panel
            stamp in black, fifty-nine mm. in height in the center of both the front and back
            covers. One panel reproduces the arms of Rosenberg with the numeral 1586, the other only
            a thirteen-line inscription within a frame (also inscribed).</p>
          <p>From the library of the older brother, Wilhelm von Rosenberg (died 1592), one volume
            has been located in the University Library and another in the Provincial Archives. On
            the front cover of both books his arms appear as a panel stamp, but in two different
            forms. The first book (54 B 13) is in the University Library and was printed in Bohemia
            in 1574, and the second, Ms. Wodnian 9, was bound in 1560 according to the stamped
            inscription.</p>
          <p>The University Library's 1544 imprint with call number 12 H 141 is identified by a coat
            of arms accompanied by an inscription on the front cover indicating that it was once the
            property of the president of the Prague Appelate Court, Johann von Hasenburg. <pb
              n="003.128"/> It may probably be dated in the middle of the sixteenth century.</p>
          <p>Printed books 19 C 92 of 1597 and 14 J 176 of 1551 in the same library have a bust of
            Tycho Brahe in an oval inscribed frame on the front cover and his coat of arms in black
            or gold impressions on the back cover. Both panels are reproduced by Bogeng<ref
              target="f003.06.42" n="42"><hi rend="super">42</hi></ref> in a form somewhat smaller
            than the original. The older book, Erasmus Reinholdus' <hi rend="italic">Prutenic&oelig;
              tabul&oelig; c&oelig;lestium motuum</hi>, is the presentation copy of the author to
            Counts Johann Georg and Johann Albert von Mansfeld, according to a manuscript note in
            red ink. Tycho himself has written in the volume that he bought it in Prague in 1601.
            Born in 1546 in Denmark, Tycho lived in his native land until 1597 and then spent the
            last four years of his life in Prague.</p>
          <p>The mark of ownership of the Danish statesman, historian, and wealthy art patron Henrik
            von Rantzau has been identified in eighteen volumes. From 1556 until his death in 1598
            he was "Statthalter" of Slesvik-Holstein, and, as we have already noted, his books came
            to Prague as booty of war. Identified volumes are located in the following libraries:
              <q>University Library: Ms. XIV A 8 (two volumes), XIII C 12, IX F 10, XIV H 28, and
              Inc. 39 A 17 (two volumes), 44 B 15, 41 C 9, 43 E 23, 42 F 35, 43 F 4, 40, 42 G 15, 44
              G 57 and 16 A 42, 24 B 5.</q>
            <q>Strahow monastery: Inc. DO IV 19.</q> In addition to these early bindings decorated
            with single stamps, six additional ones from a later period have been identified on
            which the decoration consists of rolls and panel stamps. In the University Library there
            are 14 A 42, H 13, 16 H 48, while the Knights of Malta owned C VI K 232; 6, 7, 9 (three
            volumes). Judging from the latter, Rantzau had four different panel stamps, two with his
            arms and the inscription "Heinrich Rantzau Stathalter" and two with the arms of his wife
            and different inscriptions. The smaller pair of panel stamps with the notation
            "Christinna von Halle" is described by Haebler.<ref target="f003.06.43" n="43"><hi

            the panel of the man and in the use of the spelling "Christinae von Halle" (Fig. 10). In
            addition to the panel stamps, rolls with the initials G.V. are used (described by
              Haebler<ref target="f003.06.44" n="44"><hi rend="super">44</hi></ref>).</p>
          <p>Castiglione's <hi rend="italic">Il libro del cortegiano</hi> of 1541, shelved in the
            University Library as 13 J 114, represents the end of the sixteenth century. According
            to an inscription impressed in the center field of the rear cover, the richly gilded
            binding of brown leather drawn over cardboard covers was probably executed in Rome
            between 1541 and 1547 for Apollonius Philaretus, the papal secretary. Its rarity was
            established by Hobson,<ref target="f003.06.45" n="45"><hi rend="super">45</hi></ref>
            who, although he dealt with this collector in detail, did not know this book. All in
            all, he could identify only nine bindings. The general execution and the decoration of
            the cover is similar to the one reproduced by Hobson as Plate 54.</p>
          <p>The two following centuries have produced only a few worth-while items for the
            University Library. The parchment-bound imprint of 1694 with the call number 5 J 62
            comes from the collection of the old Bohemian noble family of Sternberg. A coat of arms
            within an oval laurel wreath with the inscription "Ignatius Carolus Comes de Sternberg"
            is impressed in gold in the center of the cover.</p>
          <p>A German book, C II D 58, from the first quarter of the eighteenth century, belongs to
            the Knights of Malta, and a Czech folio, 54 A 36, of the same period, belongs to the
            University Library. It is quite certain that both of them were printed and bound for the
            bibliophile Count Franz Anton von Sporck (born 1662). They are richly decorated with
            woodcuts, among which the baronial arms frequently appear. The coat of arms of the
            patron within a baroque frame is the sole decoration of the cover and appears in the
            form of a panel stamp 289 x 214 mm. in size. Another German book, <hi rend="italic">Die
              Tugend-Schule der Christen</hi>, a Prague imprint of 1715, is also preserved in a
            similar binding in the State Library in Eichst&auml;tt with call number Lit. N IV 160
            (Fig. 11) and in the Library of the Landesgewerbemuseum in Stuttgart under No. 3822.
            Sporck was a patron of all fields of art. Among other projects, he maintained a theatre
            in Prague from his private <pb n="003.130"/> fortune, and Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer was
            one of his architects. In Kukus, his estate in north Bohemia, he established his own
            press. He died in Lissa in 1738.</p>
          <p>After this inspection of the treasures of the libraries of Prague, it may be stated
            that the Bohemian capital attained a high level of achievement in the narrow field of
            the book arts, and close relations with Germany have been noted. But the high competence
            of these craftsmen, designers, stamp cutters, and bookbinders only becomes apparent
            after a study of the fine craftsmanship and well handled materials in bindings which are
            hundreds of years old.</p>

          <head/>
          <p>FOR MOST OF SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS OF WHICH pre-folio quarto texts as well as the folio
            text itself exist, the relationship between Q and F has been determined.<ref
              target="f003.07.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> About certain of the plays,
            however, some question remains. <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> is such a
            play. Two early printed editions of <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> exist:
            the quarto printed in 1609 by George Eld for the publishers Richard Bonion and Henry
            Walley, and the text in the first Folio published in 1623. Conclusive evidence as to the
            relationship of the Q and F texts has not been presented; it is the purpose of this
            article to offer new evidence that will establish, on a bibliographical basis, the
            textual relationship of the two extant early printed editions of the play.</p>
          <p>Serious study of the relationship of the Q and F texts of <hi rend="italic">Troilus and
              Cressida</hi> began with the work of the editors of <hi rend="italic">The Cambridge
              Shakespeare</hi> in 1865. W. G. Clark and W. A. Wright expressed a theory about the
            relationship that was widely accepted for the next fifty years: <q>The two texts differ
              in many single words: sometimes the difference is clearly owing to a clerical or
              typographical error, but in other cases it appears to result from deliberate
              correction, first by the author himself, and secondly by some less skillful hand. . .
              . On the whole we are of the opinion that the Quarto was printed from a transcript of
              the author's original MS.; that his MS. was afterwards revised and slightly altered by
              the author himself, and that before the first Folio was printed from it, it had been
              tampered with by another hand.<ref target="f003.07.02" n="2"><hi rend="super"
                >2</hi></ref></q>
            <pb n="003.132"/> Charles Knight, however, in his edition of the play in 1875, offered a
            somewhat different theory: <q>From whatever secondary source it [the quarto] proceeded,
              there can be no doubt that it was printed from a genuine copy of the great poet. The
              slight variations between the text of the quarto and of the folio . . . sufficiently
              show that the original was most accurately printed. The alterations of the folio are
              not corrections of errors in the original, but, for the most part, slight changes in
              expression. We have no doubt that each text was printed from a different but genuine
                copy.<ref target="f003.07.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref></q></p>
          <p>The only detailed study of the 1609 quarto in the nineteenth century was made by H. P.
            Stokes and appeared in his introduction of the Griggs facsimile of the quarto.<ref
              target="f003.07.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> He pointed out that "The Folio
            is careful to give a separate line to the commencement of <hi rend="italic">each
              speech</hi>; indeed this fondness for fresh lines is so great that if Q. by mistake
            has a new paragraph, F. is sure to 'say ditto'."<ref target="f003.07.05" n="5"><hi
                rend="super">5</hi></ref> But he then adds: "This [the stage directions] seems to
            suggest that the 'Troilus and Cressida' as it appears in the 1st Folio, was printed from
            the Theater copy."<ref target="f003.07.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref></p>
          <p>Appleton Morgan, in his preface to the Bankside edition of the play, wrote: "The
            variants in the quarto and folio texts (so carefully listed by Mr. Stokes) seem to me
            all chargeable to typographical sources . . . the later printer might easily have been
            responsible for them all."<ref target="f003.07.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref>
            Nine years later, Sidney Lee stated that the editors of the folio "evinced distrust of
            the quarto by printing their text from a different copy."<ref target="f003.07.08" n="8"
                ><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> And in 1909, A. W. Pollard concluded that the quarto
            had not been used in the printing of the folio.<ref target="f003.07.09" n="9"><hi
                rend="super">9</hi></ref> Pollard's view, supported by J. Q. Adams,<ref
              target="f003.07.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> seems to have prevailed for
            the next twenty years, for in the Yale <pb n="003.133"/> edition, N. Burton Paradise
            states, "It is now believed that the Folio was printed from a manuscript belonging to
            the theater and the Quarto from a copy made for the private use of some friend of the
              actors."<ref target="f003.07.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref></p>
          <p>The first important work on <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> after Pollard
            was Peter Alexander's study of the quarto in 1928.<ref target="f003.07.12" n="12"><hi
                rend="super">12</hi></ref> In this article, Alexander differs with Pollard and comes
            to the conclusion that the folio text was printed from a copy of the quarto that had
            been corrected from a manuscript in the possession of Hemming and Condell.<ref
              target="f003.07.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> In the same year (1928), W.
            W. Greg had stated in a lecture before the British Academy that the folio text of <hi
              rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> was printed "not from the previous quarto
            text, but from an independent manuscript representing substantially the same
              version."<ref target="f003.07.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref></p>
          <p>Two years after Alexander's article, E. K. Chambers wrote that he was "inclined to
            think that F was set up from a copy of Q, not so much because of a few misreadings and
            abnormal spellings [Chambers must here refer to Alexander's article] which they have in
            common, since these might be derived from a common original, as because of a traceable
            resemblance in typography and the like."<ref target="f003.07.15" n="15"><hi rend="super"
                >15</hi></ref></p>
          <pb n="003.134"/>
          <p>In an attempt to refute the views of Alexander and Chambers, Dr. S. A. Tannenbaum
            published an extended textual study of <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> in
              1934.<ref target="f003.07.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> Dr. Tannenbaum
            explained the similarities between Q and F (many of which he lists) by assuming that
            these were found in two manuscripts from which Q and F were independently printed, and,
            having listed certain corruptions in the F text, concludes: <q>Such absurdities serve to
              establish the facts that F was not printed from Q, was set up from a manuscript which
              was difficult to read (or that the copyist could not decipher his original), that the
              copies for Q [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] were prepared by different scribes, and that
              the F text, though better than Q's, is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> careful and was not
                authorized.<ref target="f003.07.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref></q></p>
          <p>Reversing the opinion expressed in his British Academy lecture, W. W. Greg in 1939 came
            to support Alexander's view: "F appears to have actually been set up from a corrected
            copy of Q. I think there can be no doubt of this. Besides common errors and unusual
            spellings there are several points where the arrangement of F can only be explained by
            peculiarities in Q that the latter is unlikely to have taken over from its copy."<ref
              target="f003.07.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref></p>
          <p>That the textual relationship of Q and F remains obscure is shown by the remarks of two
            recent editors of the play. G. L. Kittredge, in 1936, wrote: "The relation between the
            text of the Quarto and that of the Folio is not clear, but the differences are
              unimportant."<ref target="f003.07.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> And G. B.
            Harrison, the most recent editor of the play, states: "The quarto issued in 1609 is
            fairly well printed, but differs in many small points from the text printed in the
            folio. Each version contains short passages omitted by the other. From certain
            similarities in the setting of the two texts, it seems either that the folio text was
            printed from a copy of the quarto carefully but not uniformly corrected from a playhouse
            copy, or that both texts derive from a common original."<ref target="f003.07.20" n="20"
                ><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref></p>
          <pb n="003.135"/>
          <p>Although it is evident that since Alexander's article in 1928, the trend has, in
            general, been away from the view of Clark, Wright, Pollard, and Adams, the foregoing
            survey shows that there is still uncertainty about the relationship of Q and F. Until
            this relationship is settled, study of the text of <hi rend="italic">Troilus and
              Cressida</hi> must rest on doubtful grounds.</p>

          <p>The problem of determining that one edition served as copy for a second edition has
            interested bibliographers for some time. R. B. McKerrow discusses the bibliographical
            evidence that can be used to determine the relationship of editions, his general
            conclusion being that the best proof of the relationship of two editions is the
            demonstration that the second edition reproduces abnormalities that had their origin in
            the shop where the first edition was printed: <q>. . . whenever he [the editor] comes
              across anything abnormal in the typographical arrangement of a text, it will generally
              pay him to consider whether this may be due to the blind following of an earlier
                edition.<ref target="f003.07.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref></q> Although
            no single piece of evidence that I shall now present can, in itself, be taken as
            indisputable proof that F was printed from a copy of Q, the cumulative effect of this
            evidence cannot, I think, be questioned: for this evidence demonstrates that F
            reproduces peculiarities found in Q that had their origin in George Eld's printing shop.
            Previous investigators have noted certain of the similarities between Q and F. As these
            similarities apparently have not been sufficient to clinch the relationship of Q and F,
            I shall confine myself to kinds of evidence that have not, for the most part, been
            previously considered.<ref target="f003.07.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref>
            This evidence will be drawn from (1) the use of roman and italic type, (2)
            speech-heading forms, and (3) significant spellings.</p>

            <hi rend="italic">Italic and Roman Type:</hi>
          </p>
          <p>The fact that F agrees with Q in the use of italic or roman type when its use is
            dictated by the typographical conventions followed in each cannot, of course, be
            considered as evidence of their relationship; but when aberrancies in Q are reproduced
            in F, this agreement becomes significant. It is the normal practice in both Q and F to
            use italic type for proper names, both in the text and in the stage-directions.
            Exceptions to this general practice occur, in Q, and it is significant that F then
            reproduces the roman type used in Q:<ref target="f003.07.23" n="23"><hi rend="super"

            <hi rend="italic">Speech-headings:</hi>
          </p>
          <p>In the pre-1640 dramatic manuscripts that have survived, there is little consistency in
            the treatment of speech-headings save that they were written in the left margin of the
            page. In the manuscript of <hi rend="italic">John of Kent</hi>, speech-headings are
            invariably written out in full, and generally so in <hi rend="italic">Believe as Ye
              List</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ironsides</hi>; in other plays they are more often
              abbreviated.<ref target="f003.07.24" n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref> W. W. Greg,
            describing extant dramatic manuscripts, says: "Speakers' names are usually abbreviated,
            but the practice varies: Massinger tends to write them in full, while on some pages of
              <hi rend="italic">Thomas of Woodstock</hi> they are reduced to an initial. A scribe
            would often write a page of text first and add the speakers' names later: this tended to
            produce bad alinement, but ambiguity was generally avoided by the practice of drawing
            short lines on the left separating the speeches."<ref target="f003.07.25" n="25"><hi
                rend="super">25</hi></ref> In the three pages of the <hi rend="italic">Sir Thomas
              More</hi> manuscript written by Hand D, the thirteen speech-headings for the character
            Lincoln appear as follows: Lincolne, Linco, Linc, Lin, Lin, Lin, Linc, Linc, Linc, Linc,
            Lincolne, Lincolne, and Lincoln.</p>
          <p>I do not think the question has ever been specifically studied, but it is my impression
            that compositors attempted, consciously <pb n="003.138"/> or unconsciously, to normalize
            speech-headings. If the speech-headings in his copy were abbreviated fairly uniformly,
            the compositor would presumably follow his copy. If, however, the speech-headings were
            written out in full, or if they varied radically, the compositor would probably
            establish a norm abbreviation of his own, at least for the most frequently appearing
              speech-headings.<ref target="f003.07.26" n="26"><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref> An
            analysis of the speech-heading forms in <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi>
            shows a tendency to normalize the abbreviations.</p>
          <p>In speech-headings Troilus' name is generally abbreviated in Q to <hi rend="italic"
              >Troy.</hi>, but there are exceptions. Between F1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and the
            bottom of F3, the form <hi rend="italic">Troy.</hi> appears seventeen times, but on
              F3<hi rend="super">v</hi> the three speeches of Troilus are each prefixed with <hi
              rend="italic">Tro</hi>. On H1 we find the normal abbreviation <hi rend="italic"
              >Troy.</hi>, but on the following two pages (H1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and H2) the
            abbreviation <hi rend="italic">Troyl.</hi> is used seven times. On H3 (Troilus does not
            have a speech on H2<hi rend="super">v</hi>) the shift is back to <hi rend="italic"
              >Troy</hi>. On K3<hi rend="super">v</hi> and K4<hi rend="super">v</hi> we find the
            normal abbreviation <hi rend="italic">Troy.</hi> appearing seven times, but on K4, the
            form <hi rend="italic">Troyl.</hi> appears four times. Similar evidence of shifts at the
            end of the type-page is supplied by the speech-headings for Pandarus. On A4<hi
              rend="super">v</hi>, for example, we find the form <hi rend="italic">Pand.</hi> used
            nine times, and the catch-word is <hi rend="italic">Pand.</hi>; but on B1 there is a
            shift to <hi rend="italic">Pan.</hi>, which appears thirteen times. Similarly, the
            speech-headings for Hector are abbreviated <hi rend="italic">Hect.</hi> for his four
            speeches on L1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, but on L2 the shorter form <hi rend="italic"
              >Hec.</hi> is used four times. On G3<hi rend="super">v</hi> the speech-heading for
            Thersites appears as <hi rend="italic">Thersi.</hi> (five times); but on the following
            page (G4) the form <hi rend="italic">Thers.</hi> appears eleven times. Other evidence of
            a similar nature can be drawn from the speech-headings of other characters.</p>
          <p>It will be noted that the shift in these speech-heading forms coincides with the end of
            the type-page. Now unless we are willing to believe that similar shifts occurred in the
            MS from which Q was set and that these shifts each time happened to coincide with the
            end of a type-page of Q, we must accept the fact that these shifts in speech-heading
            forms represent the tendency to normalize by the compositors of Q.<ref
              target="f003.07.27" n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref> In other words, the
            speech-headings <pb n="003.139"/> in Q cannot <hi rend="italic">all</hi> represent
            manuscript readings; for if we suppose that the Q forms reproduce manuscript readings,
            we must assume against all reason that these shifts in the manuscript coincided with the
            arbitrary (37 lines to a page) page division of Q. Such a hypothesis, involving such a
            chain of coincidences, seems to me to be untenable.</p>
          <p>Analysis of the speech-headings in F affords additional evidence that F was set from Q.
            We have seen that the variations in the forms of certain speech-headings in Q cannot
            represent readings found in the manuscript from which it was set. If, therefore, we find
            the compositors<ref target="f003.07.28" n="28"><hi rend="super">28</hi></ref> of F
            reproducing these variations, we shall have proof that F was set from Q. Although the
            folio compositors normalized speech-headings somewhat more uniformly than did the quarto
            compositors, there remains sufficient evidence to establish the relationship of the two
            texts.</p>
          <p>In the quarto, the speech-headings for Pandarus are normally abbreviated to either <hi
              rend="italic">Pan.</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pand</hi>. Both of the folio compositors
            generally normalize these speech-headings to <hi rend="italic">Pan</hi>. The following
            significant exceptions occur, with F reproducing the longer form found in Q: <table>

          <p>In Q the Speech-heading for Ajax is sometines written out in full. In F it is usually
            abbreviated <hi rend="italic">Aia</hi>. F uses the longer form ten times, in each case
            reproducing the full form found in Q.</p>
          <p>And finally, the absence of a speech-heading in Q and F alike at II.iii.1 suggests that
            F was printed from Q. In Q, the first line on D4<hi rend="super">v</hi> is the centered
            stage-direction, <hi rend="italic">Enter</hi> Thersites <hi rend="italic">solus</hi>.
            His speech, indented but without speech-heading, begins on the following line. In F, the
            stage direction <hi rend="italic">Enter</hi> Thersites <hi rend="italic">solus</hi> is
            centered and the speech, indented but without speech-heading, begins on the following
            line.</p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Spellings:</hi>
          </p>
          <p>The fact that F reproduces a given spelling in Q cannot be considered evidence of the
            dependence of F upon Q. Such a single spelling, particularly if it were unusual, might
            represent a manuscript spelling independently reproduced in the two texts.<ref
              target="f003.07.29" n="29"><hi rend="super">29</hi></ref> But if F is independent of
            Q, we should not find F reproducing indiscriminate spelling variants found in Q; nor
            should we find F reproducing the characteristic spellings of the two compositors of Q.
            In two groups of words, F reproduces these indiscriminate variations; and in a third
            group, F reproduces the characteristic spelling of the two Q compositors.</p>
          <p>The use of final <hi rend="italic">ie</hi> for <hi rend="italic">y</hi> in
            polysyllables is not a characteristic spelling of the compositors of either Q or F.
            Seventy-two such <pb n="003.141"/> spellings, however, are found in Q; the compositors
            of F reproduce forty-six of these spellings. The explanation of these F spellings must
            be that the F compositors were influenced by their copy to depart from their normal
            spelling habits.<ref target="f003.07.30" n="30"><hi rend="super">30</hi></ref></p>
          <p>In Q, the exclamation 'Oh' is spelled indiscriminately 'O' and 'Oh.' In F, it is, with
            twenty-one exceptions, spelled 'O.'<ref target="f003.07.31" n="31"><hi rend="super"
                >31</hi></ref> Only seven times when Q has 'Oh' does F not reproduce the form; and
            only once does F use 'Oh' when the corresponding Q spelling is 'O.'</p>
          <p>Compositors A and B of the folio occasionally depart from their normal spelling habits.
            Compositor B, who normally spells <hi rend="italic">do</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
              >go</hi> without a final <hi rend="italic">e</hi>, five times spells these words with
            a final <hi rend="italic">e</hi>. And Compositor A, who normally uses a final <hi
              rend="italic">e</hi>, thirteen times spells these words without the characteristic
            final <hi rend="italic">e</hi>. These exceptions to the characteristic spelling
            practices of the two F compositors furnish the most striking evidence of the
            relationship of Q and F. Seventeen of these eighteen exceptions reproduce spellings
            found in Q, and these Q spellings are characteristic spellings of the quarto compositors
            X and Y. In the following cases, we find the folio compositors reproducing significant Q
            spellings that are the peculiar spellings of compositors X and Y and cannot therefore
              <hi rend="italic">all</hi> have existed in any manuscript.</p>

          <p>The evidence presented here, supported by the evidence that previous investigators have
            brought to light, demonstrates, I hope, that F was indeed set up from a copy of Q. The
            implications of this fact may now be briefly considered.</p>
          <p>We can, first of all, define the authority of the two extant early printed editions of
            the play. W. W. Greg writes: <q>"In seeking to determine which is the most authoritative
              edition, an editor should distinguish between 'substantive' editions, namely those not
              derived as to essential character from any other extant edition, and 'derivative'
              editions, namely those derived, whether immediately or not and with or without minor
              intentional modification, from some other extant edition. It may be taken that the
              most authoritative edition will be a substantive one, but the distinction is in
              practice sometimes difficult to draw, so that this has less significance than at first
                appears."<ref target="f003.07.33" n="33"><hi rend="super">33</hi></ref></q></p>
          <p>The 1609 quarto of <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> is a 'substantive'
            edition, and the 1623 folio text of <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> is a
            'derivative' edition. But it is demonstrable that F is not wholly a derivative edition,
            for it has some thirty various lines that are not found in Q.<ref target="f003.07.34"
              n="34"><hi rend="super">34</hi></ref> These lines are all clearly genuine and have
            been accepted as such by all editors. Since these lines were not in Q, from which F was
            set, they must have been supplied from some outside source, i.e. a manuscript.<ref
              target="f003.07.35" n="35"><hi rend="super">35</hi></ref> This manuscript supplied not
            only the lines wanting in Q but also almost certainly some of the substantive variant
            readings found in F.<ref target="f003.07.36" n="36"><hi rend="super">36</hi></ref> The
            folio text of <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> must therefore be defined as a
            derivative edition containing some substantive readings emanating from an independent
            source.</p>
          <pb n="003.143"/>
          <p>But defining the authority of Q and F solves only the first of a series of problems
            confronting the editor of the play. He must next investigate the origin and nature of
            the manuscript behind the substantive readings in F, as well as the origin and nature of
            the manuscript from which Q was set; he should, however, make Q&mdash;the only
            substantive edition of the play&mdash;the copy-text for his edition. The use of F's
            variant readings, except to repair obvious corruption in Q, would be dependent on the
            editor's estimate of the nature and authority of the manuscript from which they
              come.<ref target="f003.07.37" n="37"><hi rend="super">37</hi></ref></p>

            <p>Alexander cites as proof that the folio text was printed from a copy of the quarto
              ten "errors" found alike in both texts, and seven "readings, which, though not
              recognized as errors by Clark and Wright, are unlikely in independent texts" (pp. 269,
              271). Mr. Alexander, as we shall see, is correct in believing that the folio text was
              printed from a copy of the quarto, but as E. K. Chambers implies (see below), he does
              not refute the possibility that these seventeen readings existed in the original
              manuscript or manuscripts from which the quarto and folio were independently
              printed.</p>

              to Folio," but I can find no evidence to support this statement. Greg later (see
              below) supports Alexander's view, but in the lecture before the British Academy he
              clearly stated that the folio was not printed from the quarto.</p>

              sentence on the following page (441) has led at least one investigator (Dr.
              Tannenbaum, see below) to the erroneous conclusion that Chambers contradicts himself,
              saying first that F was printed from Q and later that F was printed from the author's
              original manuscript. The sentence reads, "If I am right as to iv.5.96, the manuscript
              used for F was probably the author's original, and the variations between Q and F are
              intelligible on the assumption that this was so and that Q was printed from a
              transcript, perhaps for a private owner." By the phrase "the manuscript used for F"
              Chambers means, of course, the manuscript used for correcting a copy of Q from which F
              was then printed.</p>

                and Cressida and Its Relation to the Folio Text of 1623</hi> (The University of
              Virginia, 1949), the evidence of the relationship of Q and F is presented in somewhat
              greater detail, and certain kinds of evidence, notably lining practices, are included
              which cannot be presented here. In addition to its bearing on the present problem, I
              hope that the evidence here presented will suggest techniques that can successfully be
              applied to other problems of a similar nature.</p>

            <p>An examination of the comedy section of the folio reveals only eight other

              assuming that the compositor followed his copy in spite of the typographical

            <p>This can be demonstrated in at least one other dramatic quarto that I have studied.
              In <hi rend="italic">The Puritaine</hi>, printed by Eld in 1607, the name of the
              character George Pye-board is variously spelled in the text: Pie-board, Pye-boord,
              Pi-Board, and Pyboard. Two compositors, working in relay, set the text of <hi
                rend="italic">The Puritaine</hi>: one normalized the speech-heading to <hi
                rend="italic">Pi(y)e.</hi>, whereas the other used the abbreviation <hi
                rend="italic">Pi(y)b</hi>. The speech-headings in <hi rend="italic">Sir John
                Oldcastle</hi> (1600), at present being investigated, seem to exhibit similar
              variations.</p>

            <p>Spelling tests, supported by the evidence of measures and certain typographical
              peculiarities, indicate that two compositors were employed in setting the Q text of
                <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi>. I designate them X and Y to distinguish
              them from the two folio compositors, A and B. See below. The compositors of Q and F,

            <p>Certain of these <hi rend="italic">ie</hi> spellings are particularly significant. At
              I.i.174, the word 'fiftie' is the last word of the line in Q. The spelling with the
              final <hi rend="italic">ie</hi> was probably adopted as a means of justifying the
              line. In F the word is the first word of the line and does not therefore represent a
              spelling adopted to justify the line. At II.iii.113, Q's spelling 'courtesie' is
              reproduced by F, and at IV.v.82 and V.v.15, Q's variant spelling 'curtesie' is
              likewise reproduced by F.</p>

              edition which cannot have been derived from any other edition now extant . . . and
              that others of these texts are derived, with or without intentional modification, from
              earlier extant editions. Let us call the texts of the first group 'substantive' texts;
              those of the second 'derived' texts. It is evident that 'the most authoritative text'
              of which we are in search must be a 'substantive' one." <hi rend="italic">Prologomena

            <p>That Shakespeare, as an afterthought, added these lines to a copy of Q need not

          <p>IN 1932 DR. E. E. WILLOUGHBY PUBLISHED, IN A now classic monograph, a reproduction and
            a brief discussion of the sole example of corrected proof for the First Folio of
            Shakespeare then known.<ref target="f003.08.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> The
            present writer described a second example in an article published in 1942.<ref
              target="f003.08.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> It is now possible to present
            a third example;<ref target="f003.08.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> and an
            analysis of this, particularly in the light of evidence furnished by the other two,
            raises a number of questions about stop-press correction that may be of
            interest&mdash;and that seem to point to the soundness of certain conjectures that could
            heretofore be made only with great diffidence. Not that complete confidence is now
            possible: the new evidence is slight and rather slippery&mdash;but all the more
            interesting, perhaps, for this very reason.</p>
          <p>The first of our three concrete examples of First-Folio proof-reading occurs in an
            isolated leaf upon which are printed two pages of <hi rend="italic">Anthony and
              Cleopatra</hi>. One side of this leaf shows the uncorrected state of page 352 (xx6<hi
              rend="super">v</hi>) of the First Folio text. This page is clearly marked with a
            proof-reader's corrections, and these corrections, and these only, are the ones embraced
            in the text <pb n="003.146"/> presented by most of the surviving copies of the book.
            Quite probably, as is strongly suggested by both our other examples, this single leaf
            was once a part of a complete First Folio. Otherwise its chances of survival would have
            been extremely poor; and it is known to have been discovered in the 19th century "in a
            parcel of fragments of the First Folio"<ref target="f003.08.04" n="4"><hi rend="super"
                >4</hi></ref> (which seems more likely to mean in a group of leaves from <hi
              rend="italic">a</hi> First Folio than, for instance, in a bundle of printer's waste
            from Jaggard's shop). In any event the surviving leaf is certainly only a part of what
            once was a full sheet. But what the other leaf of the sheet looked like&mdash;whether or
            not page 341 (XXI<hi rend="super">r</hi>), the conjugate forme-page of page 352 (XX6<hi
              rend="super">v</hi>), also contained a proof-reader's corrections&mdash;this,
            unfortunately, we cannot say. The question, however, is not so idle as it may at first
            seem, for it is basically a question about proofing methods, methods of which we would
            gladly know much more than we do, and about which our other examples appear to have
            something to teach us.</p>
          <p>The proof-sheet first fully described in 1942 is to be found in the Jonas copy of the
            First Folio, No. 47 in the Folger collection. Forme VV3<hi rend="super">r</hi>:4<hi
              rend="super">v</hi> (pages 333 and 336, in <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>) is in the
            uncorrected state. Page 333 shows, in what is apparently the same hand and the same ink
            as the marks in the <hi rend="italic">Anthony and Cleopatra</hi> page, the
            proof-reader's marks that resulted in the corrected state of this page. <hi
              rend="italic">The conjugate forme-page 336, however, is unmarked</hi>.</p>
          <p>Another First Folio in the Folger collection (No. 48, once the W. T. Spencer copy)
            provides our new evidence, this time in a section of the book involving two further
            tragedies, <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>. Page 281
              (qq1<hi rend="super">r</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>) presents a special
            problem, to be considered later in this paper. Let us first look at the conjugate
            forme-page 292 (qq6<hi rend="super">v</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>). Here, in
            what seem again the same hand and ink as before,<ref target="f003.08.05" n="5"><hi
                rend="super">5</hi></ref> a third set<ref target="f003.08.06" n="6"><hi rend="super"
                >6</hi></ref> of proof-reader's corrections appears. (See Plate I.) The changes
            called for are not numerous&mdash;only five in all. These changes were all made, and
            must have been made, indeed, before any large number of uncorrected <pb n="003.147"/>
            states had been printed off: 76 of the 82 copies examined (or about 92.7%) show the
            corrected state of this page (as in Plate II); only 6, including the copy with the
            proof-reader's marks, (or about 7.3%) were printed before correction was effected. The
            variant pairs are given below. (Positions are identified as to column within the page
            and line number within the column. The additional references in parentheses are to act,
            scene, and line in the Globe edition of <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>. The
            uncorrected readings, which can easily be examined further in the Lee facsimile, where
            no proof-reader's cancellations obscure them, are given first.)</p>

            that correction in no case implies reference to copy. The errors are all patently
            compositorial, with the possible but improbable exception of "holly" for "holy" in <hi
              rend="italic">a</hi> 46. Neither word appears in the quarto text and one or the other
            must rest on the authority of some manuscript.<ref target="f003.08.07" n="7"><hi
                rend="super">7</hi></ref> But even if the earlier Folio reading accurately
            reproduces the copy for the Folio print, both the error and the correct reading are
            sufficiently obvious to be recognized by the proof-reader independently of any other
            "authority." We may also observe of this variant that the correction was not faultlessly
            effected, since the space-quad added after "cords" to compensate for the lost "l" was
            not properly pushed down and so took ink. There is, perhaps, nothing very surprising in
            the fact that the correction of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 21 not merely removed the
            faulty setting after "that", the only thing in the line that was marked by the reader,
            but also resulted in improved spacing before <pb n="003.148"/> "he": the wider spacing
            here is an evident consequence of reducing the space between "that" and "strikes". Yet
            it is clear that the correction called for could more easily have been made otherwise,
            without disturbing so much type, and that the compositor who effected the required
            change was interested in producing generally well-spaced lines when possible; that, in
            short, some attention was paid to typographical refinement. And this is also shown by 2
            (despite the inking space-quad) and by 5, though in this instance it is the proof-reader
            rather than the compositor who is responsible for a minor improvement&mdash;an
            improvement remarkable for its very triviality. Between this kind of thing and a serious
            and sustained concern for textual accuracy, however, there remains a very wide gulf.<ref
              target="f003.08.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref></p>
          <p>Page 281 (qq1<hi rend="super">r</hi>, the conjugate forme-page of 292) presents a
            special problem because it obliges us to define <hi rend="italic">variant</hi> somewhat
            more narrowly than heretofore. A collation of 80 copies of this page reveals no variants
            in the sense either of verbal differences or of differences in spelling, punctuation,
            capitalization, or the like. Yet the page seems nevertheless to have been proof-read;
            for a minor typographical imperfection, although of a kind to which <hi rend="italic"
              >we</hi> ordinarily have paid very scant heed, appears to have been corrected in it,
            and corrected at the same time as the five small errors in page 292 listed above. The
            facts are these. In <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 33 on page 281 (corresponding to V, ii,
            358, in the Globe <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>) the last two letters of "thee" for some
            reason stood so high in the original setting that, whereas these two letters seem very
            heavily inked in the printed page, the "h" seems lightly inked and the right-hand part
            of it is barely perceptible (see Plate III&mdash;or the Lee facsimile). The word so
            appears in all 6 of the copies which show the uncorrected state of page 292. In all <hi
              rend="italic">but one</hi> of the 74 others which show corrected page 292 all four
            letters of the "thee" in page 281 are uniformly inked (see Plate IV for a random
            example). The one exception is provided by Folger copy No. 40, which shows the corrected
            state of page 292 but the ill-printed "thee" in page 281. This, however, is surely the
            exception that proves the rule. For close examination demonstrates that the two leaves
            in question are <hi rend="italic">not in this copy conjugate</hi>, as is perhaps most
            readily shown by <pb n="003.149"/> the fact that both qq1 and qq6 here bear a watermark:
            Folger No. 40 is clearly a "made-up" First Folio.</p>
          <p>The absolute constancy of the relationship between the two settings of "thee" in page
            281 and the two patently variant states of the text in page 292 clearly indicates that
            the changes in both pages came about at the same time, after the single unlocking for
            correction to which we know the forme was subject; and if all of these changes were
            intentional, it follows inevitably that page 281, no less than page 292, presents us
            with truly variant states that are the result of proof-reading. For we must certainly
            accept the principle that whenever a text is deliberately changed in the course of its
            transmission, genuine, if not always "substantive," variants are produced. "But how," it
            may be objected, "can we know that the change in page 281 was intentional? Obviously
            enough the crucial issue is not the relative triviality of the difference between two
            supposed 'states' but whether human volition can properly be adduced to account for this
            difference; and what is there to make us suppose direct human agency here
            responsible?"</p>
          <p>Unhappily, page 281 does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> show any sign of the proof-reader's
            mark that would resolve this difficulty. The suggestion presents itself, moreover, that
            the two insufficiently pushed-down types in page 281 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 33 might
            just possibly have assumed their proper places, as it were by accident, when the forme
            was loosened by the unlocking required for the correction of the errors in page 292.
            Such an explanation, however, will hardly do. It is initially unsatisfactory, especially
            in the light of the extreme unevenness of the "thee" in the 6 copies here considered
            uncorrected. Are such completely even impressions as we find in the 73 corrected copies
            likely to be the accidental result of work on the other page of the forme? How are we
            then to explain, if even impressions are thus easily and unintentionally produced, the
            unevenness in the stage direction "<hi rend="italic">Enter Osricke</hi>." a few lines
            farther along in page 281? Here the "<hi rend="italic">c</hi>" was somewhat high in the
            original setting, so that the preceding "<hi rend="italic">i</hi>" inked poorly; and
            approximately the same unevenness appears to be characteristic of all copies. And the
            same thing is true of the "cracke a Noble heart" about ten lines below, where the
            consecutive letters "e a N" were a little high and therefore seem overinked, though in
            slightly different degree&mdash;in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> copies. Only in <hi
              rend="italic">b</hi> 33, then, does unevenness give way to perfect <pb n="003.150"/>
            regularity of impression. The difference is fairly extreme and the change occurred, not
            gradually, but at once; and it occurred at a time when five other small changes were
            introduced elsewhere in the forme, demonstrably as a result of proof-reading. The change
            in question is not likely to have been accidental, as other evidence from nearby lines
            indicates. Deliberate alteration as a result of proof-reading seems the only reasonable
              explanation.<ref target="f003.08.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></p>
          <p>If then we are obliged to assume that page 281 was proof-read, why does it not show,
            like its conjugate forme-page, the proof-reader's marks? Probably for the very simple
            reason that the proof-reader, unlike the pressmen, considered the single page, rather
            than the two-page forme, his basic working unit. The peculiarities of another pair of
            conjugate forme-pages, 333 and 336, in <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, will perhaps now
            be recalled. Both pages exist in two clearly distinguished states, although only a
            single correction was made in page 336; and the corrected and uncorrected states of the
            one page are invariably found paired with the corresponding states of the other. In the
            Jonas copy, moreover, page 333 carries the proof-reader's corrections; <hi rend="italic"
              >but page 336 is unmarked</hi>. "The most satisfactory explanation of these facts," it
            was suggested in 1942, "seems to be that the proof-reader handed his corrections to the
            compositor as soon as he had read one page of an impression taken from the forme for
            proofing purposes, and then used another impression as proof for the second page. Such a
            procedure is entirely plausible, since it would obviously save considerable time. (It is
            also possible, of course, that an impression from the uncorrected forme was given to
            each of two proof-readers and that one read p. 333 while the other was reading p. 336.
            This method would also save valuable time; but there is no need to postulate an
            additional workman.) We are doubly unfortunate, therefore, in that the <pb n="003.151"/>
            <hi rend="italic">Anthony</hi> proof-sheet is fragmentary. Since it represents only half
            of a two-page forme . . . it can provide us with no further basis for conjecture as to
            how commonly the method that seems to have been used in the proofing of VV4<hi
              rend="super">v</hi>:3<hi rend="super">r</hi> was employed elsewhere during the
            printing of the Folio."<ref target="f003.08.10" n="10"><hi rend="super"
            >10</hi></ref></p>
          <p>Now, however, we have new evidence. For in pages 281 and 292 of the Spencer copy we
            appear to find precisely the same peculiarities as in pages 333 and 336 of the Jonas
            copy. And hence we may conclude that, at least some of the time and when dealing with
            that portion of the First Folio that includes <hi rend="italic">Hamlet, Lear,
              Othello</hi>, and (probably) <hi rend="italic">Anthony and Cleopatra</hi>, the
            proof-reader returned a sheet after correcting only one of its pages. Presumably
            &mdash;for only thus would such a practice effect real gains&mdash;he then proceeded to
            correct the other page in another copy of the full sheet. The required alterations could
            by this means be begun sooner than otherwise; and by the time these changes had been
            made in the first type-page the reader would be able to return his second proof-page,
            suitably marked for immediate correction.</p>
          <p>Whether or not this practice was the usual one throughout the printing of the First
            Folio, and perhaps of a great many other books of the period as well, we still cannot
            say with assurance; but certain suggestions present themselves. Probably it would not be
            an efficient method whenever large numbers of errors were likely to be encountered (so
            that the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> proof-page might not be marked and ready as soon
            as required); nor is it a method that would ever be employed when the reader
            contemplated a careful comparison of proof-page and copy, since really conscientious
            proofing of this kind would certainly require much more time than a rapid reading of
            which the primary intent was merely the elimination of obvious typographical error.<ref
              target="f003.08.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref></p>
          <p>The implications of this last consideration are obviously of some moment; and although
            the subject cannot here be farther <pb n="003.152"/> pursued, at least one of these
            implications may be mentioned. If the stop-press variants in the First Folio, which we
            now have good reason to believe very abundant, were ordinarily the product of a method
            which itself precluded correction by reference to copy, it follows that we should be
            particularly interested in the readings of the various formes that make up the volume
              <hi rend="italic">before</hi> these were subjected to a process of arbitrary
            sophistication. Many of the First Folio's variants will no doubt be found to involve
            only the "accidentals" of which Dr. Greg speaks elsewhere in the present volume and to
            which less interest usually attaches than to "substantives." But substantives too there
            will unquestionably be; and a careful attention to the <hi rend="italic"
            >un</hi>corrected members of variant substantive pairs may sometimes enable us to get
            closer to what Shakespeare himself wrote than the corrected readings that are but the
            swift guesses of a printing-house reader who seems to have been more concerned with the
            appearance than with the accuracy of the Folio text. It is still, of course, imprudent
            to generalize too widely about the press-correction method, or methods, employed during
            the printing of the First Folio; but all of the evidence so far available certainly
            indicates the customary use of the none-too-rigorous method described above.</p>
          <p>The examination of forme qq1<hi rend="super">r</hi>:6<hi rend="super">v</hi> throughout
            the entire Folger collection of First Folios brings to light one further and rather
            surprising fact that may also, finally, be recorded here. In addition to Folger No. 48,
            the copy which carries the proof-reader's mark on page 292, the copies showing the
            uncorrected state of the forme are Folger Nos. 15, 31, 47, and 69; and the Lee facsimile
            reveals that the Chatsworth-Devonshire copy is also uncorrected in this forme. (Folger
            No. 40, clearly a "made up" copy in which the two leaves in question are not conjugate,
            is uncorrected in page 292 only.) And now let us once more recall forme VV3<hi
              rend="super">r</hi>:4<hi rend="super">v</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>. The
            uncorrected state of this forme is found in Folger Nos. 15, 31, 47, and 69; and the Lee
            facsimile also shows the uncorrected state. In short, except that qq1<hi rend="super"
              >r</hi>:6<hi rend="super">v</hi> is also uncorrected in No. 48 and in one page of
            made-up No. 40, <hi rend="italic">the very same copies and no others</hi> are
            uncorrected in two different formes&mdash;and in two formes, one involving <hi
              rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>, the other <hi rend="italic"
              >Othello</hi>, that cannot have been dealt with consecutively in Jaggard's

            <p>To readers who are not satisfied by this argument I can only offer an appeal to the
              evidence, as yet unpublished, that gives me my own greatest confidence in the
              conclusion expressed above. During the summer of 1949 I collated pages 305-40 (18
              formes that include the whole of <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> and parts of <hi
                rend="italic">Lear</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">Anthony and Cleopatra</hi>)
              throughout the entire Folger collection of 79 First Folios. The work was done with
              mechanical aid made possible by a generous grant from the Old Dominion Foundation.
              Among the numerous variants that my "machine" turned up was abundant evidence that the
              proof-reader was constantly at pains to correct minor typographical
              infelicities&mdash;including space-quads taking ink (however slightly) and <hi
                rend="italic">several</hi> uneven impressions. On more than one occasion the press
              was stopped for the sole purpose of correcting a single badly inking type.</p>

              These percentages suggest, for an edition of 1250 copies, a total of about 90
              uncorrected states, or probably rather less than half an hour's work by an
              uninterrupted press. To remove a forme from the press, to unlock it and correct one of
              its type-pages, would presumably take only about the same time, at most. But even if
              it took slightly longer, it would surely not take so much time as would be required
              for a proof-reader to make a thoroughgoing collation of a proof-page with its
              copy.</p>

          <p>THE MANY EXTANT AND READILY ACCESSIBLE books signed by the printer Thomas Newcomb
            afford a particularly good starting point in the large and tantalizingly complicated
            study of printers' ornaments in the Commonwealth and Post-Restoration periods.</p>
          <p>Newcomb was active as a printer for thirty-three years: he was the master of a large
            printing shop, and after the great fire became one of a handful of men who dominated
            London printing. Newcomb owned and employed a large assortment of ornaments which have a
            history of use totaling approximately fifty years, if one counts that group in use ten
            years before Newcomb acquired it and those which Newcomb's son used for at least seven
            years after his father's death. Finally, Newcomb printed well over a thousand items, a
            large number of them for the patentees of the King's Printing Office, but an even
            greater number for more than a score of stationers, including Henry Herringman, the
            foremost publisher of belles lettres in Post-Restoration London. Hence, one finds few
            prominent writers of history, science, theology, or literature in the last half of the
            century who had not had one or more compositions run off Newcomb's presses.</p>
          <p>Obviously a definitive study of the many ornaments in Newcomb's thousand or more
            publications must await first the appearance of Mr. Wing's <hi rend="italic">Short-Title
              Catalogue . . . 1641-1700</hi>, Volume III, and then the labors of other students. In
            this paper I attempt only to summarize the history of transmission of ornaments owned by
            Newcomb, to set down my observations on how ornaments were used in Newcomb-printed
            books, to offer some suggestions <pb n="003.156"/> to those obliged to work with Newcomb
            ornaments, and, finally, to introduce bibliographers to what I believe is a fair
            sampling of Newcomb ornaments, factotums, and decorative initials, with an accompanying
            list of their occurrences.</p>
          <p>The history of a portion of the ornaments used by Newcomb begins in 1638<ref
              target="f003.09.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> with the emergence of John
            Raworth as a London printer. I have examined far fewer of his publications than those of
            Newcomb, but my impression is that his ornament stock was a good-sized one. He owned a
            wide variety of decorative initials and many large, generally attractive ornaments; he
            preferred initials to factotums, and used both the initials and ornaments generously,
            especially in folios. The clearness and completeness of impression which many of his
            ornaments make would suggest that the bulk of his stock was newly purchased rather than
            bought up from some other printer. This observation is of course only conjectural. I
            have not tried to trace Raworth's ornaments in the books of earlier printers.<ref
              target="f003.09.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
          <p>Raworth's career as a printer was cut short by his death late in July of 1646. The
            uninterrupted flow of religious pamphlets from the Raworth presses indicates, however,
            that John's widow, Ruth, assumed charge of operations at once. Her activity as a printer
            extends to 1648 when she married Thomas Newcomb, who had just become free of the
            Stationers' Company after serving a seven years' apprenticeship under Gregory
              Dexter.<ref target="f003.09.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> Throughout her
            brief career Ruth Raworth used the ornaments at hand in her shop, and since the kinds of
            books she printed made no extraordinary demands on her ornament supply, the likelihood
            is that she added few or no ornaments to her late husband's collection.</p>
          <p>Once Newcomb had married Ruth Raworth, he seems to have taken over the direction of her
            shop, located on Thames Street <pb n="003.157"/> over against Baynard's Castle, where he
            remained until September of 1666 when the London fire destroyed his place of business
            and obliged him to seek new quarters west of the old city in the Savoy. Newcomb used
            enough Raworth decorations after 1666 for one to determine that Newcomb had saved his
            ornament collection from the flames, but after his removal to the Savoy he no longer
            relied on his old stock as he had done in the past. He continued to use the old Raworth
            ornaments, his compositors overworking a favored few until they were caked with ink and
            badly worn. But he replaced his Raworth factotums and a number of the old decorative
            initial sets with new ones, almost always bearing flower designs. These floral
            decorations Newcomb used with such consistency thereafter that more than any other
            feature of his presswork they especially characterize the books printed by him during
            the last thirteen years of his career. The study of Newcomb's decorations falls roughly,
            therefore, into two divisions: the years 1648 to 1667 when Newcomb used Raworth's stock
            almost exclusively, and the years 1668 to 1681 when he employed Raworth's collection in
            combination with his own.</p>
          <p>Newcomb died suddenly on December 26, 1681, as one ardent conventicleer would have it,
            struck down by God in the king's presence for hating protestant dissenters.<ref
              target="f003.09.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> His printing equipment,
            including his ornaments, and his patent rights in the King's Printing Office were
            inherited by his only son, Thomas Newcomb, Jr., also free of the Stationers' Company,
            who remained active as a printer in the Savoy until July, 1688, when Edward Jones moved
            into the Savoy and took over the printing of the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi>.
            Whether the son ceased printing at this point or set up shop elsewhere and continued
            actively in his trade is difficult to ascertain.<ref target="f003.09.05" n="5"><hi
                rend="super">5</hi></ref> There is no question about the fact that he managed,
            despite the political upheaval, to maintain the right to publish some types of official
            documents and that he, his executrix, and his assigns continued exercising those rights
            well into the eighteenth century.</p>
          <p>Equally difficult to determine is when Thomas Newcomb, Jr., <pb n="003.158"/> disposed
            of his ornaments and to whom he sold them. One of Newcomb's factotums appearing in
            Dryden's <hi rend="italic">All For Love</hi> (1692) printed by Edward Jones suggests
            that either in 1688 or after Newcomb's death Jones got hold of some of Newcomb's stock.
            The appearance of two well-known Newcomb ornaments in John Macock's printing of Cowley's
              <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> dated 1688 but advertised in the <hi rend="italic">London
              Gazette</hi> as early as December 15, 1687, poses a problem which further research
            alone can solve.<ref target="f003.09.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> The
            evidence pointing to a disturbance in the printing activities of Thomas Newcomb, Jr.,
            about the year 1688 is sufficient, however, to warrant the conclusion that after 1687
            one cannot use Newcomb ornaments to identify with certainty the printer of an unsigned
            book.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 id="vol003.09.02" type="section" n="2">
          <head/>
          <p>From the outset of his career Thomas Newcomb was associated with a comparatively large
            and well established printing house, which grew even larger as he prospered in his
            trade. The observations which one formulates, therefore, on how ornaments were used in
            Newcomb-printed books can only be those reflecting the general policy of his shop, and
            not a list of typographical idiosyncrasies of the master himself. The practice of
            Newcomb's compositors in handling book decorations compared with that of the printing
            houses of several of his contemporaries indicates, however, that Newcomb's practice was
            in almost every respect typical.</p>
          <p>During the Interregnum and the early years of the Restoration Newcomb tended, like the
            other printers of that day, to use more ornaments and initials throughout the text of
            his octavos and quartos than he did in the late 1660's and 1670's. His folios were
            generally his most elaborately ornamented volumes, although he seldom decorated them so
            lavishly as did his predecessor Raworth.</p>
          <p>From 1667 to 1675 Newcomb used few ornaments in his smaller formats and only a
            sprinkling of initials and factotums throughout the text. The ornamentation in his play
            quartos was confined entirely to the initial gatherings: a headpiece and initial or
            factotum on the recto of the second leaf which was usually reserved <pb n="003.159"/>
            for the dedication; a headpiece on the first page of the preface, if one followed; and a
            headpiece or initial decoration, seldom both, on the first page of the text.</p>
          <p>After 1675 he used even less ornamentation in his play quartos than he had before that
            date, reaching a point finally about 1679 when he omitted it altogether. In this
            omission he was only following the practice of his fellow London printers, many of whom
            had been turning out ornament-less play quartos since the early 1670's. In attempting to
            identify the printers of unsigned quarto plays published in 1679 or thereafter for the
            next thirty years, the bibliographer finds a knowledge of printers' ornaments
            practically valueless.</p>
          <p>In the many normal and oversized folios issuing from his presses, one finds Newcomb's
            most elaborate book decorations. As a rule printers generally tended to pay deference to
            their folio ornamentation. Newcomb's practice was to use headpieces and initial
            decorations profusely in the initial gatherings. Thereafter for about two-thirds of the
            volume he used ornaments and factotums to mark only fresh divisions of text. The final
            third was often devoid of decoration.</p>
          <p>Generally Newcomb seemed slightly fonder of using ornamentation after the Restoration
            than those among his contemporaries whose books I have examined, and was markedly more
            generous in their use than his important competitor John Macock. Yet one comes upon
            enough exceptions to most of the generalizations made so far in this section to conclude
            that the price the publisher was willing to pay and the reading public for which he
            intended his publication dictate more often than not the amount of paper space the
            printer took up with decorations. Thus in a period when Newcomb employed ornaments
            rather consistently, his quarto edition of Nedham's <hi rend="italic">Interest Will Not
              Lie</hi> (1659) and his folio printing of <hi rend="italic">Certain Letters Evidencing
              The King's Stedfastness in the Protestant Religion</hi> (1660) are without
            ornamentation while in a period of dwindling ornamentation, even in folios, Newcomb's
            folio edition of <hi rend="italic">The Genealogical History of the Kings of England</hi>
            (1677), privately printed for the herald Francis Sandford, turns out to be perhaps the
            most attractively and profusely decorated volume of Newcomb's printing career.</p>
          <p>There are apparently no practices dealing with ornaments that <pb n="003.160"/> mark
            distinctively the workmanship of Newcomb's shop, but there are some practices used by
            the contemporaries of Newcomb which his compositors did not follow. Newcomb did not, for
            instance, use a printer's device; in fact, he seldom used a title-page ornament, and
            when he did, he had no favorite. The only ornament appearing more consistently on his
            title-pages than elsewhere is the emblem bearing the motto: "Premor Dum Attollor," but
            it occurs only five times on the title-pages of the more than 200 books which I have
            examined. Except for the early years of his career Newcomb did not use ornaments to mark
            the conclusion of a division of text, and never, to my knowledge, used a tailpiece
            although Raworth had in his collection handsome tailpieces which Newcomb must have
            acquired. Newcomb made no effort to use throughout a volume the decorative initials of
            one design; his son did so only in the portion of Shakespeare's fourth folio which he
            printed. Nor did Newcomb greatly concern himself about the nicety of proportion between
            decoration and format. Sometimes a very small initial meant for a duodecimo is buried on
            an oversized folio page; at other times, one finds a large factotum designed primarily
            for a folio appearing on a quarto page.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, there are a few positive practices worth mentioning. After 1666
            Newcomb used factotums far more frequently than he used initials, and he used over and
            over the same small group of ornaments. He made some effort to decorate books authorized
            by or dedicated to the king with appropriate national and Stuart ornaments. The only
            other occasion on which a Newcomb compositor appeared concerned about using a particular
            ornament in a particular place&mdash;and this applies to compositors in other printing
            houses as well&mdash;was when he was working on a reprint of a volume previously issued
            from his shop. Then he would often reproduce in the new edition the identical ornament
            used perhaps five or ten years earlier, despite the fact that searching for it in his
            collection must frequently have involved a considerable waste of time.</p>

            <pb n="003.161"/> who may in the future make use of the chart of Newcomb book
            decorations that follows, I append these scattered observations.</p>
          <p>English ornament makers of this period show a marked tendency to copy and recopy
            earlier designs rather than create new ones. Those copies made in wood are more often
            than not distinguishable from each other, but on occasion recuttings were made with such
            precision that one is hard put to tell them apart. The many decorations made from metal
            rather than wood present a greater problem in that indistinguishable copies of an
            ornament cast from the same matrix were owned and regularly used by as many as a
            half-dozen printers. Wherever I have found a printer using an ornament very similar to
            Newcomb's, I have made a note of it after the list of occurrences; but since I have
            concentrated in this study on the ornaments of only a handful of printers and since
            there are tens of thousands of books which I have not seen, the likelihood is that
            future study will uncover very similar or indistinguishable copies of Newcomb ornaments
            in the stock of other printers.</p>
          <p>Measurements of ornaments are helpful in distinguishing between like ornaments but
            furnish conclusive evidence only where there is a marked difference in size between two
            otherwise identical ornaments. Different impressions of the same ornament vary in
            measurement because of light or heavy inking, newness or wear, or variable degrees of
            shrinkage in the paper. In the Newcomb chart I have at times given measurements down to
            a half millimeter; one should not, however, consider them other than the average, often
            made up from several varying measurements.</p>
          <p>A knowledge of printers' type-ornaments is generally useless in attempting to identify
            a particular printer in this period. I have found no one of Newcomb's many
            type-ornaments that was not also in the stock of other printers.</p>
          <p>When the identification of the printer of an unsigned book depends on the decorative
            initials H, I, O, or S, one should be sure to examine the letter both right side up and
            upside down. Compositors paid little attention to the proper position of such letters,
            and looked at wrong side up, these letters often present quite a different
            appearance.</p>
          <p>Ornaments in the text of a volume occasionally qualify or contradict the evidence of a
            printer's name in the title-page imprint. <pb n="003.162"/> A number of the large folios
            of this period were the work of two or more printers, but the imprint often carries only
            the name of the printer who ran off the title-page and the first or last portion of the
            volume. Thus the ornaments in Davenant's <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (1673), signed by
            Newcomb, indicate that Newcomb and Macock jointly printed the book, while those of the
            Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679, signed by Macock, point to the work of both Newcomb
            and Macock. Further, one should be wary of ascribing to a printer signing a title-page
            cancel the presswork of the text. In rare instances, as in Cornelius Burgess' <hi
              rend="italic">The First Sermon</hi> (1641) the imprint phrase "By I. L." means only
            that I. L. printed the cancel; the colophon and the imprint of the original title-page
            reinforce the evidence of the ornaments in pointing to T. Badger as the rightful printer
            of the text.</p>
          <p>Finally, in attributing to a specific printer the presswork of an unsigned book, one is
            always on surer ground if he can buttress the evidence of the ornamentation with that
            derived from other reliable sources. One of the obvious sources is the
            printer-employment habits of the stationer publishing the book. A study of the imprints
            on books published by Herringman, for example, reveals that he tended to patronize one
            or two printers consistently in a given period. Therefore anyone attempting to identify
            the printer of a Herringman volume can eliminate from consideration almost immediately
            all but the handful of likely candidates; and where the volume in question contains
            ornaments known to be used by several printers, one can on occasion establish with great
            probability the one printer whom Herringman hired to do his work.</p>
          <p>The other source is the wills of the printers with the appended probate statements.
            Ornament stocks seem to have passed almost overnight from one printer to another, and
            therefore it is frequently necessary to determine the terminal dates of a printer's
            activity, lest one interpret the evidence of the ornaments erroneously. For instance,
            the evidence of ornaments supported by that of the imprints suggests that Thomas
            Newcomb, Sr., was active as a printer from 1648 to 1691. The probate date of his will
            indicates, however, that he died late in 1681, and the text of the will points to the
            fact that Newcomb's son, who happened to have the same name as his father's, inherited
            the ornament stock and was <pb n="003.163"/> hence responsible for the Newcomb-printed
            books between 1682 and 1691. On the other hand, the ornaments of William Wilson
            appearing in unsigned books published by Herringman as late as 1671 suggest that Wilson
            was active until that date. Actually Wilson's will was probated in May of 1665; his shop
            was taken over by his heir and son-in-law, Edward Okes, who used Wilson's ornaments for
            the next eight years without signing, as far as I have been able to discover, more than
            two or three imprints in his entire printing career.</p>

          <p>The following is a list of occurrences which I have found of the Newcomb ornaments,
            factotums, and initials pictured in the final pages of this study. Each of the three
            types of ornamentation has its own heading and separate series of numbers. The entry for
            each decoration contains this information: (1) an identifying number corresponding to
            that accompanying the picture of the decoration; (2) the approximate millimeter
            measurements, with the vertical measurement occurring first; (3) a listing of the books
            in which the particular decoration is to be found, chronologically arranged and
            subdivided among the various printers who owned and used the decoration during specific
            periods of years. "RAWORTH" means always John Raworth, active from 1638 to 1646; "R.
            RAWORTH", Ruth Raworth, 1646-1648; "NEWCOMB," Thomas Newcomb, Sr., 1648-1681; "NEWCOMB
            JR.," Thomas Newcomb, Jr., 1682-1688(?). Books in the following list printed before or
            during 1640 are cited according to the numbers assigned them in the Pollard and Redgrave
              <hi rend="italic">S.T.C.</hi> The remainder are cited according to the numbers given
            them in the three volumes of the Wing <hi rend="italic">S.T.C.</hi>; the numbers of
            books listed in the unpublished third volume have been supplied from proof sheets
            through the courtesy of Mr. D. G. Wing and the Princeton University Library. The
            occasional book not found listed in either <hi rend="italic">S.T.C.</hi> is cited by
            short title. Where Wing has assigned only one number to a play known to appear in two
            editions during a single year, I have appended to the Wing number the numbers assigned
            the different editions by Woodward and McManaway in <hi rend="italic">A Check-list of
              English Plays 1641-1700</hi>. The brackets enclosing any <hi rend="italic">S.T.C.</hi>
            number indicate that the book has been identified by means of the ornaments as <pb
              n="003.164"/> the presswork of a particular printer although his name does not appear
            in the imprint.</p>
          <p>The decorations pictured are reproduced usually at approximately life-size; those
            pictured at less than life-size&mdash;generally reduced about one-fifth&mdash;are marked
            with an asterisk accompanying the measurements beneath the picture.</p>

            <p>The Cowley volume offers no evidence of the printing's having been divided between

              the goodly number of Macock-printed books from 1646 to 1691 which I have examined, I
              have found no other occurrence of either ornament.</p>

          <p>IN A RECENT STUDY OF PRESS FIGURES, WHICH appear in many eighteenth-century books, Mr.
            Walter E. Knotts offers a timely reminder of their importance as possible clues to
            bibliographical analysis, and from his examination of eight copies of a single work
            proposes a technique for the use of this tool.<ref target="f003.10.02" n="2"><hi
                rend="super">2</hi></ref> These figures, if properly understood, are of potential
            value in the solution of numerous problems, for oftentimes they represent, in the
            absence or in the unhelpful uniformity of such indications as headlines or watermarks,
            the only discernible evidence of irregularity in the manufacture of a book. But this
            evidence, though occasionally observed, is more often ignored, or else is variously
            interpreted according to hypotheses exclusively derived from the ambiguous data of the
            figures. Thus far, no attempt has been made to record the incidence of the figures in a
            substantial number of books, to correlate this data, whenever possible, with other
            evidence, to formulate a theory comprehending the several vagaries in the use and
            distribution of the figures, and to present a series of examples illustrating their
            significance.</p>
          <p>This enquiry is directed toward the several ends which have been slighted in previous
            accounts, and though it may fall short <pb n="003.172"/> of its ultimate objective,
            endeavors to provide, at least, a more informative basis for further study.
            Investigation discovers two kinds of information: an explanation for the casual
            employment of figures in the production of a book, and a rationale for the
            interpretation of these figures as bibliographical evidence.</p>

            I.
          </head>
          <p>In general, the received opinion concerning press figures<ref target="f003.10.03" n="3"
                ><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> is that they were inserted, one to a forme, by the
            compositor, at the direction of the overseer, in order to identify the press designated
            to receive the forme, to facilitate an equitable distribution of the work among the
            presses, and to corroborate each pressman's claim for pay.<ref target="f003.10.04" n="4"
                ><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> Contradicting these several suppositions, all of
            which are founded on cursory comment in printers' manuals published early in the
            nineteenth century, is other comment from the same sources. Elsewhere it is noted, to
            the contrary, that it was the pressman's responsibility to work with figures, that in
            small shops the office of overseer was nonexistent,<ref target="f003.10.05" n="5"><hi
                rend="super">5</hi></ref> and that all employees were paid by the hour, the day, or
            the week, as the convenience of the employer might dictate, and not, as the figures
            would imply, according to the number of sheets they had worked.<ref target="f003.10.06"
              n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> To this conflicting testimony may be added that of
            the books, which show no equitable distribution of the figures, in many instances no
            figures at all, and, in some, sheets which are only partially figured. And as a final
            piece of confusion, it is well to recall a chapel rule of 1734 enjoining the pressmen
            "to put in the Drawer, one of a Sort of every Job, with their Names, the No. wrought,
            and Day of the Month."<ref target="f003.10.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> For
            the shops in which this regulation applied, figures would be superfluous, whatever their
            purpose in the organization of the work or the payment of the men.</p>
          <pb n="003.173"/>
          <p>From the foregoing account it will be apparent that the information in the manuals is
            quite unenlightening, not only because it is inadequate, but because it indiscriminately
            reports practices which seemingly vary with the time, the shop, and the number of men
            employed. Custom or circumstance may require, for some books, the figuring of every
            sheet, whether or not the work had been predetermined; for others, figures only at the
            end of a specified period of time; and for others, figures only on those occasions when
            the work had been disrupted or reassigned. Thus any theory envisaging a uniform
            procedure in an unorganized, <hi rend="italic">laissez-faire</hi> handicraft must be
            regarded with suspicion.</p>
          <p>With this caveat against arguments based on selected testimony rather than direct
            observation, we may turn to those which have at least the merit of being empirical. An
            obvious approach to the problem, and the one taken by Dr. F. B. Kaye and Mr. Knotts, is
            to discover the procedure which results in the erratic employment of figures in a single
            book. For Dr. Kaye the unfigured formes represent the work of a press which is properly
            identified in the sheet immediately preceding or following the sequence.<ref
              target="f003.10.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> For Mr. Knotts, on the other
            hand, they designate the work of an unidentified press. <q>The indication that a forme
              of any gathering had been printed by this press would be the absence of a number. An
              examination of a number of eighteenth-century books reveals that often when some (but
              not all) sheets in a book are figured there are more without press numbers than with
              them. This suggests that the figures were used to identify formes of sheets which had
              been worked off by any press other than the one which was doing the bulk of the
                job.<ref target="f003.10.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></q> If this latter
            hypothesis is correct, then we must assume that the printing offices in the eighteenth
            century, most of which had a normal complement of about twelve pressmen and eighteen
              compositors,<ref target="f003.10.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> assigned
            the greater portion of their work to a single press, and only an occasional forme to
            others. Though we may doubt that the offices were managed as inefficiently as Mr. Knotts
            seems to imply, his interpretation of the figures is, theoretically, as plausible as the
            one advanced by Dr. Kaye.</p>
          <pb n="003.174"/>
          <p>The dilemma which confronts the bibliographer is easily resolved, for some books, by
            reference to the headlines, a kind of evidence overlooked by Mr. Knotts. When the
            headlines can be distinguished in books containing press figures, they provide a means
            for the analysis of the figures, and a measure for accepting or rejecting the opposing
            interpretations. In Gay's <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> (1727), for example, a quarto
            collating <hi rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="super">4</hi> B-Z<hi rend="super">4</hi>
              2A<hi rend="super">2</hi>, the figures are so distributed that, as Mr. Knotts
            observes, no grouping results of the order required by Dr. Kaye's hypothesis. If the
            figures are correlated with the headlines, however, a pattern emerges which appears to
            substantiate the very theory Mr. Knotts intended to disprove.</p>
          <p>Discounting the headline skeletons for gatherings B, C, and D, all of which are
            indeterminable, we may represent the others as follows: <!--<figure entity="sb031741"/>  --> Now
            according to Mr. Knotts' belief, no less than forty formes were machined by a single
            individual, and only seven by the three pressmen identified as 4, 5, and 7. But
            according to the available evidence, as it may be read from the headlines, the work was
            more equally divided and the figures revealed to be somewhat more meaningful than Mr.
            Knotts supposes. The only acceptable interpretation, it seems to me, is this: Two men
            are originally assigned to the job at "half press" (i.e., one man to a machine), their
            names properly recorded in the ledger, and their work organized so that they operate in
            tandem, with one man machining both formes of the sequence?C-E-G-I, and the other, both
            formes of the alternate sequence?B-?D-F-H-K. Upon the completion of K, the work is
            interrupted: skeletons I and II are interchanged; III and IV are pied, discarded, or
            mislaid; V and VI are composed; and two other men take the place of those originally
            assigned. <pb n="003.175"/> These identify themselves as 5 and 7 in order to obviate any
            dispute as to where the "hours" of work for one group ended, and those for the other
              began.<ref target="f003.10.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> Printing then
            proceeds through P in the same manner as before, when there is a second interruption,
            marked, we will note, by the insertion of a figure 4 in each sequence at Q and R. What
            this signifies, apparently, is that the work previously distributed between two machines
            operating, as we have conjectured, at half press, is now undertaken as a single sequence
            by one machine employing two men (4 and an assistant) at full press. Had 4 figured only
            one of the two sheets, R, for instance, the indication would be that he is replacing 5
            only in the one sequence while 7 continues with the other. But since he figures Q as
            well as R, he signalizes the termination of work by both of his predecessors, assumes
            credit for all of that which follows, and presumably operates at such a rate&mdash;at
            full press, probably&mdash;that he requires for his work the services of the same number
            of compositors, and the same number of formes, which had been used before. If a single
            compositor, using two formes, were needed for each of the two presses operating from B
            to P at half-capacity, then the total of two compositors and four formes might be
            required for a single press operating from Q to X at full capacity. That 4, with an
            assistant, is able to work twice as fast and thus to accomplish twice as much in a given
            period, is confirmed, it would seem, by the time divisions, which show that while the
            other pressmen, working individually, machine only two or three sheets in a week, 4
            machines no less than six.</p>
          <p>Unlike the others, 4 anticipates the end of his assignment, and marks it at outer X.
            Once again work is suspended, over Sunday, we may suppose, to be resumed by 5. And since
            5 also requires the labors of the two compositors who had been previously assigned to
            separate presses, he too figures one of the formes supplied by each, verifying the fact
            that 4 is no longer at work, and then finishes the production by machining Y, Z, 2A, and
            presumably <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. The grouping throughout, we may conclude, is quite
            apparent, the significance of the numbers for this work not incomprehensible, and their
            distribution exactly in accordance with Dr. Kaye's premises. For this poem, at any rate,
            the figures mark the <pb n="003.176"/> inception and the extent of the work undertaken
            by those not originally assigned to the job.</p>
          <p>If this is a reasonable interpretation of the evidence, it follows that an examination
            of books containing press figures and headlines will permit inferences not to be drawn
            when one or the other of these indications is absent. In the <hi rend="italic"
              >Fables</hi> the figures alone allow no demonstrable theory, and the headlines only a
            presumption that two presses were operating throughout. But the facts do not always
            conform to our expectations. Where there are no figures, as in the second volume of the
              <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi><ref target="f003.10.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> and in sheets K-2F of the
            fifth volume, the presumption is, for want of other evidence, indisputable. Where there
            are figures of a pattern like that in the fourth volume, the presumption is apparently
            confirmed. But where they are of another pattern, as in the <hi rend="italic"
              >Fables</hi>, and in the fourth edition of the <hi rend="italic">Fable of the
              Bees</hi>, the presumption applies only for certain sheets. And for such works as John
            Williams' <hi rend="italic">Vindication of the Answer to the Popish Address</hi> (1688)
            it does not seem to apply at all. This tract, a quarto collating A-E<hi rend="super"
              >4</hi> F<hi rend="super">2</hi>, is of the following pattern: <!--<figure
                entity="sb031761"/>  --> Throughout the major portion of this work, and occasionally in the
            two <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> we have considered, a single press, first &tgr; for
            A-B, and then * for C-D, seems to be operating at such speed (at full press?), or
            processing so few sheets, that four skeleton formes are allocated for the job in order
            to lend more fluidity to the time of distribution. Only in the last two sheets is there
            a shift in the arrangement, and then the skeletons are distributed, not in the manner we
            might expect, with I-II to one press and III to another, but with I-II to two presses,
            and III again to one of these, probably &tgr;.</p>
          <p>A correlation of the evidence necessitates a modification of our views concerning books
            with two sets of headlines as well as <pb n="003.177"/> with those having four. Again
            there seems to be more disorder than the headlines alone reveal. For the eighth volume
            of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> the absence of figures implies only a
            continuance of a process as it had been prearranged, which might be that of a single
            press machining all sheets, or that of two presses simultaneously machining the inner
            and outer formes. For the several editions of Clement Ellis's <hi rend="italic">The
              Protestant Resolved</hi> (1688), on the other hand, some other and more specific
            explanation is required. The patterns are these: <!--<figure entity="sb031771"/>  --> In each of
            these there is no indication, from the headlines, of two presses. From the figures,
            however, we learn that while * and &tgr; have individually done most of the work
            performed in shop "B", both simultaneously machined sheets I and K of the first edition,
            and G, H, and presumably I of the second. Also observe that the termination of the work
            by the extra press is carefully marked, by a &tgr; in outer L of the first edition, and
            by an * in inner K of the second. Once again the figures prevent unwarranted claims for
            pay.</p>
          <p>James Macpherson's <hi rend="italic">Temora</hi> (1763) presents another instance of
            the extent to which the headlines or the figures, if considered separately, may mislead
            the bibliographer. In this poem the identification of two sets of headlines, each used
            successively, one for the inner forme, one for the outer, might indicate work on a
            single press. The notation of a variety of marks, however, would seem to justify the
            assertion that the sheets were simultaneously processed by as many as ten different
            pressmen. Actually neither assumption appears to be valid. Either a number of men were
            working in relay on two presses or, less plausibly, the formes were allocated to any
            available press, but to no more than two at a time. Whatever the procedure, it was
            obviously erratic, undetermined by the overseer, and thus necessitated the marking <pb
              n="003.178"/> of every forme to certify the identity of the men performing the
              work.<ref target="f003.10.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref></p>
          <p>One other relationship remains to be examined: that between the figures and three sets
            of headlines. When the third skeleton appears only occasionally it is very probably the
            one usually employed for the proofing press, but used for final work if one of the other
            skeletons is unavailable. If intermittently employed, as in sheets B-F of the first
            edition of Ellis's <hi rend="italic">The Protestant Resolved</hi>, no identification is
            required for any of the formes, since all would represent the work of a single press. An
            example of a more systematic use of the third press is observed in Susannah Centlivre's
              <hi rend="italic">The Busie Body</hi> [1709]<ref target="f003.10.14" n="14"><hi
                rend="super">14</hi></ref>
            <!--<figure entity="sb031781"/> --> Here, for some reason (perhaps it may be&mdash;as we have
            conjectured before&mdash;that 3 is working full press), all but one of the formes
            through F are marked.<ref target="f003.10.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref>
            After F there is a disruption involving, this time, not a discontinuance of certain
            forme-skeletons, but a reallocation, apparently for half-press work by three presses
            operating in succession. Number 3 worked both formes of G, presumably, 5 those of H, 2
            those of I, and 3, again, those of K. The regular pattern of figures and headlines which
            might appear when several presses are operating successively would not be evident,
            however, when they are operating simultaneously. In this situation any one of the three
            formes would go to the press that was ready to take it. Consequently the sequence would
            be indeterminable, subject to arguments later on as to the hours of work performed, and
            requiring, therefore, as in similar instances cited above, the identification of every
            forme. A typical example of such an operation appears in the first volume of the <hi
              rend="italic">Spectator</hi>.</p>
          <pb n="003.179"/>
          <p>From this preliminary survey of the correspondence or, more often, the discrepancy
            between the headlines and the figures in eighteenth-century books, it will be agreed
            that investigation based on one kind of evidence to the exclusion of the other leads to
            an oversimplification of the problems involved. Before the expiration of the Licensing
            Act in 1695 the process of bookmaking was undoubtedly less confused than afterwards:
            only thirty-five master printers were authorized to practice the trade,<ref
              target="f003.10.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> and most of these, we may be
            sure, conformed to the regulation limiting the number of presses and apprentices for
            each shop. During this period, then, extraneous conditions have not only provided the
            bibliographer with certain means for detecting occasional irregularities in the
            production of a book, as these are discerned in various types, headlines, and paper, but
            limited the output of books he has to examine to relatively few and comparatively
            well-organized establishments. After 1695, though, the conditions for disorder increase
            in approximately the same ratio as the means for detecting it disappear. By the end of
            the eighteenth century the personnel of the trade numbered no less than 2815,<ref
              target="f003.10.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> but the materials of the
            trade&mdash;ink, paper, and type&mdash;had become so standardized that little is known
            or will ever be known of what these several thousand persons were doing. Even the press
            figures are uncommunicative. When they appear they seem to indicate a process which is
            disrupted, reassigned, or uncontrolled, printing engaged at half or full press,
            simultaneously or sequentially, and, rather obscurely, production over a certain period
            of time.<ref target="f003.10.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref> But they do not
            reveal, in all instances, the necessity for their appearance, nor the precise
            information conveyed to the person who ordered their insertion. Thus they remain, at
            best, as intimations of what will never be fully divulged.<ref target="f003.10.19"

          <p>Whatever may be the significance of the figures to the pressmen of the eighteenth
            century, their importance in contemporary investigation cannot be underestimated. By
            ignoring these convenient indices to the formes and sheets of various books,
            bibliographers have devised descriptions so general as to encompass as a single entity
            works which actually exist in innumerable states, impressions and editions. Even such
            authorities as Kaye, Griffith, Gulick, Sale, and Worthington, all of whom have
            occasionally reported the figures as a means of differentiation, fail to report them
            consistently and completely. Hence their accounts of Mandeville, Pope, Chesterfield,
            Richardson, and Scott are, one and all, inadequate. Indeed my casual enquiry into the
            use of these figures as a positive sign of variation among copies allows the assertion
            that practically every scholarly bibliography and edition of eighteenth-century
            literature rests on undiscriminated texts.</p>
          <p>The great value of these figures lies in the convenience with which they may be
            recorded and subsequently used to distinguish and classify the variants they disclose.
            For this purpose one need not fill reams of paper with the distinguishing
            characteristics of the headlines (a fruitless procedure, I might observe, for most
            editions in this period) or travel about the country with cases of microfilm. The
            figures are sufficient criteria.<ref target="f003.10.20" n="20"><hi rend="super"
              >20</hi></ref> In most cases they may be recorded, as a necessary part of the
            description of a book, by a simple reference to the page and number [as 39&mdash;7]. In
            some, however, it may be necessary, for the purpose of bibliographical analysis, to
            convert this reference to less simplified notations <pb n="003.181"/> indicating the
            forme in which the figure is located [C(i)7], the position of the figure within the
            forme [C7<hi rend="super">v</hi>(i)7], or, for half-sheet imposition, the sheet
            [C&mdash;7] or page [C4<hi rend="super">v</hi>&mdash;7] identified by the figure. The
            method of notation employed should, I think, be determined by the book, and not by any
            arbitrary principle requiring the presentation of useless information for some works and
            not enough of what would be essential for others. In the discussion which follows I
            have, therefore, adopted the most convenient system for the book considered.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">The analysis of variants</hi>. Variation in the presence or kind of
            figures for a sheet in copies which are otherwise of a single impression indicates (1) a
            disrupted impression, as this may be occasioned by the substitution of one pressman for
            another at the same press, (2) a reimpression at other presses to compensate for a
            miscalculation at the time the tokens were set out for the original printing, or (3) a
            resetting for the same reason as that accounted for in (2).<ref target="f003.10.21"
              n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref> Though an examination of copies which vary in
            this respect will usually not permit a discrimination between (1) and (2),<ref
              target="f003.10.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref> it will reveal (3) and allow
            the explanation suggested. Whether (2) or (3), a decision concerning the priority of
            variants may be offered on the basis suggested by Dr. Kaye: the later one will have a
            pattern of figures differing from that evident in the other sheets.<ref
              target="f003.10.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref></p>
          <p>Imagination can easily supply any number of incidents as the occasion for an
            interruption of the kind indicated under (1)&mdash;the failure of the first man to
            report for work after an evening at his favorite pub, or his departure for lunch, or his
            dismissal for one reason or another. And sometimes a reasonable hypothesis may be
            deduced from the aberration. In the previously undifferentiated second editions of
            Pope's Imitations of Horace, <hi rend="italic">The</hi>
            <pb n="003.182"/>
            <hi rend="italic">First Epistle of the Second Book</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Second
              Epistle</hi> (1737), the work was performed by four numbered men and one designated as
              "&tgr;".<ref target="f003.10.24" n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref>
            <!-- <figure entity="sb031821"/> --> For both of these second editions numbers 2, 3, 4, and
            occasionally 1 complete the impression of their formes, but &tgr; works infrequently and
            then only on the press operated by 1. I think we may presume from this circumstance that
            1 is the master printer in Woodfall's shop (perhaps Woodfall himself), and has under his
            tutelage a young apprentice who is allowed, now and then, to try his hand with a few
            sheets. If this much is presumed, the conjecture follows that where both figures and
            symbols appear in the same book, the figures may designate the master and journeymen,
            who are assigned numbers according to seniority, and the symbols, the apprentices,
            printers' devils, or "smouters" who are only occasionally employed at press.</p>
          <p>Consistent variation in the figures for all sheets indicates different impressions or
            editions. Since the figures are usually entered on or immediately below the
            direction-line, they may be tied up with that line and the adjacent letter-press when
            the latter is removed from the forme, and remain as a part of the type page until they
            are replaced by the figures of other pressmen assigned to <pb n="003.183"/> work a
            subsequent impression. When this is the practice the numbers, as always, will change
            between impressions, but their relative positions within the formes will remain
            unchanged. A typical example of this procedure is observed in the two "editions" of
            Samuel Johnson's <hi rend="italic">Thoughts on the Late Transactions Respecting
              Falkland's Islands</hi> (1771), an octavo in half-sheets collating <hi rend="italic"
                >A<hi rend="super">2</hi></hi> B-K <hi rend="super">4</hi> L<hi rend="super">2</hi>,
            and bearing these figures: <!-- <figure entity="sb031831"/> --> Here, as the figures imply and as
            inspection confirms, the second variant, though called a "Second Edition" on its
            title-page, is actually a reissue (reimpression).<ref target="f003.10.25" n="25"><hi
                rend="super">25</hi></ref> Not infrequently, however, the figures will be dropped,
            along with other superfluous matter, before the pages are retied for storage, and thus
            reappear in a new impression as different numbers in different positions. Where this has
            occurred, it is impossible to ascertain, from the figures alone, whether the variant is
            of the same or another setting of type.<ref target="f003.10.26" n="26"><hi rend="super"
                >26</hi></ref></p>
          <pb n="003.184"/>
          <p>During the course of an impression regularly processed according to the order of its
            signatures, it may be decided to overprint the remaining sheets in anticipation of a
            second edition. Such a decision will be reflected in the figures, which will vary in
            number and position throughout that portion of the text which has been reset or
            reimpressed, but will usually remain invariable in the latter portion, where a single
            expanded impression suffices for both editions. Thus the incidence of identical figures
            provides, for the books concerned, instances of a procedure for which Dr. Bowers found
            no evidence in books of an earlier period:<ref target="f003.10.27" n="27"><hi
                rend="super">27</hi></ref> that of a deliberate increase in the number of very late
            sheets machined at one time to be divided between two editions. The other practice to
            which Dr. Bowers refers as normal for sixteenth and seventeenth century printing is that
            of laying aside and later reimpressing the pages to be overprinted. Of the many examples
            of both procedures, apparently only five are now on record for the eighteenth century:
            those involving the two editions, first volume, of Gibbon's <hi rend="italic">Decline
              and Fall</hi>; volumes 2 and 4 of the second and third editions of Chesterfield's <hi
              rend="italic">Letters</hi>; volumes 1 and 3 of the third and fifth editions of the <hi
              rend="italic">Letters</hi>; volume 7 of the first and third editions of Richardson's
              <hi rend="italic">History of Sir Charles Grandison</hi>; and two editions of <hi
              rend="italic">The New Ministry</hi>.<ref target="f003.10.28" n="28"><hi rend="super"
                >28</hi></ref></p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Printing according to the order of accessibility</hi>. Occasionally
            it may be inferred, with varying degrees of certainty, that the initial impression of a
            book has not proceeded according to the order of its signatures, but in some abnormal
            sequence determined by the availability of the formes. Irregularity is implied, but not
            demonstrated, whenever identical figures in a second variant reappear, not in the latter
            portion of that variant, as we should expect for a normal overprint, but scattered
            throughout several interior sheets. In the absence of indications to the contrary, one
            explanation for these reiterated figures&mdash;as they occur, for example, in <pb
              n="003.185"/> sheets D, F, and H of Johnson's <hi rend="italic">Thoughts on the Late
              Transactions</hi>&mdash;is that the pressmen so identified accidentally returned to
            the same formes they had machined before. But for some works, certain considerations
            disallow this conjecture. For these, we may presume that the formes involved were
            overlooked in the process of the first impression, either by the pressman, who for one
            reason or another neglected to machine them until toward the end of his work, when they
            were then used for an overprinting, or by the compositor, who pushed them aside while he
            imposed or distributed the type for the others.</p>
          <p>Before fixing the responsibility upon one or the other we should trace the progress of
            the forme from the compositor's bench to the press-room and back again in order to
            determine where and how it could be mislaid. Normally, of course, the proportion between
            compositors and pressmen will be such that the work proceeds without interruption. Once
            the intended date of publication has been advertised, however, the distribution of work
            must be so arranged that the pressmen are never allowed to be idle, for the schedule
            depends upon their machining a certain number of formes in a given time. It will be of
            advantage to the overseer, therefore, that he have one or more formes ready at each
            press so that there will be no delay and consequent disruption of the schedule. The
            practice of stacking the formes awaiting impression we may consider to be a custom, for
            a regulation covers the matter: <q>When a compositor carries his form down for press, he
              is not to put two forms together without a partition between, or forfeiture of
              two-pence; and in case, through neglect of such partition, a form should be battered,
              the compositor guilty of such neglect shall forfeit six-pence.<ref target="f003.10.29"
                n="29"><hi rend="super">29</hi></ref></q> Since preservation of type is the primary
            concern, it is probable that the formes were laid, even with partitions, not one on top
            of the other, but against a wall where they would be convenient to all the pressmen, or,
            if they were previously assigned to one, against that man's press. Wherever their
            location, <hi rend="italic">the formes last imposed would be those most accessible to
              the men</hi>.</p>
          <p>Infrequently it might happen, particularly if the preceding work is running to a great
            number of copies, that all the formes of <pb n="003.186"/> a pamphlet would be stacked
            and ready for impression, in which case they would be machined throughout in the inverse
            order of their signatures.<ref target="f003.10.30" n="30"><hi rend="super">30</hi></ref>
            So long as the pressman keeps the two formes of a sheet together, it is immaterial
            whether he selects those for sheets G or M or X, for he knows that sooner or later he
            and his companions will "work their way to the wall," where he may find some of the
            early formes&mdash;B, D, and F, for example. And if, before he gets that far, the issue
            has been increased, then B, D, and F will constitute a single impression for the two
            editions, while G, M, and X, though later in the alphabetical sequence, will be reset or
            reimpressed in the second.</p>
          <p>Though there must necessarily be an accumulation of ready-formes in the press-room in
            order to avoid delay, any accumulation of used formes was considered a nuisance and
            subject to fine. <q>As soon as a form is wrought-off, the pressman to carry it to a
              lie-trough, and there completely rub it over with lie, rinse it with water, and then
              carry it to the wrought-off place, or to the end of the compositor's frame it belongs
              to. Three-pence for each neglected form.<ref target="f003.10.31" n="31"><hi
                  rend="super">31</hi></ref></q> After it has been returned to the "wrought-off
            place" or directly to the compositor, he too must not be dilatory in distributing type.
              <q>Jobs to be cleared away immediately after notice being given by the overseer, under
              the penalty of two-pence for every hour's delay.<ref target="f003.10.32" n="32"><hi
                  rend="super">32</hi></ref></q> Usually, of course, the compositor would need no
            urging to perform this task, for it would often be essential that he distribute in order
            to keep himself provided with enough sorts to continue composition. And as it takes only
            one-sixth as long to break type as it does to set it up,<ref target="f003.10.33" n="33"
                ><hi rend="super">33</hi></ref> he not only has the compulsion of a penalty and the
            necessity for reusing the type as encouragements to distribute, but sufficient time for
            the job. It may be said, therefore, <pb n="003.187"/> that whenever interspersed formes
            of the first impression reappear in the second impression or edition, these formes have
            been machined according to the accessibility of the type in the press-room.</p>
          <p>It is one thing to construct a plausible hypothesis, quite another to prove it. The
            three examples cited below are arranged according to the degree of irregularity and the

              >2</hi>+M<hi rend="super">2</hi> would seem to indicate a single impression; but since
            the date on A1 of the "A" edition invariably reads "M.CDD.XLIII.", while that in "B"
            reads, correctly, "M.DCC.XLIII.", an interruption has occurred between the variants. The
            sheet in "B" must be considered, then, either as a reimpression, with the presence of
            the identical figure accounted for as the accidental return of the man to the forme he
            worked before, or as a continuous impression, with the corrected state appearing, again
            accidentally, only in the later edition of the copies examined. Though accidence may
            similarly account for the reiterated figures in F, H, I, and K, the possibility of this
            diminishes with each additional sheet and may be discounted altogether with reference to
            four. It would be a strange coincidence indeed that out of the eleven formes of this
            book, number 2 should return to one of the two formes he had previously impressed. More
            likely is the supposition that the sheets for "A" were impressed in the order of their
            accessibility, those later <pb n="003.188"/> reset being the first, followed by those
            subsequently reimpressed and, as the stack was uncovered, those continued as a single
            impression for the planned overprint. The progress of these formes through the press may
            therefore approximately correspond to this formulary: <table>

            <!-- <figure entity="sb031881"/> --> Since the formes for every sheet, except C and E, were
            simultaneously impressed in the one issue, but consecutively impressed in the other, it
            would appear that there was some reason for a shift in the printing arrangements. And
            that reason, we may confidently assert, can be found in the circumstances pertaining to
            the impression of C, a sheet which, unlike the others, is apparently of a single
            impression, and simultaneously machined throughout. What happened, presumably, is that
            the formes for C were covered by those for D-G, and were thus not available until inner
            and outer G had been picked up by 1 and 6. Then, after the completion of a run
            of&mdash;let us say&mdash;500 copies of G, but before the completion of the same run on
            C, the decision was made to double the issue, whereupon x and 4 together continued to
            impress about 900 copies of C in approximately the same amount of time that it took 8
            and &tgr; individually to print and perfect 500 copies <pb n="003.189"/> of B and E.
            Number 8 then completed the work on AG while 4 machined D and F. The facts of printing,
            therefore, were probably not too dissimilar to what is represented by the formulary: </p>

              rend="super">0</hi> in half-sheets, A-P<hi rend="super">4</hi>) are several kinds of
            evidence which together provide a convincing demonstration of the irregular printing of
            the first impression. In this, A4<hi rend="super">v</hi> carries a list of fifteen
            corrigenda present in eight of the fifteen gatherings. In the second issue
            (reimpression) of the play the list has been withdrawn and all errata corrected <hi
              rend="italic">except</hi> those appearing in the three sheets having the same figures
            as before&mdash;sheets H, I, and N. Then in the second impression of these sheets (the
            third issue of the play, titled "The Second Edition") four of the five errata which they
            contained are finally corrected. From this it follows that H, I, and N were printed
            without interruption for both of the early issues before the corrigenda were made
            available for the second, and before they were removed from the press and corrected for
            the third. To understand these complications as they are now beginning to develop it

          <p>Since H, I, and N are both by figure and by readings confirmed as a single impression
            for the first and second issues, we may suppose that they were printed toward the end of
            the sequence of sheets for the first and in sufficient quantities to provide copies <pb
              n="003.190"/> for both issues. Yet they must precede the last two or three sheets, for
            sometime during the work on P, first issue, the press was stopped for the correction of
            "requium" to "requiem" (105.5), one of the fifteen errors noted by Lewis when he
            returned the proof for preliminary gathering A. If H, I, and N had followed A, then it
            is reasonable to assume that they too would have been corrected at press, especially
            since number 3 worked on A as well as H and N. And not only must P and A therefore come
            after the three but very probably the invariant O, a sheet worked by 6, who, we will
            observe, is lately assigned to this job, apparently for the purpose of hurrying it
            up.</p>
          <p>Taking these several factors into account, we are obliged to assume that the first
            issue was overprinted for three sheets (H-I, N), then reduced to the original quota of
            copies for three more (O-P, A) in order to insure the publication of the original issue
            on the scheduled date. After this date there were a number of other improvisations in
            the making of subsequent issues, all of which may be represented in a formulary. <table>

            <note>[I assume the production of 1000 copies for each of the first two issues, the
              reuse of 500 copies remaining from the second for the third, and the production of 500
              more for the fourth.]</note> Should any more be needed, a measure of proof for the
            position of H-I, N in the sequence machined for the first issue can be inferred from the
            construction of subsequent impressions. For the third issue ("Second Edition") sheet A
            was discarded, four new sheets prepared (<hi rend="super">i</hi>, a, Q-R), and the
            remainder of the second issue combined with these to form a complete copy. As all the
            type for the first issue, excepting H and I, was still standing at the time the fourth
            issue (also titled "Second Edition") was ordered, it was corrected according to the
            author's latest desires, <pb n="003.191"/> then machined by a new group of men. Why was
            it necessary to reset H and I?<ref target="f003.10.37" n="37"><hi rend="super"
              >37</hi></ref> If these two sheets had come in their proper sequence during the
            impression of the second issue, they would have been available for the fourth. But as
            they obviously were not available, the conclusion is inescapable that they were printed
            simultaneously with the first and at the beginning of the second issue, then distributed
            before the decision was made to retain the type of the second for a fourth reimpressed
            issue.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Cast-off copy</hi>. Normally an allocation of copy among several
            shops can be easily detected by variation in the headlines, font of type, type-measure,
            or paper. But occasionally these differentiae are so minute that they escape notice
            unless attention is directed to them by evidence of a more conspicuous nature, such as
            that provided by the figures. These may show a division whenever they appear in one
            portion of the text, but not in the second, or, less frequently, when they are of one
            kind in the first portion, and of another in the second. Why the former pattern should

            </table> Other cancels in Burke's <hi rend="italic">Appeal</hi> for which the figures
            provide no clue, however, are B5 (signed) and D8 (signed 'D7'). If there were no
            signature on the first of these to signify cancellation, it might be inferred,
            nevertheless, from the absence of a figure. All sheets except B have in their
            uncancelled state, presumably, two figures; B departs from the pattern by having only
            one. And as this is on the inner forme (B8-&sect;), the other was very probably on the
            outer forme of B5 in its original state.</p>
          <p>Where there is, as in the <hi rend="italic">Appeal</hi>, an evident pattern of figures,
            any irregularity should be regarded with as much suspicion as duplicate figures. In
            Johnson's <hi rend="italic">Thoughts on the Late Transactions</hi>, to cite again an
            oft-quoted example, the missing figure in sheet K of the first impression (see p. 183)
            is doubtless explained by the existence of a cancel at K2. Similarly in Edward Young's
              <hi rend="italic">Centaur Not Fabulous</hi> (1755), an octavo, various deviations from
            customary practice are observed: the register of signatures through &dollar;4 for all
            sheets, except N2 and R2; and the insertion of a single figure for each sheet, except T
            and 2C, which have two, and E and U, which have none. As the copies examined have all
            been tightly rebound, corollary evidence is not easily obtained; but the occasional
            presence of stubs in some exemplars allows a provisional conclusion that this book
            contains at least five cancels&mdash;N1.2, R1.2, and T8 or U1&mdash;and probably has
            several more, or perhaps a complete resetting, in sheets E, T, and 2C.</p>
          <p>Like the grouping of figures discussed in the previous section, the appearance or
            disappearance of figures is not always a certain sign of abnormality. To the several
            instances of this in which cancellation is confirmed, we may add several more which seem
            to indicate a cancellation that has not occurred. The first, Chesterfield's <hi
              rend="italic">Vindication of the Case of the Hanover Troops</hi> (1743, 8<hi
              rend="super">0</hi> in half-sheets), has a figure 1 entered at D3<hi rend="super"
              >v</hi> of the initial issue, the same 1 and another at D4<hi rend="super">v</hi> of
            the reissue (reimpression).<ref target="f003.10.43" n="43"><hi rend="super"
              >43</hi></ref> As this <pb n="003.194"/> pamphlet was printed by half-sheet
            imposition, requiring only one figure to a forme, the presence of a second calls for
            explanation. And the only plausible one is that upon the return of the forme for a
            reissue, the pressman, perhaps realizing that he was subject to a fine for working
            without figures,<ref target="f003.10.44" n="44"><hi rend="super">44</hi></ref> looked
            about for the symbol of the previous man, and not finding it, inserted his own at D4<hi
              rend="super">v</hi>. Had he looked on the other side of the forme, we may presume, he
            would not only have found the figure, but discovered it to be his.</p>
          <p>Another appears in a cheap reprint of Charles Shadwell's <hi rend="italic">Fair Quaker
              of Deal</hi> (1769, 12<hi rend="super">0</hi>) where, curiously enough, two figures, a
            2 and a 4, are found on B11. Quite possibly&mdash;my conjecture rests on a single copy
            (NcD)&mdash;one man replaced another at press and failed to remove the figure belonging
            to his predecessor. A third example, evident in Fielding's <hi rend="italic">Voyage to
              Lisbon</hi>, is more appropriately considered in the next section.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Imposition</hi>. When the format of a book is for any reason subject
            to various interpretations, the figures should provide a clue to the disposition of the
            pages within a given forme, and thus identify the process employed. For the normal
            method of half-sheet imposition, in which all the pages for a signature are placed
            within the same chase, the process, involving the use of a single machine, is revealed
            by a single figure in each gathering. For the alternate method, requiring an arrangement
            of two successive outer formes in one chase, the corresponding inner formes in another,
            the process, involving two presses or two distinct operations on the same press, would
            be occasionally signified by two figures, both of which will appear in one of the half
            sheets, none in the second, or one in a certain forme of the first, the other in the <hi
              rend="italic">obverse</hi> forme of the second. Again, as with all of my remarks
            concerning the figures, these generalizations have exceptions. One, Chesterfield's <hi
              rend="italic">Vindication</hi>, has already been mentioned as an instance of
            accidental duplication in the figures. Another, possibly, occurs in Fielding's
            second-printed, first-published edition of the <hi rend="italic">Voyage to Lisbon</hi>
            (1755), a duodecimo with its final gathering <pb n="003.195"/> imposed as a half-sheet
            and figured N3<hi rend="super">v</hi>(i)7, N4<hi rend="super">v</hi>(o)2. Here we would
            expect, for one gathering, imposition according to the first method, but find,
            apparently, the arrangements required by the second. Perhaps, if the figures are a
            reliable indication, the second half-sheet produced was used in another book.</p>
          <p>In duodecimoes the manner of imposition can be determined, in most instances, by the
            position of the figures. Normally these will be found only at the most convenient point
            of insertion, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, at the <hi rend="italic">exposed</hi> foot of
            unsigned pages at either end of the forme. If the pages are, conveniently, of an outer
            rank, but so positioned that their headlines are exposed, the feet of these pages are as
            inaccessible as those for the inner rank, and thus remain unfigured. To illustrate the
            arrangement of the pages in the impositions usually described (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>
            and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> below), possible variations in these arrangements, and the
            probable location of the figures in all varieties, I present the following data for the
            outer formes: <!--<figure entity="sb031951"/>  --> Practically all eighteenth-century books of
            duodecimo format were imposed as described under (a); some few, as for example those
            discussed below, have sheets accidentally imposed, it would seem, in the manner of (b)
            or (c); but none, so far as I have observed, were imposed as indicated by (d).</p>
          <p>One instance of disarranged imposition appears in a reprint of <pb n="003.196"/> Thomas
            Southerne's <hi rend="italic">Oroonoko</hi> (printed for C. Bathurst and others, 1776),
            in which sheet B is aberrantly signed through &dollar;6 (not &dollar;5, as normally) and
            figured 7<hi rend="super">v</hi>(i)3, 10<hi rend="super">v</hi>(o)2. The added signature
            as well as the location of the figures suggests (b) as the manner of imposition. Very
            probably the rank of leaves 5&mdash;8 was not discovered to be misplaced until the outer
            forme of B had been partially machined. Then, to avoid wastage, the inner was imposed in
            the same manner, and a signature added to &dollar;6 so that the binder would be certain,
            whatever forme was up, to sect the lower and not the upper third of the sheet.</p>
          <p>Other instances of irregularity, but only in the location of the figures, are implicit
            in Mandeville's <hi rend="italic">Fable of the Bees. Part II</hi> (1730),<ref
              target="f003.10.45" n="45"><hi rend="super">45</hi></ref> where an asterisk is
            inserted at M10<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and in Smollett's <hi rend="italic">Humphry
              Clinker</hi> (second edition, 1771), where there are the following discrepancies from
            the normal pattern: F11<hi rend="super">v</hi>(i)4, F10<hi rend="super">v</hi>(o)7;
            H8(i)4, H9(o)7; and M4<hi rend="super">v</hi>(o)7. All of these except F conform, again,
            to (b); and F, apparently, to (c). For these the evidence of aberration becomes less
            certain, of course, when it rests on the figures alone, and may be explicable on other
            grounds at present undisclosed. (Outer 11 and 12 would be conjoined whether imposition
            is [a] or [c].)</p>
          <p>One example of the confusion that may result when the figures are abnormally placed in
            a normal imposition appears in the first-published edition of Fielding's <hi
              rend="italic">Voyage to Lisbon</hi> (1755), a book of many bibliographical mysteries,
            not all of which have as yet been fathomed. In this all gatherings have two figures, one
            for each forme, except E, F, and G, each of which has three: <!-- <figure entity="sb031961"/> -->
            If the figures in the inner rank were not duplicated in the outer, we might suppose, as
            for <hi rend="italic">Humphry Clinker</hi>, that the first two sheets are instances of
            (b), the third of (c). Since the figures are reiterated, however, and since the
            chainlines for all leaves are contiguous with those for their normal counterparts, we
            must discount, not only this possibility, but another pertaining to <pb n="003.197"/>
            cancellation. A third conjecture, that these three gatherings were imposed by 4's and
            8's to dispose of split sheet remainders, must also be dismissed; for if this were the
            procedure, then F would have two figures on the inner four-leaf segment to represent the
            work of a single press, and only one on the outer eight-leaf segment to represent the
            work of two. Thus we are perforce reduced to the comment that these figures must reflect
            some irregularity, not in the production of the book, but in the assignments for its
            production. Perhaps two agents were involved, the compositor, who accidentally inserts
            the figures in the middle rank of pages as he imposes them, and the pressman, who fails
            to discover them in the outer ranks, where they belong, and therefore figures again,
            number 1 at E12<hi rend="super">v</hi>, number 2 at F5<hi rend="super">v</hi> and
            G8.</p>
          <p>Though the figures raise, in the <hi rend="italic">Voyage to Lisbon</hi>, an intriguing
            little problem which may not be decided to the satisfaction of all, they do provide the
            means for solving one of much greater consequence. Excluding those in the inner rank of
            E, F, and G, which are demonstrably superfluous, and those appearing in I and K, which
            ambiguously identify either (a) or (d) imposition [I7<hi rend="super">v</hi>(i)3, I12<hi
              rend="super">v</hi>(o)7; K7<hi rend="super">v</hi>(i)3, K12<hi rend="super"
            >v</hi>(o)2], the ones remaining are invariably disposed in locations accessible only
            for imposition with cutting (a). The watermarks, however, seem to indicate the alternate
            method without cutting (d). These are located, in each gathering, at the outer margin,
            half-way down the page, and overlapping leaves 9 and 10, their approximate position for
            the latter method. Between the two kinds of evidence we must choose, I am now convinced,
            that afforded by the figures, and explain the other as uncommon paper of foreign make,
            probably Genevan, with the watermark in the <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> of the
              sheet.<ref target="f003.10.46" n="46"><hi rend="super">46</hi></ref> In this unusual
            position it <pb n="003.198"/> appears exactly at the location described for the sheets
            of the <hi rend="italic">Voyage to Lisbon</hi> and verifies the imposition which the
            figures certify as (a). Thus the information to be derived from the figures is
            completely justified and leads to a conclusion which might not have been forthcoming had
            it been ignored.</p>
          <p>From these several demonstrations of the value of press figures in various phases of
            bibliographical analysis it is obvious that they are entitled to consideration whenever
            they appear in eighteenth-century books. In many instances they constitute the only
            convenient procedure for disclosing hidden variants, "presumed editions,"<ref
              target="f003.10.47" n="47"><hi rend="super">47</hi></ref> and sophisticated or mixed
              copies,<ref target="f003.10.48" n="48"><hi rend="super">48</hi></ref> the only
            practicable method for detecting and deciding problems at present unknown or unresolved,
            the only expedient means for selecting and organizing the material to be studied in any
            investigation, and for describing the exact nature of that material in the
            bibliographical record. Their presence in the record may not always be informative, but
            their omission must inevitably deny the scholar the opportunity of confirming the
            research of others and seriously inhibit his own.</p>

          <head type="sub">ADDENDUM</head>
          <p>The recent publication of Mr. Philip Gaskell's article on "Eighteenth-century Press
            Numbers" [<hi rend="italic">Library</hi>, 5th ser., IV (1950), 249-61] allows me the
            privilege of anticipating, in his commentary, some of the criticism which may be evoked
            by my own account. Again I feel constrained to remark that the exclusive interpretation
            offered by Mr. Gaskell, like the one ventured by Mr. Knotts, cannot prevail against the
            conflicting testimony of <pb n="003.199"/> the headlines. Perhaps information other than
            this may be found to support the ambiguous intimations of the figures&mdash;such as that
            recorded in the printers' ledgers, for instance&mdash;but until it is forthcoming I
            shall continue to refer to the corollary evidence now available, and to reaffirm my
            conviction (1) that Kaye's theory is, essentially, the only one that comprehends all the
            facts; (2) that the presence of an anonymous pressman need not, therefore, be presumed
            for all unfigured sheets; (3) that reiterated figures in both formes of a sheet cannot
            be regarded as the idiosyncrasy of a compositor or foreman (a surmise which overlooks
            the strangely intermittent indication of what would be a persistent trait), but rather
            as the sign of full-press operation or of the termination of simultaneous printing; (4)
            that a shift in the position of a figure does not necessarily signify reimposition; or
            conversely, (5) that the appearance of a second figure in the same position as the first
            may not result from the transfer of the forme, during the course of an impression, to
            another machine. If one recognizes the probabilities which seem to be confirmed by the
            examples that I have cited, first, that the figures designate the man and not the
            machine, and secondly, that the figures may be tied up with the letterpress between
            impressions, then it can be maintained that the occasional appearance of an alternate
            but identically positioned figure in some sheets usually indicates a replacement at the
            same press, and the appearance of this figure in all sheets, a subsequent impression at
            other presses. Moreover, the association of the figure with the man also permits a
            rational explanation of the large numbers in a few works, such as the '22' which Mr.
            Gaskell found in Mrs. Piozzi's <hi rend="italic">Observations on a Journey</hi> (1789).
            Actually, Strahan, the printer, may have owned only seven or eight presses and assigned
            to each three or more men working in shifts.</p>
          <p>Despite our several disagreements, Mr. Gaskell and I concur in rearranging the order
            and reducing the number of impressions which Mr. Knotts devised for the variants of <hi
              rend="italic">The Beggar's Opera</hi> (1728). But where Mr. Gaskell, as a consequence
            of his premise concerning the variable figures, supposes only one reimposition, and thus
            limits the total impressions to two&mdash;constituting for the first, the groups he
            labels A&mdash;C, for the second, D&mdash;G &mdash; I wish to defer a commitment on
            those described as D&mdash;E (corresponding <pb n="003.200"/> to the miscellaneous group
            3 in my review) until their status has been determined by the headlines. Meanwhile, it
            should be mentioned that, in addition to the variants already disclosed, several others
            have been reported. These I describe according to Mr. Gaskell's classification. <table>

            <p>I have adopted the term "press figures" in deference to original contemporary usage
              in the printers' manuals. Perhaps a more accurate signification would be "pressman's
              mark," for, as I shall endeavor to show, the symbol identifies the man rather than the
              press, and exists in the form of letters and numbers as well as figures. Since this
              term is of my own coinage, however, and since it might be confused with "printer's
              mark" or "press mark," both of which have other denotations, I use the customary
              reference.</p>

              the time represented may be a week. For these books it is plausible that the men
              completed, in a six day period, three or more sheets at full press, three or less at
              half press. The evidence is so ambiguous, however, and so variously recorded by the
              pressmen as to be almost worthless.</p>

            <p>It has been suggested to me that the figures might identify the compositors as well
              as the pressmen, and thus serve as a means for insuring the return of the wrought-off
              formes to the proper persons for distribution. This would be a plausible assumption
              were it not for the fact that the figures are highly variable, not present in some
              formes of an impression, constant in others, shifting in still others, and changing in
              every forme of a reimpression. Thus for any one setting of type, presumably the work
              of a single compositor, there may be in the course of its use as many as eight
              different figures, all identifying the succession of men at press, but none the man
              who composed the type. An exceptional case is evident, however, in the initial
              gathering of Mandeville's <hi rend="italic">Fable of the Bees. Part II</hi> (1730,
                12<hi rend="super">0</hi>&mdash;the second edition?), where a figure &Dagger;
              appears at the foot of every page from A7 to A11<hi rend="super">v</hi>. Professor
              James L. Clifford has offered what seems to be the only reasonable explanation for
              this phenomenon. An apprentice has composed these ten pages and is held responsible
              for whatever correction is necessary and for the eventual distribution of the
              type.</p>

            <p>This comment should be qualified by the observation that pirates may infrequently
              attempt to duplicate the figures of their copytext as well as the ornaments and

                (12<hi rend="super">0</hi>, 1752) may appear at position F6<hi rend="super">v</hi>
              (CtY) or F7 (CtY, ICU, NN-Berg[2]). Presumably these figures were extracted by the

            <p>Throughout this paper my terminology approximately conforms, I trust, to the several
              definitions set forth in Dr. Bowers' <hi rend="italic">Principles of Bibliographical
                Description</hi> (1949). From the available evidence concerning planned overprints
              of certain eighteenth-century books, I am, however, unwilling to abandon McKerrow's
              classification of these as "editions" and to assume with Dr. Bowers (p. 48) that they
              represent states. For books printed before 1695 it is no doubt true that since legal
              restrictions operated to prevent an excessive issue of copies from a single setting,
              the necessary resetting for overprints "presumably occurred," as Dr. Bowers remarks,
              "during 'continuous printing' and concerns the text of only a small portion of the
              book." But the lapse of these restrictions brought about a modification of procedure
              which is evident in numerous books of a later period. In one, Gibbon's <hi
                rend="italic">Decline and Fall</hi> (cited by Dr. Bowers [p. 48, n. 7] as an unusual
              case), the resetting admittedly involves only about one-third of the text; but this
              amounts to the impression of 500 sheets on fifty-four formes&mdash;or to some 13,500
              perfected sheets, in all, which could hardly have been processed simultaneously with
              the work on the original issue. In a second the resetting, comprising 50% (160 pages)
              of the text, was certainly not undertaken until <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the
              overprinting of the remainder, for the author was demanding publication of the first
              issue at the earliest possible date. In a third, resetting constitutes 60% (192 pages)
              of the text, and some of this was continuously impressed for the "third edition." And
              for others, as in the several editions of Pope's <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi>, and
              of <hi rend="italic">The New Ministry</hi> cited in the text, printing apparently
              proceeded up to the last sheet or so before resetting or reimpression was begun. Quite
              obviously, then, the time-consuming process of recomposing and reprinting early sheets
              for most, if not all of these books must have been subsequent to the initial
              publication of the copies produced according to the original plan. Thus the evidence
              for this period is sufficiently complete, I believe, to deny the necessity and the
              practice of resetting during continuous printing, and to reject the designation of
              "states" for books in this category. Actually, if this designation must apply, it will
              be necessary to subsume under these "states" variant impressions and other
              "substates"; and this is quite impractical. I have, therefore, accorded such books the
              status of editions.</p>

            <p>The watermark, a twelve-pointed star measuring 3 cm. across, almost certainly
              identifies the paper as of Genevan origin, since the law in that locality specifically
              required the mark to be in the center of the sheet. Cf. C. M. Briquet, <hi

              in this edition of the <hi rend="italic">Voyage</hi>, printed in 1755, is most
              unusual, for it had been supposed that no Italian or Swiss paper was used by British
              printers after 1740. Corroborative evidence of the w/m position is to be found, first,
              in the other edition, which was printed just before this one [cf. Strahan's ledger
              entries, cited in J. Paul de Castro, "The Printing of Fielding's Works," <hi

          <p>BY 1800 BINNY AND RONALDSON WERE DOING rather well for themselves financially. It was
            only four years before that James Ronaldson, deciding not to rebuild his fire-gutted
            bakery, had become the partner of Archibald Binny, just arrived from Edinburgh equipped
            with the skill and tools of type founding. The two men formed an excellent combination:
            one the business man, the other the craftsman, and both were canny Scots. After a short
            period of partnership they absorbed the New York foundry of Adam Mappa and later
            expanded their own shop in Philadelphia. At the turn of the nineteenth century they
            owned the only foundry in the United States casting English letters.</p>
          <p>But like most of the other manufacturers of this period, they constantly faced the
            problem of maintaining an adequate supply of raw materials. Although some of these could
            be procured in America, many others had to be imported, so Congress, attempting to
            encourage native manufacturing, admitted a number of items duty free. Importation,
            however, was a time-consuming process and an expensive one; if, like antimony, the
            material did not appear on the free list, the duty to be paid was large. When Binny and
            Ronaldson received approximately three tons in 1800, they were charged the sum of
            &dollar;161.54 as duty. The partners paid the bill, but not without protest. On January
            8, 1802, this petition<ref target="f003.11.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> was
            read in the House of Representatives: </p>

            <p>To the Honourable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States</p>
            <p>The Petition of Binny &amp; Ronaldson Letter Founders in Philadelphia</p>
            <p>Respectfully Sheweth</p>
            <p>That your Petitioners have established the Manufacture of Printing Types in
              Philadelphia, in the prosecution of which they have had many obstacles to encounter,
              which by industry, attention, and &oelig;conomy, they have hitherto
              surmounted&mdash;That the high price of the Metals of which their Types are composed,
              together with the difficulty of procuring some of them, particularly Regulus of
              Antimony, is a considerable bar to the success of their establishment &mdash;That
              after many unsuccessful endeavours to procure Regulus, or Antimony from which it might
              be extracted, in this Country, they have been obliged to send to Europe for it, and
              with much difficulty and after long delay they succeeded in procuring a quantity of it
              in London at a very high price, which for the sake of greater security they directed
              to be shipped in two different vessels, and it was accordingly sent out on board the
              Susanna and the Pennsylvania, who both arrived in the Delaware in October
              1800&mdash;That Regulus of Antimony being a new material, not to be procured in this
              Country and imported for the express purpose of being Manufactured here, they did not
              expect any duty would have been charged upon its importation, and therefore applied to
              the Collector of this Port who informed them that he had no power to remit the
              Duties&mdash;That they then applied to Oliver Wolcott Esq<hi rend="super">r</hi>.
              Secretary of the Treasury who answered them as follows</p>

              the rising Manufactures of the United States, they have the fullest confidence of
              obtaining, when it is recollected that all other articles of a similar nature, as far
              as they were understood at the time of enumerating the Duties, have been expressly
              exempted, such as Tin, Pewter, Copper, Brass-wire <pb n="003.209"/> &amp;<hi
                rend="super">c</hi>.&mdash;and Regulus of Antimony would doubtless have also been
              exempted had it been adverted to, or its uses been known in the Country at that
              time&mdash;That as Regulus of Antimony may be advantageously used in several other
              branches of Manufacture, and is applicable to no other purpose, your Petitioners
              submit to this Honourable Body the propriety of remitting the Duties in the present
              instance and exempting the articles in future, in which case the loss to the Revenue
              would be trifling indeed and the encouragement to several useful branches of
              Manufacture very considerable.</p>

          <p>Such a petition was not unusual and the House referred it, along with others, to the
            Committee of Commerce and Manufactures. The Committee must have studied these petitions
            very carefully for on February 10, 1802, it submitted a detailed report recommending
            various changes in the tariff. The Committee stated that <q>such manufactures as are
              obviously capable of affording to the United States an adequate supply of their
              several and respective objects, ought to be promoted by the aid of Government. Two
              modes of administering this aid have presented themselves to your committee: The one,
              to permit, free of duty, the importation of such gross articles as are essential to
              those manufactures. The other, to impose higher duties on such articles (on
              importation) as can be supplied by our own citizens to advantage.<ref
                target="f003.11.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></q> And in this vein it
            recommended that the duty on regulus of antimony be lifted and that the duty on imported
            printing types be twenty per cent <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi>&mdash;an increase of
            seven and a half per cent.</p>
          <pb n="003.210"/>
          <p>The news might well have remained buried in the list of proposed duties on such items
            as fur hats, glue, tarred cordage, pickled fish, and dried fish. But to one journalist,
            William Duane, publisher of the Philadelphia <hi rend="italic">Aurora</hi>, who was in
            Washington hoping to get the government contract for printing and stationery, this was
            exciting information. In fact, it is probably true that the duty on type was increased
            at his suggestion. In 1800 he had married Margaret Bache, widow of Benjamin Franklin
            Bache, the owner of the <hi rend="italic">Aurora</hi> as well as of the type founding
            materials which Benjamin Franklin had brought from France in 1786. Thus Duane could
            appreciate the possibilities of establishing a lucrative type foundry once imported
            types were priced prohibitively high. He proceeded immediately to notify the <hi
              rend="italic">Aurora</hi>. Five days later, it printed the following: <q> From the Editor.<lb/>
              <hi rend="italic">Washington, February 10, 1802</hi>.<lb/> The duty on Antimony is

          <p>This laconic communication set off a chain reaction which was felt in six cities. A
            narrative of the effects in chronological order would be confusing even if more

            Peters must be robbed to compensate Paul."<ref target="f003.11.05" n="5"><hi
                rend="super">5</hi></ref> On the evening of the same day, Samuel Relf's <hi
              rend="italic">Philadelphia Gazette</hi> called attention to this editorial <pb
              n="003.211"/> and noted that the increased duty "must materially retard the progress
            and perfection of the printing business."<ref target="f003.11.06" n="6"><hi rend="super"
                >6</hi></ref></p>
          <p>The next day the <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia Gazette</hi> announced that it would
            publish a detailed consideration of the duty in the following issue.<ref
              target="f003.11.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> Then, launching the campaign,
            it devoted almost two columns to the attack. The editor stressed the fact that while Fry
            and Steele, of London, could furnish more than one hundred different sizes of English
            letters in addition to characters in many foreign languages, Binny and Ronaldson could
            not supply more than one twentieth of this amount. While he did not deny that the firm
            possessed the skill required to make the additional type, he noted that the cost of the
            matrices would have to be borne by the printer who ordered the type. Nevertheless, even
              <q>on the limitted (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) scale on which it is conducted, (the
              english, pica, long-primer and brevier forming at least nine tenths of the demand from
              them) these gentlemen, possessing a monopoly of the business in America, have, in a
              few years realised an handsome property.<ref target="f003.11.08" n="8"><hi
                  rend="super">8</hi></ref></q> At this point, the editor made a rather unfortunate
            error. He interpreted the duty to be an additional twenty per cent, not an increase to
            twenty per cent. After elaborating on the injustice of such an excessive amount, he
            accused Duane, a British subject, of instigating this increase and concluded with the
            lament that <q>our public councils should be disgraced by an adherence to the opinions
              or suggestions of an individual blinded by an inveterate hatred to the country to
              which he owes his birth and allegiance.<ref target="f003.11.09" n="9"><hi rend="super"
                  >9</hi></ref></q></p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the members of the book trade had been discussing the new tariff among
            themselves. Finding themselves in general agreement on the steps to be taken, they
            called for a meeting at Mr. Cameron's, on North Third St., at seven o'clock on Saturday,
            February twentieth.<ref target="f003.11.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> When
            they assembled, Mathew Carey was chosen chairman and John H. Oswald secretary. A
            committee was directed to draft a memorial to Congress, the chairman was requested to
            ask the representative in Congress to postpone action, <pb n="003.212"/> and the
            chairman was also requested to communicate the measures adopted to the printers and
            booksellers of Boston, New York, and Baltimore. After a resolution to publish the
            proceedings of the meeting,<ref target="f003.11.11" n="11"><hi rend="super"
              >11</hi></ref> the members adjourned to meet and receive the memorial on Monday,
            February twenty-second.</p>
          <p>Duane, of course, did not neglect to answer the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>. His
            two-column reply included a brief resum&eacute; of English type founding, praise for the
            beautiful type of Binny and Ronaldson, as well as the statement that they employed more
            than twenty people.<ref target="f003.11.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> Some
            of his remarks emphasized his personal interest in the increased duty. He declared that
            there were three different foundries in America which were idle through want of
            protection; he referred to a foundry in Philadelphia which possessed matrices for every
            type from non-pareil to five-line Pica, with Greek, Hebrew, and other oriental
            characters and three hundred different species of typographical ornaments. And, in
            conclusion, he repeated that several founders would resume if provided with protection.
            The <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> printed its reply two days later. Its major point was
            that the Philadelphia foundry was in Duane's possession, having been acquired from
            Bache: "This is the clue, which at once unravels the mystery of his <hi rend="italic"
              >pretended</hi> attachment to the encouragement of <hi rend="italic">American
              manufactures</hi>!"<ref target="f003.11.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref></p>
          <p>The Philadelphia book trade continued its campaign, and two papers carried notices of
            book trade meetings in New York and Baltimore.<ref target="f003.11.14" n="14"><hi
                rend="super">14</hi></ref> On March 8, 1802, the following petition was read in the
            House of Representatives: </p>
          <q>
            <p> To the Honorable the Members of the House of<lb/> Representatives of the United
              States,<lb/> The memorial of the undersigned Printers and<lb/> Booksellers of the City
              of Philadelphia,<lb/> Respectfully represents,<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>That your memorialists view with extreme concern a proposition which they understand
              is at present under the consideration of your Honorable body, for imposing an
              additional duty upon the importation of printing types&mdash;a <pb n="003.213"/>
              measure which they cannot but consider as a new proof of the paternal solicitude of
              the Legislature, extended to the infant manufactures of our country,&mdash;but against
              which your memorialists are urged by imperious considerations to remonstrate.</p>
            <p>That the encouragement of Domestic Manufactures is an object worthy of Legislative
              attention, your Memorialists readily acknowledge. They are, however, of opinion, which
              with all due deference is submitted, that in those instances where our own
              manufactures are incompetent to the current demand, it is both unwise and impolitic,
              to prevent, by excessive imposts, a necessary supply by importation from foreign
              countries</p>
            <p>Your memorialists beg leave to state, that there is, perhaps, no manufacture in our
              common country which so little requires the aid contemplated to be afforded by the
              duty in question, as that of Types. There is at present but one Foundry of English
              Type in operation within the Union, which they are warranted in saying is inadequate
              to the supply of the great and growing demand. The proposed duty will in no wise
              increase the capacity of supply and must operate merely, as a heavy and unequal burden
              on all persons mediately or immediately concerned in the printing business.</p>
            <p>Your Memorialists also beg leave respectfully to state that the present duty on the
              importation of Type, affords sufficient encouragement to the manufacture within the
              country, so that they are neither altogether dependent on a foreign nation for their
              supply, nor lie at the mercy of the manufacturers at home.</p>
            <p>Your memorialists forbear trespassing on the patience of the Legislature, and
              conclude with expressing a hope that your honorable body will take the premises into
              serious consideration, and adopt such measures therein as to your wisdom shall seem
              proper. And your memorialists, as in duty bound, will ever pray, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>

          <p>Within two days after Duane's dispatch appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Aurora</hi>,
            it was reprinted in at least three New York newspapers.<ref target="f003.11.15" n="15"
                ><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> The <pb n="003.214"/> following week, the New York
            editors printed the formal reports of the Philadelphia meeting<ref target="f003.11.16"
              n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> and the <hi rend="italic">Daily Advertiser</hi>
            printed a short comment on the proposed duty. It called attention to the long article in
            the <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia Gazette</hi>, and repeated the <hi rend="italic"
              >Gazette's</hi> mistake in thinking that the duty was an <hi rend="italic"
              >additional</hi> twenty per cent.<ref target="f003.11.17" n="17"><hi rend="super"
                >17</hi></ref> By this time the trade, ready to go into action, requested the
            printers and booksellers to meet at the Old Coffee House at seven o'clock, Saturday
            evening, February twenty-seventh.<ref target="f003.11.18" n="18"><hi rend="super"
                >18</hi></ref> According to the official report, Samuel Campbell was chosen chairman
            and George F. Hopkins, secretary. After the circular letter from Philadelphia was read,
            it was unanimously resolved to cooperate with the brethren of Philadelphia, and the
            Union. A petition to the House of Representatives was drafted, adopted, and ordered
              engrossed.<ref target="f003.11.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> The
            unofficial report, however, told a much more interesting story. Cheetham and Denniston's
              <hi rend="italic">American Citizen</hi> published it in the course of an article which
            defended the increase and which stated that Binny and Ronaldson opposed it because it
            would create competitors. According to the <hi rend="italic">Citizen</hi>: <q>The
              meeting consisted of <hi rend="italic">sixteen</hi> printers, booksellers, and <hi
                rend="italic">type importers</hi>. It was with some difficulty that a chairman was
              obtained. Mr. Samuel Campbell was at length prevailed upon to take it, and Mr. George
              F. Hopkins was appointed Secretary. Mr. James Swords opened the business of the
              meeting by reading a letter which he had received from the chairman and secretary of
              the meeting of the printers of Philadelphia. This letter merely stated what they had
              done, and invited their co-operation; it entered not into the merits of the proposed
              additional duty. Mr. Swords then stated that he had mentioned his reception of the
              letter <hi rend="italic">privately</hi> to Mr. <hi rend="italic">Pintard</hi>, (now
              editor of the Daily Advertiser) who had prepared a suitable remonstrance against the
              proposed increase of duty. Mr. Denniston asked for specific information of the nature
              of the meeting&mdash;what the additional duty proposed by the committee of commerce
              and manufacture against which they intended to petition? Mr. Lang, alias Lawyer Lang,
              then rose, and moved that Mr. Denniston should give to himself the information which
              he himself required, and instantly <hi rend="italic">dropt</hi> upon his chair.
              Finding that no information could be given him, Mr. Denniston produced the report of
              the committee of commerce and manufactures in which they propose an additional duty on
              types. This was read by the secretary. The meeting were <pb n="003.215"/> astonished.
              Because Mr. Duane stated that a duty of 20 per cent. would be laid on types, it had
              been conceived by the typo's present, that this meant 20 per cent. <hi rend="italic"
                >additional</hi> duty, which added to the 12&frac12; now paid, makes 32&frac12; per
              cent. Whereas the report proposes an <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> duty of
              7&frac12; per cent. only, which, if added to the 12&frac12; now paid, would make the
              whole duty on types amount to 20 per cent. On this misconception the meeting was
              called. It is probable the Philadelphia meeting laboured under the same error. Mr.
              Denniston examined the subject, and stated two grounds for enquiry. 1st. Whether the
              establishment of foundaries would not benefit the country? 2d. If so, what means ought
              to be adopted to give them efficacy? He was decidedly in favor of the legislature
              affording such aid as would enable us to cast our own types, and concluded that this
              aid ought to consist of an adequately increased duty on the importation of foreign
              types. Mr. James Swords acknowledged the correctness of Mr. Denniston's remarks, but
              was of opinion, that to establish foundaries sufficient to supply our wants was
              impracticable. After a few words in reply from Mr. Denniston, the Chairman very
              gravely, if not very <hi rend="italic">sagely</hi>, informed the meeting that they did
              not come there to <hi rend="italic">discuss</hi> the subject, but to <hi rend="italic"
                >co-operate without discussion</hi> with their brethren of Philadelphia. Mr.
              Campbell and Mr. Swords are both importers of types, and, of course, interested in the
              non-increase of duty. Many of the Philadelphia meeting are also importers. This is
              sufficient to account for <hi rend="italic">their</hi> opposition. Discussion being
              thus closed, Mr. Pintard's memorial was read and passed in the affirmative with the
              exception of Mr. Denniston's vote. The memorial, however, underwent some alteration.
              It was written under the impression that the proposed increase of duty was 20 per
              cent; and as this was viewed as tantamount to a prohibition of the importation of
              foreign types, the memorial was couched in correspondent terms. The error being at
              length discovered it underwent a suitable alteration. The public are left to draw
              their own conclusions from this statement of <hi rend="italic">true facts</hi>.<ref
                target="f003.11.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref></q> Two days later, the
              <hi rend="italic">American Citizen</hi> reprinted Duane's long <hi rend="italic"
              >Aurora</hi> article<ref target="f003.11.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref> and
            on the same day the <hi rend="italic">Evening Post</hi> defended the attack on the duty,
            declaring that the only persons who oppose them are Duane and Cheetham, "two
            foreigners." It concluded with a jeer at Thomas Jefferson as well as at his "protege,"
            Duane: <q>Blest era of philosophism and philanthropy, which knows no distinction between
              natives and foreigners, citizens and aliens, other than forever to give an
              indiscriminate preference to the latter over the former!<ref target="f003.11.22"
                n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref></q></p>
          <p>And so on March 8, 1802, this petition was read in the House of Representatives: </p>
          <pb n="003.216"/>
          <q>
            <p>To the Honorable the House of Representatives of the United States;</p>
            <p>The Memorial of the Printers and Booksellers of the City of New York, respectfully
              sheweth,</p>
            <p>That, thro' the medium of the public papers and private correspondence, your
              memorialists have been informed that a proposition is now before your Honorable House
              for imposing a duty of Twenty per cent. on imported printing Types.</p>
            <p>Conceiving this measure to be highly impolitic in itself, as directly calculated to
              do extensive injury to all persons concerned in printing, and indirectly to tax every
              reader in the United States for the emolument of the few persons who are concerned
                in<ref target="f003.11.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref> the business of
              Type-founding, they trust your Hon. House will not give its sanction to a measure
              which, according to the practical knowledge, and the most diligent inquiry of your
              memorialists, they believe to be founded in error and fraught with extensive
              mischief.</p>
            <p>They beg leave to submit to your Honourable House, that at present there exists but
              one Type-Foundery<ref target="f003.11.24" n="24"><hi rend="super"
              >24</hi></ref>&mdash;in the United States&mdash;that they presume it is wholly out of
              the power of this concern to supply a twentieth part of the demand from printers in
              America: That there are many species of letters not made at this foundery which are
              essentially necessary in order properly to conduct the printing business&mdash;That
              the existing duty of 12 1/2 per cent. on printing types appears to be amply sufficient
              as a <hi rend="italic">protecting</hi> duty to this manufacture, as the Foundery at
              present established in Philadelphia can afford to make and supply Types at a rate
              quite as reasonable as those imported from Europe.</p>
            <p>On these grounds your memorialists respectfully trust that your Honourable House,
              taking the premises into consideration, will not impose a further duty on Printing
              Types, which would almost amount to a prohibition; a result which your memorialists,
              from their professional knowledge and pursuits, are persuaded would operate as a
              public evil, and would materially and injuriously affect the whole business of
              Printing and Bookselling throughout the United States.</p>
            <p>All which is humbly submitted.<lb/> Signed in behalf of the associate meeting of the
              Printers and Booksellers of the City of New York, by</p>

              the City of New York respectfully sheweth . . .</p>
            <p>That your memorialists have been informed, through the medium of the Public Prints,
              that there is a proposition before your Honourable House, to impose a duty of twenty
              per cent. on imported Printing Types.</p>
            <p>Under a full conviction, that every measure entered into by your Honorable House is
              intended to benefit the Union, your memorialists beg leave to suggest the impropriety
              of the proposed duty, and hope to be able to show, that, so far from being a
              beneficial act, it would be highly injurious, not only to your memorialists, but to
              all persons whose occupations are connected with the Printing Business, either as
              Printers, Book-binders or Paper-makers . . .</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">First</hi>---Your memorialists beg leave to state, that the
              addition of 7&frac12; per cent. would almost prohibit the importation of Types; and as
              the business of Type-founding is yet but in its infancy in the United States, (the
              present foundery in Philadelphia not being able to furnish a twentieth part of the
              Type in general use, and being totally destitute of the Oriental, and of almost all
              the ornamental characters) resort must be had to the measure of importing Books; a
              measure which the master-printers and Booksellers of New York, by forming themselves
              into an association, have been patriotically endeavoring to suppress, and which would,
              almost immediately, deprive two thirds of the Journeymen Printers in the United
              States, of their means of subsistence, not to mention the great number of Boys, who
              are at present learning the Printing business, on which they must hereafter depend for
              a livelihood.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Second</hi>---The business of Printing being very expensive to
              establish, from the high price of materials, very few of those, who are obliged to
              resort to journey-work when they become free, ever have it in their power to realize a
              capital sufficient to commence business on their own account; and the contemplated <pb
                n="003.218"/> additional duty, by enlarging the barrier, would still diminish their
              number, to the very great injury of the whole.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Third</hi>---As the characters for Printing Books in the dead
              Languages cannot be had in the United States, nor is it reasonable to expect that they
              will be furnished for forty years to come; and as there are a number of other works
              which cannot be done without European materials, all such characters and materials, at
              least, must, of necessity, be imported from Europe. . . . The consequence would be,
              that the printing of such Books must either be relinquished, or they must be done at
              such an expense, as would render them dearer to purchasers, than those of the same
              kind imported. This would be a severe blow to printing in this country, rising, as it
              now is, rapidly, to excellence:&mdash;and, indeed, in a short time, almost every
              description of Books must be had from Europe; which would not only distress your
              memorialists, in a very severe degree, but destroy, in a great measure, the business
              of Book-binding, and Paper-making, and give a heavy check to the dissemination of
              learning and useful knowledge.</p>
            <p>Your memorialists beg leave, also, respectfully to state, that as no art is more
              conducive to the promotion of learning, liberty and happiness, than that of Printing,
              so it would seem the policy of the government of our country, to leave unshackled
              every article appertaining to it; and as the taking off the duty on Regulus of
              Antimony will be a very considerable encouragement to any foundery that may be
              established in the United States; and as the present Philadelphia foundery has been,
              and must still continue to be liberally encouraged; and, in fact, as Types may be here
              considered as a <hi rend="italic">raw material</hi> to <hi rend="italic">manufacture
                books</hi>; in order to promote the manufacture within ourselves, and thereby to
              prevent the importation of foreign Editions, we humbly submit to your Honourable House
              the propriety of taking off, altogether, the duty on Printing Types, or at least of
              reducing it, so that it may not, in any degree, impede the importation of them; and of
              laying an additional one, even more than equivalent, on imported Books, for the
              encouragement of the printing business. . . . If such encouragement be given, no doubt
              can be entertained of its being fully adequate, in a very few years, to the supply of
              not only the ordinary works of instruction, and amusement, but of the higher order of
              classics. But if shackled in the way which has been proposed in your Honourable House,
              your memorialists foresee an end of enterprize in Printing, and will probably have to
              seek some other means of obtaining subsistence.&mdash;To take off the duty on Types,
              and to lay an additional one on Books, your memorialists deem not only a wise, but a
              necessary measure, as the number of people now employed in the printing business, is
              very large, and is daily increasing.</p>
            <p>Your memorialists beg leave further to remark, that all those who have arrived at any
              degree of eminence in the business of Type-founding in Europe, have so great a share
              of encouragement at home, as to render it highly improbable that any of them would
              emigrate to this country: Therefore we must expect, <pb n="003.219"/> at best, if the
              duty takes place, to have those only (if any should come) who have been but newly
              established, or who might make their first commencement after their arrival here:
              consequently, we should still labor under the heavy disadvantage of having but
              imperfect founderies, and be obliged still to pay the heavy duty; or, which is more
              probable, import the Books which we should be unable to print. And your memorialists
              would add, for the information of those of your Honorable House who may not be
              acquainted with the nature of the Type founding business, or may not have had leisure
              to make sufficient inquiry, that it is such as to require, at, least, from fifteen to
              twenty years, before a foundery can be made in any manner perfect: And the truth of
              this assertion will appear manifest, when it is considered, that the foundery of
              Mesrs. Binney &amp; Ronaldson, in Philadelphia, had been established in Europe for
              several years previous to its removal to this country, which took place at least six
              years ago, and they cannot now furnish a single perfect fount of common Type, owing to
              the labor and time indispensably necessary to cut the matrixes, &amp;c.
              &amp;c.&mdash;</p>
            <p>Independent of these considerations, it must be obvious to all; that if the
              additional duty is laid on, the domestic founders will greatly enhance the price of
              their Types, which must, of course, occasion a rise on all kinds of Printing Work, and
              operate as a tax on every reader; from the student in college, to the peruser of the
              daily newspapers, throughout the United States.&mdash;</p>
            <p>All which is humbly submitted.<lb/> John Clough, President<lb/> Walter W. Hyer, Vice

          <p>With characteristic caution, the Bostonians moved slowly but steadily. The announcement
            of the proposed tariff revision appeared nine days after it was printed in the <hi

              >25</hi></ref> And it was <pb n="003.220"/> not until the ninth of March that a book
            trade meeting voted to present a memorial to Congress.<ref target="f003.11.26" n="26"
                ><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref> Three days later, the Boston Franklin Association
            passed a similar resolution.<ref target="f003.11.27" n="27"><hi rend="super"
              >27</hi></ref> Quite properly, they might have considered their task completed, but
            they continued to keep the public aware of the controversy. Two papers reprinted the
            report of the Committee of Commerce and Manufactures<ref target="f003.11.28" n="28"><hi

          <p>On March 25, 1802, the following resolutions were read in the House of Representatives: </p>
          <q>
            <p>To the Honourable the Senate, and the Honourable the House of Representatives, of the
              United States in Congress assembled.</p>
            <p>The Memorial of the Subscribers, Printers, Booksellers, and others, residing in
              Boston and its Vicinity, most respectfully represents,</p>
            <p>That they have been informed from Sources which they have cause to fear are correct,
              that it is in Contemplation of a Committee of your Honourable Body to propose that a
              considerable additional Duty be laid on the Importation of Printing Types.</p>
            <p>Considering it as a Fact that such is the Intention of your Committee, your
              Memorialists feel themselves necessitated to lay before your honourable Body the
              Reasons which induce them to conceive that the Measure, if adopted, will be oppressive
              to them and injurious to their Country.</p>
            <p>1<hi rend="super">st</hi>. Because at present, they humbly conceive, it would be
              impossible to procure a Supply of Types in the United States, equal to the necessary
              Demand for them; more especially when it is considered that there is a necessity for a
              much greater variety of founts than can be manufactured in America, in order that the
              productions of the American press may hold any reasonable competition with those of
              Europe&mdash;</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="super">d</hi>. Because the additional duty, by enhancing the expense on
              Imported Types, will probably induce the American type founders to advance their
              present prices in proportion to the additional expense of importation; so that, in
              fact, it will be burthening several hundred citizens, and cramping an important and
              interesting manufacture, merely to benefit an individual type foundery, or, at most,
              perhaps only two; the principal of which, has already, we learn, more orders <pb
                n="003.221"/> than it can execute; and which, having no competition, will assume a
              monopoly of the business. On the disadvantages to a community of such monopolies, we
              trust, we need not enlarge.</p>
            <p>3<hi rend="super">d</hi>. Because your memorialists conceive, that the business of
              making types, in the United States, with a suitable capital, can now be carried on to
              more advantage than in Great Britain; for the present charges of importation on them
              amount to about 25 P<hi rend="super">r</hi>.Ct. and the raw materials of which types
              are made, or old type metal, can probably be procured nearly as cheap as in England;
              so that, excepting the extra price of labour, in America, the founders here may now
              command 25 per cent. more for their types, than the same types would cost at the
              European founderies, provided they are equally good.</p>
            <p>4<hi rend="super">th</hi>. Because your memorialists respectfully conceive, that,
              under any circumstances, it is injurious to the public interest, and a discouraging
              precedent, to lay duties on articles used in necessary manufactures, which amount
              nearly to a prohibition, merely to enable individuals to manufacture, and make a large
              profit on any commodity:&mdash;it is, they conceive, oppressing the <hi rend="italic"
                >many</hi> for the benefit of the <hi rend="italic">few</hi>.</p>
            <p>5<hi rend="super">th</hi>. Because your memorialists have been in the habit of
              experiencing under former impost laws, particularly those of Massachusetts previous to
              the establishment of the present government of the United States that printing types
              have been considered as the implements of an important manufacture, and as such
              deserving encouragement, and therefore they have either been admitted to be imported
              free of duty, or considered as a raw material, and subjected to the lowest rate of
              impost only; the Legislators of both the General and State Governments considering, in
              this indulgence, that without such encouragement the art of Printing would be
              embarrassed; that it was important, in a Republican Government, that Books and
              Newspapers should be afforded as low as possible, in order that they may be within the
              means of purchase of every citizen; and that it were much more essential to the
              interests of this country that the means of learning and information should be cheap,
              than that the single business of type-making should be taken under the patronage of
              Government.</p>
            <p>6<hi rend="super">th</hi>. Because, your memorialists conceive, that every measure
              which has a tendency to embarrass the art of Printing, not only discourages
              literature, and increases the expences of educating the rising generation, but is
              essentially injurious, in its operation, to the interests of the Bookinders (<hi
                rend="italic">sic</hi>), Papermakers, and other manufacturers connected with
              them.&mdash;</p>
            <p>7<hi rend="super">th</hi>. Because, we cherish a hope, that there is sufficient
              patriotism in the body of Printers to encourage type founding in America, without any
              restrictive laws;&mdash;and we feel confident, when we assert, that no types will be
              imported, when they can be procured as perfect, and on as good terms, manufactured in
              the United States. The encouragement afforded to the foundery at Philadelphia is a
              proof in point:&mdash;and it is easy to demonstrate, that a number of inconveniences,
                <pb n="003.222"/> / of which procuring imperfections in founts is not the least /
              arise from the importation of types from <hi rend="italic">Europe</hi>. The only plea
              for the additional duty, which has come to the knowledge of your memorialists, is,
              that the price of types in Great Britain will be reduced by the Peace. This we readily
              believe and hope; but we respectfully enquire, will not Peace in Europe also reduce
              the price of labour in the United States; and thus enable the American type founder
              more advantageously to prosecute his business, and if he imports his raw materials
              from Europe, will not their prices also be reduced? especially as we learn with
              pleasure that the duty on antimony is to be taken off.</p>
            <p>8<hi rend="super">th</hi>. Because your memorialists conceive, that such are the
              demands for types on the founderies in Great Britain, and so few the number of those
              founderies therein; that no fears need be entertained that English types will be sent
              to this country, for a market, with a view to injure the American founding: a number
              of your memorialists now find it difficult to have any considerable order
              expeditiously answered at the English founderies. For these reasons, and many others,
              which we trust will readily suggest themselves to your honourable body, your
              memorialists earnestly request, that no additional duty may be laid upon the
              importation of Printing Types. And as in duty bound will ever pray.</p>

              in Congress assembled.</p>
            <p>The subscribers, members of the "Boston Franklin Association," journeymen Printers of
              Boston;&mdash;beg leave with all due respect and consideration, to present the
              following Memorial:&mdash;</p>
            <p>---</p>
            <p>---Placed, by Providence, in a land that fosters the civil and political rights of
              freemen;&mdash;in a country that has built its liberties and happiness upon social
              intercourse, justice, and knowledge;&mdash;and whose citizens enjoy the superior
              privilege, at all times, in a proper manner, to express their sentiments on public
              measures, whether they be actually adopted, or merely proposed:---Considering that
              "such Manufactures as are obviously capable of affording to the United States an
              adequate supply of their several and respective objects, ought to be promoted by the
              aid of Government:"&mdash;but when such domestic Manufactures are not "obviously
              capable" of supplying the various <pb n="003.223"/> and necessary demands of the
              country; should they be so far preferred as to injure the best interests of those
              classes of society, who are, and from existing local circumstances must continue to be
              dependent for some time to come on foreign Manufactures?&mdash;Laudable as is the
              intention of Government, to afford prompt and friendly assistance to our own
              Manufactures, in preference to those of foreign countries; we yet feel confident they
              will first consult their nature, their expediency, and their utility.</p>
            <p>---Fully impressed with these general truths; and having observed that your Committee
              of Commerce and Manufactures have proposed "that it is expedient to impose a duty, in
              future, of 20 per cent. ad valorem on Printing Types;" we should be wanting in justice
              to ourselves, and perhaps to our common country, did we not promptly and respectfully
              remonstrate; and on principles, we trust, that even those who petitioned to have the
              additional duty laid on, cannot, but consent to as just and equitable.</p>
            <p>---Having a perfect knowledge of the relative branches that constitute our
              profession; and of course knowing what materials are necessary to its use, whether for
              elegance, convenience, or durability;&mdash;we feel assured, that the Philadelphia
              Type Foundery could not possibly furnish either the quantity or the quality
              requisite:&mdash;nor could it be able to afford those numerous improvements which we
              may receive from Europe; and which are most essential, not only to our interest, but
              the typographical character of the United States.</p>
            <p>---as well, in our opinion, might an additional or burthensome duty be laid on
              foreign hemp and cotton, because, in some small part of this country, it <hi
                rend="italic">can</hi> be raised:&mdash;Those States, who <hi rend="italic">could
                not</hi> raise the articles, could not feel greater embarrassment or injury, than
              the proposed additional duty on Types would affect Printers, and others
              concerned:&mdash;for as the non-producing States would have to pay whatever price was
              demanded, and the consumers also have to suffer by the inferiority and want of the
              articles;&mdash;in a similar manner the proposed additional duty on Types would affect
              us, and through us the community at large.</p>
            <p>---Whoever <hi rend="italic">is</hi> acquainted with the nature of our business, will
              undoubtedly be fully sensible, that the duty proposed goes to sap if not destroy its
              most respectable and useful existence;&mdash;that, particularly to young men, like us,
              about entering business, after a laborious, and not far above penurious
              apprenticeship, it threatens to annihilate our prospects as future masters and as
              happy and useful members of society:&mdash;while our country itself reaps no essential
              benefit, but actually suffers; perhaps without receiving an honor for maintaining, by
              heavy duty, a trifling and partial manufacture, which, without competitors, would not
              only monopolize to itself; but tend to cause Europeans, who must be acquainted with
              the futility and barreness of our foundery, to encrease their demands;&mdash;and thus
              place our avocation in an impoverished, fatal situation.</p>
            <p>---If our country has derived any glory from the freedom of inquiry <pb n="003.224"/>
              permitted; if it has become, like Rome and Athens, celebrated for its general
              literature; if, in short, knowledge ought not to be taxed, and its circulation thereby
              impeded, if not annihilated:&mdash;then your Memorialists conceive, that they, the
              promulgators, ought not to suffer in an occupation, so necessary, and so
              important;&mdash;particularly as their materials were formerly free of all duty, and
              merely considered as the tools of mechanics.</p>
            <p>---From these considerations, and others too numerous to particularize; your
              Memorialists humbly pray and hope, That the proposed additional duty on foreign
              printing Types, be not laid on, as recommended.</p>

          <p>As soon as the notice of the Philadelphia meeting reached Baltimore, it was printed
            with the following paragraph appended: <q>As no time ought to be lost in arresting the
              progress of a bill which aims so deadly a blow at one of the most flourishing mechanic
              arts in this country, those interested in this city should be early in co-operating
              with their brethren of Philadelphia. A meeting therefore of the printers, booksellers,
              paper-makers, book-binders and stationers, of this city, is requested at James
              Bryden's Fountain Inn, on Friday evening next at 6 o'clock&mdash;All of whom will,
              more immediately or remotely, be affected by the operation of the contemplated
                duty.<ref target="f003.11.30" n="30"><hi rend="super">30</hi></ref></q> At the
            meeting, Samuel Butler, Vincent Bonsal, and Matthew Brown were appointed to prepare a
            memorial for approval the following evening.<ref target="f003.11.31" n="31"><hi
                rend="super">31</hi></ref> After it was approved, it was set up in type and
            forwarded to Congress in print, the only one presented in this fashion. It was read in
            the House of Representatives on March 8, 1802: </p>

            <p><hi rend="italic">To the Hon. the</hi> Senate <hi rend="italic">and</hi> House <hi
                rend="italic">of</hi> Representatives <hi rend="italic">of the</hi></p>
            <p>United States <hi rend="italic">of</hi> America;</p>
            <p>The Subscribers, Printers and others, of the City of Baltimore, who feel themselves
              affected by the additional duty which they learn is contemplated to be laid on
              imported Printing Types,</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Beg leave respectfully to represent</hi>,</p>
            <p>That in the opinion of your Memorialists, any further duty on the Implements of
              Printing would at this time be impolitic, inasmuch as it would encrease the already
              too great embarrassments to young beginners in the manufacture of Books; and unjust,
              inasmuch as it would tax the many for the benefit of the few (for a mere individual)
              and oppress those whose taste, genius and exertions in a science, if such it may be
              termed, still in its infancy, have produced specimens of correctness and elegance in
              the new world, which begin to form a competition with the works of the long
              established and extensive printing houses of the old&mdash;That to encrease the
              present difficulty of obtaining those implements absolutely requisite, and which in
              the printing business are more expensive than perhaps in any other, and require even
              under present circumstances a considerable capital, will be to many, a serious
              interdiction of the trade, and must force the country for a long time to depend for
              the Book already <hi rend="italic">made and bound</hi>, upon those, who in a little
              while, with proper encouragement to the Press, can furnish only the <hi rend="italic"
                >tools</hi> wherewith to make it.</p>
            <p>To check the progress of an art already sufficiently embarrassed, would also, your
              Memorialists believe, materially injure other and essential branches too, of mechanics
              in this country&mdash;those of the paper-maker, of the book-binder and of the
              skin-dresser. Nor could the book-seller repair the injury done <hi rend="italic"
                >him</hi>, even by supplying himself from abroad with those school and common books,
              which the manufacturer now furnishes him with at home.</p>
            <p>Your Memorialists would request your serious attention to the following
              facts,&mdash;facts which they hope will have their due influence with your honorable
              body: On a moderate computation there are nearly one thousand printing houses in the
              United States, which, notwithstanding the great number of hands they employ&mdash;the
              vast quantity of paper they consume&mdash;and the constant supply of various sized
              types they require&mdash;are able to raise but a feeble mound against the flood of
              imported literature, which threatens to inundate the country. To supply even those
              offices with type, not to mention others daily establishing, there is but one
              foundery* in operation on this extensive quarter of the globe&mdash;and this but a
              partial one, since not half of the various denominations and sizes of types used in
              our mother tongue are cast at it; and not one of the Greek, Oriental and numerous
              other characters. To erect other founderies, or to complete the present, much taste
              and many years application are requisite, whilst in the mean time old established
              founderers will scarcely be induced by the proposed duty, to remove from Europe to
              this country. From a correct view of the consequences <pb n="003.226"/> of a
              dependence on this foundery, or on others which may be established, for that supply of
              implements which the business daily requires, your honorable body will be fully able
              to judge whether the apprehensions of your Memorialists be not well founded.</p>
            <p>The foundery at Philadelphia, it is, however, the interest of the country, it is the
              interest of the printer to encourage, as far as it can be done consistently with the
              prosperity of thousands, which should never be sacrificed to the aggrandizement of any
              individual&mdash;and encouraged it has been, as the proprietors themselves acknowledge
              by the multiplicity of their business and the handsome property they have already
              acquired&mdash;Nor can it arise from a want of patronage, that the money must be
              deposited with them in advance, at the time of sending an order, although the type,
              from the great demand, cannot be furnished for many months after. The desire of your
              petitioners, for the further prosperity and extension of this foundery shall prevent
              them, although there is but too much room, from drawing an injurious comparison
              between the durability, symmetry and requisite finish of the type cast there, and of
              that which is procured from abroad.</p>
            <p>To tax then, the industry, genius and enterprize of so useful a class of
              manufacturers as Printers confessedly are, by an exorbitant addition to an impost,
              already heavy, on the only implements almost with which the manufacture can be carried
              on, would inevitably be to encourage the importation of literature from
              abroad&mdash;to cause a great rise on foreign as well as domestic made books&mdash; to
              injure if not ruin, a young and flourishing art with its dependencies among
              us&mdash;to multiply the obstacles to knowledge&mdash;and to strengthen the empire of
              ignorance and vice.</p>
            <p>Your Memorialists pray your honorable body to excuse their prolixity on a subject
              which few, except professional men, can sufficiently know or appreciate.</p>
            <p>Note. There is a small foundery at Germantown, which casts German letter only.</p>

            <p>The Memorial of the Subscribers, printers, booksellers, &amp; Stationers, in the City
              of Charleston,</p>
            <p>Respectfully sheweth,</p>
            <p>That it is with concern your memorialists learn, that your honorable body have it in
              contemplation to lay an additional duty on Printing Types, imported into the United
              States; which, when laid, will be equal to 20 p cent on the Cost; and that this will
              be done under the idea of giving encouragement to the manufacturers of Types in the
              United States.&mdash;Your Memorialists beg leave to assure your honorable body, that
              if they thought this Idea was well founded, &amp; they could believe that the
              different fonts of Types used in their Business, could be obtained in the United
              States, it would give them great satisfaction to find encouragement, in the way
              proposed, given to the manufactures of their country; but knowing that at this time,
              there are not founderies amongst us that can furnish the twentieth part of the
              existing demand, they can <pb n="003.228"/> view the intended additional duty in no
              other light than an act that will distress your memorialists, and all others concerned
              in the business of Printing, Bookselling, &amp;c. and not add to the general good of
              the Country. Your memorialists beg leave also to observe to your honorable body, that
              while duties on almost every species of merchandise will fall but lightly on
              individuals, being borne by the great mass of consumers, duties on mechanical
              Implements, coming out of the pocket of the laborious artisan alone, must tend to
              check the progress of trade, and damp the incentives to industry.&mdash;Therefore they
              pray that your honorable body will not agree to the proposed additional duty on
              Types.</p>
            <p>And your memorialists, as in duty bound, will pray.</p>

            the Committee of the Whole House, each of the above petitions, when read, was also
            referred to the Committee of the Whole House. On December 14, 1802, these petitions were
            referred to the Committee of Commerce and Manufactures. The committee reported back on
            February 21, 1803, when the House, adopting their report, resolved that <q>the Secretary

            which were to come, this one had been successful.</p>

          <p>THERE ARE TIMES WHEN A WRITER FINDS HIM-SELF with the leisure time and the inclination
            to burrow among the artifacts of his literary past. During his sixty-fifth year. James
            Kirke Paulding began "rummaging" among his old manuscripts. What he found were yellowed
            and mutilated copies of poems written during his youth and middle age&mdash;"careless"
            verses, he rightly called some of them. Largely to amuse himself, Paulding transcribed
            into a copybook a large number of these poems and, as the alterations reveal, he later
            busied himself with polishing and revising some of them. To the collection he added some
            poems newly written.</p>
          <p>With the instincts of a writer, Paulding carefully provided his copybook with a
            preface. Because it is brief and because it gives some indication of his attitude toward
            his poetry, it deserves quotation in its entirety. </p>
          <q>
            <p>In rummaging among my old Manuscripts, I came across the following careless, and
              occasionally, mutilated, copies of verses, written at various and distant periods, and
              most of them long since forgotten. I have amused my leisure hours in copying them
              here, rather as indications of the progress of my feelings and of past events of my
              youth than as compositions worthy of being preserved. They may serve as memorials to
              my children, of me, the progress of whose life without being checquered by any
              remarkable events, has been regularly onwards from Poverty and obscurity to competent
              independence and honourable distinction. I am now drawing near its close anticipating
              little and fearing less here, for the result of my various experience has satisfied me
              how small a portion of <pb n="003.230"/> our real, substantial happiness, is derived
              from the gratification of vanity, ambition, or avarice.</p>
            <p>JKP.<lb/> New York 1843<lb/> P. S. A few of these pieces have been published in
              Periodicals.</p>
          </q>
          <p>Paulding was a little pessimistic in thinking that he was drawing near the close of his
            life. He was to live seventeen years more, until his eighty-second year, and was to
            publish three more volumes.</p>
          <p>Perhaps because of his modest view of the literary value of his poems, Paulding did not
            seek to collect them in printed form. Certainly his literary reputation is built upon
            prose in many forms&mdash;humorous essays, satirical sketches, short stories, biography,
            drama, patriotic and sectional writings. He published only two volumes of poetry, the
            satirical <hi rend="italic">Lay of the Scottish Fiddle</hi> in 1813 and the long
            narrative <hi rend="italic">Backwoodsman</hi> in 1818. Nonetheless, throughout his life
            he continued to experiment with verse.</p>
          <p>No adequate survey has been made of Paulding as poet. The first book-length study of
            Paulding was his son William's slipshod memoir-anthology, <hi rend="italic">Literary
              Life of James K. Paulding</hi> (1867). William Paulding quotes several short poems and
            excerpts longer ones, actually giving a whole chapter to <hi rend="italic">The
              Backwoodsman</hi>, but he provides no critical estimate of his father as a poet.<ref
              target="f003.12.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> In <hi rend="italic">James
              Kirke Paulding, Versatile American</hi> (1926), Dr. Amos L. Herold gives little
            attention to the poetry and he lists only a handful of single poems. A study of
            Paulding's verse&mdash;its subject matter and technique&mdash;yet remains to be done. A
            prior task is to locate and call attention to his fugitive poems, scattered though they
            are. Inasmuch as Paulding's copybook of 1843 is still preserved and available, this
            forms a logical starting point for such a study.<ref target="f003.12.02" n="2"><hi
                rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
          <pb n="003.231"/>
          <p>Of the seventy-three<ref target="f003.12.02a" n="2a"><hi rend="super">2a</hi></ref>
            poems in the copybook, forty-five bear dates of composition, and these range from 1798
            (Paulding's twentieth year) to 1843 (his sixty-fifth year).<ref target="f003.12.03"
              n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> The largest number of these dated poems falls
            within Paulding's twenties. There are twenty-two written during these years, ten during
            his thirties, seven during his forties. As one might expect from a young romantic, the
            earlier poems are on the subjects of love and death; but gradually he began to write
            about the literary scene, about America, and about persons whom he knew.</p>
          <p>Many types of poetry and subject matter are represented. A large number are lyrics.
            Many are love poems and the names of women are frequent. Some are elegiac and of the
            graveyard school. Many are conventionally moral in tone. A few, such as "Lament of the
            Faithless Shepherdess," show the pastoral influence. Several are appreciations of
            natural beauty, including Niagara and the Hudson river. Two of the poems are highly
            critical of N. P. Willis and John Jacob Astor; some are on human foibles in general. One
            criticizes the ubiquitous English traveller as a "creature of arrogance, folly,
            conceit." There are several on patriotic themes: "The Stripes and Stars," a criticism of
            the "national apathy" during the War of 1812, a poem welcoming Texas into the Union. A
            few are concerned with national letters, literary critics, and "these dull prosy times."
            In length the poems range from mere moralizing couplets to the long, 810-line narrative
            poem, "The Pilgrim and His Guide," apparently written to illustrate how the easterner's
            materialistic greed can lead to personal tragedy on the hostile western plains.</p>
          <p>It is the writer's immediate purpose only to describe this manuscript volume, to place
            on record a briefly annotated list of its contents, and to record such periodical
            printings of these poems as he has been able to identify for the first time. Of the
            seventy-three <pb n="003.232"/> poems, one of them (number 22 in the check-list) may not

          <p>In the following listing, the titles are given exactly, but no attempt has been made to
            follow Paulding's capitalization. Following each title are the following data: the date
            (when indicated in the copybook), the total number of lines of each poem, and the
            copybook page on which the poem appears. The first line is given for each poem. For
            those poems whose periodical publication has been discovered, the wording of the printed
            title has been added when a variant occurs. In those cases in which the number of lines
            in the printed poem differs, the number of printed lines is recorded. Following the

              on July 4, 1853. The printed program distributed at this ceremony gives no reference
              to Paulding's poem or to Paulding's presence. Major John Andr&eacute; was apprehended
              in 1780 by three men, one of whom was John Paulding, a relative of James Kirke
              Paulding. Andre was executed as a spy. This Paulding poem is another addition to the

            <p>It is obvious that W. I. Paulding did not use the 1843 copybook (as we shall call
              this ms., using the date of the preface). He refers to one poem (number 41 in the
              check-list) as the earliest piece of his father's writing he has found. Had he
              possessed this copybook, he would have seen a poem (number 42 in the check-list)
              written a year earlier. W. I. Paulding does mention (page 43) "an early Commonplace
              book" from which he prints a poem found there as a newspaper clipping. He estimates
              its date as "about 1810" and prints it as "no doubt" of his father's authorship. It is
              a highly doubtful attribution. The copybook mentioned cannot be the present one: see
              no. 71 below.</p>

            <p>The Paulding copybook came into the possession of Dr. Godfrey F. Singer and upon his
              untimely death became a part of the Singer Memorial Collection presented to the
              University of Pennsylvania Library. The volume is a typical nineteenth century
              copybook&mdash;a volume of blank pages bound in boards, with an engraved title page
              reading simply "Album . . ." It measures 7 7/8 by 9 13/16 inches and contains 109
              numbered pages. (Pagination through page 55 is in ink, entered apparently by the
              author, and continued in pencil by another hand. Certain verso pages which are blank
              are not numbered. A loose sheet of letter paper, inserted at the back of the volume,
              is numbered 110.) I am indebted to the University of Pennsylvania for permission to
              publish this study.</p>

          <p>The antagonism that existed so strongly between the theatre and various religious
            groups during the Elizabethan and Stuart periods, and which achieved its strongest
            expression, perhaps, in Prynne's <hi rend="italic">Histriomastix</hi> and in such plays
            as <hi rend="italic">The Puritan</hi>, may cause us to overlook a minor but definite
            countertendency of the theatre to play up to the religious interests of a part of the
            populace. In the earlier decades of the era, mystery and morality plays, though no
            longer as once under the aegis of the church, remained as reminders to us of the
            religious origin of the English theatre. We know that down into the 'eighties such plays
            continued, in diminished numbers, to be written and produced. And from 1590 on, in a
            theatre increasingly secular and especially anti-Puritan, there were occasional plays
            that, in whole or in major part, showed a desire in the writers and producers of plays
            for a raprochement with the bourgeois, church-going elements of the community.</p>
          <p>As examples of the tendency we may name Greene and Lodge's <hi rend="italic">A
              Looking-glass for London and England</hi> (printed 1594); <hi rend="italic">Sir John
              Oldcastle</hi>, by Drayton and others (1600); <hi rend="italic">Thomas Lord
              Cromwell</hi> (1602); Heywood's <hi rend="italic">If You Know Not Me You Know
              Nobody</hi> (1605); Rowley's <hi rend="italic">When You See Me You Know Me</hi>
            (1605); Dekker and Massinger's <hi rend="italic">The Virgin Martyr</hi> (1622);
            Shakespeare and Fletcher's <hi rend="italic">Henry VIII</hi> (1623); Heywood's <hi
              rend="italic">England's Elizabeth</hi> (1631); his <hi rend="italic">Life and Death of
              Queen Elizabeth</hi> (1639); and Shirley's <hi rend="italic">The Martyred Soldier</hi>
            (1638). In the long roll of lost plays there are a number that, judging by their titles,
            must belong to the same group. All or a substantial part of the following plays must
            have been, at least, not utterly repugnant to religious-minded people: <hi rend="italic"
              >Pope Joan</hi> (produced ca. 1580-1592); <hi rend="italic">Abraham and Lot</hi> (ca.
            1580-1594); Haughton's <hi rend="italic">The English Fugitives</hi> (? 1600); <hi
              rend="italic">Judas</hi> (1601-2); Rowley's <hi rend="italic">Joshua</hi> (1602);
            Dekker and Munday's <hi rend="italic">Jephtha</hi> (1602); and <hi rend="italic"
              >Samson</hi> (1602). It may be argued, of course, that these plays could not have been
            very popular or successful, or they would not <pb n="003.242"/> have been lost; but
            their mere existence is enough to demonstrate that the minor tendency was present. The
            period from 1606 to 1621, when no such play is recorded as printed or produced except by
            such frankly religious groups as that of St. Omers, is the longest hiatus before the
            closing of the theatres.<ref target="f003.13.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref></p>
          <p>Among plays of this sort, and perhaps as good an example of the type as we shall find,
            is <hi rend="italic">The Duchess of Suffolk</hi>, by Thomas Drue, produced at the
            Fortune Theatre in 1623, and printed in 1631.<ref target="f003.13.02" n="2"><hi
                rend="super">2</hi></ref> It is a historical drama, and like most of that sort, it
            appeals strongly to community pride; but the community in this case is not the nation,
            primarily, but the strongly Protestant left wing of the English Church&mdash;the
            moderate Puritans.</p>
          <p>There is also a very strong vein of local interest in the play and its production in
            1623. The Fortune Theatre stood in Golden Lane, Cripplegate. Scarcely a stone's throw
            away stood the Barbican, the home of the Duchess and the scene of the first part of the
            play. An ancient watchtower rebuilt into a residence, the house stood near the corner of
            Red Cross street and what was later known as Barbican street. It had been a possession
            of the holders of the Suffolk title since the time of Edward III. As late as 1599,
            Peregrine Bertie, the son of the Duchess, bequeathed to his son a parcel of land on this
            street, possibly including the old residence. The Barbican was in a state of ruin in
            1682, but did not entirely disappear until late in the 18th century. In its later years
            it was known as Willoughby House, possibly to distinguish it from the street.<ref
              target="f003.13.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> In Dryden's day the locality
            was given over to brothels.<ref target="f003.13.04" n="4"><hi rend="super"
            >4</hi></ref></p>
          <p>The players at the Fortune were the Palsgrave's Company. They had been under the
            protection of the German princeling Frederick V, Elector of the Rhenish Palatinate,
            since 1612, when he had come to England to marry the Princess Elizabeth; and they
            remained under his aegis until 1631. During all this time the Fortune was their special
            theatre; it burned and was rebuilt (1621-23); it was the scene of riots; the players
            left it on occasion for excursions in the provinces. But through all their existence as
            the Palsgrave's Company the Fortune was their center and their home.<ref
              target="f003.13.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref></p>
          <p>The Palsgrave, as the king of Poland, is one of the characters in the play, <hi
              rend="italic">The Duchess of Suffolk</hi>. Presumably the players thus honored their
            patron by presenting a flattering portrait of his predecessor. The Palsgrave's residence
            is not known, but his son Prince Rupert is said to have lived in Barbican Street.</p>
          <pb n="003.243"/>
          <p>Thomas Deloney, the ballad maker whose version of the Duchess' story, as we shall show,
            influenced the play, lived in Cripplegate.<ref target="f003.13.06" n="6"><hi
                rend="super">6</hi></ref> And John Foxe the martyrologist, from whose <hi
              rend="italic">Acts and Monuments</hi> the material for the play is chiefly drawn, from
            1570 to his death in 1587 had owned a house in Grub street, an easy stroll from the
            theatre, and was buried in St. Giles, which fronts Red Cross street in the same
            neighborhood. The play, then, knits together a number of neighborhood interests.</p>
          <p>The lady whose adventures are the subject of the play was the historical Katharine,
            Dowager Duchess of Suffolk, born in 1519. She was the daughter of Lord Willoughby and of
            Mary de Salinas, a Spanish Lady of the court of Henry VIII. At her father's death in
            1526 she became Baroness of Willoughby. Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, became her
            guardian, and married her in 1533. She was the Duke's fourth wife, and by him she had
            two sons. The Duke died in 1545, and the two boys in 1551. Richard Bertie, the Duchess'
            second husband, whom she married in 1553, was the son of a prosperous stonemason who,
            like Shakespeare's father, became a gentleman by act of the College of Heralds when his
            son came up in the world. Richard was a graduate of Oxford, reputed to be an
            accomplished student of French, Italian, and Latin, and a man of tact and ability. He
            had been the Duchess' gentleman usher. In the later period of his life he was a member
            of Parliament for Lincolnshire.<ref target="f003.13.07" n="7"><hi rend="super"
              >7</hi></ref></p>
          <p>There can be little doubt that the character named Foxe, who opens the play, was
            intended to represent the martyrologist. In a play in which practically every character
            is historical, which is based on his own book and set and produced in his own old
            neighborhood, it could scarcely be otherwise. The record of Foxe's ordination as a
            deacon indicates that he was a tutor in the household of the Duchess in 1550.<ref
              target="f003.13.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> But Foxe, the Duchess' servant
            in the play, who envies Bertie's good fortune but goes into exile with his master and
            mistress, has little in common with his historical counterpart. Drue lavished more
            attention upon him, however, than upon any other minor character in the play, and made
            him an individual with more than a spark of life in him. He becomes the chief instrument
            of the Providence that watched over the Duchess. That the sober, studious, godly Foxe
            should be shown as worshipping his Protestant heroine, foiling the villainous prelates,
            and smoothing the path of Protestant exile might be taken, not too cynically, as an
            allegory of the effect of his book upon the Protestant world. At the very least, this is
            neither the first nor the last time that Foxe the man has been misunderstood. Almost any
            history of English literature will serve as another example.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">The Duchess of Suffolk</hi> comes near the end of a surprisingly long
            list of plays <pb n="003.244"/> whose plots, in whole or in part, are drawn from the
            pages of Foxe.<ref target="f003.13.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> In this case,
            the entire plot, with only minor modifications, is from the <hi rend="italic">Acts and
              Monuments</hi>. Indeed, the play's indebtedness to Foxe is so obvious that its source
            was probably known and recognized from the beginning. The story of the Duchess' exile on
            the continent during Mary's reign was not reported in the 1563 edition&mdash; the first
            in English&mdash;of the "Book of Martyrs." The only reference to it occurs in a marginal
            note on page 1680: "Lady Francis, Duchess of Suffolk, who hazarding bothe life, lands,
            and so great possessions fled her countrey with her husband in cause of her conscience."
            Foxe, or more probably the translator who Englished his 1559 Latin version, had confused
            the Dowager Duchess with her stepdaughter.<ref target="f003.13.10" n="10"><hi
                rend="super">10</hi></ref> The detailed story was inserted, when the book was
            revised for the second (1570) edition, among other accounts dealing with "divers saved
            by God's providence"&mdash;persons who, in spite of strong Protestant sympathies, had
            survived Mary's reign by one means or another.<ref target="f003.13.11" n="11"><hi
                rend="super">11</hi></ref> It remained substantially unchanged in succeeding
            editions. The <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi> asserts, quite
            plausibly but without offering any proof, that the account was written by Richard
              Bertie.<ref target="f003.13.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> The whole story
            is copied, word for word, by Holinshed's editors in the second edition of the <hi
              rend="italic">Chronicles</hi>.<ref target="f003.13.13" n="13"><hi rend="super"
              >13</hi></ref></p>
          <p>Foxe's account tells of the Duchess' flight with her husband and children to escape the
            enmity of Bishop Gardiner. They made their way by slow stages, suffering hardships and
            meeting many adventures, to Poland. There they were befriended by the king and allowed
            to remain in security until the death of Mary made their return to England possible.</p>
          <p>The story of the Duchess' wanderings had been made into a ballad by Thomas Deloney, and
            published in 1602 or earlier.<ref target="f003.13.14" n="14"><hi rend="super"
              >14</hi></ref> Deloney had taken some liberties with the story as told in Foxe, and it
            is possible, as a result, to say with certainty that the dramatist Drue knew and used
            the ballad version as well as Foxe's book. Drue follows Deloney rather than Foxe in
            including an attack by thieves on the Duchess and her party. Foxe has nothing of this.
            Foxe had told of the party's taking refuge in the church-porch at Wesel; Deloney added
            that the sexton came and tried to drive them out. Bertie "wrung the churchkeys <pb
              n="003.245"/> out of his hand," and beat the drunken janitor over the head with them.
            This incident also is used by Drue.</p>
          <p>Deloney also had told of the son, Peregrine, born to the duchess during the early days
            of the exile, and had named the daughter, Susan, a babe in arms at the time of their
            flight, who afterward became Countess of Kent. These facts are used in the play, and
            Drue may have taken them from the ballad. But it is highly probable that Drue had later
            and more direct sources of information about the personages in the Willoughby
            family.</p>
          <p>The influence of the <hi rend="italic">Acts and Monuments</hi> upon the play is not
            confined to Foxe's story of the Duchess' flight and exile. Latimer, Ridley, and Cranmer,
            Marian martyrs, and Dr. Sands, an exile, appear on the stage. Sands, with little effect
            on the plot but with much damage to his academic and ecclesiastical dignity, is pursued
            onto and off the stage so often as to become ridiculous. Foxe's story of Dr. Sands is
            told a few pages after that of the Duchess, but the two stories are not connected.
            Historically, Sands and Katharine were friends, and they may have met on the continent.
            The connection may have been suggested to the dramatist by this sentence in Foxe: "Dr.
            Sands . . . conveyed himself by night to one master Bartly's [i.e., Bertie's?] house, a
            stranger, who was in the Marshalsea prison with him for a while; he was a good
            Protestant, and dwelt in Mark-lane."<ref target="f003.13.15" n="15"><hi rend="super"
                >15</hi></ref> But Bertie was not a "stranger," never was in prison, and did not
            live in Mark lane. In one speech in the play Sands is called Saunders; a man of that
            name, according to Foxe,<ref target="f003.13.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref>
            had been Sands' prison-mate. These minor elements of the play are confused and
            confusing, but the whole complex suggests the hack-dramatist searching out details to
            fill up his scenes without too much regard for verisimilitude where his main character
            is not concerned.</p>
          <p>Latimer, Ridley, and Cranmer are introduced in the fourth act, where the dramatist
            compresses into a single scene the stories of the three martyrs. These he would have
            found in great detail in Foxe.<ref target="f003.13.17" n="17"><hi rend="super"
              >17</hi></ref> Historically, the Duchess was a staunch friend of Latimer, and some of
            his volumes of sermons are dedicated to her. Presumably the playwright's purpose in
            bringing in these characters is to show dramatically what the Duchess escaped by her
            flight, and perhaps also to associate her more closely with the main stream of
            historical events. But the connection is not made obvious in the drama, and the
            playwright lost a real opportunity to knit his story more closely together when he
            failed to bring Latimer into an earlier and more organic association with the main plot.
            To make room for him, Sands could have been eliminated entirely; he is never necessary
            to the action. One suspects he is present because a part had to be made for one of the
            comedians of the company. Perhaps the groundlings would have been less pleased, but the
            development of Latimer's part and the exclusion of <pb n="003.246"/> Sands would have
            caused less pain to the Muse of History than she suffers from other things in the play.
            The burning of Cranmer's hand, for instance, is distorted completely out of its true
            significance to provide a momentary dramatic sensation.</p>

          <p>In a paper read before the Bibliographical Evidence group at the meeting of the Modern
            Language Association in Chicago in 1945 I made the point that careful bibliographical
            analysis of the text of Thomas Middleton's <hi rend="italic">A Mad World</hi>, <hi
              rend="italic">My Masters</hi>,<ref target="f003.14.01" n="1"><hi rend="super"
              >1</hi></ref> 1608, along with a study of Middleton's scribal habits, might afford a
            more generally satisfactory explanation of the aberrations in the quarto than the
            previously held theory of revision.</p>
          <p>The publication since then of F. T. Bowers' article, "An Examination of the Method of
            Proof Correction in Lear,"<ref target="f003.14.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>
            has led me to believe that the analysis of the composition and printing of <hi
              rend="italic">A Mad World</hi> might be interesting in its own right, apart from its
            application to the editorial problem; for the first five sheets of the play were printed
            with three skeletons used in a pattern somewhat different from that in <hi rend="italic"
              >Lear</hi>. To complicate matters a bit, no variant formes in <pb n="003.247"/> these
            sheets appear in the nine copies of the first edition which I have collated.</p>
          <p>Incidentally, the two compositors of the first five sheets were accomplished workmen,
            one of whom set almost all the type for these first sheets&mdash;all but D1-4 and E3v-4.
            The point is significant because apparently a single compositor was not pressed for time
            in setting all the type for sheets A, B, and C.</p>
          <p>Some of the phenomena to be detailed here are sufficiently similar to those in <hi
              rend="italic">Lear</hi> to recommend comparison, and sufficiently different to prove
            puzzling and perhaps enlightening. To facilitate comparison, I have used in the
            following table the same system of indicating running-title transfers that was used by
            Bowers. <!-- <figure entity="sb032471"/> -->
          </p>
          <p>Several oddities deserve special comment, if only as a warning to future students of
            running-titles used as bibliographical evidence. As indicated in the above table two
            slightly different titles are used on A4<hi rend="super">v</hi>. Printing starts with
            title IIIa, found in copies of the play in the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Bodleian,
            the Folger, the Huntington, and the New York Public Library. <pb n="003.248"/> After a
            considerable number of copies had been printed the broken initial A was replaced by a
            better one, but the rest of the running-title was not changed. The title in its improved
            form, IIIb, appears on A4<hi rend="super">v</hi> in the copies of the play in the
            British Museum, Harvard, the Library of Congress, and the Boston Public Library.
            Thereafter title IIIb appears in all copies on B3<hi rend="super">v</hi> and C3<hi
              rend="super">v</hi>, after which it is rejected.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile what is apparently the rejected initial A from IIIa re-appears in a new title
            on B4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, labeled now IXa, which is used again on C4<hi rend="super"
              >v</hi> and then set aside temporarily. It appears again on E4<hi rend="super">v</hi>
            but its broken initial A is replaced almost immediately, quite by chance by what is
            apparently the same initial A which had replaced it in title III. Title IXa is found
            only in the British Museum copy.</p>
          <p>The notable fact, it seems to me, is that these pages are invariant except for the
            changed letter in the running-titles. If these pages were proofed, as their general
            excellence suggests, what sort of proofing before printing might allow the broken
            running-title to escape notice? That there was ample time for proofing in the first five
            sheets of the play is obvious when we study the probable order of the formes through the
            press.</p>
          <p>The cumulative effect of admittedly inconclusive evidence leads me to believe that the
            outer formes of both sheet A and sheet B preceded their inner formes through the press.
            If inner B had been imposed and run before outer B, we should be obliged to account for
            the delay occasioned by the use in inner B of running-titles from both formes of A. This
            demands the assumption that sheet A was completed at the end of a working day, in which
            event both skeletons should have been ready for normal transfer to their respective
            quarters in the formes of B.</p>
          <p>Instead we find new running-titles used in outer B, one of them with the previously
            discarded broken A. Apparently outer B was imposed before either skeleton of A was ready
            for transfer. Then while outer B printed white paper, the running-titles and furniture
            from both formes of A were used in inner B.</p>
          <p>Similarly, if inner A had been first run, its running-titles would presumably have been
            first ready for transfer to inner B, in which case normal transfer of running-titles
            would have placed title IV on B3<hi rend="super">v</hi> instead of on B1<hi rend="super"
              >v</hi>, and title V on B4 instead of on B2. But if outer A was first run, first
            rinsed, and first stripped, normal transfer would place title II on B4 and title IIIb on
              B3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, which is precisely where they are used. This conjecture,
            unfortunately, leaves the puzzle of why title I from A2<hi rend="super">v</hi> was not
            used. I suspect that by the time the workman was ready to impose B1<hi rend="super"
              >v</hi> and B2 he had available the running-titles from the two adjacent type pages of
            inner A, which he preferred to use rather than the single remaining running-title from
            outer A plus another odd one.</p>
          <p>It seems likely, then, that the order of formes through the press thus far was outer A,
            inner A, outer B, inner B; and the pattern of running-title transfers <pb n="003.249"/>
            could be indicated as follows: set X, set Y, set Z, set XY, or three different sets plus
            a fourth composed of parts of the first two.</p>
          <p>This last point may seem unduly labored; the reason for the insistence lies in the odd
            repetition of that same pattern in sheets C and D, though of course the running-titles
            used in inner and outer C are not newly set.</p>
          <p>The outer forme of C uses the titles from outer B, and is presumably first printed, to
            be followed by inner C, which uses three titles from inner B plus one new one. The new
            title can be plausibly accounted for if we assume that imposition of outer C was begun
            after outer B had been rinsed and stripped. But when the imposition of inner C was
            begun, the skeleton of inner B was not quite ready for transfer. Overlooking the
            set-aside running-title from A2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, the compositor set a new one and
            imposed C1<hi rend="super">v</hi>. By the time he had completed that task the inner
            forme of B had been rinsed and stripped and its running-titles were available for normal
            transfer.</p>
          <p>The situation in sheet D is similar. Outer D, like outer B, uses in effect a new
            skeleton, though two running-titles previously set aside from A2<hi rend="super">v</hi>
            and B1<hi rend="super">v</hi> form part of the skeleton. Composition is again far ahead
            of presswork; the outer forme of D is imposed with a new skeleton, and the inner forme
            of D is being imposed shortly before the outer forme of C has been rinsed. Rejecting the
            broken title IXa, the compositor imposes three quarters of the inner forme of D, making
            two normal transfers from C3 to D4 and from C1 to D2, and one unusual transfer from
              C2<hi rend="super">v</hi> to D3<hi rend="super">v</hi> instead of to D1<hi
              rend="super">v</hi>. By this time the inner forme of C has been rinsed and is
            available. The normal transfer of running-title from C1<hi rend="super">v</hi> to D1<hi
              rend="super">v</hi> completes the imposition of the inner forme of D.</p>
          <p>It will be noted that inner D might have been imposed entirely with the skeleton from
            outer C, had the broken running-title not been rejected. It remains a fact,
            nevertheless, that the inner forme of D uses running-titles from both formes of C, thus
            completing the cycle of four sets as in sheets A and B with the same pattern, X, Y, Z,
            XY.</p>
          <p>Laboring the point may be wasted effort, especially when one cannot explain exactly why
            the pattern exists; the point is made because it suggests that sheets B and D were
            completed at the end of a working day and immediately calls attention to a somewhat
            similar pattern in <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>.<ref target="f003.14.03" n="3"><hi
                rend="super">3</hi></ref></p>
          <p>In any case, composition was well ahead of presswork, the new compositor at work in D
            is not needed to relieve any pressure, and the compositor evidently had sufficient type
            for sixteen standing pages. As a corollary it seems clear that the resources of the shop
            were fully utilized in the printing of these sheets.</p>
          <p>If both formes of D marked the end of a working day, both skeletons might have been
            available for the imposition of either forme of E. As a matter of fact, both formes of E
            use running-titles from D. In sheet E, however, it is <pb n="003.250"/> rather difficult
            to determine which forme was first imposed and printed because the outer forme of E uses
            two running-titles from inner D and in addition a single running-title from each of two
            other formes, outer C and inner C.</p>
          <p>The problem is not insoluble, however, if we can correctly interpret the following
            facts: <list>
              <item>1. Title X from C1<hi rend="super">v</hi> is used on D1<hi rend="super">v</hi>
                and E2<hi rend="super">v</hi>.</item>
              <item>2. Title V from C2 is used on E1.</item>
              <item>3. Titles IIIb and II from the other two pages of inner C were probably
                distributed before outer E was machined, for we note that the initial A from title
                IIIb is used to replace the rejected A in the previously set aside title IXa that
                now appears on E4<hi rend="super">v</hi>.</item>
              <item>4. The use of title X on E2<hi rend="super">v</hi> and VIII on E3 is the normal
                pattern of running-title transfers from an inner to an outer forme; and the only
                sensible reason why the other two titles from inner D were not used must be that the
                other quarters, E1 and E4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, were already imposed.</item>
            </list>
          </p>
          <p>In short, the compositor went back to earlier set-aside running-titles because neither
            skeleton of D was available, but by the time he had imposed E1 and E4<hi rend="super"
              >v</hi>, side-by-side on the stone, the skeletons of D had been rinsed and were
            available. The needed two running-titles were taken from the quarters of inner D which
            are appropriate to normal transfer from inner to outer formes, D1<hi rend="super">v</hi>
            to E2<hi rend="super">v</hi> and D4 to E3.</p>
          <p>Finally the entire skeleton of the outer forme of D was transferred in normal order to
            the inner forme of E. And that concluded the printing of the first five sheets of the
            play.</p>
          <p>With sheet F a wholly new situation arises. All running-titles from the first five
            sheets are discarded; they are replaced in sheet F by four new running-titles, one of
            which has a comma instead of a period after the word "<hi rend="italic">Masters</hi>."
            These four are used in both formes of F and G and in the inner forme of H. Four other
            running-titles, one of which has a badly broken upper case <hi rend="italic">W</hi> in
            the word "<hi rend="italic">World</hi>", were used in outer H, and three of these in the
            final three pages of the play, I1-2.</p>
          <p>Apparently the outer forme of H was imposed and printed before the inner forme, a
            second skeleton being introduced to speed up completion of the job. It is likely that
            the order of the formes through the press was inner F, outer F, inner G, outer G, outer
            H, inner H. There is obviously nothing to prevent simultaneous imposition of both formes
            of I. In fact half-sheet imposition seems likely, the running-titles from outer H being
            transferred as follows: H1 to I1, H2<hi rend="super">v</hi> to I1<hi rend="super"
            >v</hi>, and H3 to I2.</p>
          <p>Signatures F-I differ from the earlier sheets of the play in another important
            respect&mdash;composition. The two efficient compositors of sheets A-E were replaced by
            one compositor who is not an accomplished workman. His work is easily distinguished from
            that of the other two by his spelling, by his handling <pb n="003.251"/> of contractions
            and apostrophes, and by his sometimes stupid blunders, which are noticeable chiefly in
            sheet H. Evidently, sheets F and G underwent some sort of correction, for we find only
            three variants in these two sheets, two on F1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and one on G3<hi
              rend="super">v</hi>. When we find numerous errors throughout sheet H, the comparative
            absence of errors in F and G strongly suggests that F and G underwent some sort of
            proofing earlier.</p>
          <p>Sheet H is truly amazing, exhibiting as it does both formes variant in wildly erratic
            fashion. For instance we find in outer H in the uncorrected state these flaws: on H1
            seven stupid blunders; on H2<hi rend="super">v</hi> a generally good page with one
            nonsense line at the bottom; on H3 a faulty speech-tag, <hi rend="italic">An.c</hi>
            later changed to <hi rend="italic">Anc.</hi>; on H4<hi rend="super">v</hi> a good
            invariant page.</p>
          <p>In inner H the situation is much the same; on H1<hi rend="super">v</hi> there are five
            stupid blunders limited to the upper half of the page; signature H2 is invariant and
            good, and shows signs of having been set or extensively corrected by the compositor of
            the greater part of the first five sheets; on H3<hi rend="super">v</hi> one word is
            wrong and one speech-tag is changed from <hi rend="italic">Short.</hi> to <hi
              rend="italic">Short.R.</hi>; signature H4 exists in three states. The wholly
            uncorrected state,<ref target="f003.14.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> found
            only in the British Museum copy, has the incorrect catchword <hi rend="italic"
              >Short</hi>. All other copies properly read <hi rend="italic">Mast Pan</hi>. The third
            from the last line of text in this copy reads in part "&#x017F;hall I intreat a
            cute&#x017F;y?" All other copies properly add the missing <hi rend="italic">r</hi> in
            "curte&#x017F;y" and omit one of the l's in "&#x017F;hall", probably to avoid the
            necessity of spacing out the line anew; it was certainly not lack of room in the line.
            The British Museum copy uses <hi rend="italic">Short</hi>. as a speech-tag five times.
            The partially corrected states remove all the errors listed above except the use of <hi
              rend="italic">Short.</hi>, which is hardly an error. The twice corrected states change
              <hi rend="italic">Short</hi>. to <hi rend="italic">Short.R.</hi> twice near the top of
            the page, but leave it unexpanded the other three times it occurs. Here surely is
            haphazard correction!</p>
          <p>To complete the discussion of composition we may add that the three pages of sheet I
            exist in two states. Signature I1 is uncorrected in the Dyce copy of the play in the
            Victoria and Albert Museum. The variants in I1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and I2 seem to me
            to be the result not of correction strictly speaking but of an accident in the course of
            printing. In those copies of the play that do not lack the <hi rend="italic">FINIS</hi>
            the upper part of signatures I1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and I2 near their common margin
            show signs of badly justified lines with type slipping from side to side. I assume that
            the type in this area pied locally and necessitated re-adjustment. In those copies that
            lack the <hi rend="italic">FINIS</hi> these badly justified lines have been tightened
            up, but in those areas mistakes have crept in; for instance the i from
            "&#x017F;eriou&#x017F;ly" slips down into the next line with this result: <q>
              &#x017F;erou&#x017F;ly<lb/> ainother<lb/>
            </q>
          </p>
          <pb n="003.252"/>
          <p>When we add to all this evidence of careless work the significant fact that the badly
            damaged running-titles in the last sheets of the book were not replaced, as were those
            in the first sheets, we get a picture the cumulative force of which demonstrates beyond
            a doubt that the two bibliographically distinguishable sections of <hi rend="italic">A
              Mad World</hi> were composed and printed in quite different ways.</p>
          <p>Sheets A-E were carefully composed and printed with all the resources of Ballard's shop
            directed toward turning out a reasonably good piece of work. Then for some reason the
            printing of <hi rend="italic">A Mad World</hi> was stopped. The distribution of
            running-titles as outlined in step number three above suggests that the decision to set
            aside this play was reached before sheet E was in the press, but after its type had been
            set at least in part. When the printing was resumed, a wholly different attitude
            prevailed. Composition was done by one man in the main, probably an apprentice,
            certainly not a good compositor.</p>
          <p>For, as I demonstrated before the Bibliographical Evidence group of the Modern Language
            Association in Chicago, the entire play shows signs of having been set from Middleton's
            holograph manuscript, and Middleton's handwriting is very easy to read, unlikely to
            prove troublesome to a good compositor. Even the printing did not make use of all the
            facilities of Ballard's shop, presumably because his accomplished workmen were busy with
            some other job.</p>
          <p>This entire analysis undoubtedly introduces more questions than answers, but it may
            prove helpful to some other student with a similar bibliographical problem.</p>

            <head type="divisional">(1) The Two 1695 Editions of Wycherley's <hi rend="italic"
              >Country-Wife</hi></head>
            <p>The first edition of William Wycherley's <hi rend="italic">Country-Wife</hi> appeared
              in 1675 with the collation 4<hi rend="super">0</hi>, [A]<hi rend="super">2</hi> B-O<hi
                rend="super">4</hi>. Before the end of the century four more quarto editions were
              published, each regularly derived from its predecessor: 1683, collating A<hi
                rend="super">2</hi> B-K<hi rend="super">4</hi>; 1688, a line-for-line paginal
              reprint of 1683; and two editions in 1695 collating [A]<hi rend="super">2</hi> B-I<hi
                rend="super">4</hi>, one a line-for-line paginal reprint of the other.</p>
            <p>Before the appearance of the Woodward and McManaway <hi rend="italic">Check List of
                English Plays 1641-1700</hi> the fact that there were two editions, not one, in 1695
              had not been recognized; but the <hi rend="italic">Check List</hi> separated them,
              assigning no. 1325 to the edition with "Country Wife" (no hyphen) in the
              running-titles, and no. 1326 to the edition with the hyphenated running-titles
                "Country-Wife."<ref target="f003.15.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> Other
                <pb n="003.253"/> differences may be added for identification. In 1325 the imprint
              contains plain italic caps; on sig. C4, line 33, Pinchwife's aside "Will nothing do?"
              is enclosed in parentheses; and on sig. D1<hi rend="super">v</hi> the first
              speech-heading reads "<hi rend="italic">Sr. Jas.</hi>" In 1326 swash italic caps head
              the imprint names Briscoe, Russel-street, and Daniel Dring; the aside is bracketed;
              and the speech-heading reads "<hi rend="italic">Sir Jas.</hi>"</p>
            <p>These two 1695 editions have not previously been subjected to bibliographical
              examination to determine their order, but when this is done it is seen that the
              Woodward and McManaway order should be reversed: 1326 is the true fourth and 1325 the
              true fifth edition. Since one is a paginal reprint of the other, independent
              derivation is eliminated and the question resolves itself to the simple determination
              of which edition was set from 1688 and which was not. Of 86 variations between the two
              1695 editions in Act II, for example, 77 in no. 1326 follow 1688 where no. 1325
              differs. Three of these are substantives: <list>
                <item>1688-no. 1326: that is no wit, out of friendship to me? (C3<hi rend="super"
                    >v</hi>, line 47)</item>
                <item>no. 1325: that is no whit out of Friendship to me.</item>
                <item>1688-no. 1326: to our honours (C4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, line 38)</item>
                <item>no. 1325: to our honour</item>
                <item>1688-no. 1326: do not use that word naked. (D1, line 3)</item>
                <item>no. 1325: do not use the word naked.</item>
              </list> In 46 cases, no. 1326 follows 1688 in spelling, capitalization, or contraction
              where no. 1325 differs; and in 28 punctuation variants no. 1326 conforms to 1688,
              where no. 1325 does not. In the light of this overwhelming evidence that no. 1326 was
              printed from 1688 and that, as a paginal reprint, no. 1325 must derive from 1326, the
              four minor examples of spelling and punctuation variants in which no. 1325 and 1688,
              but not no. 1326, agree may readily be dismissed as fortuitous.</p>
            <p>Collation against the 1675 and the 1683 editions discloses that no. 1326 did not
              consult these editions and that it is a straight reprint of 1688.</p>

            <head type="divisional">(2) The Two 1692 Editions of Otway's <hi rend="italic">Caius Marius</hi></head>
            <p>The first edition of Thomas Otway's <hi rend="italic">History and Fall of Caius
                Marius</hi>, listed in the Woodward and McManaway <hi rend="italic">Check List</hi>
              as no. 880, was published by Thomas Flesher in 1680. The <hi rend="italic">Check
                List</hi> follows with no. 881, an edition for Robert Bentley in 1692, which has a
              long "s" printed in the word "<hi rend="italic">eft</hi>" on the title-page; no. 882,
              with a short "s", or "<hi rend="italic">est</hi>" in the quotation on the title,
              thereupon follows in the listing as "another issue" of no. 881, with the same date and
              publisher. This listing as an issue is in error, for no. 882 is throughout <pb
                n="003.254"/> in a completely different typesetting from 881, and is the true third
              edition of the play.<ref target="f003.15.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
            <p>The order 880, 881, and 882 is readily established by collation. Nos. 881 and 882
              agree in their makeup (a slight condensation of 880), one being a paginal reprint of
              the other. That edition, therefore, which derives directly from 880 must be the
              earlier. Various substantive readings point to the agreement of 880 and 881 in cases
              where 882 differs.</p>
            <list>
              <item>880-881: Lay my gray Hairs low (page 8, line 4)</item>
              <item>882: Lay my gray Heirs low</item>
              <item>880-881: This D&aelig;mon (page 8, line 15)</item>
              <item>882: The D&aelig;mon</item>
              <item>880-881: its most dear-bought Honours (page 11, line 29)</item>
              <item>882: its more dear-bought Honours</item>
            </list>
            <p>This same line of derivation is clearly exemplified by the accidentals, as well: </p>
            <list>
              <item>880-881: my wish'd-for Peace (page 9, line 4)</item>
              <item>882: my wish'd for Peace</item>
              <item>880-881: Sh'has bin with Sylla (page 10, line 46)</item>
              <item>882: Sh'has been with Sylla</item>
            </list>
            <p>The second instance is especially good evidence, for although "bin" is the invariable
              spelling of 880, "been" is the normal form in 881; hence, the few cases in 881 of
              "bin" reflect its copy-text, and 882 quite naturally normalizes the form to
              "been."</p>
            <p>The whole trend of the evidence demonstrates this order without question, and the
              expected few cases of agreement in accidentals between 880 and 882 against 881,
              resolve themselves without difficulty into normal corrections by the compositor of
                882.<ref target="f003.15.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref></p>
            <p>The seventeenth-century history of this play may be continued by remarking that no.
              883, listed as a 1692 issue for Flesher, is a "ghost," the single recorded copy, that
              at Northwestern University, being in fact no. 882. No. 884, a 1694 edition reported by
              Montague Summers but without confirmation, has no recorded exempla and very likely
              does not exist. Finally, collation establishes that no. 885, the 1696 edition for
              Bentley, is a reprint of no. 882, a fact which points to 882 as an authorized edition
              and not a piracy.</p>

            <p>Following the first edition in 1686 (no. 662) and the second in 1693 (no. 663) of
              Thomas Jevon's farce <hi rend="italic">The Devil of a Wife</hi>, the Woodward and
              McManaway <hi rend="italic">Check List</hi> records as no. 664 an edition for James
              Knapton in 1693 (4 preliminary leaves, 47 p.) and another (no. 665) in the same year,
              also for Knapton (3 preliminary leaves, 42 p.). Under no. 664 it is noted that the
              Henry E. Huntington Library has another copy of this edition with variant readings.
              This second copy, which is the same as that held by Chicago and Duke, is, on the
              contrary, a completely new reset edition and should be assigned the number 664a.</p>
            <p>Collation establishes that no. 664, the first of the 1695 editions, was set in a
              condensed makeup from a copy of Knapton's 1693 edition (no. 663), and that 664a is a
              paginal and line-for-line reprint of 664.</p>

            <p>The similar title-pages and makeup of 664 and 664a furnish no points of
              identification, but the two editions may be distinguished on the basis of the above
              readings, although other points may be mentioned. Thus 664 has the correct page number
              19 but 664a transposes this in the copies seen to 91. In the persons, in 664 Lovemore
              is described as "beloved for good old <hi rend="italic">Engl</hi>. House-keeping"
              whereas 664a reads "House-keeper."</p>
            <p>Various unique readings confirm the evidence of its compressed makeup to indicate
              that the third 1695 edition, no. 665, did not precede 664. Collation establishes,
              moreover, that it is derived directly from 664 and not from 664a or from any earlier
              edition, for it follows the major readings in which 664 varies from 663 but ignores
              the variants in 664a from 664.</p>

            <p>The only modern edition of Addison's poetic works which has any authority is that of
              Guthkelch. In spite of the many merits of this production, the editing of <hi
                rend="italic">The Campaign</hi>,<ref target="f003.16.01" n="1"><hi rend="super"
                  >1</hi></ref> the poem which marked the turning point in Addison's career, is
              based on an erroneous bibliography of the early editions (also found in the <hi
                rend="italic">Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature</hi>); and the text is
              not contrived according to present-day standards of editorial practice. Accepting
              Tickell's text in the posthumous folio edition of Addison's <hi rend="italic"
                >Works</hi> (1721), Guthkelch assumes that the variants from the first edition of
              1705 made their initial appearance in the edition of 1708 with the Latin translation.
              This assumption posits a delay of four years between the first appearance of the poem
              and Addison's revision of his text. In fact, no such delay occurred, for the poem was
              revised for the first and only time in the third London edition of 1705.</p>
            <p>It is the purpose of this study to present a corrected bibliography of the critically
              important early editions of <hi rend="italic">The Campaign</hi>, and to call attention
              to certain significant bibliographical features affecting our estimate of the

                  of the "British" and "British" forms discussed below, establishes that this
                  edition was set from the first London edition. Owing to the speed with which the
                  second London edition seems to have been prepared, whether the Edinburgh
                  immediately preceded or succeeded it is impossible to determine. This Scots
                  edition has no independent authority and is described here only because of its
                  rarity and to complete the roster of 1705 editions.</item>
              </list>
            </p>
            <p>The three 1705 London editions are all that can possess textual authority, but the
              precise assignment of authority to all details rests in part on the bibliographical
              evidence of their printing. In the opinion of the writer, the first edition was
              hurried to completion in order to be put on sale on the day of Marlborough's return to
              London. In addition to the evidence which has been cited elsewhere,<ref
                target="f003.16.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> one may offer signs of haste
              in the book itself, for at least two and possibly more compositors were concerned in
              setting its few pages. A marked feature of the spelling in sheets B-C is the
              invariable form "Brittish," "Brittain," "Brittania," and "Britton," whereas in D-G are
              consistently found the forms "British," "Britain," and so on. We have, then, what
              seems to be simultaneous two-section printing of this book in the respective parts A-C
              and D-G. And if inferences are valid from the University of Chicago copy, which
              contains sheets B and D from the second edition, it is possible that the edition was
              enlarged after the type of these first-printed sheets had been distributed.<ref
                target="f003.16.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref></p>
            <p>That a very brief interval elapsed between the printing of the first and second
              editions is suggested by the fact that standing type from the first-edition titlepage
              was utilized in the second, although all other type had been distributed as printed.
              Very considerable haste in the preparation of this second edition is <pb n="003.259"/>
              shown by bibliographical analysis of its characteristics. A major break in the book
              between sheets D and E, indicated by the change in the size of the headline square
              brackets, shows that at least two-section printing with two presses obtained. The
              separate setting, at a minimum, of sheets F-G is indicated by the use of a very
              small-font possessive "s" following words set in small caps, which differs from the
              practice shown in sheet D of using a small-cap "s" as throughout the first edition.
              This difference is buttressed by the setting of "Marlbro" in F-G without a circumflex,
              although the form "Marlbr&ocirc;" is found in D (the name does not appear in B-C).</p>
            <p>Sheet E, which may be taken as beginning the second section, is irregular because of
              the unique wide measure used to set its inner forme. The two measures used in the
              sheet demonstrate composition by formes in order to begin printing with the least
              possible delay. The compositor of inner E differs from that of sheet D in dropping the
              circumflex in "Marlbro," but he also differs from F-G in using a small-cap possessive
              "s" for words set in small caps. That sheet E was not the only sheet to be set by
              formes may perhaps be indicated by a certain feature of the typography. In the first
              edition the cases contained a mixture of two kinds of commas, one perceptibly thinner
              than that proper for the font. These mixed commas are found in the second edition in
              both formes of sheet B, in inner C and inner D. Only the regular commas which go with
              the font are found in outer C and D and in all formes of E-G.</p>
            <p>If the inference is correct that in the first edition sheet D, and possibly B as
              well, was underprinted by accident or by reason of a subsequent enlargement of
              edition-sheet, then the fact that in the second edition sheet D, uniquely, was reset
              with the same measure as the first edition and printed on first-edition paper
              throughout very likely indicates that this sheet preceded all others through the press
              as a separate unit in order to complete the edition-sheet for the first edition.<ref
                target="f003.16.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> The second edition may,
              therefore, have been sent to the presses in sections as A-C, D, E, F-G, or possibly as
              A-C, D, E-G. If, then, typesetting for the reprint began and was pushed forward
              rapidly before the complete exhaustion of first-edition sheets, we may combine this
              evidence with the standing type of the first-edition title-page to suggest that sale
              of the first edition was brisk and that no very great time elapsed between the
              printing of the two editions.<ref target="f003.16.06" n="6"><hi rend="super"
                >6</hi></ref></p>
            <p>Collation of the text of the second against that of the first edition discloses no
              substantive variants, indicative of revision, but only the scattering of <pb
                n="003.260"/> punctuation and capitalization variants which are encountered in any
              resetting. The number of compositors employed resulted in varying degrees of
              exactitude with which copy was followed. The relatively short time between the
              printing of the first and second editions, combined with the absence of substantive
              revision, makes it extremely unlikely that Addison had anything to do with the copy
              for the second edition or that any of its variants have authority.</p>
            <p>This point is of considerable importance for the minutiae of the text, for since the
              revised third edition was set from a copy of the second, the vast majority of the
              alterations from the first in the "accidentals" were retained. That by the retention
              in a substantively revised edition of compositors' variants Addison automatically gave
              them authority and his approval is a contention that would be utterly unsupported by
              modern views of the transmission of texts.<ref target="f003.16.07" n="7"><hi
                  rend="super">7</hi></ref> On the other hand, the changes made in the third edition
              from the accidentals of its copy-text, the second, may be compositorial or may reflect
              Addison's markings, or both: that is a decision for an editor in each specific case.
              Otherwise, only the "accidentals" of the first edition, set from manuscript, have
              authority.</p>
            <p>The substantive revisions in the third edition are recorded by Guthkelch, but with
              the erroneous assumption, previously noted, that they originated in the 1708 edition.
              At least sixteen such alterations attest to Addison's labors of revision. Twelve
              alterations are slight changes in wording such as the shift from "indites" to
              "recites" (line 5), or from "A Captive Host" to "Whole Captive Hosts" (line 355). More
              positive revisions are confined to four passages, each a single couplet. Although
              these are strictly rhetorical in interest, they may be regarded as pointing out those
              passages in which Addison could have sensed the dangers of the kind of turgidity that
              led Pope to score on <hi rend="italic">The Campaign</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">Peri
                Bathous</hi>.<ref target="f003.16.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> Since the
              revised couplets appear in widely separated passages on pages 4, 8, 13, and 16, it is
              apparent that Addison submitted the whole poem to critical scrutiny. One example,
              lines 153-154 on page 8, will suffice to show the general character of his polishing. <q>
                <l>Whole Nations trampl'd into Dirt, and bruis'd</l>

              </q>
            </p>
            <p>With the recognition that Addison's work on <hi rend="italic">The Campaign</hi> was
              complete with the third edition, subsequent reprints retain but slight importance,
              although they do show continued interest in the most successful of the several score
              of Blenheim poems or, indeed, of the larger group of Marlborough panegyrics. The 1708
              edition with the Latin translation, Hill's piracy of 1710, T. Warner's edition of
              1713, and the reprint in Part VI of the reissue of the Dryden-Tonson <hi rend="italic"
                >Miscellanies</hi> in 1716, all listed by Guthkelch, have no textual importance.
              Unnoticed by Guthkelch are two Tonson editions, of 1713 and 1725, which are labeled as
              the fifth and sixth editions respectively. The 1713 edition is embellished by an
              engraving which depicts an Angel bearing a sword and riding the storm clouds above
              Marlborough's head, while he, mounted on a rearing horse, towers above squadrons of
              cavalry on the field of combat below. The 1725 edition is an unpretentious octavo,
              interesting only in that it is the final separate printing to be identified with the
              name of Tonson, although of course the elder Jacob had retired in 1720. Thus a total
              of six editions, four of them separate printings, are to be associated with the press
              of the eminent Kit-Cat printer.</p>
            <p>The final question remains: which of the three 1705 Tonson texts of <hi rend="italic"
                >The Campaign</hi> is to be preferred? Although conventional editorial procedure
              would select the revised third to reprint, the McKerrow-Greg bibliographical
              school&mdash;conscious of the derivation of some of the "accidentals" of the third
              from the unauthoritative second edition&mdash;would choose the authoritative first
              edition as copy-text and in this would incorporate the authoritative substantive
              revisions of the third and such of its unique "accidentals" variants as might be due
              to Addison's own alterations.<ref target="f003.16.09" n="9"><hi rend="super"
                >9</hi></ref> To date no edition is available which, according to this standard, is

                and American libraries discloses only fourteen copies of the first edition. Three
                others in the possession of the writer, and three in private or dealers' hands,
                raises the total to twenty, of which nineteen have been examined for variant
                features. The first edition is held by the following libraries: MH(2), CSmH, CLUC,
                CtY (badly trimmed, lacking title), MB, NjP, NN, IU, ICU, NNC, TxU, British Museum
                (Ashley: another copy lost in blitz), and Bodleian. A selection of prominent

                by the evidence of the half-title, sheet A. Just possibly the order of composition
                was B, A, and C, and the compositor adjusted his measure with C in order to utilize
                skeletons made up for the latter part.</p>

              <p>Pope very easily finds in panegyric verse illustrations for Macrology and Pleonasm,
                "the superfluity of words and vacuity of sense" conjoined. Without naming Addison he
                remarks, "I am pleased to see one of our greatest adversaries employ this figure."
                He then offers six isolated lines without comment, and in the following sequence,
                199, 202, 193, 268, 168, and 190. Actually, Addison got off very easily. Since
                Pope's extracts are taken almost without exception from Whig apologists, he may have
                included Addison as much for his political associations as for being guilty of
                poetic swellings and tautology. See <hi rend="italic">Works of Pope</hi>, ed.

              <p>The posthumous Tickell edition of 1721 has been made the basis of all modern texts,
                including that of Guthkelch, instead of the early editions. Tickell, in fact, did
                restore a number of the first-edition punctuation variants to his third-edition
                copy-text (this is surely significant coming from Addison's close friend); but, as
                was inevitable, the compositor of his edition normalized some spellings and treated
                the capitalization freely so that in certain respects his text is yet one further
                step removed from basic authority in detail.</p>

            <p>Although in England reprints and collections of Elizabethan and seventeenth-century
              poetry and drama were popular throughout the eighteenth century, this eminently
              critical age lacked easy access to its rich heritage of literary criticism. Only
              slowly were the classics of Elizabethan and seventeenth-century criticism reprinted,
              and for these there was so little demand that the editors usually had to share or
              assume the financial risk of publication. No history of English criticism appeared to
              supplement Thomas Warton's <hi rend="italic">History of English Poetry</hi>. In 1737
              Elizabeth Cooper promised "<hi rend="italic">some Account of the Progress of Criticism
                in</hi> England; <hi rend="italic">from Sir</hi> Philip Sidney, <hi rend="italic"

                target="f003.17.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> But the volume which was to
              contain this account never appeared, nor did Dr. Johnson ever write his more ambitious
              "History of Criticism . . . from Aristotle to the present age."<ref
                target="f003.17.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
            <p>The first separate English reprint of Elizabethan literary criticism seems to have
              been that of Sidney's <hi rend="italic">Defence of Poesy</hi> issued in 1752 by G.
              Robert Urie, one of Glasgow's foremost publishers. This book, though neatly printed
              and adorned with a portrait, was an isolated phenomenon, since it did not promote
              further republication of literary criticism.</p>
            <p>The unpretentious forerunner of future scholarly collections was published in 1787 by
              Joseph Warton. Warton had acquired experience as an anthologist by assisting Dodsley
              to select material for his <hi rend="italic">Collection</hi>. He had established a
              reputation as literary critic by his edition of Virgil, his critical papers in <hi
                rend="italic">The Adventurer</hi>, and his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Writings
                and Genius of Alexander Pope</hi>. On 18 April 1784 Warton suggested to the printer
              John Nichols the small compendium which appeared in 1787 as <hi rend="italic">Sir
                Philip Sydney's Defence of Poetry, and Observations on Poetry and Eloquence, from
                the Discoveries of Ben Jonson:</hi>
              <q>I have a little Printing-Scheme to mention to you and imagine you will not mislike
                to join with me in the <hi rend="italic">Profit</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                >Loss</hi>. We all know what a Taste is diffused for reading our old Poets. I think
                some of our old <hi rend="italic">Critics</hi> might be made as popular and
                  pleasing.<ref target="f003.17.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref></q> For this
              venture Warton thus offered to share the expenses and undertook to furnish copy,

              evidently on 27 April, Warton sent copy to the printer. For some reason publication
              was delayed until early in 1787, possibly because Warton was remiss in performing his
              editorial duties. Of the second volume of his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Writings
                and Genius of Pope</hi> two hundred pages had lain in the warehouse for more than a
              score of years while the publishers waited for him to complete the volume. Finally, on
              12 December 1786, Warton sent in the preliminaries for his collection of literary
              criticism, suggesting that publication might coincide with his presence in London
              about January the sixth or seventh. About that date, probably, it appeared, published
              by G.G.J. and J. Robinson and J. Walter.</p>
            <p>This slender compendium was possibly Joseph Warton's greatest service to English
              scholarship; but it had its deficiencies. Warton did not attempt to reproduce the
              original texts, or probably even to consult them. Instead he used for copy
              eighteenth-century editions of Sidney's and Jonson's <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>,
              even further modernizing the punctuation and paragraphing and marking for omission
              several passages in Jonson's <hi rend="italic">Timber, or Discoveries</hi>. Nor did
              the edition include the explanatory notes which the editor had intended to supply.
              Despite these modernizations, however, sale of the book was slow. Indeed most copies
              were evidently still unsold when on 8 February 1808 Nichols's warehouse burned with
              all his stock, so that soon Warton's book was difficult to obtain.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile at the very end of the eighteenth century, in 1800, accurate scholarly
              methods were finally applied to the editing of literary criticism. For his edition of
              Dryden's <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Prose Works</hi> Warton's friend
              Edmond Malone used and collated originals, employing methods which he had helped to
              perfect in editing Shakespeare.</p>
            <p>In 1810, two years after most of Warton's edition burned, Sidney's <hi rend="italic"
                >Defence</hi> was reprinted by Edward Hovell, Lord Thurlow. He was prompted to
              replace Warton's editon and, possibly, to help satisfy interest aroused in Sidney by
              Thomas Zouch's <hi rend="italic">Life and Writings of Sir Philip Sydney</hi>,
              published in 1808. In his edition of <hi rend="italic">The Defence</hi>, which
              appeared in December, 1810, Thurlow made no attempt to apply Malone's scholarly
              methods to the editing of Sidney. Instead he merely reprinted Warton's text,
              modernizing the capitals and prefacing five original sonnets. This edition, elegantly
              printed by W. Bulmer in quarto on large wove paper, evidently found so few purchasers
              at the shop of White and Cochrane on Fleet Street that Thurlow decided to get rid of
              some copies by preparing a private or gift issue. For this issue he used the original
              sheets containing the text of Sidney's <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi> but printed new
              preliminaries. He deleted the publishers' names on the title-page, acknowledged there
              the sonnets included in both issues, changed the date of publication to 1811,
              suppressed the advertisement, and added a two-leaf gathering to include an additional
              original poem. The leaves he had only slightly cut and gilded; and the whole issue he
              had elegantly bound.<ref target="f003.17.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref></p>
            <pb n="003.264"/>
            <p>Thurlow's edition of Sidney's <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi> probably helped to lead
              Joseph Haslewood, who was already editing scarce and curious Elizabethan material, to
              publish in 1811 an edition of Puttenham's <hi rend="italic">Arte of English
                Poesie</hi>. At least Haslewood in 1815 omitted Sidney's <hi rend="italic"
                >Defence</hi> from his anthology of criticism because it had already been edited by
              Thurlow's "noble hand." In his edition of Puttenham, Haslewood followed Malone in the
              tradition of scholarly accuracy and on some points was even more meticulous than his
              predecessor had been. Haslewood's edition is a page by page reprint of the 1589 Field
              edition. Even in bibliographical features such as pagination, signatures, and
              gatherings all the accidental oddities of the original were reproduced. Haslewood
              skipped page numbers 93 to 100, which had in his original been left unused to
              compensate for four unpaginated leaves, omitted from many copies, including that used
              by him. He signed his leaves in the style Field had used, C, C ij, C iij, C iiij, <hi
                rend="italic">etc.</hi>, though why he signed leaf aiij as a 5 and aiiij as a 7 does
              not appear. In reproducing the original gatherings he was just as scrupulous,
              imitating the original two-leaf gathering I and only the three leaves that he saw of
              the original <hi rend="italic">AB</hi> gathering. Haslewood's leaves [Bij] and Biij
              are conjugate and correspond to Field's [<hi rend="italic">ABij</hi>] and <hi
                rend="italic">A B iij</hi>. The single leaf B, blank like Field's leaf <hi
                rend="italic">AB</hi>, Haslewood had his binder paste onto the preceding leaf. Since
              in Haslewood's copy of Field's edition the original leaf [<hi rend="italic"
                >ABiiij</hi>], containing the woodcut portrait of Queen Elizabeth, had been removed
              from its original position, Haselwood, thinking that he was following Field, omitted
              this leaf from his B gathering, but had the portrait printed with sheet a to face his
              general title-page.</p>
            <p>Accompanying the publication of Puttenham's <hi rend="italic">Arte</hi>, Haslewood
              announced his intention of publishing a uniform edition of all the essays on poetry up
              to Dryden. Meanwhile he continued to edit and encourage the publication of rare old
              volumes. In 1812 he helped to found the Roxburghe Club for this purpose. During the
              same year he became, with Sir Edgerton Brydges, joint editor of <hi rend="italic">The
                British Bibliographer;</hi> and in the fourth volume he printed critical extracts
              from Henry Reynold's <hi rend="italic">Mythomystes</hi>.</p>
            <p>In 1815 finally appeared Haslewood's anthology of critical essays, <hi rend="italic"
                >The Arte of English Poesie, &amp;c.</hi>, later designated, with the Puttenham
              volume, as <hi rend="italic">Ancient Critical Essays on Poets and Poesie</hi>.
              Complaining of the difficulty of locating copies, Haslewood here renounced his project
              of reprinting a complete series of critical essays, but this 1815 volume is in itself
              a magnificent collection. It comprises Gascoigne's <hi rend="italic">Certayne Notes of
                Instruction</hi>, Webbe's <hi rend="italic">Discourse of English Poetrie</hi>, King
              James VI's <hi rend="italic">Treatise of the Airt of Scottis Poesie</hi>, Harrington's
                <hi rend="italic">Apologie of Poetrie</hi>, Meres's <hi rend="italic">Comparative
                Discourse of our English Poets</hi>, Campion's <hi rend="italic">Observations in the
                Art of English Poesie</hi>, Daniel's <hi rend="italic">Defense of Rhyme</hi>,
              Bolton's <hi rend="italic">Hypercritica</hi>, and five letters on poetry by Spenser
              and Harvey. Here Haslewood again tried to reproduce his originals as accurately as
              possible, and he indicated variant <pb n="003.265"/> readings when he could locate
              more than one authoritative text. At least some of the volume is, again, a page for
              page reprint; and though he could not here follow the original pagination and
              signatures, he varied the style of his signatures to follow his originals. It was
              beautifully printed in an edition of 220 copies by T. Bensley, Sir Edgerton Brydge's
              printer. It was a worthy culmination of the renaissance of interest in older criticism
              begun with Warton's thin collection in 1787. Only a century later was it superseded,
              and even then the modern editors like G. Smith frequently abstracted what Haslewood
              had printed in full and modernized punctuation which he had reproduced faithfully.</p>

            <name type="title">PRINTER'S COPY FOR TYRWHITT'S CHAUCER</name>

          <p>The Alderman Library of the University of Virginia was happy to find recently that the
            annotations in a fragment of a black-letter Chaucer which it owns are those of the great
            english scholar and editor Thomas Tyrwhitt. It finds further that nearly all the
            matching fragments of the volume, also annotated, are in the Britism Museum.</p>
          <p>In 1944 the Alderman Library purchased, at the suggestion of the English department,
            from Myers and Co. of London, a book-fragment (catalogue 340, item 107) described as
            "ninety-nine leaves and portions of several others of Speght's edition of Chaucer, 1602,
            most extensively annotated and corrected by Timothy Thomas . . . in connection with
            Urry's edition of Chaucer's works . . . of which he was the final editor."</p>
          <p>In 1946, Dr. George Pace, at that time of the University of Virginia English faculty,
            examined the emendations and came to the conclusion that they were not those of Timothy
            Thomas but were probably those of Tyrwhitt; they bore no relation to the Urry text but
            were identical with Tyrwhitt's text.</p>
          <p>That the emendations are Tyrwhitt's, Pace has now happily established as true. Recently
            in London, he writes, he examined a fragment of a black-letter Chaucer in the British
            Museum (press mark 641.m.19). He saw written on the recto of the leaf which precedes the
            title page a note, "Bequeathed by Tho<hi rend="super">s</hi> Tyrwhitt Esq. 1786."
            Furthermore the volume lacks folios 1-85 and 92-108, the very folios which&mdash;except
            for two two-folio breaks&mdash;are present in the Alderman fragment. All this makes a
            pleasing discovery.</p>
          <p>The Alderman fragment contains the prologue to the <hi rend="italic">Canterbury
              Tales</hi> and all the tales now held authentic except for the two two-folio breaks
            already mentioned and a segment of the Parson's tale; it also lacks a large part of the
            apocryphal Plowman's Tale. The marginal emendations, of which there are thousands, and
            the instructions make it clear that the fragment is part of <pb n="003.266"/> Tyrwhitt's
            copy for the printer. They reveal the pains-taking devotion of a great scholar to his
            task. His five-volume edition of the <hi rend="italic">Tales</hi>, the first of the
            modern ones, was published, part in 1775 and the rest in 1778. He was the first to make
            sense out of what were then the baffling mysteries of Chaucer's language and the
            supposed crudities of his verse.</p>
          <p>The volume deserves and awaits close study.</p>

          <p>The bibliographer of George Crabbe's works has strange opportunities in the United
            States of America, for on this side of the Atlantic have been preserved several early
            editions which have not thus far come to light in the libraries of Europe and have not
            been listed in the bibliographies of Crabbe hitherto published.<ref target="f003.19.01"
              n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> One of these scarce early editions is a collection
            of the tales and miscellaneous poems of Crabbe which was brought out in 1847 by H.G.
            Bohn. A copy of this collection, once owned by the Public School Library of Municipality
            No. 2, New Orleans, Louisiana, is now in the New Orleans Public Library.<ref
              target="f003.19.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
          <p>The volume is of interest both as a rarity and as an additional testimonial of the
            popularity of Crabbe's works about the middle of the nineteenth century. I regret that I
            have not been able to identify the makers of the drawings and the plates or to determine

          <p>The story of the establishing of the Cambridge, Massachusetts, Press, the first
            printing house in England's North American colonies, has been told and retold many times
            during the past one hundred and forty years, but the known facts about its founding are
            still relatively few, singularly open to various interpretations, and really not
            materially augmented over those set down by Isaiah Thomas in the first edition of his
              <hi rend="italic">History of Printing in America</hi> (1810).</p>
          <p>Especially lacking are details about the financing of the original printing house
            established at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the autumn of 1638. Writers on the subject
            have been understandably reluctant to accept as sole founder and benefactor of the
            Cambridge Press the Reverend Jose Glover, Non-Con-formist clergyman of Surrey, who died
            at sea in the summer of 1638 while conveying the press and other printing equipment and
            supplies to Massachusetts. There is, indeed, some evidence that others besides Glover
            helped to procure the press and fonts of type for the new colony.</p>
          <p>Speculation about these circumstances by writers on the Press seems to stem almost
            completely from two entries made by the third president of Harvard College, Leonard
            Hoar, in the early records of the college. In 1674 Hoar, attempting to list for
            posterity various benefactors of Harvard in its early days, wrote down seven names as
            follows: <q>
              <l>Benefactors to the first ffont of</l>
              <l>Letters for printing in Cambridge.</l>
              <l>Their names collected p L H 1674</l>
              <pb n="003.268"/>
              <l>Major Thomas Clark</l>
              <l>Capt James Oliver</l>
              <l>Capt Allen</l>
              <l>Capt Lake</l>
              <l>Mr Stoddard</l>
              <l> ffreake</l>
              <l> Hues<ref target="f003.20.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref></l>
            </q> At a different time, but during his twenty-seven months as President, Hoar
            collected and entered the following information: </p>
          <q>
            <p>Mr Joss: Glover gave to the Colledge a ffont of printing Letters.</p>
            <p>Some Gentlemen of Amsterdam gave towards the furnishing of a Printing-Press with
              Letters gave [sic] fourty nine pound &amp; something more.<ref target="f003.20.02"
                n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>
            </p>
          </q>
          <p>The purpose of this note is to correct a widely-accepted legend that identifies the
            seven names on the list made by Hoar with the "Gentlemen of Amsterdam." Both of Hoar's
            entries were printed by Thomas in 1810, but Roden seems to have been the first to make
            this identification with a misleading passage in his <hi rend="italic">Cambridge
              Press</hi> (1905), pp. 10-11: <q>At his [Glover's] own expense he provided a font of
              type and procured funds from friends in England and Holland for a complete printing
              establishment, '&pound;49 and something more' being donated by seven men whose names
              were collected by Leonard Hoar in 1674: Major Thomas Clarke, Captain James Oliver,
              Captain Allen, Captain Lake, Mr. Stoddard, Mr. Freake, and Mr. Hues.</q> An
            examination of the actual information as preserved in the manuscript records at Harvard
            shows that Roden came to the wrong conclusion. The list of names and the entry about the
            benefactors of Amsterdam are not even preserved in the same volume of records; thus
            there is no physical connection between these two scraps of information, and the sum of
            &pound;49 is wrongly associated with the seven English names.</p>
          <p>G. P. Winship has helped to perpetuate this false identification, first in an article
            in 1938<ref target="f003.20.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> and again in a
            further consideration of the Cambridge Press in 1939.<ref target="f003.20.04" n="4"><hi
                rend="super">4</hi></ref> Finally, in 1945, when Mr. Winship wrote his extensive
            monograph <pb n="003.269"/> on the Cambridge Press, he printed the two excerpts from the
            early Harvard records and then wrote the following: <q>The two entries made at different
              times must refer to the same gift, and this gift must have been made before a press
              was set up in the colony. . . . There are circumstances which render an Amsterdam
              contribution toward a New England venture at the time explicable. . . . Holland had
              long been the principal purveyor of type and supplies to English printers. The Dutch
              ports were the most frequented commercial centers of northern Europe, and their normal
              trading advantages were strengthened for English merchants by the large numbers of
              disaffected fellow countrymen who were living in the Low Countries. Taking these
              factors into account it would not be surprising if a group of shipmasters and
              supercargoes engaged in the Massachusetts Bay trade, happening to sit together of an
              evening, agreed that it might be a profitable speculation to help to establish a
              printing shop overseas where the illicit Puritan printing that was being suppressed in
              Holland could be done without danger of interference. Circumstances can be imagined
              which might have led such a group to contribute generously to such a proposal.<ref
                target="f003.20.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref></q></p>
          <p>Although thus conjecturally connected by Winship, there is nothing implicit in the
            entries to suggest that the seven names might be identified as the gentlemen of
            Amsterdam. Furthermore, none of the scholars who have written about the Cambridge Press
            seem to have investigated the list to see if the names may not be identifiable.
            Actually, such an investigation provides proof that the names are not those of the
            gentlemen of Amsterdam. Instead, at least four of them can be positively identified as
            residents of New England many years after the printing house at Cambridge was
            established. Major Thomas Clark was actually an Overseer of Harvard College during
            Hoar's administration;<ref target="f003.20.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref>
            Captain James Oliver was a resident of Massachusetts and had given money to Harvard
            about twenty years before Hoar recorded his name;<ref target="f003.20.07" n="7"><hi
                rend="super">7</hi></ref> Mr. Stoddard was both an Overseer of the College and its
            Librarian: he had not yet been born when the Cambridge Press was founded.<ref
              target="f003.20.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> There was a Captain John Allen
            who lived <pb n="003.270"/> in Massachusetts at this time, although identification of
            him as a benefactor of Harvard College cannot be definite.<ref target="f003.20.09" n="9"
                ><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> Mr. Freake cannot be positively identified, although
            two English brothers, Ralph and John Freck, are known to have given books to the Harvard
            Library not long before Hoar's administration.<ref target="f003.20.10" n="10"><hi
                rend="super">10</hi></ref> Lake and Hues do not seem to appear in early
            Massachusetts records.</p>
          <p>There seems no doubt, then, that in light of this information all previous speculations
            that Hoar's two entries refer to the same gift are erroneous.</p>

                brothers to the Harvard Library. Ralph gave the College, Bryan Walton's <hi

                one of the proudest possessions of the early Harvard Library. In 1667 the College
                sent him in return a copy of the first edition of Eliot's Indian Bible, which was
                inscribed in part to him as 'a Noble benefator [sic] to the abouesayd Colledge.'
                Ralph Freck passed the copy on to the Bodleian (both Frecks were Oxford graduates)
                where it is still preserved.</p>

            <p>To this day the question of who first cast type in America remains unsettled.
              Although the claims in behalf of Abel Buell, of Connecticut, are the strongest, there
              remains an element of doubt.<ref target="f003.21.02" n="2"><hi rend="super"
                >2</hi></ref></p>
            <p>That we cannot be certain is due largely to a statement in the <hi rend="italic"
                >Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News-Letter</hi> for September 7, 1769,
              that "Printing Types are also made by Mr. Mitchelson of . . . [Boston] equal to any
              imported from Great-Britain." This casual remark seems destined to cast a lengthening
              shadow over the problem of Buell's priority. It is given further weight by the
              statement made by Isaiah Thomas in his <hi rend="italic">History of Printing in
                America</hi> that "An attempt was made to establish a foundry for casting types in
              Boston about 1768, by a Mr. Mitchelson from Scotland, but he did not succeed."</p>
            <p>The "Mr. Mitchelson" of the <hi rend="italic">Massachusetts Gazette</hi> and of
              Isaiah Thomas has been plausibly identified by Mr. Lawrence Wroth as David Mitchelson,
              who had arrived in Boston from Scotland in October, 1764. He was a member of the
              religious sect called Sandemanians, the leader of which, Robert Sandeman, came to
              America at the same time. By trade he was a goldsmith and lapidary&mdash;like
              Gutenberg, and like Abel Buell as well&mdash;and thereby qualified, at least by
              precedent, to turn his skill to casting type.</p>
            <pb n="003.271"/>
            <p>In discussing Mitchelson's possible merits as a type founder, in the appendix to his
                <hi rend="italic">Abel Buell of Connecticut</hi>, Mr. Wroth suggests that Mitchelson
              was working in co-operation with John Mein, the Boston bookseller and partner in the
              printing shop of Mein and Fleeming.<ref target="f003.21.03" n="3"><hi rend="super"
                  >3</hi></ref> That Wroth does so is on the basis of a letter from Benjamin Gale to
              Ezra Stiles of April 1, 1769, where Gale writes, "However as Buel is jealous of his
              being intercepted by Mein you will not mention Bismuths entring that Composition." The
              context implies that Mein, like Buell, was interested in the founding of type, and Mr.
              Wroth is able to assume that Mein was linked with Mitchelson's activities.</p>
            <p>The conjunction is a reasonable one. Mein and Mitchelson were probably acquainted,
              for they apparently were fellow-passengers aboard the shop <hi rend="italic">George
                and James</hi> which brought Mein to America. That Mein was also a Sandemanian is
              not known, but a member of the Sandeman family was a partner in the first shop he set
              up in Boston. His subsequent partner, John Fleeming, had also come to New England
              earlier in 1764, and had, with William McAlpine, printed <hi rend="italic">Some
                Thoughts on Christianity</hi>, the first work by Robert Sandeman to be published in
              America.</p>
            <p>But can we, even so, find any evidence that Mitchelson did cast type, to substantiate
              his reported efforts? And are we justified in connecting him with John Mein?</p>
            <p>Before Mein set up his shop with John Fleeming he apparently employed William
              McAlpine to do his printing. Early in 1767 he and Fleeming began to issue works with a
              joint imprint which are distinctive in a curious bold-face roman type so unusual as to
              make its presence valid evidence of Mein and Fleeming printing even when their imprint
              does not appear on the title-page.<ref target="f003.21.04" n="4"><hi rend="super"
                  >4</hi></ref> As a type face it is a prototype of that which became so popular in
              the early nineteenth century, when it came to be known in the printing trade as
              "Scotch" type.</p>
            <p>The need for accounting for the Mein and Fleeming type is perhaps the strongest
              support for Mitchelson's actual activity as a type founder and for linking him to John
              Mein that exists. For if Mitchelson did not cast the type, who did?</p>
            <p>Although Mr. Wroth has noted the use of this bold-face roman only in Boston at a
              slightly later period (when the type may have come from Fleeming's possession after
              Mein's departure for England late in 1769), and by John Carter in Providence, it does
              occur in other printing of the 1770's. For instance, John <pb n="003.272"/> Howe, the
              printer set up by the British forces in Newport during their occupation of the town,
              possessed a supply, probably brought from Boston.</p>
            <p>More significant is the fact that Alexander Purdie, of Williamsburg, like-wise
              employed it in his <hi rend="italic">Virginia Gazette</hi> and elsewhere, such as the
              title-page of <hi rend="italic">The Proceedings of the Convention of Delegates . . .
                the 6th of May</hi>, 1776.<ref target="f003.21.05" n="5"><hi rend="super"
                >5</hi></ref> John Dunlap, of Philadelphia, is also known to have used it.</p>
            <p>Despite the fact that Dunlap came from northern Ireland (which was, none the less,
              culturally and economically related to Scotland), it is noteworthy that Alexander
              Purdie, like both Mein and Fleeming, was a Scotchman. If our bold-face roman type was
              not cast in America, it is probable that it came from Scotland, as suggested by the
              popular name given to its descendants. According to Isaiah Thomas, Fleeming in 1766
              had returned to Scotland to secure printing supplies: that these included type
              follows.</p>
            <p>A comprehensive examination of Scottish books of the period has not been feasible,
              but it may be noted that the first edition of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclop&oelig;dia
                Britannica</hi>, the publication of which was completed in 1771, is in the same
              bold-face roman. Scattered instances of its use are found in other British works such
              as William Woty's <hi rend="italic">Poetical Works</hi> (London, G. Scott, 1770), and
              for the text of John Tait's <hi rend="italic">Poetical Legends</hi> (London, J.
              Donaldson, 1775). That the printer of the latter, John Donaldson, was a Scotchman may
              be deduced on the basis of his name alone; but before moving to London he had in fact
              been a printer in Edinburgh. On the other hand, the London, 1767, edition of Tissot's
                <hi rend="italic">Advice to the People</hi>, cited by Mr. Wroth as an English use of
              the type, proves to be an American edition with a false imprint.<ref
                target="f003.21.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref></p>
            <p>In their <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Specimens of Printing Types</hi> (London,
              1935), W. T. Berry and A. F. Johnson list no Scottish examples of the 1760's or 1770's
              other than those issued by Alexander Wilson. A comparison of Wilson's faces with the
              Mein and Fleeming types eliminates effectively any likelihood that Wilson produced the
              latter. During this period there was, however, another type founder in Scotland, a
              relatively obscure person named John Baine. Mr. George H. Bushnell, Librarian of St.
              Andrews University, is currently engaged on a biography of him, but as yet very little
              is known regarding Baine. At one time a partner of Alexander Wilson, Baine appears to
              have been active many years before the appearance of his first recorded type specimen
              book, <hi rend="italic">A Specimen of Printing Types by John Baine &amp; Grandson
                &amp; Co.</hi> (Edinburgh, 1787). Of it a unique copy, which belonged to Isaiah
              Thomas, is preserved at the American Antiquarian Society. A comparison of Mein's type
              specimen sheet of <hi rend="italic">ca.</hi> 1768 with the Baine types leaves no more
              than a perfunctory doubt that it was from Baine that Mein and Fleeming secured their
              type.</p>
            <pb n="003.273"/>
            <p>The possibility that the Mein and Fleeming type may none the less have been cast in
              America from matrices supplied by Baine is largely disposed of by at least one strange
              phenomenon observed in printing done by their shop. In setting <hi rend="italic">A
                Sermon Delivered July 31st, 1768</hi>, by Sylvanus Conant (Boston, 1768), the
              compositor, probably following the author's copy, set the words "Lord" and "God" in
              large capitals throughout the work. Its theological nature, needless to say, gave
              frequent occasion for their appearance. A close examination of some of the capital O's
              reveals a slight deformity at the foot of the letter which on further scrutiny proves
              to be a vestige of the tail of a Q. The demand for capital O's for the words "Lord"
              and "God" may well have taxed the resources of the shop: in any event, the Q's were
              obviously cut down either for this or an earlier need. The same modified Q's will be
              found in the running titles of Mein's newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Boston
                Chronicle</hi>, which were kept as standing type during the early months of its
              career. Amusing as this is as a demonstration of the printer's ingenuity, its
              importance for us lies in the fact that, if matrices were available, to cast the
              needed O's would have been easier than to file off the tails of the Q's.</p>
            <p>Whatever the truth may be regarding the newspaper reference to Mitchelson, there is
              even less reason for linking him with the Scotch type of Mein and Fleeming, in face of
              a recognized source for it in the foundry of John Baine. It is perhaps wisest and
              safest to accept Isaiah Thomas's statement that in his efforts to set up a foundry
              Mitchelson did not succeed. If Mein were associated with him, then Mein had other more
              pressing problems on his hands, for the year 1769 found Mein engaged in political
              controversy which led to his being mobbed in the streets of Boston and to an
              ignominious flight to England.</p>

            <p>In attributing the Mein and Fleeming type to John Baine, a new pattern in American
              type history is made possible, a new continuity with British typography established.
              In his essay on "British Influences upon American Printing," recently published in his
                <hi rend="italic">Typographic Heritage</hi> (1949), Mr. Wroth recognizes the
              r&ocirc;le played by John Baine and his grandson in casting the type used by Thomas
              Dodson in printing Rees's <hi rend="italic">Encyclop&oelig;dia</hi>, although the face
              used is a traditional face unlike the bold-face roman of Mein and Fleeming.</p>
            <p>Continuing, Mr. Wroth speaks of the work of Binny and Ronaldson of Philadelphia, the
              first type founders to achieve significant and lasting stature in America. Both were
              Scotchmen, and in the partnership it was Binny who contributed the knowledge of
              printing and of punch cutting. Although they began business in 1797 their first
              specimen book of types did not appear until 1812. Of the two distinct faces displayed,
              the first was a transitional letter which, recast in recent times, has been named
              "Oxford," and, even more recently, has been recut by the Linotype Company as
              "Monticello."</p>
            <pb n="003.274"/>
            <p>The other face cast by Binny and Ronaldson is one which, in Stanley Morison's words,
              is a "fat grotesque," one of the "bold, bad faces" which none the less achieved great
              popularity. But in speaking at some length of this face Mr. Wroth does not call
              attention to the fact that its resemblance to the Baine type is most remarkable. The
              obvious question arises: Was there any connection between Baine and his fellow Scots
              Binny and Ronaldson?</p>
            <p>The evidence for such a connection is at present inconclusive. The research in which
              Mr. P. J. Conkwright, of the Princeton University Press, is currently engaged
              concerning Binny and Ronaldson should ultimately clarify the matter. In the meantime
              we do know that Baine and his grandson came to Philadelphia around 1790, where shortly
              thereafter the elder man died. There is reason to believe that Binny was as a young
              man apprenticed to Baine, and the ledgers of the firm record that on June 12, 1799, J.
              Baine (presumably the grandson) sold to Binny and Ronaldson &dollar;300 worth of
              tools. What these tools included is not specified, but in the sale there is evidence
              of continuity. That the boldface Binny and Ronaldson type is a lineal descendant of
              the Baine face becomes a very real possibility.<ref target="f003.21.07" n="7"><hi

            <head type="divisional">III.</head>
            <p>As the innovator of the type known as "Scotch" John Baine's significance is
              consequently far greater than has been hitherto acknowledged in the history of
              typography, both in America and in Great Britain. As a result, the importance ascribed
              to Richard Austin and to Robert Thorne by A. F. Johnson, discussing the evolution of
              modern-face roman in his <hi rend="italic">Type Designs</hi> (1934) should be
              reevaluated and reconsidered. Obscure as he may have been, to Baine should apparently
              be attributed the bold-face roman type which, unfortunately, makes so much early
              nineteenth-century printing hideous to our eyes.</p>

            <name type="author">William H. Gaines, Jr.</name>
          </head>
          <p>The early summer of the third year of the Revolutionary War was a period of crisis for
            the struggling colonials. One British army under General Burgoyne had launched an
            invasion of New York State from Canada and, having conquered Ticonderoga, was moving
            down the Hudson towards Albany. Another, commanded by General Sir William Howe, was
            being herded aboard the troopships that were to take them from New York to the Head of
            Elk in Maryland, from which they were to march overland to the rebel capital at <pb
              n="003.275"/> Philadelphia. In that city, the Continental Congress was busy with the
            varied complex of problems, military, diplomatic, and financial, that were all crying
            for attention and action.</p>
          <p>There, on the seventh of July, 1777, a petition from a group of Presbyterian clergymen
            was received, which called on the Congress to underwrite the printing of an edition of
            the Bible for the use of patriot families. This petition was sponsored by the Reverend
            Francis Allison, assistant pastor of the first Presbyterian church of Philadelphia; John
            Ewing, provost of the University of Pennsylvania; and William Marshall. These gentlemen
            were much concerned over the lack of Bibles in the colonies and the difficulty of
            importing them from abroad, and they apparently felt that a war for liberty could not be
            won by bullets alone. The petition<ref target="f003.22.01" n="1"><hi rend="super"
              >1</hi></ref> was immediately referred to a committee consisting of John Adams of
            Massachusetts, Daniel Roberdeau and Jonathan Bayard Smith of Philadelphia.<ref
              target="f003.22.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
          <p>The petition, the original manuscript of which appears in the Papers of the Continental
            Congress, is printed here below for the first time: <list>
              <item>1. As the Price of Bibles for the Use of Families and Schools is greatly
                advanced beyond what was formerly given for them, thro their Scarcity and Difficulty
                in importing them from Europe, it is highly expedient for Congress to order a common
                Bible to be printed under their Inspection for the Use of y<hi rend="super">e</hi>
                united States of America.</item>
              <item>2. That as there are about 500,000 families in the united States, each standing
                in Need of one or more Bibles, many Thousand Copies of the holy Scriptures are
                immediately wanted and ought to be furnished at a moderate Price.</item>
              <item>3. That as there are not Types in America to answer this Purpose, there should
                be a compleat Font, sufficient for setting the whole Bible at once, imported by
                Congress at the Public Expence, to be refunded in a stipulated Time by the
                Printer.</item>
              <item>4. That in Order to prevent the Paper Makers from demanding an extravagant Price
                for the Paper, and retarding the Work by Breach of Contract or otherwise there
                should also be imported with the Types a few Reams of Paper, not exceeding a
                thousand, at the Beginning of the Work, to be paid for by the Printer in y<hi
                  rend="super">e</hi> same Manner as y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Types are to be paid
                for.</item>
              <item>5. That a Printer be employed, who shall undertake the Work at his own Risque
                &amp; Expence, giving a Mortgage on y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Font &amp; Printing
                Materials, with sufficient Personal Securities for his Fidelity, until the first
                Cost of y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Font, y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Paper, &amp; such
                Sums of Money as the Congress may think proper to advance to him for Dispatch of the
                Work, be refunded to the Public.</item>
              <pb n="003.276"/>
              <item>6. That in Order to render the Price of Binding as low as possible, the Congress
                order their Commissary General for Hides etc to deliver to the Printer at a moderate
                Price all the Sheep Skins furnished at y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Camp, to be tanned
                for this Purpose.</item>
              <item>7. That the Printer be bound under sufficient Penalties to furnish Bibles to
                  y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Public at a limited Price, not exceeding ten Shillings
                each, &amp; to prevent any Retailer, under him in the united States from asking an
                higher price on any Pretence whatsoever.</item>
              <item>8. That, as the greatest Precaution is necessary to preserve the sacred Text
                uncorrupted &amp; free from Errors, an accurate &amp; skillful Corrector of the
                Press be employed at a proper Salary, to superintend the Impression, untill the
                whole Bible be composed: and then that the Frames be carefully locked up in proper
                Places prepared for y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Purpose, to guard against an accidental
                or designed Alteration of them, and to have them ready for constant Use to supply
                the Public Demand.</item>
              <item>9. That the Printer on no Pretence whatsoever presume to strike off any Sheet of
                the Bible, untill the Corrector has examined a sufficient Number of Proofs &amp;
                judged it to be sufficiently accurate &amp; corrected: and that this Precaution be
                taken as often as any Frame is used after having been locked up for some Time
                past.</item>
              <item>10. That y<hi rend="super">e</hi> most correct Copy of the Bible that can be
                found be delivered by y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Congress to the Printer, who shall be
                bound by solemn Oath not to vary from it knowingly in his Edition, even in a single
                Iota, without first laying the proposed Alteration before Congress &amp; obtaining

          <p>This was no ordinary printing job which Mr. Allison had proposed and of which Congress
            was expected to dispose. Up to 1777, there had been no complete English Bible printed in
            the colonies, and the English-speaking inhabitants depended on British presses for their
            copies of the Scriptures. There had been Bibles printed in the colonies, but these had
            been in non-English tongues and <pb n="003.277"/> had been produced in relatively small
            numbers. Thus, as early as 1663, Samuel Green and Marmaduke Johnson of Cambridge,
            Massachusetts, had issued one such printed in the Maumee tongue, the <hi rend="italic"
              >lingua franca</hi> of the New England Indians. This was the famous and rare Eliot
            Bible, prepared by the Reverend John Eliot for the use of Congregationalist missionaries
            to the red heathens of Massachusetts. Then, in 1743, Christopher Saur, a Rhenish German
            printer settled in Germantown, Pa., issued a Bible in German, the first to be published
            in a European tongue in North America. Even Saur had had to use imported paper and type.
            However, another edition of the German Bible, which appeared in 1763, was the first to
            use American-made paper. Then, in 1776, Saur's son, also Christopher, published the
            first Bible to be printed from American-cast types. However, these were all limited
            editions, the Saur or German Bible, running only to 1200 copies, while the third or 1777
            edition to only 3000.<ref target="f003.22.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> The
            project now before Congress, on the other hand, called for 20,000 English Bibles to be
            run off by an American printer at a time when every resource was at least theoretically
            devoted to war production. However, the committee to which Mr. Allison's petition had
            been referred began studying the most practicable way of solving the problem, and before
            arriving at a solution turned to the printers of Philadelphia, inviting them to submit
            estimates and to give their advice on the best way to print 20,000 Bibles. This was
            quite natural, since at that time many of the competent printshops in the Confederation
            were located in that city. Of the other two colonial printing centers, New York was in
            the hands of the enemy, while Boston was many days' hard travel from the capital of the
            Confederation. At least five printers, all of them Pennsylvanians, submitted estimates
            in which every phase of the work, the cost of every piece of equipment and every
            material was quoted.</p>
          <p>One of those submitting bids was Robert Aitken<ref target="f003.22.04" n="4"><hi
                rend="super">4</hi></ref> (1734-1806), a Quaker of Scotch birth, who was already
            established in his profession by his work as publisher of the <hi rend="italic"
              >Pennsylvania Magazine</hi> and of an edition of the New Testament. Figuring 24 pages
            to each sheet and the weight<ref target="f003.22.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>
            of type necessary to print one sheet at 144 (6 per page), he estimated a total of 34
            sheets (or 4896 wt) for the entire job, then added 600 additional weight of type to
            reach an estimated font of 5496 weight of type for the whole. Allowing a cost of 5
            shillings per sheet or per 144 weight of type, Aitken set the cost of type alone at 1374
            pounds. Although the specifications called for the use of nonpareil type, Aitken,
            feeling that this type would wear out sooner than brevier "being of smaller face,"
            maintained that 200,000<ref target="f003.22.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref>
            Bibles could be run off from the latter, and submitted <pb n="003.278"/> a sample sheet
            of the Bible printed in this type. The types, he thought, should be purchased at the
            foundry of Dr. Wilson in Glasgow, for these produced "the best metal and the neatest
            letter in Europe." Aitken made no suggestions, however, as to how the embattled colonies
            were to obtain this superior metal while Glasgow remained loyal to the Crown and while
            the British fleet maintained its blockade.</p>
          <p>As for paper, Aitken based his estimates on a total of 200,000 Bibles and called for
            146,000 reams, 73 reams sufficing to print a thousand. Since the domestic product seemed
            adequate neither in quality nor quantity, he advised that this commodity be imported
            from Germany or France and allowed a cost of 15 shillings per ream or a total cost of
            10,950 pounds. (At this rate, 20,000 would have cost 1095 pounds.) By way of fixed
            equipment, he felt 13 presses, one of which was to be used for running proofs, would be
            necessary. These like "penny pies" could be obtained for 10 pounds each in Glasgow, but
            for not less than 42 pounds in Pennsylvania. It is significant that he used the lower
            figure in totalling up his estimates. Chases, 84 of which were necessary, were
            obtainable for 3 pounds each in the colonies but could be had for only 15 shillings each
            in that paradise for impecunious printers, the loyal city of Glasgow. A labor force of 6
            compositors and 24 printers (2 to a press) could complete the work, Aitken felt, in 20
            months. Calculating from the price of leather then prevailing, he estimated the binding
            cost per volume at 4 shillings. Arriving at a total cost for the job of 33,281 pounds, 5
            shillings and 4 pence (after allowing for a difference of 66-2/3 in the exchange price
            of all material imported from abroad), Aitken showed that the actual cost per Bible was
            only 3 shillings 4 pence apiece.</p>
          <p>Another printer who submitted a bid on the job was Thomas Bradford (1745-1838), son of
            "the patriot printer," William Bradford, and co-publisher with him of the <hi
              rend="italic">Pennsylvania Journal</hi>.<ref target="f003.22.07" n="7"><hi
                rend="super">7</hi></ref> He submitted two sets of estimates, one for printing
            20,000 Bibles and one for 30,000. For the former number, he estimated that 1100 reams of
            paper would be sufficient, whereas 2000 reams would be necessary for an edition of
            30,000 copies. Bradford, like the other printers, was acutely aware of the paper
            shortages within the colonies and advised that that commodity be imported from either
            France or Holland, where it was obtainable for 6 to 8 shillings the ream, and expressed
            a preference for the Dutch product. His type estimates, which he based on a Bible of 45
            sheets, each taking a font of 200, allowed for imperfections and deterioration, for he
            called for a font of 10,000 weight. He estimated that 8 hands could complete the job in
            6 months, and he fixed the expenses of composition at 14 pounds per sheet and press
            costs at 20 pounds. Apart from his estimates and possibly looking to his <pb n="003.279"
            /> own interests in the event that the Congress should award him the contract, Bradford
            recommended that no Bibles be imported, once the Congressional edition was completed,
            for ten to fifteen years. He was the only one of the five printers to make this
            suggestion specifically.</p>
          <p>The founder of the <hi rend="italic">Pennsylvania Packet</hi> and the man who had
            printed the Declaration of Independence, John Dunlap, also entered the competition on
            July 10, 1777.<ref target="f003.22.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> Dunlap
            estimated that 300 pounds of type would be necessary to set one sheet, but pointed out
            that it would be desirable to obtain a total of 8000 weight to set all sheets at once,
            since the types were so small and delicate that they would be worn out "if frequently
            worked." Paper, which might formerly have been purchased from Great Britain at 10
            shillings per ream, posed a problem. Dunlap hoped that if enough could be imported to
            begin the job, he would be able to get the remaining stock made in Pennsylvania. The
            cost of paper and type was estimated by him at 4000 pounds sterling, and he allowed
            &dollar;500 for labor. Binding would cost 4 shillings per volume.</p>
          <p>Another printer who submitted estimates on the Congressional Bible was Henry Miller
            (1702-1782), native of Waldeck, Germany, and publisher of the <hi rend="italic"
              >Wochentliche Philadelphische Staatsbote</hi>.<ref target="f003.22.09" n="9"><hi
                rend="super">9</hi></ref> Allowing a font of 156 weight for each sheet and figuring
            that 35 sheets would be necessary for the work, Miller stipulated a total type weight of
            5460, but allowed an additional 1360 to allow for errors. He estimated that the type
            alone would cost 1687 pounds 10 shillings, and pointed out that types of good metal and
            having the proper depth would be sufficient for two impressions of 10,000 copies each.
            While making no estimate of the quantity or cost of paper needed, the German felt that
            it should be made by master workmen in that craft, "which will hardly be possible in
            this Country at this present time." Pointing out that the number of printers and
            compositors would have to be fixed "and their attendance assured" before an estimate
            could be made on the time to finish the job, he guessed that it could not be done in
            much less than a year. As leather was not to be had, he refrained from making any
            estimate of binding costs.</p>
          <p>The last of the Philadelphia group submitting bids was William Sellers (1725?-1804),
            who had served his apprenticeship in London before he set up his shop in Philadelphia in
            1764 and who with David Hall had published the <hi rend="italic">Pennsylvania
              Gazette</hi>.<ref target="f003.22.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> Sellers
            figured on a total font of 6000 weight, which would cost about 1500 pounds sterling. If
            these were cut "clear and deep," he felt that they would suffice for two impressions of
            10,000 copies each, but a third impression from the same type could not be expected to
            be as satisfactory. Calling for approximately 1500 reams of paper, he found no
            satisfactory supply <pb n="003.280"/> existing in the United States, and thereby implied
            the need for importation. As to the time element, Sellers thought that two compositors
            might set the whole in nine months, and that two presses could run off 10,000 copies in
            the same length of time.</p>
          <p>The committee considered these propositions for a little better than two months before
            it reported to the Congress. In that interval, the military developments had been
            sufficiently disastrous to the American cause that all but the most urgent business was
            delayed. By the 25th of August, "Blue Billy" Howe's expeditionary force had established
            a beachhead at the Head of Elk in Maryland and was deploying for a strike at
            Philadelphia itself. By the tenth of September, that army had defeated Washington's at
            the Battle of the Brandywine, and only the Schuylkill river stood between the invaders
            and the capital of the Confederation. In the north, the news was not so bad, but it was
            bad enough. Burgoyne had advanced almost to the junction of the Mohawk and Hudson
            rivers, and though both his right and left wings had been defeated, he was still in a
            position to capture Albany and to seize the Hudson Valley for the Crown. Benedict Arnold
            and Daniel Morgan were to annihilate this threat at the battle of Bemis's Heights in
            late September, but at the time it seemed very likely that Gentleman Johnny's reckless
            stroke would succeed.</p>
          <p>Thus, on the eleventh of September, Mr. Adams, Mr. Roberdeau, and Mr. Smith submitted
            their report on Mr. Allison's petition to a Congress that undoubtedly was more concerned
            with the military situation, particularly the one on its own doorstep. The committee,
            tacitly considering the advice of the Philadelphia printers, but also, it must seem,
            influenced by the nearness of Blue Billy's veterans, reported unfavorably on the
            project. Noting that "the proper types . . . are not to be had in this country" and that
            "the paper cannot be procured but with such difficulties and subject to such casualties
            as render any dependance on it altogether improper," the committee's report dwelt on
            "the risque of importing them" and on the uncertainty of any calculations of expenses
            "in the present state of affairs." Thus, they recommended that no attempt be made to
            import these materials. Recognizing, however, that "the use of the Bible is so universal
            and its importance so great," they recommended also that the Committee of Commerce be
            ordered to import the 20,000 Bibles from Holland, Scotland "or elsewhere." A motion to
            this effect was approved with all four New England states, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and
            Georgia supporting the measure, while New York, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and both
            Carolinas opposed it. The resolution being read a second time, final action was put off
            until the nineteenth.<ref target="f003.22.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref></p>
          <pb n="003.281"/>
          <p>Before that date, however, the body was concerned almost exclusively in finding enough
            reenforcements to stop Howe and save Philadelphia. On the eighteenth, the emperilled
            legislators discreetly resolved to adjourn their deliberations to the more restful
            atmosphere of Lancaster. Two days later, General Charles Grey surprised the usually
            vigilant Anthony Wayne in his bivouac at Paoli; Howe slipped across the Schuylkill with
            his main body; and on Friday, the twenty-sixth of September, the British marched into
            the erstwhile Continental capital. The government in exile at Lancaster returned to
            Philadelphia the following summer, but it did not resume the Bible project until 1782.
            In that year, the Quaker printer, Robert Aitken, working under Congressional auspices,
            produced the first complete Bible printed in English in the New World.<ref
              target="f003.22.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> But by then, Philadelphia
            had been four years restored to American rule, France had recognized the independence of
            the revolted colonies, and Yorktown had been fought and won. The new nation, though far
            from being out of the political or financial woods, no longer had a well-armed hostile
            army on the outskirts of its capital. A printing project, which the exigencies of war
            and invasion had made impractical and relatively unimportant, became attainable within a
            year after Cornwallis' surrender.</p>

          <p>The Huth Catalogue<ref target="f003.23.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> in 1880
            described two different states of the 1651 Farrer Map of Virginia, and Col. Lawrence
            Martin in 1936<ref target="f003.23.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> further
            distinguished a total of four states. There is, however, a copy of the map in the
            Huntington Library which was pulled from an earlier state of the plate than any
            previously described. It can be distinguished from the earliest of Col. Martin's states
            by the absence of the words "Fort Orang." on the right border above "Septen." There is
            no other difference.</p>
          <p>It is not often enough emphasized that 17th-and 18th-century map plates had an active
            life expectancy of well over a decade. The Jefferys' plates for the 18th-century Fry
            &amp; Jefferson Map of Virginia were, for example, in use for at least 21 years;
            moreover, additions were made to the plates after Jefferys' death.</p>
          <pb n="003.282"/>
          <p>The Farrer Map has peculiar interest as showing the survival of two related but
            inaccurate geographical beliefs: a northwest passage through the North American land
            mass; and the close proximity of the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. Although in general
            the Farrer Map is derived from the more important and more accurate 1646-7 Dudley Map of
              Virginia,<ref target="f003.23.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> it nevertheless
            has a significance of its own in that it places for the first time on any known map the
            names of the original shires: Henrico City, Charles City, Elizabeth City; and Anandale
            County, Maryland. For historical as well as bibliographical reasons, therefore, it is
            worth recording with some care the additions to the plate, with their probable
            dates.</p>
          <p>The map was first engraved by John Goddard for Stephenson's 3rd edition, 1651, of
            Edward Williams' <hi rend="italic">Virgo Triumphans</hi>, which announced the addition
            of the map on its titlepage. This 3rd edition is, however, known only by an inserted
            titlepage in the Huth copy of the 2nd edition. Stephenson also apparently added the map
            to some copies of another of his 1651 publications, Edward Bland's <hi rend="italic">The
              Discovery of New Brittaine</hi>, its relevance to which was, however, only
            approximate, since Bland's explorations were southwest of the chief placename locations
            on the Farrer map. Copies of the two works in question have been so long sought for by
            collectors of Americana and have so often been sophisticated by dealers and binders,
            that it is no longer possible to speak with precision about occurrences of the map with
            either book. It is, however, assumed from available evidence that <list>
              <item>1) Copies of the first and second editions of Williams which contain the map are
                either late gathered copies or sophisticated ones.</item>
              <item>2) Any of the first four states of the map (see below) might properly be found
                with the 3rd edition of Williams, and the 3rd edition would be incomplete without
                one of them.</item>
              <item>3) The copies of the Bland with the Farrer map are accidental, or special
                copies, or sophisticated ones.</item>
              <item>4) The plate was obtained by Overton from Stephenson or his successors, and was
                used by him under his own imprint for separately issued (or Atlas bound) copies of
                the map. The assignment of the date 1667? to the final state of the plate is based
                on indirect evidence in Plomer<ref target="f003.23.04" n="4"><hi rend="super"
                  >4</hi></ref> and on the fact that after 1668 the Term Catalogues carry notices of
                Overton's publications with a different imprint address.</item>

          <p>The lines entitled "Alone," first published in 1875, twenty-six years after Poe's
            death, have been generally accepted by his editors as an early Poe poem.<ref
              target="f003.24.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> Various details concerning the
            background of this poem and bearing on its attribution to Poe have not previously been
            known, for the correspondence of John Ingram, the English biographer of Poe, seems never
            to have been examined for the light it throws on the poem.<ref target="f003.24.02" n="2"
                ><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> In addition to discussing the prepublication
            background of "Alone" and the source from which the poem is derived, this paper will
            present information concerning the manuscript of the poem which only recently has been
            definitely located.</p>
          <p>The poem was first published in <hi rend="italic">Scribner's Magazine</hi> for
            September, 1875, with a prefatory note by Eugene L. Didier, who claimed to have found
            the poem "in the album of a lady of distinguished social position."<ref
              target="f003.24.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> The poem is reproduced in what
            Didier calls "fac-simile," but very likely it is a reproduction either by wood-cut or
            zinc-plate; this is different in several ways from modern <pb n="003.285"/> facsimile
            processes since the hand of the engraver intervenes between the document and its printed
              reproduction.<ref target="f003.24.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref></p>
          <p>Nearly a year before the poem's publication, Didier had offered Ingram on the first of
            October, 1874, a transcript of this poem for &dollar;100, along with other information
            he had been collecting for "five or six years . . . for a correct life of Poe."
            Concerning "Alone," Didier wrote, "I have in my possession a <hi rend="italic">M.
              S.</hi> poem of Poe's which has never been printed. Poe wrote it in a lady's Album in
            this city [Baltimore], from which I copied it. It is dated March 17, 1829, and signed E.
            A. Poe. This will be very valuable to you."<ref target="f003.24.05" n="5"><hi
                rend="super">5</hi></ref> Ingram appears to have been interested enough in this
            writer and the materials he offered to write to a Baltimore friend for details about
            Didier. For, on May 17, 1875, John Parker, an assistant in the Peabody Institute
            Library, wrote Ingram that Didier was "a magazine writer, who had been collecting and
            writing in regard to Poe for some years, but from what I hear of him I do not believe he
            would impart much knowledge."<ref target="f003.24.06" n="6"><hi rend="super"
              >6</hi></ref> Two months later Parker was able to send Ingram a copy of this poem
            under rather strange circumstances: <q>I send you two photographic copies of a poem
              which bears Poe's name and which I have never seen before. I obtained them quite
              accidentally. A gentleman, who is doing some work for our librarian, has invented a
              new style of photography, and one day about a month ago one of his assistants brought
              up to the library some samples of this new mode of photographing manuscripts &amp;c
              and among these samples was this poem. As soon after this as I was able I obtained
              some copies of it and also made enquiries as to where they had seen this poem. All the
              information I could get was that they had photographed it from the autograph album of
              some <pb n="003.286"/> gentleman whose name they did not remember. They also said that
              the page whereon it was written was very yellow with age and that the writing had
              almost faded away.<ref target="f003.24.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref></q>
            Ingram probably had his doubts of the poem's authenticity and must have asked Parker for
            further details; thus, in December, after the poem had appeared in the September <hi
              rend="italic">Scribner's</hi>, Parker wrote: <q>From the photographer of the poem I
              learnt the following items. Mr. Didier borrowed the album containing the poem from its
              owner and brought it to him to have some copies photographed. He kept several copies
              for himself, some of which I sent you. He says he photographed directly from the album
              which was a very old one. Mr. Didier refused to give me the name of the owner of the
              album and insisted that it was Poe's writing. He was rather indignant when I suggested
              to him in a note that it might possibly be a copy of Poe's writing.<ref
                target="f003.24.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref></q></p>
          <p>Later, in an essay on the Virginia Edition of <hi rend="italic">Poe's Works</hi>,
            Didier himself gives us an important piece of information concerning these lines. Again
            claiming the poem to be a genuine one, although Professor Harrison had classed it under
            "Attributed Poems," Didier declared, <q>I discovered it in the autograph album of Mrs.
              Balderston, the wife of Judge Balderston, formerly Chief Judge of the Orphan's Court
              in Baltimore. I had it engraved and published in <hi rend="italic">Scribner's
                Monthly</hi>. I gave the poem the name of "Alone," and dated it, as it had neither
              name nor date, but the poem and signature as published in the magazine are an exact
                <hi rend="italic">fac simile</hi> of the writing in the album.<ref
                target="f003.24.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></q> Thus, although the poem
            purported to be in Poe's handwriting, Didier admitted that he added a title and a date
            to the manuscript. The title has been retained by Poe's editors, but the date has been
            suspect. Although Didier had implied to Ingram that the dating of the poem, "Baltimore,
            March 17, 1829." was in Poe's hand, actually it was his own handwriting. This fictitious
            date has not been accepted by editors: indeed, the chronology of Poe's life does not
            allow acceptance. After the funeral in Richmond of Mrs. Allen, Poe's foster mother, Poe
            had returned to Fortress Monroe by March 10, 1829, and presumably <pb n="003.287"/> was
            there until his discharge from the army on April 15, 1829. Although it is possible that
            he could have visited Baltimore sometime in that month before his discharge from the
            army, a letter from Baltimore, May 20, 1829, seems to indicate that he had but recently
              arrived.<ref target="f003.24.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref></p>
          <p>The handwriting of the poem as it appears in the reproduction in <hi rend="italic"
              >Scribner's</hi> has sometimes been doubted by Poe's editors and friends. For
            instance, Mrs. Whitman, the "Seeress of Providence," was outraged by "so audacious and
            so palpable a forgery." Nevertheless, she saw that the poem might after all be Poe's:
              <q>I think that the <hi rend="italic">poem</hi> might readily be accepted as genuine.
              If it had been in Poe's writing I should not have questioned it even without
              signature. . . . Still, the <hi rend="italic">poem may</hi> be his, but if so why was
              it not given in his own handwriting.<ref target="f003.24.11" n="11"><hi rend="super"
                  >11</hi></ref></q></p>
          <p>Although there are many difficulties in determining the authenticity of the handwriting
            with only the reproduction in <hi rend="italic">Scribner's</hi> as a basis, it is now
            possible to examine the original of the poem, which only recently has been definitely
              located.<ref target="f003.24.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> It is written
            in an early nineteenth-century autograph album, 12.5 by 20.5 centimeters, bound in red
            morocco with gold and black stampings; on the spine in the lettering in gilt, "ALBUM."
            Its pages are numbered in script, the odd numbers on the recto, the even on the verso,
            from 1 to 258. Some of the leaves bear the watermark, inverted, with the outline letters
            "S &amp;A Butler / U S"<ref target="f003.24.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> at
            the fold near the bottom of the sheet. The paper, which is of the "wove" type, appears
            to be fully consistent throughout the album.</p>
          <p>There are seventy-six poems in the album, many of them bearing datelines; these dates
            range from August 1, 1826 (p. 15) to October 7, 1848 (p. 99). Many of the poems bear
            signatures as well: one is signed by Lucy Holmes, the original owner of the album;
            another signature is that of I. Balderston, who <pb n="003.288"/> married Miss Holmes.
            In addition to members of the Balderston and Holmes families, several of the other
            writers can be identified.<ref target="f003.24.14" n="14"><hi rend="super"
            >14</hi></ref></p>
          <p>The poem that is of the greatest interest in the album is that signed "E. A. Poe" (p.
            55). It is headed "Original" and bears no date-line. Yet traces of the title "Alone" and
            the date-line which Didier admitted that he added can be seen, for they appear to have
            been carelessly erased from pencilling. The traces left, however, are sufficient to
            indicate that the writing is that of Didier, and that this is the manuscript that he had
            photographed and from which he was working for the <hi rend="italic">Scribner's</hi>
            publication.</p>
          <p>Of almost equal interest is a poem, p. 51, headed in this way: "by W. H.
            Poe&mdash;copied at his / request by E. A. Poe&mdash;"<ref target="f003.24.15" n="15"
                ><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> Although there is a slight difference in appearance
            in the handwriting of this poem and Poe's own poem, it is very probable that they were
            written by the same person. Especially the formation of short words like <hi
              rend="italic">my</hi> and <hi rend="italic">in</hi>, the long pendulums on certain
            letters, the general cursory nature of the script, and the characteristic of crossing
            the "t" some distance after the letter itself lead me to believe they are in the same
            hand.</p>
          <p>From several pieces of evidence it appears that these are genuine Poe manuscripts.
            First, there are no blank rectos of leaves in the first hundred pages of the album
            except in one instance where a poem is written on the verso following (p. 48). It seems
            rather improbable, then, that two leaves, p. 51 and p. 55, would be left blank (to be
            utilized by a forger) in this rather full first section; the leaving of these rectos
            blank here would be more than chance. The latest poem in the album (p. 99), dated
            October 7, 1848, may indicate that there were no blank rectos suitable for autograph in
            this first section at that time; otherwise, the writer here would have utilized them.
            His alternative was to turn to the back of the album where there are many blank leaves,
            but he seemed to have wanted his poem as near the first of the album as possible, and
            therefore he may have taken the first blank recto he came to.</p>
          <p>Two other items may be mentioned to authenticate the poems: both pages 51 and 55 are
            conjugate to their gathering, and there is no evidence of any kind of insertion of these
            two leaves. The stitching is plainly evident, and it has not been tampered with. The
            other item is a drawing, p. 258, the last page of the album, of a series of visiting
            cards bearing the names of writers in the album. These are the work of a skilled penman,
            and the cards are in contemporary styles of engraved cards. Among these cards is the
            name of "E. A. Poe." The ink used seems to be of the same age throughout this page, and
            the addition <pb n="003.289"/> of Poe's name at a later date might be indicated by a
            difference in ink, which is not present. There is every indication that this card was
            drawn with the others.</p>
          <p>But the most conclusive evidence rests on the handwriting, which examination shows to
            be the same in the two poems. It would seem an unnecessary and almost unbelievable
            forgery to head a poem "by W. H. Poe copied . . . by E. A. Poe," since it would clearly
            be more advantageous for a forger to give us another poem by Edgar Poe. But this problem
            is subordinate to the handwriting of the poem "Alone." The signature of Poe on both
            poems is very similar to those of the Poe letters to John Allan in 1829 and 1830, which
            Mrs. Whitman and Ingram did not know; their conclusion that the poem was not in Poe's
            handwriting was very likely based on the Poe script that they knew, which was some years
            later than the presumed date of this poem. The handwriting within the poems, aside from
            headings and signatures, has been carefully examined for me by several specialists.
            Especially, Mr. Robert W. Hill, Keeper of Manuscripts, The New York Public Library, has
            very generously examined this poem and compared it with Poe letters particularly of the
            years 1829 and 1835. He has written that while this examination has been hindered by the
            necessity of comparing <hi rend="italic">letters</hi> against <hi rend="italic"
              >poem</hi>, "nevertheless, there are common characteristics in both: the 'th,' the
            long pendulums of the 'f,' 'g,' and the 'y' and the beginning strokes of the 'm' and
            'n.'" He summarizes his examination by stating that, "An examination of the photostats
            which have been furnished me and which have been made from the autograph album described
            in this paper leads me to lean toward acceptance of the poem as being in the handwriting
            of Poe."<ref target="f003.24.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref></p>
          <p>Thus this poem which has been long suspect because of the method of first publication
            and the temporary disappearance of this album now seems to be authenticated, and may be
            accepted as a genuine Poe manuscript.</p>
          <p>Poe's editors have generally agreed that, as Killis Campbell describes it, the poem "is
            clearly in Poe's early manner."<ref target="f003.24.17" n="17"><hi rend="super"
              >17</hi></ref> The tone of the poem is certainly not that of the mature poet, but it
            contains many resemblances to his early work. As Swinburne wrote Ingram, the verses
            "seemed to me not unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them."<ref
              target="f003.24.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref> Indeed, the lines are
            particularly infused, as we shall see, with a reflection of Byronism that is very common
            in the early poems. It is likely that Poe had "read all of Byron's poems, and that he
            had read and re-read many of them";<ref target="f003.24.19" n="19"><hi rend="super"
                >19</hi></ref> this early reading obviously <pb n="003.290"/> influenced Poe's
            earliest volumes, and "Alone" shares a kinship with those early volumes because of the
            strong Byronic element common to all of them. While the mere presence of a Byronic
            influence does not guarantee the authenticity of "Alone," it strengthens the claim that
            this is a genuine Poe poem.</p>
          <p>It has not hitherto been pointed out that the first nineteen lines of "Alone" are
            derived from Byron's <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>, II, ii, 50-75, although the last
            three lines are a Po&euml;sque conclusion using only a slight hint from Byron. A
            comparison of Poe's lines and the passage from <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> shows
            clearly the strong similarity of the two.</p>
          <p>Both "Alone" and the speech of Manfred are autobiographical. Both begin with a similar
            phrase, and both put an emphasis on the act of seeing. Manfred declares: <q>
              <l>From my youth upwards,</l>
              <l>My Spirit walked not with the souls of men,</l>
              <l>Nor looked upon the earth with human eyes.</l>
              <l>(ll. 50-52)</l>
            </q> Poe writes: <q>
              <l>From childhood's hour I have not been</l>
              <l>As others were&mdash;I have not seen</l>
              <l>As others saw.</l>
            </q> Both poets continue in the description of their isolation from humanity. In Byron
            it is, <q>
              <l>The thirst of their ambition was not mine,</l>
              <l>The aim of their existence was not mine;</l>
              <l>My joys&mdash; my griefs&mdash; my passions&mdash; and my powers,</l>
              <l>Made me a stranger; though I wore the form,</l>
              <l>I had no sympathy with breathing flesh.</l>
              <l>(ll. 53-57)</l>
            </q> This difference in the poet's passions from those of the common man is reemphasized
            in Poe: <q>
              <l>I could not bring</l>
              <l>My passions from a common spring&mdash;</l>
              <l>From the same source I have not taken</l>
              <l>My sorrow&mdash; I could not awaken</l>
              <l>My heart to joy at the same tone&mdash;</l>
              <l>And all I lov'd&mdash; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> lov'd alone.</l>
            </q>
            <pb n="003.291"/> This is the same sense of isolation that Byron expresses in <q>
              <l>. . . with men, and with the thoughts of men,</l>
              <l>I held but slight communion.</l>
              <l>(II. 60-61)</l>
            </q>
          </p>
          <p>Byron, for dramatic foreshadowing, mentions the "One" who, as Manfred later explains,
            has been destroyed by heart and not by hand. Poe does not reflect these two lines, but
            begins a description, following Byron, of the mystery which binds him, a Byronic love of
            nature. The elements that the two poets mention are similar, Poe's "red cliff of the
            mountain," Byron's "iced mountain top," Poe's "the torrent, or the fountain," Byron's, <q>
              <l>to plunge</l>
              <l>Into the torrent, and to roll along</l>
              <l>On the swift whirl of the new-breaking wave</l>
              <l>Of river-stream, or Ocean, in their flow.</l>
              <l>(II. 65-68)</l>
            </q> Byron's "the moving moon, / The stars and their development," becomes in in Poe
            "the sun that 'round me roll'd / In its autumn tint of gold." Byron's "the dazzling
            lightnings" is Poe's "the lightning in the sky / As it passed me flying by&mdash;."
            Byron's "the scattered leaves" and "Autumn winds . . . at their evening song" is
            compressed by Poe to "the thunder and the storm."</p>
          <p>Poe's conclusion, <q>
              <l>. . . the cloud that took the form</l>
              <l>(When the rest of Heaven was blue)</l>
              <l>Of a demon in my view,</l>
            </q> is not directly derived from the passage in <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> but was
            perhaps suggested by the Witch of the Alps to whom Manfred had spoken the lines of
            autobiography.</p>
          <p>Here again it appears that Poe was familiar with Byron's writings and did not hesitate
            to rely on them for ideas. It would be interesting to know if Poe composed these lines
            on the spur of the moment for Mrs. Balderston's album. If he did, the performance shows
            a remarkable memory for his reading and an admiration for this particular passage in
            Byron. But, of course, it is possible that he had composed the lines some time before
            and that he took the opportunity of a proffered album to set them down. Although he was
            probably satisfied in the suitability of his paraphrase for a lady's album, he was not
            proud enough of its to include it in his later volume of poems.</p>

              <p>For this information I am grateful to Mr. Rollo G. Silver, Peabody Institute
                Library. In a private communication, October 21, 1949, he writes that, because of
                the use of the word "fac-simile" by Didier, "we may be sure that photography was
                employed." Ringwalt's <hi rend="italic">American Encyclopedia of Printing</hi>
                (1871), states that "wood-engraving, which, as applied to printing purposes,
                precedes all others, still holds a front rank for popular purposes; and its utility
                has been immensely increased during the present century by the readiness and
                certainty with which perfect copies of an engraved block can be electrotyped, and
                the rapidity with which impression can be made on machine presses." (p. 158). It is
                also pointed out that "designs can readilv be photographed on wood for the use of
                the engraver" (p. 348) and, furthermore, on the same page, he states that "various
                attempts have been made to produce cuts capable of being printed on typographic
                presses without the aid of an engraver." Later (p. 506) he notes that zinc plates
                are "specifically useful when only small editions are required." As Mr. Silver
                writes, "we can arrive at the conclusion that the manuscript was printed from a
                plate which may have been made from a wood-cut or from a zinc-plate. The consensus
                of opinion in these parts is that no one person can be sure of identifying the
                method employed." It must be pointed out that, while modern facsimiles do not employ
                a human element, this <hi rend="italic">Scribner's</hi> plate most likely had the
                engraver's hand between the photograph that Didier submitted and the final,
                published plate. Thus handwriting characteristics might be slightly modified, and
                certain irregular formations that might partake of the appearance of forgery could
                very well be incorporated.</p>

              <p>The album in which Poe presumably wrote the poem was described, as pointed out
                above, by Didier on several occasions. However, Poe editors&mdash;not having traced
                the album itself&mdash; have been content perforce to use the <hi rend="italic"
                  >Scribner's</hi> reproduction as a basis for the poem. After many fruitless
                searches, the album now has been located as the property of Mrs. E. H. Welbourn of
                Cantonsville, Maryland, a granddaughter of the original owner. It is through the
                generosity of Mrs. Welbourn that I am able to describe this album and the
                manuscripts it contains.</p>

              <p>Mr. Dard Hunter of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has kindly written to
                me of the history of this firm: it was established in Suffield, Hartford County,
                Connecticut, by Asa Butler and his brother Simeon, in 1816. In 1819 they received
                the first government contract for supplying paper to the United States Senate, which
                before this time had used foreign-made papers. The firm went through several hands,
                and in 1877 the old "Eagle Mill" of the Butler firm was destroyed by fire.</p>

            <hi rend="small-caps">Part I: Incunabula and Early Renaissance, by Rudolph Hirsch<lb/>
              Part II: Later Renaissance to the Present, by Lucy Clark and Fredson Bowers</hi>
          </head>
          <p>A CHECK list of the previous year's bibliographical scholarship will hereafter become a
            regular department in <hi rend="italic">Studies in Bibliography</hi>. The present list
            is experimental: overlooked items will be cumulated in the <date value="1950"
              >1950</date> compilation. The editor would appreciate copies of off-prints or
            collected publications containing material for listing, although reviews cannot be
            undertaken. Interested persons are invited to send references to books or articles which
            should appear here. This annual listing does not propose to treat the large number of
            enumerative catalogues which acquaint scholars with secondary publications in their
            field or assist libraries in the performance of their duties. Instead, the single
            attempt is made to bring together a selective account of primary investigations dealing
            with printing and publishing history, and bibliographical treatment of authors and their
            books, together with such critical or textual studies as are based on bibliographical
            evidence or the interpretation of basic documents. The claims of history have not been
            entirely excluded under these conditions; but in general the emphasis in Part II is
            placed on English and American literature. In Part I some few works on manuscripts are
            noted, but no attempt has been made to collect this material comprehensively. The
            compilers gratefully acknowledge a number of items suggested by Mr. Rollo Silver and
