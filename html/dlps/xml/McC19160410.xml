            <p>
            This camp is a
            delight after Pau.  One is at 
            seemingly perfect liberty and can
            do about as one pleases.  Of course
            it pleases me to go ahead as 
            fast as I can with my work but
            when I’m not working I can do
            what I want and its a great
            relief.  Johnson and Rumsey
            sneaked into Paris.  They are not
            very serious.  All of the fellows
            who were in the Nieuport school
            at Pau are still here and so I
            am with friends.  Due to the
            fact that I’ve had more hours of
            flight on the Nieuport than most
            of the men here I shall probably
            get on the Baby right away.  Up

            to the present I’ve been kept
            running from bureau to bureau.
            </p><p>
            What did you say to the 
            Slades?  I was asking a chap
            here about the blunder I made
            and he said the Slades didn’t
            like it that I blamed them 
            for the result.  You know I
            took especial pains to impress
            Mrs. Slade that it wasn’t her
            party that had fixed me.  I never
            blamed her &mdash; it is of course all
            my fault.  The individual I
            talked with claimed that I
            blamed the Slades in a letter 
            to you.  I wish you would
            try and convince Mrs. Slade
            that she is wrong in thinking
            I attributed anything to her
            party.
            </p><p>
            This place is in the war
            zone and it takes a ^good three days
            for letters to come and to go.

            The American Escadrille thinks
            it will leave for the front
            this week and Kiffin says
            I can get off with them.  I 
            hope so anyway.  Otherwise
            I may have a long wait.
            </p><p>
            It was delightful to
            see you again in Paris and
            I thank you so much for
            making me feel at ease.  I
            had been afraid of looking
            you in the face again.
            </p><p>
            Will you please tell Mary
            Lines that I’m sorry I had
            such a short time and could
            not see her and thank her
            for writing me about Betty.
            The first time I go in I
            shall try my best to see
            her.  I don’t know how to
            get news now tho [sic] I don’t 
            suppose there is any need
            of worrying.

            a machine here yesterday.  His
            gasoline tank exploded and
            no one could get to him.
            </p><p>
            I left the helice in
            charge of the patron of my 
            little hotel (Hotel Beauvau, 24
            Rue Miromesneil) with your
            father’s name on it but I
            do not see the need of 
            bothering Monsieur Guerin When I’ll
            soon be in.
