            <p>
            You are really too
            good to me sending me 
            all those things.  Thank
            you so much for the 
            “Fragments from France”.  It
            is very amusing and I
            never get tired of looking 
            at it.  I thank you
            so much.
            </p><p>
            They moved me
            from the depot d’eclopes
            to the hopital mixte in
            town.  I don’t know why.
            I was better off at the depot.
            
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            The most annoying trouble I
            have now is a small cold
            that makes me cough and
            when I cough my back, or
            rather sides, feel as if they
            were being torn apart, so
            I smoke to keep from coughing
            and the cigarettes will
            probably end in knocking
            me out.  Funny situation.
            </p><p>
            At the gare they
            were going to send me
            to the interior but I
            asked to stay here.  No 
            sense in traveling all
            
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            over France.  I’m in a 
            ward here with a lot
            of soldiers who seem quite
            nice save one who comes 
            to my bed and talks, and
            as he talks he climbs 
            up and puts his face
            nearer and nearer to mine.
            He uses words that are
            such as to cause a spray,
            and I move over and over
            and he follows &mdash; then I
            crawl out of that side
            of the bed and get in 
            the other.  Then he starts
            edging over again and the 
            process goes on until I could
            
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            hit him.  There’s a sister
            in charge who gets off
            a prayer about every hour
            and all the Catholics arise
            and cross themselves.
            Amusing anyway.
            </p><p>
            Hope you don’t tire
            yourself out working Marcelle.
            And thank you again for
            being so nice to me.
            </p>
