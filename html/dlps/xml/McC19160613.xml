            <p>
            It seems years
            since we’ve done anything.
            The weather has been so
            bad.  The other morning, it
            was Saturday, a Boche was
            signaled over Vaux, and I
            happened to be on guard, so
            I had the delightful job
            of flirting with the clouds
            looking for him.  I could see
            no machine so kept on into
            German territory.  It looked
            very calm and peaceful 
            back there.  After twenty
            minutes I thought it
            best to turn and go
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0353" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            towards home.  It seemed
            ages before Verdun came
            to view beneath a hole in
            the clouds.  There is a broad
            brown band north of Verdun
            which marks the territory
            where the fighting has
            taken place.  It does not
            seem of this earth.  At
            each side are shell holes
            but in the brown band
            there are none to be seen.
            They are so numerous that
            they blend into each other.
            What trees there were have
            all gone, and if villages
            were there, there is no
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0352" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            sign of them left.  Even
            the broad white roads
            have vanished as if erased
            from a blackboard.
            Beneath one there are flashes
            as if one turned on a pocket
            lamp.  And the machine rocks.
            Soon there is a puff of
            smoke when the projectile
            explodes.  That’s as much
            as we see of a battle.
            The motor drowns all other
            sounds and we see but
            the flash and smoke.  The
            battle seems quiet and
            still.  It is very weird.
            To see the endless fall of
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0354" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            shells makes one wonder
            how men can stand in the
            face of such fire.  There is
            a haze above Mort Homme &mdash;
            so thick is the smoke.
            But its all silent.  Its queer
            that.  Then away on the
            other side of the lines
            a squadron of Boche planes
            goes by.  Above are little
            black specks.  They are
            the guarding Fokkers.  One
            watches and forgets the
            fight below for one’s
            sphere is the air and 
            there will be something
            coming out of it before long.
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0355" n="[p.5]"/>
            
            And all that passes in 
            silence and one is lonely.
            </p><p>
            Kiffin told me to day
            that you and your
            mother had come to see
            him when he was in
            Paris.  He told me that
            you were entrancing.  His
            description was vague but
            please remember the
            combination you had
            for I want to see
            you dressed in that
            way.  Not that you are
            not always entrancing 
            but your “get up” that
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0357" n="[p.6]"/>
            
            day was something
            very extra from all 
            accounts.
            </p><p>
            I suppose you
            have received my last 
            letter from here.  I’ve
            been hoping to receive
            news of you ever since
            I left Luxeuil.  It won’t
            be much more that
            two months before I
            am allowed a “permission”.
            I’m looking forward to
            that with delight.
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0356" n="[p.7]"/>
            
            You’ll see Lovell before
            long.  He’s leaving soon.
            </p><p>
            Paul writes me that
            he’s passed several very
            delightful times with
            you.  Great to be all
            in a little family like
            that.  Betty is back 
            in Paris, as you probably 
            know, and seems quite
            normal in her letters.
            She says no one would
            know she had been
            sick.  I wonder if she
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0358" n="[p.8]"/>
            
            does not yet know about 
            the accident.
            </p><p>
            Do let me hear
            from you Marcelle.
