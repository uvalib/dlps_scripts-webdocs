     <p>"BY COMMON CONSENT THE CONSTITUTION OF an author's text is the highest aim that a scholar
      can set before himself."<ref target="f003.01.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> This, as
      one might guess, is the dictum of a classical scholar, and a classical scholar is far more
      acutely conscious than a student of the modern literatures that for over two thousand years
      the preservation and elucidation of the texts of the great writers have been the primary
      concern of literary study. Yet to many, and not to lay minds alone, textual criticism is an
      arid activity, almost synonymous with pedantry. Nevertheless, the text must be established
      before a just critical appraisal is possible, as a simple illustration will make clear.</p>
     <p>The 13th of Donne's <hi rend="italic">Holy Sonnets</hi> is one of the better known of his
       <hi rend="italic">Divine Poems</hi>. It begins, <q>
       <l>What if this present were the worlds last night?</l>
       <l>Marke in my heart, O Soule, where thou dost dwell,</l>
       <l>The picture of Christ crucified, and tell</l>
       <l>Whether that countenance can thee affright.</l>
      </q> In all the editions before Grierson's the poem concluded: <q>
       <l>so I say to thee</l>
       <l>To wicked spirits are horrid shapes assign'd,</l>
       <l>This beauteous form assumes a pitious mind,</l>
      </q> but Grierson, on the authority of the manuscripts, altered "assumes" to "assures."
      "Assumes" gives the poem the flatness of a geometrical demonstration, even though it might be
      argued that <pb n="003.004"/> the word would come naturally enough from one so soaked as Donne
      in the dialectic of scholastic philosophy. "Assures," on the other hand, alters the whole
      effect of the poem and brings it to the triumphant climax which Donne surely intended.</p>
     <p>The present disrepute of textual criticism, it would seem, arises from an excessive faith in
      our mechanical means of reproducing books. We take our texts on trust. Modern scholarship, Dr.
      R. W. Chapman has remarked, seems to proceed on the assumption that the texts of books
      published after 1700 are sound, or, if not, that "it is useless, if not improper, to correct
      them." But, he continues, "The first position has only to be stated to reveal its absurdity;
      every book, every newspaper, reminds us of human fallibility. The second position . . . arises
      from cowardice."<ref target="f003.01.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> Whether due to
      indifference or cowardice, textual corruption can go unchecked for a surprisingly long time,
      and can produce some very disconcerting results. Let me illustrate.</p>
     <p>A correspondent in <hi rend="italic">The Times Literary Supplement</hi> not long ago pointed
      out that the very titles of certain books, quite frequently reprinted, have been altered, and
      the original titles almost forgotten. How many readers of Dickens, for instance, know that <hi
       rend="italic">The Adventures of Oliver Twist: or, The Parish Boy's Progress</hi> is the title
      which the author gave his novel? And if title pages are so unreliable, what can be expected of
      the text? An examination of modern reprints of <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi> revealed
      widespread divergences from Sterne's final text: <q>Errors in punctuation amount on many pages
       to 15 to 20 to the page. . . . Modern reprints have frequently set in lower case words which
       Sterne required to be set in small capitals. Alterations in spelling have not been confined
       to modernizations; . . . errors destroying Sterne's sense and meaning have been perpetuated,
       like <hi rend="italic">area</hi> for <hi rend="italic">aera, clause</hi> for <hi
        rend="italic">cause, port</hi> for <hi rend="italic">post, timber</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
        >tinder, catching</hi> for <hi rend="italic">catechising</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
        >caravans</hi> for <hi rend="italic">caverns</hi>.<ref target="f003.01.03" n="3"><hi
         rend="super">3</hi></ref></q> Many of these errors apparently originated in some popular
      nineteenth-century reprint, and have been repeated ever since.</p>
     <p>Another class of book in which textual laxity is frequent is one in which, theoretically, it
      should be rarest: the textbook. Textbooks profess to be edited by competent scholars, and
      should <pb n="003.005"/> thus be in a class quite apart from the popular reprint,
      mass-produced as economically as possible. It would be easy to cite examples of indifferent,
      scissors-and-paste editing, and even of culpable carelessness, but it will be more effective
      to refer to books otherwise immune from the ordinary criticism of slipshod work. Within the
      past year or so two new college <hi rend="italic">Shakespeares</hi> have appeared,<ref
       target="f003.01.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> whose editors are perhaps the two
      most active and distinguished Shakespearian scholars in the country. For range and interest of
      material presented in introductions and notes, the two books are a marked improvement on
      anything previously available, and they are bound to exert a strong influence on the teaching
      of Shakespeare for a generation or so. Yet both reproduce the Globe text. It is not as if
      there had been no advances in the textual study of Shakespeare during the present century, nor
      are these two editors ignorant of the work of Pollard, McKerrow, Greg, and Dover Wilson; but
      is there any other branch of study in which a teacher would be satisfied to present students,
      as these books do, with the results achieved by scholarship up to, but not beyond, the year
      1864?</p>
     <p>A third example may be given to show how neglect of textual matters may distort or nullify
      an argument. In a recent investigation into the origins and development of what we call the
      Victorian attitude of mind the Reverend Thomas Bowdler's <hi rend="italic">Family
       Shakespeare</hi> almost inevitably came up for discussion. In <hi rend="italic">I Henry
       IV</hi>, it was alleged, Bowdler showed a certain squeamishness about Falstaff's oaths,
      though, rather surprisingly, he was somewhat erratic in his elimination of them. "Zounds,"
      "'Sblood," "By the Lord," and "By the mass" are frequently omitted, and in one place "God" is
      replaced by "heaven."<ref target="f003.01.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> But such
      omissions and substitutions were not due to Bowdler at all. The more forcible expressions are
      all found, it is true, in most modern editions, and they also appear in the early quartos, but
      they do not appear in the First Folio. This half-hearted censorship of Shakespeare's text took
      place in the theatre, and was the result of the Act of 1606 which forbade the profane "use of
      the holy name of God or of Jesus Christ or of the Holy Ghost or of the Trinitie" <pb
       n="003.006"/> on the stage; Bowdler was merely working from an eighteenth-century text of
      Shakespeare based on the First Folio, and in actual fact did not concern himself in any way
      with Falstaff's oaths.</p>
     <p>If, then, we are aware of the value of textual studies, we must pay them more than lip
      service, and no scholar is properly trained unless he knows something of the mechanics of
      preparing a text. In the remarks which follow I shall confine myself to English texts from the
      period of the Renaissance onwards, that is, to the age of the printed book, since the texts of
      the manuscript age are to be the subject of another paper in this series. A distinction
      between the texts of the manuscript age and those of the age of the printed book is fully
      justified. I am aware, of course, that certain early texts and editions have survived in
      unique exemplars, and that the twelve surviving copies of the first edition of <hi
       rend="italic">King Lear</hi> contain ten different combinations of corrected and uncorrected
      sheets, so that such texts may present problems closely analogous to those of texts found only
      in manuscript. In the main, however, it is true to say that the printed book presents the text
      in a fixed and standardized form, whereas every manuscript is unique, and its value as an
      authority for the text must be separately investigated.</p>
     <p>Although there have been authors, from Ben Jonson in Shakespeare's day to Housman in our
      own, who have been extremely meticulous about the form in which their work has appeared in
      print, most of the conventions of English spelling and punctuation are the creation of
      printers and compositors, especially in the seventeenth century. Most authors, provided their
      words and sense have been accurately reproduced, have been content to have current printers'
      usage superimposed upon their writings. In other words, though a manuscript copied out fair to
      be sent to the publisher may represent the work in its final form as far as the author is
      concerned, it is not necessarily yet in the form in which it will be offered to the reader, or
      in which the author expects it to be offered. Thus Wordsworth sent the copy for the second
      edition of <hi rend="italic">Lyrical Ballads</hi> to Humphry Davy, requesting him before the
      manuscript went to press to adjust the punctuation&mdash;"a business in which I am ashamed to
      say I am not adept." Similarly the manuscript of his <hi rend="italic">Ode on Intimations of
       Immortality</hi> (first published <pb n="003.007"/> in the <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> of
      1807), which is in the handwriting of his sister-in-law Sara Hutchinson with notes and
      corrections in Wordsworth's hand, has had emphatic changes in capitalization and punctuation
      added, presumably by a reader at the publisher's.<ref target="f003.01.06" n="6"><hi
        rend="super">6</hi></ref> Coleridge's <hi rend="italic">Friend</hi> may be cited for another
      example. The manuscript is extant, partly in Coleridge's hand, but mainly in Sara
      Hutchinson's. It was originally printed by a provincial printer at Penrith, with the result
      that the first edition reproduces many of the eccentricities of spelling, punctuation,
      italicization, and capitalization of Coleridge and his amanuensis. A few years later, when a
      revised edition was brought out in London, most of these eccentricities were normalized. By
      comparison with the edition of 1818 the original edition looks more like a piece of eighteenth
      than of nineteenth-century typography, but there is no shred of evidence that Coleridge
      concerned himself in any way with the typographical practice of either printer.</p>
     <p>Although authors have frequently shown no care for such <hi rend="italic">minutiae</hi>, or
      "accidentals," as Dr. Greg calls them, they are of some concern to the editor, and his
      treatment of them will in large measure be determined by the nature of the edition he is
      preparing. For our purposes we may distinguish between three classes of editions: (1) the
      modern-spelling edition, (2) the old-spelling edition; and (3) the facsimile edition,
      sometimes called the diplomatic edition.<ref target="f003.01.07" n="7"><hi rend="super"
       >7</hi></ref></p>
     <p>There will always be, one hopes, editions in modern spelling of the major English authors
      since Spenser. Chaucer can only be modernized by altering his language, and Spenser, with his
      deliberately cultivated archaisms, is also separated from us by a linguistic gulf, narrow and
      easily crossed, but none the less real. But if ever the day comes when no modernized editions
      of Shakespeare and Donne and Milton are available to the general reader, <pb n="003.008"/> our
      cultural heritage will be in a sad state. The responsibility of the editor of a text in modern
      spelling is no less than that of him who edits in the old spelling; if anything, it is
      greater. Nor is the task any lighter; in fact, the editor of one such work, who had no
      modernized text already made for him, writes in his preface that the task of modernization had
      convinced him "that Elizabethan editors save themselves a vast deal of trouble and risk by
      adhering to the original spelling and punctuation."<ref target="f003.01.08" n="8"><hi
        rend="super">8</hi></ref> Yet, in this particular case at least, the undertaking was well
      worth while, bringing as it did a great deal of otherwise inaccessible material within the
      range of the ordinary reader, who would have been easily repelled by the apparent remoteness
      and strangeness of the originals.</p>
     <p>The aim of the facsimile reprint is to provide the most accurate substitute for a rare
      original that typography can supply. Those who contemplate the preparation of such a text will
      find the principles to be followed set out in the "Rules for Editors" drawn up for the Malone
      Society. But with the development of cheap photographic processes the facsimile reprint will
      be less and less in demand, except on those occasions where it is desirable to furnish a <hi
       rend="italic">literatim</hi> transcript of a manuscript, either to preserve the peculiarities
      of an individual writer or to aid those unskilled in palaeography, as in a work like Greg's
       <hi rend="italic">English Literary Autographs</hi>, 1550-1650.</p>
     <p>The old-spelling text is of course requisite in any standard or definitive edition. After
      the copy-text has been chosen, the editor reproduces it faithfully except for such corrections
      as he finds it necessary to make. The copy-text will usually be either the first (authorized)
      edition, or the last to receive the author's revision; the editorial corrections will involve
      such matters as the elimination of misprints, the adjustment in poetry of faulty verse-lining,
      the correction of inadequate punctuation, the incorporation of manifestly superior (and
      authentic) readings from other editions, and the emendation of corrupt passages. The <hi
       rend="italic">rationale</hi> of such editorial procedure has been fully discussed and set
      forth by McKerrow and Greg, and one can usually find in their writings a solution for one's
      difficulties.<ref target="f003.01.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></p>
     <pb n="003.009"/>
     <p>Thanks to these and to other scholars, current editorial practice is fairly clearly defined,
      but I should like to emphasize that many editors will sooner or later find themselves face to
      face with problems or with materials that demand treatment different from that worked out by
      classical scholars or even by editors of Shakespeare, and I propose briefly to survey some of
      these and indicate their consequence for an editor.</p>
     <p>In recent years it has become clear that in the seventeenth century certain authors cared
      sufficiently for textual accuracy not to rest content with printed errata slips, but had
      manuscript corrections made in as many copies of their works as possible. Such autograph
      corrections by Sir Thomas Browne and Izaak Walton are now well known, but they were by no
      means the only authors to resort to this device. Even the plays of such minor court dramatists
      as Sir William Berkeley and Sir William Lower are known to contain manuscript corrections by
      or at the instigation of the authors, and editors should constantly be on the watch for other
      instances. Obviously such corrections are of the highest textual importance.</p>
     <p>Other classes of material throw light on the earlier history of a work, and no one,<ref
       target="f003.01.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> I fancy, will dispute the fact that
      one of the functions of a definitive edition is to illuminate as much as possible the origin
      and development of the work edited. Every student of the Romantic Period, for instance, knows
      something of the fascinating struggle for artistic perfection revealed by Keats's manuscripts,
      or of the information about the development of Wordsworth's thought and art furnished by the
      new Oxford edition. Many writers, too, have constantly revised their writings after the first
      publication; sometimes the extent of revision can be shown by recording the readings of the
      successive editions, but often the revisions are so thorough that there is no alternative but
      to print all the versions or, if not all, at least the first and final ones. Examples that
      come to mind immediately are Whitman's <pb n="003.010"/>
      <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, whose problems were discussed here several years
       ago,<ref target="f003.01.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> or Fitzgerald's successive
      versions of <hi rend="italic">The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</hi>. But these are by no means
      solitary instances. Among the Elizabethans, Daniel and Drayton revised throughout their
      careers. In the eighteenth century Pope wrote <hi rend="italic">The Rape of the Lock</hi> in
      two forms, and left two <hi rend="italic">Dunciads</hi>. In the nineteenth century both
      Wordsworth and Tennyson completely rewrote some of their early poems, and Coleridge reworked
       <hi rend="italic">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</hi> from 1798 until his death. Nor are
      poets the only revisers. While English literature can scarcely furnish a parallel equal in
      interest and importance to the case of Montaigne's <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> in French,
      the two versions of Sidney's <hi rend="italic">Arcadia</hi>, the successive editions of
      Burton's <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of Melancholy</hi>, and of Walton's <hi rend="italic"
       >Lives</hi> involve problems scarcely less complex.</p>
     <p>The bulk of authors' manuscripts, first drafts, and work sheets that has survived may
      sometimes by very considerable indeed. The most famous of such documents is of course the
      collection of Milton's manuscripts preserved at Trinity College, Cambridge. But there is
      scarcely a major author since the beginning of the eighteenth century of whose work some
      manuscripts have not survived. Such materials are not necessarily of primary textual
      authority, since they may consist of early drafts, or the author may have made his final
      revisions in proof; but they can be of utmost importance in correcting the text, as a simple
      example will make clear. The epigraph to the second chapter of <hi rend="italic">The Heart of
       Midlothian</hi> consists of two stanzas from Prior's <hi rend="italic">The Thief and the
       Cordelier</hi>. In the novel one of the lines reads <q>
       <l>There the squire of the poet and knight of the post,</l>
      </q> which is nonsense. It should be <q>
       <l>There the squire of the pad and the knight of the post.</l>
      </q> This example is unusual, because there is the possibility of a double check. Not only do
      the texts of Prior give the right reading, but Scott's manuscript, which is extant, shows that
      he quoted the passage correctly. Nevertheless this printer's error was repeated in all
      editions until 1948.<ref target="f003.01.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref></p>
     <pb n="003.011"/>
     <p>Two other similar classes of material that have as yet been scarcely used by editors should
      also be noticed: printer's copy and author's proofs. Printer's copy and proof-sheets have both
      survived from as early as the fifteenth century; in neither of these instances, however, was
      the author involved. But even a brief enumeration of some of the surviving manuscripts which
      were sent by the authors to the press is an impressive one, including as it does Book I of
      Hooker's <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical Polity</hi>, part of Sir John Harington's
      translation of Ariosto's <hi rend="italic">Orlando Furioso</hi>, Book I of <hi rend="italic"
       >Paradise Lost</hi>, Pope's <hi rend="italic">Essay on Criticism</hi>, the second edition of
       <hi rend="italic">Lyrical Ballads</hi>, and Wordsworth's <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> of
      1807. The Bodleian manuscript of Herbert's <hi rend="italic">Temple</hi>, though not sent to
      the press, is the one bearing the <hi rend="italic">imprimatur</hi> of the official licenser,
      and is therefore of textual authority at least equal to that of the first edition. Of author's
      proofs I know of no actual examples earlier than some of Dr. Johnson's in the R. B. Adam
      Collection, and the earliest I happen myself to have examined were of works by Hazlitt and
      Scott, but there must be many others in existence awaiting full examination by interested
      scholars.</p>
     <p>A further class of material offering editorial problems of its own is to be found in those
      manuscripts, such as letters, diaries, and notebooks, which were never prepared for the press
      by the authors, and were never intended for the press. Editors, and especially
      biographer-editors, have allowed themselves a latitude in handling such materials that varies
      all the way from a naive desire to safeguard the hero's dignity to flagrant dishonesty. One of
      the earliest writers to suffer from such editorial ineptitude was Donne. His son in editing
      his letters not only showed extreme carelessness over dates and addresses but, it is now
      known, altered the names of those to whom the letters were written, presumably in order to
      suggest that he had access to a much greater volume of his father's correspondence than in
      fact he had.<ref target="f003.01.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> Even Walton was
      not above tampering with Donne's letters, so that on one occasion he strung together excerpts
      from five different letters, clapped a date on the end, and presented the result as a single
       epistle.<ref target="f003.01.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref> My colleague Professor
      W. M. Sale tells me that Samuel <pb n="003.012"/> Richardson's letters were similarly
      mishandled by Mrs. Barbauld, and other examples from eighteenth and nineteenth-century
      biographies could doubtless be found with little difficulty.</p>
     <p>Many of these earlier editorial mutilations are explicable in terms of the standards of
      their age. Two of Donne's letters seem to have survived only in the opening and close; the
      intermediate news or business communication, or whatever it was, has been omitted.<ref
       target="f003.01.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> His contemporaries were interested
      in the elegance of Donne's epistolary style and the ingenuity of his compliments more than in
      the details of his personal relations with his friends. Nineteenth-century taboos were
      responsible for a different kind of excision altogether; witness those, for instance, in the
      early editions of Lamb's letters. One recalls how Lamb wrote to Thomas Manning about the
      little book on honours and dignities which he had written for children,<ref
       target="f003.01.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> and how in the course of it he had
      envisaged himself advancing through all the degrees of the peerage, concluding with "Duke
      Lamb." <q>It would look like quibbling [he continued] to carry it on further . . . otherwise I
       have sometimes in my dreams imagined myself still advancing, as 9th, King Lamb; 10th, Emperor
       Lamb; 11th, Pope Innocent, higher than which is nothing upon earth.</q> At least, that is
      what appeared in the nineteenth-century editions; what Lamb actually wrote was "higher than
      which is nothing but the Lamb of God."</p>
     <p>Coleridge, who left behind him vast stores of marginalia, notes, scattered papers, and other
       <hi rend="italic">disjecta membra</hi>, has given much trouble to his editors. Henry Nelson
      Coleridge, who edited the <hi rend="italic">Literary Remains</hi>, did some very strange
      things with his uncle's writings, though he was attempting in all sincerity to impose some
      order on chaos, and to show his uncle to best advantage. Ernest Hartley Coleridge, in editing
      the series of extracts from the notebooks entitled <hi rend="italic">Anima Poetae</hi>, had
      similar problems to face. Not only was the family still reluctant to reveal the extent of
      Coleridge's disagreement with his wife and his attachment for Sara Hutchinson (which entailed
      various excisions), but the compressed form of many of the notes, with their disregard for <pb
       n="003.013"/> ordinary rules of syntax, to say nothing of their highly individual punctuation
      and capitalization, produced numerous additional difficulties. Here are two brief examples of
      E. H. Coleridge's editorial procedure. In each case the passage is transcribed as accurately
      as possible from the original, and then followed by the corresponding passage in <hi
       rend="italic">Anima Poetae</hi>.</p>
     <q>
      <p>A new year&mdash;the old Wants/ The new from God, the old our own/ . . .</p>
      <p>Time&mdash;3 fold&mdash;Future slow&mdash;Present swift&mdash;Past unmoveable&mdash;No
       impatience will quicken the Loiterer&mdash;no Terror, no delight rein in the Flyer&mdash;No
       Regret set in motion the Stationary&mdash;would'st be happy, take the Delayer for thy
       counsellor, do not choose the Flyer for thy Friend, nor the ever-remainer for thy
       Enemy&mdash;</p> (Notebook viii, p. 3)<lb/>
      <p>The old world begins a new year. That is <hi rend="italic">ours</hi>, but this is from
       God.</p>
      <p>We may think of time as threefold. Slowly comes the Future, swift the Present passes by,
       but the Past is unmoveable. No impatience will quicken the loiterer; no terror, no delight
       rein in the flyer, and no regret set in motion the stationary. Wouldst be happy, take the
       delayer for thy counsellor; do not choose the flyer for thy friend, nor the ever-remainer for
       thine enemy.</p> (<hi rend="italic">Anima Poetae</hi>, p. 22)<lb/>
      <p>Reviewers resemble often the English Jury and the Italian Conclave, that they are incapable
       of eating till they have condemned or crowned&mdash;</p>
      <p>Pope like an old Lark who tho' he leaves off soaring &amp; singing in the height, yet has
       his <hi rend="italic">Spurs</hi> grow longer &amp; sharper, the older he grows.</p> (Notebook
      xvii, p. 167)<lb/>
      <p>Reviewers resemble often the English jury and the Italian conclave, they are incapable of
       eating till they have condemned or craned.</p>
      <p>The Pope [may be compared to] an old lark, who, though he leaves off soaring and singing in
       the height, yet has his spurs grow longer and sharper the older he grows.</p> (<hi
       rend="italic">Anima Poetae</hi>, p. 223)<lb/>
     </q>
     <p>In the first passage I suspect that E. H. Coleridge misread "Wants" as "world," as it is
      difficult otherwise to account for the rephrasing; in the second he was certainly baffled by
      "crowned," which he rendered by the unintelligible "craned". But the two notes in the second
      extract are interesting for another misconception, which would positively have delighted
      Coleridge, who was always <pb n="003.014"/> fascinated by the workings of the principle of the
      association of ideas. In writing the first of the two notes Coleridge's mind went from the
      notion of juries condemning before eating to the line in <hi rend="italic">The Rape of the
       Lock</hi>, <q>
       <l>And wretches hang that juryman may dine,</l>
      </q> and thence to its author, who became the subject of the next note; his grandson's mind,
      on the other hand, was caught by the phrase "Italian conclave," and he therefore interpreted
      the succeeding note as referring to the pontiff instead of the poet.</p>
     <p>E. H. Coleridge was for many years a schoolmaster, and his procedure with the text of the
      notebooks resembles that of a conscientious instructor correcting a carelessly written
      schoolboy exercise. He believed, no doubt, that he was only doing what was needful to remove
      unnecessary stumbling blocks from the path of a reader, and he was preparing a book for the
      general reader rather than the scholar. But notions of editorial responsibility have changed
      within the last fifty years, and such manipulation of the text is contrary to modern
      standards. Editors of comparatively recent material will, no doubt, always have to make
      excisions out of regard to the susceptibilities of the family and friends of the author, but
      what they do print will be printed with scrupulous fidelity to the wording of the original,
      and there will be some statement as to the nature and extent of any necessary omissions.</p>
     <p>The problem of fidelity to the minuter details of the author's text&mdash;to the
      "accidentals"&mdash;is a more difficult one and depends, in the last resort, on the editor's
      taste and judgment. It is worth bearing in mind, I think, that there is a real gain in
      consulting, wherever possible, the reader's convenience. Mr. Harold Williams, in his recent
      edition of Swift's Journal to Stella, reproduces faithfully Swift's "little language" from
      such of the letters as have survived in manuscript, with the exception that Swift's "th" and
      "te" become "the," "y" and "yo" becomes "you," and "yr" and "yrs" become "your" and "yours."
      The consequent gain in legibility is considerable, as may be seen by comparison with the
      edition which prints these forms as Swift wrote them. As Mr. Williams points out in his
      preface: <q>In these days, when the art of photography has been enlisted in the student's
       service, the attempt to reproduce in print insignificant orthographical peculiarities <pb
        n="003.015"/> has less meaning than it once had. The result can never be wholly
       satisfactory, and it may only repel or distract the reader.</q> Again, Professor Vinaver's
      edition of Malory, the most exciting piece of literary scholarship of the past decade, is not
      least so because the editor has made Malory so much easier to read in the original text than
      ever before. Compare any page of this edition with the corresponding passage in Oskar Sommer's
      and the difference will be apparent at a glance. The paragraphing, the re-punctuation, and the
      setting of the dialogue in the manner of the modern novel are all introduced without any
      compromising of editorial integrity, and the gain to the reader who is not primarily a
      mediaevalist is enormous.</p>
     <p>A less successful solution of some of these problems is exemplified in the edition recently
      published of Melville's <hi rend="italic">Billy Budd</hi>. Two pages of the original
      manuscript are reproduced, so that a measure of comparison with the printed text is possible.
      Melville's spelling, we are told, has been corrected "to modern American usage," and any
      editorial insertions in the text are enclosed within pointed brackets (instead of the more
      usual square ones). Thus the editor conceals the fact that Melville used such spellings as
      "Judgement," "fellow-man," "innocense," and "respectivly" (though the last two may have been
      mere slips of the pen), but if Melville neglected to close quotations marks or to add a period
      at the end of a paragraph, the fact is forcibly brought to our notice by means of pointed
      brackets. It would be of little value, no doubt, to record that the <hi rend="italic">um</hi>
      of "circumstances" is two minims short, but Melville's characteristic spellings are not
      without interest, while his careless omission of occasional punctuation marks is of far less
      significance and their silent editorial correction would have been perfectly proper.</p>
     <p>Further, the textual notes are insufficient to permit an adequate reconstruction of the
      original. One discovers, after some initial bewilderment, that what are referred to as
      "variants" are in fact words and phrases that have been deleted and on second thoughts
      replaced by others; words and phrases said to have been "omitted" are those which in revision
      were <hi rend="italic">added</hi>, very often above a caret mark. Nor is there any attempt in
      the notes to distinguish the various stages of revision. In the phrase "he could never
      convert," <pb n="003.016"/> "could" is above the line in ink over a caret mark, but the fact
      is not recorded; in the phrase "without first performing," "first" is above the line in ink
      over a caret mark, and here it is recorded as "<hi rend="italic">om.</hi>" In the phrase "that
      hitherto has stood in human record," Melville first wrote in ink "that stands in human
      record," then altered it in pencil to "that hitherto has stood in authoritative record," but
      finally deleted "authoritative" and restored "human." The textual note here merely cites the
      phrase "that stands in authoritative record" as the "variant" of the final form, thus
      telescoping two steps in the process of revision into one. Thus an editor, however well
      intentioned, by departing from established conventions and inadequately describing the state
      of his original, can confuse more than he aids the reader, and a student wishing to make a
      close study of Melville's method of composition in this tale is still unable to do so without
      recourse to the original manuscript.</p>
     <p>Though it is a function of the editor to aid the reader wherever he can, it is scarcely
      possible to condone the practice of the editors of <hi rend="italic">The Oxford Book of
       Seventeenth Century Verse:</hi>
      <q>Where words or lines might seem ugly to modern eyes [they write], or where a difference in
       usage might lead to ambiguity, we have substituted simpler forms, always taking care (we
       believe) that the substituted form <hi rend="italic">was actually in use during the
        seventeenth century</hi>.</q> This, though the editors disavow it, is really normalization.
      One used to get Old English texts normalized to standard West Saxon of about 1000 A.D., and
      even normalized texts of Chaucer. But happily such a practice is out of favour nowadays, for
      editors know that not until the eighteenth century was normalization imposed on English
      orthography, and then by printers rather than authors.<ref target="f003.01.17" n="17"><hi
        rend="super">17</hi></ref></p>
     <p>There is, however, a real difference between normalization and the expansion of
      contractions, or the attempt to reproduce in type scribal peculiarities outside the range of
      the printer's case. The value of the facsimile reprint, in other words, is strictly limited,
      and photographic aids are diminishing its usefulness. Hence, as a literary student&mdash;as
      distinct from the historian or the palaeographer&mdash;I <pb n="003.017"/> deplore the
      over-meticulous habit of printing legal records and other old documents with all their
      contractions, or with the contractions expanded in italics. The silent expansion of
      contractions is but a courtesy to the reader. Actually, many of these documents ought merely
      to be described and summarized, with a few of the important phrases quoted; the class of
      document to which the example belongs may be indicated, if necessary, through reference to
      historical source books or to formularies.</p>
     <p>Many of the processes in the preparation of a text, such as transcription, collation, and
      even proof-correction, involve, it must be admitted, much sheer drudgery, and unlike some
      other forms of drudgery they cannot be delegated. They are exacting, and they demand the
      unremitting concentration of a highly trained mind. But the less they show the better; the
      text's the thing, not the textual notes; and this is perhaps the final principle that an
      editor would do well to bear in mind. If he has been brought to his task by enthusiasm for an
      author or a book, he will wish above all things by his work to pass on that enthusiasm. We may
      fitly conclude with some other words of the classical scholar with whom we began: <q>A man is
       led by some feeling of kinship for what is greater than himself to devote his life to the
       interpretation of a poet, philosopher, or historian, to the elucidation of the language
       itself on its purely linguistic side, or to that of the art or institutions of antiquity.
       Such a man will freely give himself up to the most arid and laborious investigations. No
       erasure in a manuscript, no half-read scholium, no fragmentary inscription will seem unworthy
       of his attention; no grammatical nicety or stylistic peculiarity will be passed by as too
       trivial for his patient study. All these things will live in his hands; for they are all
       transformed by his faith in something to which he can hardly give a name, but which, to him,
       is more real than anything else.<ref target="f003.01.18" n="18"><hi rend="super"

     <p>WHEN, IN HIS EDITION OF NASHE, McKERROW invented the term 'copy-text', he was merely giving
      a name to a conception already familiar, and he used it in a general sense to indicate that
      early text of a work which an editor selected as the basis of his own. Later, as we shall see,
      he gave it a somewhat different and more restricted meaning. It is this change in conception
      and its implications that I wish to consider.</p>
     <p>The idea of treating some one text, usually of course a manuscript, as possessing
      over-riding authority originated among classical scholars, though something similar may no
      doubt be traced in the work of biblical critics. So long as purely eclectic methods prevailed,
      any preference for one manuscript over another, if it showed itself, was of course arbitrary;
      but when, towards the middle of last century, Lachmann and others introduced the genealogical
      classification of manuscripts as a principle of textual criticism, this appeared to provide at
      least some scientific basis for the conception of the most authoritative text. The
      genealogical method was the greatest advance ever made in this field, but its introduction was
      not unaccompanied by error. For lack of logical analysis, it led, at the hands of its less
      discriminating exponents, to an attempt to reduce textual criticism to a code of mechanical
      rules. There was just this much excuse, that the method did make it possible to sweep away
      mechanically a great deal of rubbish. What its more hasty devotees failed to understand, or at
      any rate sufficiently to bear in mind, was that authority is never absolute, but only
      relative. Thus a school arose, mainly in Germany, that <pb n="003.020"/> taught that if a
      manuscript could be shown to be generally more correct than any other and to have descended
      from the archetype independently of other lines of transmission, it was 'scientific' to follow
      its readings whenever they were not manifestly impossible. It was this fallacy that Housman
      exposed with devastating sarcasm. He had only to point out that 'Chance and the common course
      of nature will not bring it to pass that the readings of a ms are right wherever they are
      possible and impossible wherever they are wrong'.<ref target="f003.02.01" n="1"><hi
        rend="super">1</hi></ref> That if a scribe makes a mistake he will inevitably produce
      nonsense is the tacit and wholly unwarranted assumption of the school in question,<ref
       target="f003.02.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> and it is one that naturally commends
      itself to those who believe themselves capable of distinguishing between sense and nonsense,
      but who know themselves incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong. Unfortunately the
      attractions of a mechanical method misled many who were capable of better things.</p>
     <p>There is one important respect in which the editing of classical texts differs from that of
      English. In the former it is the common practice, for fairly obvious reasons, to normalize the
      spelling, so that (apart from emendation) the function of an editor is limited to choosing
      between those manuscript readings that offer significant variants. In English it is now usual
      to preserve the spelling of the earliest or it may be some other selected text. Thus it will
      be seen that the conception of 'copy-text' does not present itself to the classical and to the
      English editor in quite the same way; indeed, if I am right in the view I am about to put
      forward, the classical theory of the 'best' or 'most authoritative' manuscript, whether it be
      held in a reasonable or in an obviously fallacious form, has really nothing to do with the
      English theory of 'copy-text' at all.</p>
     <p>I do not wish to argue the case of 'old spelling' <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> 'modern
      spelling'; I accept the view now prevalent among English scholars. But I cannot avoid some
      reference to the ground on which <pb n="003.021"/> present practice is based, since it is
      intimately connected with my own views on copy-text. The former practice of modernizing the
      spelling of English works is no longer popular with editors, since spelling is now recognized
      as an essential characteristic of an author, or at least of his time and locality. So far as
      my knowledge goes, the alternative of normalization has not been seriously explored, but its
      philological difficulties are clearly considerable.<ref target="f003.02.03" n="3"><hi
        rend="super">3</hi></ref> Whether, with the advance of linguistic science, it will some day
      be possible to establish a standard spelling for a particular period or district or author, or
      whether the historical circumstances in which our language has developed must always forbid
      any attempt of the sort (at any rate before comparatively recent times) I am not competent to
      say; but I agree with what appears to be the general opinion that such an attempt would at
      present only result in confusion and misrepresentation. It is therefore the modern editorial
      practice to choose whatever extant text may be supposed to represent most nearly what the
      author wrote and to follow it with the least possible alteration. But here we need to draw a
      distinction between the significant, or as I shall call them 'substantive', readings of the
      text, those namely that affect the author's meaning or the essence of his expression, and
      others, such in general as spelling, punctuation, word-division, and the like, affecting
      mainly its formal presentation, which may be regarded as the accidents, or as I shall call
      them 'accidentals', of the text.<ref target="f003.02.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref>
      The distinction is not arbitrary or theoretical, but has an immediate bearing on textual
      criticism, for scribes (or compositors) may in general be expected to react, and experience
      shows that they generally do react, differently to the two categories. As regards substantive
      readings their aim may be assumed to be to reproduce exactly those of their copy, though they
      will doubtless sometimes depart from them accidentally and may <pb n="003.022"/> even, for one
      reason or another, do so intentionally: as regards accidentals they will normally follow their
      own habits or inclination, though they may, for various reasons and to varying degrees, be
      influenced by their copy. Thus a contemporary manuscript will at least preserve the spelling
      of the period, and may even retain some of the author's own, while it may at the same time
      depart frequently from the wording of the original: on the other hand a later transcript of
      the same original may reproduce the wording with essential accuracy while completely
      modernizing the spelling. Since, then, it is only on grounds of expediency, and in consequence
      either of philological ignorance or of linguistic circumstances, that we select a particular
      original as our copy-text, I suggest that it is only in the matter of accidentals that we are
      bound (within reason) to follow it, and that in respect of substantive readings we have
      exactly the same liberty (and obligation) of choice as has a classical editor, or as we should
      have were it a modernized text that we were preparing.<ref target="f003.02.05" n="5"><hi
        rend="super">5</hi></ref></p>
     <p>But the distinction has not been generally recognized, and has never, so far as I am aware,
      been explicitly drawn.<ref target="f003.02.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> This is
      not surprising. The battle between 'old spelling' and 'modern spelling' was fought out over
      works written for the most part between 1550 and 1650, and for which the original authorities
      are therefore as a rule printed editions. Now printed editions usually form an ancestral
      series, in which each is derived from its immediate predecessor; whereas the extant
      manuscripts of any work have usually only a collateral relationship, each being derived from
      the original independently, or more or less independently, of the others. Thus in the case of
      printed books, and in the absence of revision in a later edition, it is normally the first
      edition alone that can claim authority, and this authority naturally extends to substantive
      readings and accidentals alike. There was, therefore, <pb n="003.023"/> little to force the
      distinction upon the notice of editors of works of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
      and it apparently never occurred to them that some fundamental difference of editorial method
      might be called for in the rare cases in which a later edition had been revised by the author
      or in which there existed more than one 'substantive' edition of comparable authority.<ref
       target="f003.02.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> Had they been more familiar with
      works transmitted in manuscript, they might possibly have reconsidered their methods and been
      led to draw the distinction I am suggesting. For although the underlying principles of textual
      criticism are, of course, the same in the case of works transmitted in manuscripts and in
      print, particular circumstances differ, and certain aspects of the common principles may
      emerge more clearly in the one case than in the other. However, since the idea of copy-text
      originated and has generally been applied in connexion with the editing of printed books, it
      is such that I shall mainly consider, and in what follows reference may be understood as
      confined to them unless manuscripts are specifically mentioned.</p>
     <p>The distinction I am proposing between substantive readings and accidentals, or at any rate
      its relevance to the question of copy-text, was clearly not present to McKerrow's mind when in
      1904 he published the second volume of his edition of the Works of Thomas Nashe, which
      included <hi rend="italic">The Unfortunate Traveller</hi>. Collation of the early editions of
      this romance led him to the conclusion that the second, advertised on the title as 'Newly
      corrected and augmented', had in fact been revised by the author, but at the same time that
      not all the alterations could with certainty be ascribed to him.<ref target="f003.02.08" n="8"
        ><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> He nevertheless proceeded to enunciate the rule that 'if an
      editor has reason to suppose that a certain text embodies later corrections than any other,
      and at the same time has no ground for disbelieving that these corrections, <hi rend="italic"
       >or some of them at <pb n="003.024"/> least</hi>, are the work of the author, he has no
      choice but to make that text the basis of his reprint'.<ref target="f003.02.09" n="9"><hi
        rend="super">9</hi></ref> The italics are mine.<ref target="f003.02.10" n="10"><hi
        rend="super">10</hi></ref> This is applying with a vengeance the principle that I once
      approvingly described as 'maintaining the integrity of the copy-text'. But it must be pointed
      out that there are in fact two quite distinct principles involved. One, put in more general
      form, is that if, for whatever reason, a particular authority be on the whole preferred, an
      editor is bound to accept all its substantive readings (if not manifestly impossible). This is
      the old fallacy of the 'best text', and may be taken to be now generally rejected. The other
      principle, also put in general form, is that whatever particular authority be preferred,
      whether as being revised or as generally preserving the substantive readings more faithfully
      than any other, it must be taken as copy-text, that is to say that it must also be followed in
      the matter of accidentals. This is the principle that interests us at the moment, and it is
      one that McKerrow himself came, at least partly, to question.</p>
     <p>In 1939 McKerrow published his <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena for the Oxford
      Shakespeare</hi>, and he would not have been the critic he was if his views had not undergone
      some changes in the course of thirty-five years. One was in respect of revision. He had come
      to the opinion that to take a reprint, even a revised reprint, as copy-text was indefensible.
      Whatever may be the relation of a particular substantive edition to the author's manuscript
      (provided that there is any transcriptional link at all) it stands to reason that the relation
      of a reprint of that edition must be more remote. If then, putting aside all question of
      revision, a particular substantive edition has an over-riding claim to be taken as copy-text,
      to displace it in favour of a reprint, whether revised or not, means receding at least one
      step further from the author's original in so far as the general form of the text is
       concerned.<ref target="f003.02.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> Some such
      considerations must have been in McKerrow's mind when he wrote (<hi rend="italic"
       >Prolegomena</hi>, pp. 17-18): 'Even if, however, we were to assure <pb n="003.025"/>
      ourselves . . . that certain corrections found in a later edition of a play were of
      Shakespearian authority, it would not by any means follow that that edition should be used as
      the copy-text of a reprint.<ref target="f003.02.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> It
      would undoubtedly be necessary to incorporate these corrections in our text, but . . . it
      seems evident that . . . this later edition will (except for the corrections) deviate more
      widely than the earliest print from the author's original manuscript. . . . [Thus] the nearest
      approach to our ideal . . . will be produced by using the earliest "good" print as copy-text
      and inserting into it, from the first edition which contains them, such corrections as appear
      to us to be derived from the author.' This is a clear statement of the position, and in it he
      draws exactly the distinction between substantive readings (in the form of corrections) and
      accidentals (or general texture) on which I am insisting. He then, however, relapsed into
      heresy in the matter of the substantive readings. Having spoken, as above, of the need to
      introduce 'such corrections as appear to us to be derived from the author', he seems to have
      feared conceding too much to eclecticism, and he proceeded: 'We are not to regard the
      "goodness" of a reading in and by itself, or to consider whether it appeals to our aesthetic
      sensibilities or not; we are to consider whether a particular edition taken <hi rend="italic"
       >as a whole</hi> contains variants from the edition from which it was otherwise printed which
      could not reasonably be attributed to an ordinary press-corrector, but by reason of their
      style, point, and what we may call inner harmony with the spirit of the play as a whole, seem
      likely to be the work of the author: and once having decided this to our satisfaction we must
      accept <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the alterations of that edition, saving any which seem
      obvious blunders or misprints.' We can see clearly enough what he had in mind, namely that the
      evidence of correction (under which head he presumably intended to include revision) must be
      considered <hi rend="italic">as a whole</hi>; but he failed to add the equally important
      proviso that the alterations must also be <hi rend="italic">of a piece</hi> (and not, as in
       <hi rend="italic">The Unfortunate Traveller</hi>, of apparently disparate origin) before we
      can be called upon to accept them <hi rend="italic">all</hi>. As he states it his canon is
      open to exactly the same objections as the 'most authoritative manuscript' theory in classical
      editing.</p>
     <p>McKerrow was, therefore, in his later work quite conscious <pb n="003.026"/> of the
      distinction between substantive readings and accidentals, in so far as the problem of revision
      is concerned. But he never applied the conception to cases in which we have more than one
      substantive text, as in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and perhaps in 2 <hi rend="italic">Henry
       IV, Troilus and Cressida</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>. Presumably he would have
      argued that since faithfulness to the wording of the author was one of the criteria he laid
      down for determining the choice of the copy-text, it was an editor's duty to follow its
      substantive readings with a minimum of interference.</p>
     <p>We may assume that neither McKerrow nor other editors of the conservative school imagined
      that such a procedure would always result in establishing the authentic text of the original;
      what they believed was that from it less harm would result than from opening the door to
      individual choice among variants, since it substituted an objective for a subjective method of
      determination. This is, I think, open to question. It is impossible to exclude individual
      judgement from editorial procedure: it operates of necessity in the all-important matter of
      the choice of copy-text and in the minor one of deciding what readings are possible and what
      not; why, therefore, should the choice between possible readings be withdrawn from its
      competence? Uniformity of result at the hands of different editors is worth little if it means
      only uniformity in error; and it may not be too optimistic a belief that the judgement of an
      editor, fallible as it must necessarily be, is likely to bring us closer to what the author
      wrote than the enforcement of an arbitrary rule.</p>
     <p>The true theory is, I contend, that the copy-text should govern (generally) in the matter of
      accidentals, but that the choice between substantive readings belongs to the general theory of
      textual criticism and lies altogether beyond the narrow principle of the copy-text. Thus it
      may happen that in a critical edition the text rightly chosen as copy may not by any means be
      the one that supplies most substantive readings in cases of variation. The failure to make
      this distinction and to apply this principle has naturally led to too close and too general a
      reliance upon the text chosen as basis for an edition, and there has arisen what may be called
      the tyranny of the copy-text, a tyranny that has, in my opinion, vitiated much of the best
      editorial work of the past generation.</p>
     <pb n="003.027"/>
     <p>I will give a couple of examples of the sort of thing I mean that I have lately come across
      in the course of my own work. They are all the more suitable as illustrations since they occur
      in texts edited by scholars of recognized authority, neither of whom is particularly subject
      to the tyranny in question. One is from the edition of Marlowe's <hi rend="italic">Doctor
       Faustus</hi> by Professor F. S. Boas (1932). The editor, rightly I think, took the so-called
      B-text (1616) as the basis of his own, correcting it where necessary by comparison with the
      A-text (1604).<ref target="f003.02.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> Now a famous line
      in Faustus's opening soliloquy runs in 1604, <q>
       <l>Bid <hi rend="italic">Oncaym&oelig;on</hi> farewell, <hi rend="italic">Galen</hi> come</l>
      </q> and in 1616, <q>
       <l>Bid <hi rend="italic">Oeconomy</hi> farewell; and <hi rend="italic">Galen</hi> come . .
        .</l>
      </q> Here <hi rend="italic">Oncaym&oelig;on</hi> is now recognized as standing for <hi
       rend="italic">on cay m&oelig; on</hi> or &oragr;&ngr; &Kgr;&agr;&igragr; &mgr;&eegragr;
      &oragr;&ngr;: but this was not understood at the time, and <hi rend="italic">Oeconomy</hi> was
      substituted in reprints of the A-text in 1609 and 1611, and thence taken over by the B-text.
      The change, however, produced a rather awkward line, and in 1616 the <hi rend="italic"
       >and</hi> was introduced as a metrical accommodation. In the first half of the line Boas
      rightly restored the reading implied in A; but in the second half he retained, out of
      deference to his copy-text, the <hi rend="italic">and</hi> whose only object was to
      accommodate the reading he had rejected in the first. One could hardly find a better example
      of the contradictions to which a mechanical following of the copy-text may lead.<ref
       target="f003.02.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref></p>
     <p>My other instance is from <hi rend="italic">The Gipsies Metamorphosed</hi> as edited by Dr.
      Percy Simpson among the masques of Ben Jonson in 1941. He took as his copy-text the Huntington
      manuscript, and I entirely agree with his choice. In this, and in Simpson's edition, a line of
      the ribald Cock Lorel ballad runs (sir-reverence!), <q>
       <l>All w<hi rend="super">ch</hi> he blewe away with a fart</l>
      </q>
      <pb n="003.028"/> whereas for <hi rend="italic">blewe</hi> other authorities have <hi
       rend="italic">flirted</hi>. Now, the meaning of <hi rend="italic">flirted</hi> is not
      immediately apparent, for no appropriate sense of the word is recorded. There is, however, a
      rare use of the substantive <hi rend="italic">flirt</hi> for a sudden gust of wind, and it is
      impossible to doubt that this is what Jonson had in mind, for no scribe or compositor could
      have invented the reading <hi rend="italic">flirted</hi>. It follows that in the manuscript
       <hi rend="italic">blewe</hi> is nothing but the conjecture of a scribe who did not understand
      his original: only the mesmeric influence of the copy-text could obscure so obvious a
       fact.<ref target="f003.02.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref></p>
     <p>I give these examples merely to illustrate the kind of error that, in modern editions of
      English works, often results from undue deference to the copy-text. This reliance on one
      particular authority results from the desire for an objective theory of text-construction and
      a distrust, often no doubt justified, of the operation of individual judgement. The attitude
      may be explained historically as a natural and largely salutary reaction against the methods
      of earlier editors. Dissatisfied with the results of eclectic freedom and reliance on personal
      taste, critics sought to establish some sort of mechanical apparatus for dealing with textual
      problems that should lead to uniform results independent of the operator. Their efforts were
      not altogether unattended by success. One result was the recognition of the general
      worthlessness of reprints. And even in the more difficult field of manuscript transmission it
      is true that formal rules will carry us part of the way: they can at least effect a
      preliminary clearing of the ground. This I sought to show in my essay on <hi rend="italic">The
       Calculus of Variants</hi> (1927); but in the course of investigation it became clear that
      there is a definite limit to the field over which formal rules are applicable. Between
      readings of equal extrinsic authority no rules of the sort can decide, since by their very
      nature it is only to extrinsic relations that they are relevant. The choice is necessarily a
      matter for editorial judgement, and an editor who declines or is unable to exercise his
      judgement and falls back on some arbitrary canon, such as the authority of the copy-text, is
      in fact abdicating his editorial function. Yet this is what has been frequently commended as
      'scientific'&mdash;'streng wissenschaftlich' in the prevalent <pb n="003.029"/>
      idiom&mdash;and the result is that what many editors have done is to produce, not editions of
      their authors' works at all, but only editions of particular authorities for those works, a
      course that may be perfectly legitimate in itself, but was not the one they were professedly
      pursuing.</p>
     <p>This by way, more or less, of digression. At the risk of repetition I should like to
      recapitulate my view of the position of copy-text in editorial procedure. The thesis I am
      arguing is that the historical circumstances of the English language make it necessary to
      adopt in formal matters the guidance of some particular early text. If the several extant
      texts of a work form an ancestral series, the earliest will naturally be selected, and since
      this will not only come nearest to the author's original in accidentals, but also (revision
      apart) most faithfully preserve the correct readings where substantive variants are in
      question, everything is straightforward, and the conservative treatment of the copy-text is
      justified. But whenever there is more than one substantive text of comparable authority,<ref
       target="f003.02.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> then although it will still be
      necessary to choose one of them as copy-text, and to follow it in accidentals, this copy-text
      can be allowed no over-riding or even preponderant authority so far as substantive readings
      are concerned. The choice between these, in cases of variation, will be determined partly by
      the opinion the editor may form respecting the nature of the copy from which each substantive
      edition was printed, which is a matter of external authority; partly by the intrinsic
      authority of the several texts as judged by the relative frequency of manifest errors therein;
      and partly by the editor's judgement of the intrinsic claims of individual readings to
      originality&mdash;in other words their intrinsic merit, so long as by 'merit' we mean the
      likelihood of their being what the author wrote rather than their appeal to the individual
      taste of the editor.</p>
     <p>Such, as I see it, is the general theory of copy-text. But there remain a number of
      subsidiary questions that it may be worth-while to discuss. One is the degree of faithfulness
      with which the copy-text should be reproduced. Since the adoption of a copy-text is a matter
      of convenience rather than of principle&mdash;being <pb n="003.030"/> imposed on us either by
      linguistic circumstances or our own philological ignorance&mdash;it follows that there is no
      reason for treating it as sacrosanct, even apart from the question of substantive variation.
      Every editor aiming at a critical edition will, of course, correct scribal or typographical
      errors. He will also correct readings in accordance with any errata included in the edition
      taken as copy-text. I see no reason why he should not alter misleading or eccentric spellings
      which he is satisfied emanate from the scribe or compositor and not from the author. If the
      punctuation is persistently erroneous or defective an editor may prefer to discard it
      altogether to make way for one of his own. He is, I think, at liberty to do so, provided that
      he gives due weight to the original in deciding on his own, and that he records the alteration
      whenever the sense is appreciably affected. Much the same applies to the use of capitals and
      italics. I should favour expanding contractions (except perhaps when dealing with an author's
      holograph) so long as ambiguities and abnormalities are recorded. A critical edition does not
      seem to me a suitable place in which to record the graphic peculiarities of particular
       texts,<ref target="f003.02.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> and in this respect the
      copy-text is only one among others. These, however, are all matters within the discretion of
      an editor: I am only concerned to uphold his liberty of judgement.</p>
     <p>Some minor points arise when it becomes necessary to replace a reading of the copy-text by
      one derived from another source. It need not, I think, be copied in the exact form in which it
      there appears. Suppose that the copy-text follows the earlier convention in the use of <hi
       rend="italic">u</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v</hi>, and the source from which the reading is
      taken follows the later. Naturally in transferring the reading from the latter to the former
      it would be made to conform to the earlier convention. I would go further. Suppose that the
      copy-text reads 'hazard', but that we have reason to believe that the correct reading is
      'venture': suppose further that whenever this word occurs in the copy-text it is in the form
      'venter': then 'venter', I maintain, is the form we should adopt. In like manner editorial
      emendations should be made to conform to the habitual spelling of the copy-text.</p>
     <p>In the case of rival substantive editions the choice between <pb n="003.031"/> substantive
      variants is, I have explained, generally independent of the copy-text. Perhaps one concession
      should be made. Suppose that the claims of two readings, one in the copy-text and one in some
      other authority, appear to be exactly balanced: what then should an editor do? In such a case,
      while there can be no logical reason for giving preference to the copy-text, in practice, if
      there is no reason for altering its reading, the obvious thing seems to be to let it
       stand.<ref target="f003.02.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref></p>
     <p>Much more important, and difficult, are the problems that arise in connexion with revision.
      McKerrow seems only to mention correction, but I think he must have intended to include
      revision, so long as this falls short of complete rewriting: in any case the principle is the
      same. I have already considered the practice he advocated (pp. 23-25)&mdash;namely that an
      editor should take the original edition as his copy-text and introduce into it all the
      substantive variants of the revised reprint, other than manifest errors&mdash;and have
      explained that I regard it as too sweeping and mechanical. The emendation that I proposed (p.
      26) is, I think, theoretically sufficient, but from a practical point of view it lacks
      precision. In a case of revision or correction the normal procedure would be for the author to
      send the printer either a list of the alterations to be made or else a corrected copy of an
      earlier edition. In setting up the new edition we may suppose that the printer would
      incorporate the alterations thus indicated by the author; but it must be assumed that he would
      also introduce a normal amount of unauthorized variation of his own.<ref target="f003.02.19"
       n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> The problem that faces the editor is to distinguish
      between the two categories. I suggest the following frankly subjective procedure. Granting
      that the fact of revision (or correction) is established, <pb n="003.032"/> an editor should
      in every case of variation ask himself (1) whether the original reading is one that can
      reasonably be attributed to the author, and (2) whether the later reading is one that the
      author can reasonably be supposed to have substituted for the former. If the answer to the
      first question is negative, then the later reading should be accepted as at least possibly an
      authoritative correction (unless, of course, it is itself incredible). If the answer to (1) is
      affirmative and the answer to (2) is negative, the original reading should be retained. If the
      answers to both questions are affirmative, then the later reading should be presumed to be due
      to revision and admitted into the text, whether the editor himself considers it an improvement
      or not. It will be observed that one implication of this procedure is that a later variant
      that is either completely indifferent or manifestly inferior, or for the substitution of which
      no motive can be suggested, should be treated as fortuitous and refused admission to the
      text&mdash;to the scandal of faithful followers of McKerrow. I do not, of course, pretend that
      my procedure will lead to consistently correct results, but I think that the results, if less
      uniform, will be on the whole preferable to those achieved through following any mechanical
      rule. I am, no doubt, presupposing an editor of reasonable competence; but if an editor is
      really incompetent, I doubt whether it much matters what procedure he adopts: he may indeed do
      less harm with some than with others, he will do little good with any. And in any case, I
      consider that it would be disastrous to curb the liberty of competent editors in the hope of
      preventing fools from behaving after their kind.</p>
     <p>I will give one illustration of the procedure in operation, taken again from Jonson's <hi
       rend="italic">Masque of Gipsies</hi>, a work that is known to have been extensively revised
      for a later performance. At one point the text of the original version runs as follows, <q>a
       wise Gypsie . . . is as politicke a piece of Flesh, as most Iustices in the County where he
       maunds</q> whereas the texts of the revised version replace <hi rend="italic">maunds</hi> by
       <hi rend="italic">stalkes</hi>. Now, <hi rend="italic">maund</hi> is a recognized canting
      term meaning to beg, and there is not the least doubt that it is what Jonson originally wrote.
      Further, it might well be argued that it is less likely that he should have displaced it in
      revision by a comparatively commonplace <pb n="003.033"/> alternative, than that a scribe
      should have altered a rather unusual word that he failed to understand&mdash;just as we know
      that, in a line already quoted (p. 27), a scribe altered <hi rend="italic">flirted</hi> to <hi
       rend="italic">blewe</hi>. I should myself incline to this view were it not that at another
      point Jonson in revision added the lines, <q>
       <l>And then ye may stalke</l>
       <l>The <hi rend="italic">Gypsies</hi> walke</l>
      </q> where <hi rend="italic">stalk</hi>, in the sense of going stealthily, is used almost as a
      technical term. In view of this I do not think it unreasonable to suppose that Jonson himself
      substituted <hi rend="italic">stalkes</hi> for <hi rend="italic">maunds</hi> from a desire to
      avoid the implication that his aristocratic Gipsies were beggars, and I conclude that it must
      be allowed to pass as (at least possibly) a correction, though no reasonable critic would <hi
       rend="italic">prefer</hi> it to the original.</p>
     <p>With McKerrow's view that in all normal cases of correction or revision the original edition
      should still be taken as the copy-text, I am in complete agreement. But not all cases are
      normal, as McKerrow himself recognized. While advocating, in the passage already quoted (p.
      25), that the earliest 'good' edition should be taken as copy-text and corrections
      incorporated in it, he added the proviso, 'unless we could show that the [revised] edition in
      question (or the copy from which it had been printed) had been gone over and corrected <hi
       rend="italic">throughout</hi> by' the author (my italics). This proviso is not in fact very
      explicit, but it clearly assumes that there are (or at least may be) cases in which an editor
      would be justified in taking a revised reprint as his copy-text, and it may be worth inquiring
      what these supposed cases are. If a work has been entirely rewritten, and is printed from a
      new manuscript, the question does not arise, since the revised edition will be a substantive
      one, and as such will presumably be chosen by the editor as his copy-text. But short of this,
      an author, wishing to make corrections or alterations in his work, may not merely hand the
      printer a revised copy of an earlier edition, but himself supervise the printing of the new
      edition and correct the proofs as the sheets go through the press. In such a case it may be
      argued that even though the earlier edition, if printed from his own manuscript, will preserve
      the author's individual peculiarities more faithfully than the revised reprint, he must
      nevertheless be assumed <pb n="003.034"/> to have taken responsibility for the latter in
      respect of accidentals no less than substantive readings, and that it is therefore the revised
      reprint that should be taken as copy-text.</p>
     <p>The classical example is afforded by the plays in the 1616 folio of Ben Jonson's Works. In
      this it appears that even the largely recast <hi rend="italic">Every Man in his Humour</hi>
      was not set up from an independent manuscript but from a much corrected copy of the quarto of
      1601. That Jonson revised the proofs of the folio has indeed been disputed, but Simpson is
      most likely correct in supposing that he did so, and he was almost certainly responsible for
      the numerous corrections made while the sheets were in process of printing. Simpson's
      consequent decision to take the folio for his copy-text for the plays it contains will
      doubtless be approved by most critics. I at least have no wish to dispute his choice.<ref
       target="f003.02.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref> Only I would point out&mdash;and
      here I think Dr. Simpson would agree with me&mdash;that even in this case the procedure
      involves some sacrifice of individuality. For example, I notice that in the text of <hi
       rend="italic">Sejanus</hi> as printed by him there are twenty-eight instances of the
      Jonsonian 'Apostrophus' (an apostrophe indicating the elision of a vowel that is nevertheless
      retained in printing) but of these only half actually appear in the folio, the rest he has
      introduced from the quarto. This amounts to an admission that in some respects at least the
      quarto preserves the formal aspect of the author's original more faithfully than the
      folio.</p>
     <p>The fact is that cases of revision differ so greatly in circumstances and character that it
      seems impossible to lay down any hard and fast rule as to when an editor should take the
      original edition as his copy-text and when the revised reprint. All that can be said is that
      if the original be selected, then the author's corrections must be incorporated; and that if
      the reprint be selected, then the original reading must be restored when that of the reprint
      is due to unauthorized variation. Thus the editor cannot escape the responsibility of
      distinguishing to the best of his ability between the two categories. No juggling with
      copy-text will relieve him of the duty and necessity of exercizing his own judgement.</p>
     <p>In conclusion I should like to examine this problem of revision <pb n="003.035"/> and
      copy-text a little closer. In the case of a work like <hi rend="italic">Sejanus</hi>, in which
      correction or revision has been slight, it would obviously be possible to take the quarto as
      the copy-text and introduce into it whatever authoritative alterations the folio may supply;
      and indeed, were one editing the play independently, this would be the natural course to
      pursue. But a text like that of <hi rend="italic">Every Man in his Humour</hi> presents an
      entirely different problem. In the folio revision and reproduction are so blended that it
      would seem impossible to disentangle intentional from what may be fortuitous variation, and
      injudicious to make the attempt. An editor of the revised version has no choice but to take
      the folio as his copy-text. It would appear therefore that a reprint may in practice be forced
      upon an editor as copy-text by the nature of the revision itself, quite apart from the
      question whether or not the author exercized any supervision over its printing.</p>
     <p>This has a bearing upon another class of texts, in which a reprint was revised, not by the
      author, but through comparison with some more authoritative manuscript. Instances are
      Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi> and <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>. Of both
      much the best text is supplied by the folio of 1623; but this is not a substantive text, but
      one set up from a copy of an earlier quarto that had been extensively corrected by collation
      with a manuscript preserved in the playhouse. So great and so detailed appears to have been
      the revision that it would be an almost impossible task to distinguish between variation due
      to the corrector and that due to the compositor,<ref target="f003.02.21" n="21"><hi
        rend="super">21</hi></ref> and an editor has no choice but to take the folio as copy-text.
      Indeed, this would in any case be incumbent upon him for a different reason; for the folio
      texts are in some parts connected by transcriptional continuity with the author's manuscript,
      whereas the quartos contain only reported texts, whose accidental characteristics can be of no
      authority whatever. At the same time, analogy with <hi rend="italic">Every Man in his
       Humour</hi> suggests that even had the quartos of <hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">King Lear</hi> possessed higher authority than in fact they do, the choice of
      copy-text must yet have been the same.</p>
     <p>I began this discussion in the hope of clearing my own mind as well as others' on a rather
      obscure though not unimportant matter <pb n="003.036"/> of editorial practice. I have done
      something to sort out my own ideas: others must judge for themselves. If they disagree, it is
      up to them to maintain some different point of view. My desire is rather to provoke discussion
      than to lay down the law.</p>

       I have above ignored the practice of some eccentric editors who took as copy-text for a work

     <p>BIBLIOGRAPHY CONCERNS ITSELF WITH EDITORIAL problems not as a usurper of the functions of
      legitimate criticism, but instead as the necessary foundation on which, in certain
      investigations, textual criticism must be based and to which criticism must constantly refer
      for more or less definitive judgments. Bibliography, in W. W. Greg's acute phrase, is the
      grammar of literary investigation. This position was strikingly advanced in Greg's classic
      address on the relations of bibliography to literature which appeared some time ago in <hi
       rend="italic">Neophilologus</hi>, and, again, in his "Bibliography&mdash;An Apologia" (<hi
       rend="italic">The Library</hi>, 4th ser. XIII [1932], 113 ff.). Any attempt merely to restate
      Greg's views here would be quite superfluous. For some years, at least among scholars, the
      inferential identification of bibliography with textual criticism has been so firmly
      established that to talk about the contribution of one to the other might appear to be like a
      solemn discussion of the usefulness of the arm to the hand.</p>
     <p>Nevertheless, it is possible to suspect that, as more and more scholars have come to deal
      with these twin methods, the popularizing of their disciplines may have led, by subtle
      degrees, to a rather over-simplified view of the basic provinces of bibliography and textual
      criticism, especially as applied to editorial problems. Certainly the theory that every
      bibliographer is professionally qualified to be a full-fledged textual critic and editor is
      quite wrong. Correspondingly, there are a number of distinguished <pb n="003.038"/> textual
      critics whom, according to any strict accounting, we might hesitate to call
      bibliographers.</p>
     <p>Some fortunate scholars like Pollard, McKerrow, Greg, and Percy Simpson may happily combine
      in themselves both functions, although perhaps in unequal proportions; but this two souls in
      body one is certainly the exception rather than the rule. On the other hand, the most
      prominent Elizabethan textual critic now living&mdash;I refer to Mr. Dover Wilson&mdash;often
      operates in that dark region of the ur-state of a text which McKerrow rightly hesitated to
      identify with bibliography. One should comment, however, that not all of Wilson's
      readers&mdash;or his critics&mdash;are completely aware of the distinction. It is somewhat
      perturbing, for example, in Hereward Price's admirable "Towards a Scientific Method of Textual
      Criticism in the Elizabethan Drama"<ref target="f003.03.01" n="1"><hi rend="super"
       >1</hi></ref> to find his chief whipping boy, Dover Wilson, consistently referred to as
      representing the bibliographical school. Save for his impatience at various of Wilson's
      well-known aberrations, Mr. Price&mdash;no more than the rest of us&mdash;would, I should
      think, completely discount such investigations. But we may agree with McKerrow and Greg that
      this scholarship is not usually bibliographical in any sense in which we should be prepared to
      use the term.</p>
     <p>Bibliography is likely to be a vague and misused word because it has come to be employed for
      too many different purposes. For the present discussion we may rule out enumerative
      bibliography&mdash;the making-up of finding or reference lists of books on various
      subjects&mdash;and use the term to mean analytical bibliography, the investigation and
      explanation of a book as a material object. Yet even within this narrower limitation there are
      various strata and subdivisions of research. For example, we have such forms of
      bibliographical spadework as the identification and recording of type-faces as by Haebler, or
      of <hi rend="italic">STC</hi> printers' ornaments as is now in progress by F. S. Ferguson,
      with their dates and history.</p>
     <p>But when we move from such essential preliminary investigation, and from the recording of
      material data as a part of publishing history, to another sort of bibliography, more
      specifically of the kind we designate as <hi rend="italic">analytical</hi>, we come to a field
      in which all our accumulated knowledge of printing practice and history is <pb n="003.039"/>
      devoted to the examination of individual or related books as material objects, with a view to
      determining the facts of their production. Is there or is there not a cancel in a certain
      gathering; were the various sheets of a book printed <hi rend="italic">seriatim</hi> or
      simultaneously in two or more sections; did one or two compositors, one or more presses, work
      on this book, and if so which parts did they do; was a cancel title-page or a cancel in the
      text printed later or as a part of the continuous printing of the book. Are variants in the
      sheets of the book the result of different impressions, or do they result from different
      typesettings or from simple correction at the press. If some of the sheets are of a single
      impression but certain others exhibit variant typesettings, which setting is the original, and
      why was the resetting made. If there are variant imprints, which was first through the press.
      And so on. It will be seen that correct answers to some of these questions depend not only on
      the simple discovery of the facts themselves, but more particularly on the satisfactory
      explanation of the ascertained facts. From specific analyses of this kind, some speculatively
      minded bibliographers may endeavor to evolve new techniques for bringing to light yet further
      secrets in printed books, techniques which may enable us to attack successfully some general
      problems which have heretofore been thought insoluble.</p>
     <p>Such technical examinations of individual books for their own sake are proceeding very
      swiftly these days, and they are being matched step by step by the parallel development of
      techniques for determining with greater precision the relation of the printed book to its
      underlying manuscript.<ref target="f003.03.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> No textual
      critic can afford to ignore the results of these investigations. From Willoughby's and
      Hinman's explorations of spelling tests,<ref target="f003.03.03" n="3"><hi rend="super"
       >3</hi></ref> assisted in certain cases by evidence from the varying length of the
      compositor's stick,<ref target="f003.03.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> we are now
      able to distinguish with some certainty in the <hi rend="italic">STC</hi> period and the
      following years the precise pages of a book set by different compositors. By an equation of
      these compositors' <pb n="003.040"/> habits we can thereupon make certain assumptions about
      the characteristics of the manuscript from which they were setting. The cooperative efforts
      which have been made in the analysis of the evidence of headlines<ref target="f003.03.05"
       n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> have opened up possibilities, in combination with this
      compositor evidence, for determining sometimes quite minute but necessary questions of the
      presswork and proofreading. To these may be added&mdash;among many other
      investigations&mdash;the classic Carter and Pollard examination of paper and type which
      exposed the Wise forgeries, Hazen's use of identified paper to detect Strawberry Hill
      forgeries, and Stevenson's technique for aligning watermarks with presswork.<ref
       target="f003.03.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> The unexpected uses of bibliography
      have been demonstrated in Bond's assignment of authorship to certain doubtful <hi
       rend="italic">Spectator</hi> papers, the whole argument resting ultimately on type left
      standing in advertisements and headings.<ref target="f003.03.07" n="7"><hi rend="super"
       >7</hi></ref></p>
     <p>Astonishing results have recently accrued from certain research on eighteenth-century press
      figures, which had been earlier dismissed by McKerrow as of little bibliographical
      significance. Knotts<ref target="f003.03.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> has added a
      chapter to the work of Sale, Chapman, and others; and W. B. Todd's latest interpretation of
      the evidence of these figures in a number of books demonstrates some most exciting things one
      can learn of printing.<ref target="f003.03.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> From this
      evidence a whole new area of research has been opened up of such importance for distinguishing
      impressions, partial re-impressions, and editions, as well as various other important textual
      matters, that we may well believe in many cases press figures alone will come to be the most
      valuable tool for penetrating the extreme difficulties of textual problems in frequently
      reprinted popular eighteenth-century authors.</p>
     <pb n="003.041"/>
     <p>I should be less than candid if I tried to pretend that the immediate or even the chief aim
      of these and of many other bibliographical scholars was to serve as the sons of Martha to
      textual criticism. Without question, a number of bibliographical investigations which
      eventually proved invaluable to textual criticism were not undertaken with this end
      immediately in view and almost by accident arrived at their textual applications. Thus a real
      difference from textual criticism must always be felt, I suspect, in bibliographical research
      in its purest aspect. To defend themselves against doubters, bibliographers are accustomed to
      argue that the ultimate aim of all bibliographical research, and therefore its justification,
      is the definitive account of books in a descriptive bibliography, or the direct application of
      their findings to textual criticism. But I make bold to say that&mdash;at least as I view
      it&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> end of a great deal of research is no such
      thing. Although I believe that the conventional justification is valid for the ultimate aims,
      and that this rationale is deeply felt by almost every bibliographical student, nevertheless,
      even though eventual application is the ideal, ordinarily textual criticism has not provided
      the immediate spur to the investigation and no specific textual use is often anticipated, at
      least in the early stages of the work. This attitude develops, in part, because many technical
      studies that are absolutely necessary yet require no interest in textual criticism on the part
      of the investigator. In part, because various of these studies are concerned only with a
      fragment of some total problem, the whole of which must be unraveled before any of it can be
      made of practical use to textual criticism.</p>
     <p>Nonetheless, in spite of the various legitimate reasons which may be advanced to explain the
      rationale for much technical work in bibliography, the point of view does in fact serve to
      separate many bibliographers from textual critics; indeed, it would be tempting to say <hi
       rend="italic">most</hi> bibliographers were it not an increasing tendency for a number of
      analysts, with or without due training, to cross over the line and to concern themselves
      directly with the editing of texts. Others, though not editors, may develop so great an
      interest in textual questions that they direct their research specifically towards
      bibliographical problems which do have an immediate textual application and thus underlie
      accurate criticism. The record, while respectable, has not been one of unalloyed <pb
       n="003.042"/> success, perhaps, and when bibliographers have concerned themselves with
      matters of textual criticism that were not primarily bibliographical, they have sometimes
      floundered pitifully if they lacked the training and the qualities of mind which are necessary
      for textual criticism in <hi rend="italic">its</hi> purest state.</p>
     <p>I use this statement of a point too often overlooked, in our current tendency to exalt the
      bibliographer, as an aid towards a cursory glance at the nature of textual criticism, a
      subject on which I can speak with little authority and on which I shall anticipate correction.
      It is perhaps absurd to set up too sharp a distinction between textual critics and textual
      bibliographers. Anyone, we may suppose, who is concerned with the origin, derivation,
      authority, and correctness of a text, in whole or in part, is a textual critic, no matter what
      his method of approach. Some scholars tackle problems through bibliography, some through what
      Greg has called metacriticism, some through an attempted or actual combination of bibliography
      and criticism. For purposes of distinction I must deal in blacks and whites more starkly than
      is perhaps realistic. Nevertheless, I am sure that when we distinguish between a McKerrow and
      a Dover Wilson, both brilliant examples of different schools, we are in fact implying a
      greater fundamental difference than exists between the conservative and speculative wings of
      the same method.</p>
     <p>Greg&mdash;and in this he is frequently misunderstood&mdash;insists that the bibliographer
      must view a book only as a material object.<ref target="f003.03.10" n="10"><hi rend="super"
        >10</hi></ref> This is a far cry from the aims of a textual critic. Historically, textual
      criticism developed long before analytical bibliography; and it evolved its own rules,
      especially for dealing with manuscripts, both classical and vernacular, according to certain
      principles which are outside the strictly bibliographical range, if for our purposes we
      continue to limit the definition of bibliography to analytical bibliography. These principles,
      or something like them, were also applied to printed books, again before bibliography was more
      than a gleam in the eye, and&mdash;as Greg has shown in his paper for this series&mdash;they
      are still in part applicable to certain problems. Thus there has been established in the past
      a firm tradition for dealing with texts; and it would be foolish <pb n="003.043"/> for us to
      believe that analytical bibliography has displaced this tradition, or even that in many cases
      it could. Nevertheless, analytical bibliography has demonstrated that in some circumstances
      the classical tradition is not completely self-sufficient. We may put it, therefore, that
      bibliography is neither a usurper nor a poor relation in the field of textual criticism, but
      rather its foundation, the grammar of the subject.</p>
     <p>If, in the interests of brevity, we pass over the important field of manuscript texts and
      concern ourselves with textual criticism based chiefly on printed books, we may, perhaps,
      discern three main but by no means mutually exclusive lines of endeavor. The first concerns
      itself with the authorship, origin, and characteristics of the lost manuscript behind a
      printed book both in whole and in part. I am thinking first of various studies in the
      attribution of anonymous works, or of the solution of problems in multiple authorship as in
      the Beaumont and Fletcher plays, Massinger, and Dekker; and secondly of such studies as Mr.
      Duthie has made in the bad quarto of <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and more recently in the
      Pide Bull <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>. Dover Wilson's reconstructions of the manuscript
      copy for <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and other texts should be placed here, as also various
      studies such as Hoppe's of <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi> but especially Greg's of
       <hi rend="italic">Doctor Faustus</hi>. As with the <hi rend="italic">Faustus</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">Lear</hi> investigations, according to the circumstances this division may
      merge imperceptibly with the second, which I take to be concerned with the critical analysis
      of texts in known manuscripts or printed exempla. Here we might place studies like Grierson's
      on the text of Donne, Wolf's on commonplace books, Shaaber's on <hi rend="italic">2 Henry
       IV.</hi> The determination of the order and authority of printed texts after the first also
      applies, and we must certainly include the very difficult task of separating from
      compositor's, proof-reader's, and printing-house editor's alterations those true revisions
      from an authoritatively corrected copy used as the basis for a later edition. The relation of
      the variants in the Quarto and Folio of <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
       >Troilus and Cressida</hi> is such a problem. In all of these divisions various special
      studies may enter in one form or another. I list as examples a few of the inquiries which Mr.
      Price sets up as among the subjects for textual criticism: vocabulary tests of authorship, and
      also of plagiarism, metrical tests including study of broken lines, deficient lines, redundant
      syllables, feminine endings, <pb n="003.044"/> prose as blank verse, and so on, applied to
      form an opinion of a text.</p>
     <p>Finally, perhaps we may assign as a third general division the orderly bringing together of
      all this information in an editorial capacity, and the consequent evolution of a modern
      critical text designed to represent the intentions of the author more faithfully than any
      single preserved manuscript or printed copy. Whereas the findings of analytical bibliography
      may or may not be applicable in the first two divisions, the claims of analysis enter full
      force in the editorial third.</p>
     <p>In the first two divisions, it is true, the investigations lead hopefully towards the ideal
      of a definitive text, but, as with pure bibliography, much textual criticism is undertaken
      either for its own sake or else to attack only a fragment of the total problem, so that the
      immediate end of the research may not be the formation of a text. For example, Mr. Duthie did
      not edit <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> after he had solved the problem of the bad quarto. It
      will be convenient, however, to treat textual criticism and its relations to bibliography in
      its narrower application to the evolution of an edited text and to the various delicate
      problems that arise before this text can eventually be fixed. Moreover, the limitation may be
      extended to cover only the specific problem of old-spelling critical texts, for&mdash;as
      Greg's paper has shown&mdash;these are subject to certain criteria which do not always apply
      to modernized versions, even though the basic problems are shared in common.</p>
     <p>At the start one should distinguish certain editorial problems that have no necessary
      connection with bibliography. An editor of the literature of the past must have considerable
      linguistic attainments, or ready access to professional advice. Through long familiarity he
      must grow to be a native in the characteristic thought, usage, speech patterns, and customs of
      his period. Although bibliography may occasionally assist in the solution of some problems, or
      offer a convincing after-the-event confirmation, much emendation&mdash;or refusal to
      emend&mdash;much estimate of authenticity, must be made quite independently of bibliographical
      considerations and instead on a philological basis. This aspect has no relation to
      bibliography, and it requires a discipline and study which leave little time for
      bibliographical investigations not concerning the problem immediately at hand. Moreover, if
       <pb n="003.045"/> we speak of only one characteristic, the great emendations have been
      inspired art and not systematic science. One can give a rational palaeographical explanation
      to derive "a table of green fields" set in type from the crabbed script of "a" babld of green
      fields," but I beg leave to doubt that this famous emendation would to the present day ever
      have been arrived at by strictly palaeographic reasoning. Greg, I believe, has no very high
      opinion of palaeography as giving more than a hint for emendations,<ref target="f003.03.11"
       n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> although its confirmation is often most valuable.
      Usually, I suspect, one arrives at an emendation of any subtlety by inspiration, memory, and a
      strong sense of analogy, and then one brings in palaeography if possible to justify one's
      conclusions.</p>
     <p>Many other considerations of text are too frequently confused as soluble by bibliography.
      For example, bibliography can establish that edition <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> was printed
      from edition <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>, and not from an independent manuscript; but if
      revisions appear in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi>, there is no bibliographical technique for
      determining except in isolated cases whether they derive from the author himself, a scribe
      revising the text of <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> from a manuscript, or an editor of some kind.
      Such problems in one way or another involving emendation or the acceptance of variant readings
      fall to the lot of the textual critic once bibliography has cleared his way to the limit of
      its ability.</p>
     <p>This critical acumen, which we cannot value too highly as applied to text, is, of course,
      the product of a keen and imaginative mind; but, again, it is materially aided by a very close
      acquaintance with one's period in general philological considerations. This acquaintance
      gradually develops an opinion about speech and imagery which, in mature and thoughtful hands,
      has its own authority not only in questions of emendation but in any division of textual
      criticism. We may note that even the conservative, bibliographical McKerrow does not disdain
      in certain circumstances to write about the authority of variants between editions which best
      seem to have the greatest internal harmony with an author.<ref target="f003.03.12" n="12"><hi
        rend="super">12</hi></ref></p>
     <p>This strong and subtle imagination necessary for close inquiries <pb n="003.046"/> into
      texts may apply itself to studies in attribution, plagiarism, or multiple authorship, or to
      studies in an author's speech and metrical characteristics, or it may be found in Dover
      Wilson's various attempts&mdash;whether rightly or wrongly&mdash;to discover layers of
      revision in the pre-printing history of a manuscript, or it may be utilized in the scrupulous
      examination of the sources and methods of corruption in a text which Duthie has demonstrated
      in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>. Such striking
      deductions as those Duthie makes about the composition of memorial texts from tag ends of
      general recollections exhibit a critical virtuosity which has its own discipline and rigorous
      training.</p>
     <p>If I were a textual critic concerned with such matters as I have been sketching, problems
      involving my total powers as a critic, I fancy I should be rather impatient with a
      bibliographer who insisted that I should be all this and McKerrow too. And I should be
      strongly inclined to reply: you are a technician&mdash;you do the technical part of this
      business and I shall apply your findings, taking care that I have studied the principles and
      general methods of your craft seriously enough so that I can follow your arguments and
      understand the applicability of what you are saying.</p>
     <p>This is roughly what has happened, and as a consequence something like the following
      rationale is commonly accepted. The bibliographer's function is to prepare the general
      material of the texts, when bibliographical investigation is necessarily involved; and the
      textual critic, in the light of bibliographical findings, can then proceed to apply the
      discovered relationships, and to add his own art, to achieve the finished, definitive
      result.</p>
     <p>Since we are an age of specialists, this separation of function seems reasonable to us.
      Indeed, in various cases it may work very well, and in some it may even be positively
      necessary. Yet I must confess it is a position I held with more conviction in the past than I
      do today, and I anticipate holding it with even less conviction in the future, especially if
      certain far-reaching bibliographical speculations and experimental techniques for dealing with
      the accidentals in an old-spelling text ever reach success. This change in attitude, I am
      conscious, may have been dictated too much by various experiences with amateur editors, from
      whom the good Lord deliver us, by a tendency to over-emphasize the importance of a close
      reconstruction of accidentals, and by allowing the <pb n="003.047"/> special problems of
      distinctly unusual texts to bulk too large in my mind so that the uncomplicated,
      run-of-the-mill variety is obscured.</p>
     <p>Whatever the cause, I have here what is only a selection of examples to illustrate that a
      textual critic, when he is himself incapable of applying advanced bibliographical techniques
      to every detail of an old-spelling text, can seldom achieve absolute authority in his results,
      and may indeed be led into serious error through the false confidence induced in him by the
      notion that bibliography has sufficiently prepared the way before his labors have begun.</p>
     <p>This hypothetical critic can ordinarily be prepared only to follow and apply bibliographical
      arguments: his training has not prepared him to evaluate their correctness on technical
      grounds. A small but rather interesting example occurs in Thomas Southerne's <hi rend="italic"
       >Disappointment</hi> of 1684. Here the case for a cancel to abridge a censored scene was very
      plausibly advanced in 1933, and in 1946 was vetted by a good bibliographer who made some
      necessary modifications but in no way questioned the central thesis. Yet in the last sixteen
      years if any textual critic had treated the scene in the light of this apparently
      authoritative evidence, without testing it bibliographically for himself, he would have been
      quite wrong, for no cancel exists and the scene is not abridged.<ref target="f003.03.13"
       n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref></p>
     <p>Secondly, this critic may often be forced to enter upon subjects where rigorous
      bibliographical investigation has not yet been made, although he may not be aware of that
      fact. A really egregious case of false bibliography has only recently been corrected by W. B.
      Todd's study of <hi rend="italic">The Monk</hi>.<ref target="f003.03.14" n="14"><hi
        rend="super">14</hi></ref> The full story is very involved, but the point is brief. If
      between 1935 and 1949 any critic had blindly relied on the accepted ordering of the publishing
      history which pseudo-bibliography had set up, he would have been led to evolve a text which
      treated Lewis's revisions as the original readings, and the readings which Lewis had discarded
      as in fact his later revisions. <hi rend="italic">Q. E. D.</hi> Don't trust all the
      bibliographers.</p>
     <pb n="003.048"/>
     <p>This is a pretty fix for a textual critic, since he is damned if he does and damned if he
      doesn't. And in fact, in many cases no solution for his dilemma is possible unless he is
      himself also a trained bibliographer who is capable of re-examining technically a fouled-up
      problem. Yet he must do something. One course is to trust only <hi rend="italic">some</hi>
      bibliographers. The very best butter. Nonetheless we may well remember in this connection Curt
      B&uuml;hler's favorite quotation of the observation made by A. W. Pollard on his colleague
      Robert Proctor, a great pioneer in incunabula studies, "that in matters of bibliography he
      would not have taken the results of an archangel upon trust." As an example we may survey two
      specific but fortunately minor instances in which Mr. Duthie in his new edition of <hi
       rend="italic">King Lear</hi> was misled by untested bibliography. A small part of his
      arguments concerning certain peculiarities of the quarto rests on Greg's speculation that two
      compositors with different habits might have been engaged with the book. Now in this case Greg
      was not speaking <hi rend="italic">ex cathedra</hi> as the result of a detailed
      bibliographical examination, but only in terms of possibilities. Fortunately the point was of
      no very great consequence for Duthie's conclusions, because he accepted the speculation on
      trust and did not test it. We know now, however, from a recent bibliographical study, which
      can be confirmed by even stricter bibliographical evidence,<ref target="f003.03.15" n="15"><hi
        rend="super">15</hi></ref> that only one compositor set the book. These peculiarities,
      therefore, require another explanation.</p>
     <p>In the second instance the point of discussion is the mislining of the verse at the opening
      of Act III, Scene 2, the great storm scene. Greg took the view that the early part is mislined
      because the compositor was setting the text as prose, and it was not until he reached a
      certain point that he recognized he was dealing with verse and thereafter proceeded to line
      correctly. Duthie, naturally, accepted Greg's explanation as 'bibliographical,' and quite
      properly added that of course the compositor must have gone back to insert capitals at the
      beginning of each line in the prose section to give it the appearance of verse that it assumes
      in the printing. However, a single piece of bibliographical evidence demonstrates the
      mechanical impossibility of such a procedure. Throughout <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> the
      compositor of the quarto used a short stick for verse and <pb n="003.049"/> a longer stick for
      prose; and he never sets prose in his short or verse measure. Since the opening lines of this
      scene were set in the verse measure, not the prose, the explanation for the mislineation must
      be sought elsewhere, for from the start the compositor intended to set verse. But other
      consequences resulted from this failure to see the bibliographical evidence. Because the
      implications of the short measure were not recognized, in these lines Duthie
      over-conservatively retained a corrupt lack of punctuation which succeeds in destroying,
      almost completely, not only a successful flower of rhetoric but also one of the mightiest
      images of this great storm scene.<ref target="f003.03.16" n="16"><hi rend="super"
       >16</hi></ref></p>
     <p>If the critic finding himself thus abused hurls a curse on this treacherous science of
      bibliography and betakes himself to his own estimates&mdash;to what Greg calls metacritical
      evidence&mdash;he may find himself in a rather vulnerable position. A simple, though typical,
      case occurs in <hi rend="italic">The Dumbe Knight</hi> of 1608 which is preserved with either
      one of two title-pages, the major difference between them being that one gives the author's
      name whereas the other does not. Metacritics worked up a pretty romance about this play,
      conjecturing that Gervase Markham, the author, was so disgusted when he found his play printed
      with an inferior under-plot by another hand that he withdrew his name from the title. On the
      contrary, bibliography demonstrates that the title with the name is the true cancel leaf so
      that the name was added rather than excised.<ref target="f003.03.17" n="17"><hi rend="super"
        >17</hi></ref></p>
     <p>Vulnerability increases when the problem is one of any complexity. Here is a small problem
      yet one in which an old-spelling editor must make a decision. The inner forme of text sheet A
      of George Sandys's <hi rend="italic">Christs Passion</hi>, a translation in 1640 from Grotius,
      was reset in the course of enlarging the edition. One typesetting of this inner forme agrees
      largely with the invariant outer forme in making up capital W's from two V's, whereas the
      other uses regular W's. Aha, says the critic, I'm not so bad at bibliography myself: obviously
      the setting of inner A which is consistent with outer A must be the original for me to
      reprint. The only trouble is, he is wrong. A rather technical interpretation of the evidence
       <pb n="003.050"/> of the headlines demonstrates that this setting must have been printed a
      sheet or so later.<ref target="f003.03.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref> The
      inconsistent forme is the authoritative original which must be taken for the copy-text, and it
      is probably inconsistent because we may be dealing with two compositors casting off copy and
      setting by formes in order to get the book started in a hurry.</p>
     <p>We do not need the example of nineteenth-century editors basing Shakespeare texts on the
      Pavier Quartos to indicate some of the larger dangers of inferences about the relations of
      texts made on purely metacritical grounds. But lest we feel too confident about our present
      abilities to cope with matters more properly the province of textual criticism, such as our
      ability to construct a correct family tree of editions on the basis of their readings alone,
      we may consider the case of the ninth edition of Dryden's <hi rend="italic">Indian
       Emperour</hi> in 1694. Certain of its readings are drawn apparently at random from those
      which are unique in the seventh edition and are not found in the eighth. Others derive from
      equally random readings unique in the eighth and not found in the seventh. There are three
      reputable critical interpretations of this phenomenon: (1) the ninth edition comes from an
      independent manuscript; (2) the seventh and eighth editions were collated at the printing
      house and the conflation of readings thus results from editorial intervention&mdash;or one
      might even introduce collation of one of these editions against a prompt copy or other
      manuscript; (3) the ninth is set from a lost edition which may be placed in between the
      seventh and eighth and on which the eighth is also based. This last would be a favorite with
      critics accustomed to dealing with manuscripts, and it is certainly the most plausible.</p>
     <p>At least the first two of these quite reputable explanations might cause some critical
      perturbation, since fresh authority could have been introduced into the text, and the various
      new readings in the ninth not found in either the seventh or eighth might demand critical
      acceptance on their merits. However, when analytical techniques are applied, the answer is not
      hard to find. Two compositors were employed on the ninth edition, but&mdash;perhaps because
      only one press was available&mdash;instead of chopping the reprint up into two sections to be
      set and printed simultaneously, <pb n="003.051"/> they set the book <hi rend="italic"
       >seriatim</hi> but working in relay. One would compose from four to five type-pages, or only
      one or two, and then be relieved by the other while he distributed his type, and so on in
      turn. Since the eighth edition was a paginal reprint of the seventh, what actually happened
      was that one compositor set from a copy of the seventh, and the other from a copy of the
      eighth, and so they worked merrily along in relay to the confusion of scholarship, conflating
      the two editions to form the ninth. The answer is very easy after bibliographical analysis.
      <ref target="f003.03.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref></p>
     <p>I do not wish to infer that in all cases bibliographical evidence is applicable. To be
      properly bibliographical, evidence must concern itself with only certain relations between
      preserved printed or inscribed pieces of paper. For example, a form of textual criticism
      linked with bibliography can usually decide on an over-all basis whether variations in a later
      edition are compositors' variants or editorial revisions; and pure bibliography can
      demonstrate whether or not this later edition was otherwise set from a copy of an earlier. But
      whether these revisions were the author's or someone else's can never be decided by
      bibliography under ordinary circumstances; that is for textual criticism pure and simple. The
      case is usually not demonstrable by any form of bibliographical evidence. Some critics may
      deal extensively with evidence which is probably bibliographical at bottom because it is
      founded on the peculiarities of printed inscriptions on paper; but the inferences they draw
      may have no relation to the laws of bibliographical evidence. As I shall indicate in a moment,
      strictly bibliographical deduction is not always possible from bibliographical facts. It is
      this common confusion about the difference between the strictly bibliographical and the
      metacritical interpretation of the evidence offered by a book as a material object which
      places, wrongly I believe, a number of Dover Wilson's ingenious arguments in the field of
      bibliography. Larger examples may be cited. The <hi rend="italic">Taming of the Shrew</hi>
      problem can have no bibliographical basis, for whatever relation existed between <hi
       rend="italic">A Shrew</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Shrew</hi> antedates their printing, and
      the manuscripts behind the printed copy of each have no bibliographical relation. Somewhat
      less clearly, perhaps, the formation of a critical text of <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>
      <pb n="003.052"/> is not, basically, a bibliographical investigation. There is no direct
      relationship between the three printed texts.</p>
     <p>But when pure textual criticism concerns itself with problems in which bibliographical
      investigation is possible, it can seldom be equally definitive as in this other field, for
      critical interpretation of evidence is at best inferential, and the logic of the argument is
      frequently reversible. Until the problem was directly tackled by bibliographical methods, the
      question of whether <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> in the Folio was set from an
      annotated copy of the quarto or from an independent manuscript had yielded no convincing
      answer from the critical approach. Yet Mr. Williams has made the problem seem like child's
      play,<ref target="f003.03.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref> and we may find his study
      very illuminating for the relative validity of bibliographical and critical methods in such
      situations. Similarly, Mr. Hinman's authoritative study of <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> and
      its second quarto contains a most ingenious bibliographical solution of another long-vexed
      critical problem.<ref target="f003.03.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref></p>
     <p>There are other problems involving the relations between editions. Greg, I think, has
      remarked that given two editions only, the critical method could never satisfactorily
      establish their relationship or indeed, if they are similarly dated, as with certain of the
      Pavier quartos, their priority. I may be making this more positive or detailed than his
      original statement, but when we realize that Greg is not thinking in terms of inferences
      establishing high probability but instead of absolute proof, then we must admit that true
      demonstration is impossible because of the reversibility of the critical evidence. Is a
      variant a correction or rationalization in one edition, or a corruption in the
      other&mdash;frequently the case may be argued either way.</p>
     <p>An example is Dryden's <hi rend="italic">Wild Gallant</hi>, which has two editions in 1669,
      the year of its first appearance in print. One is clearly a paginal reprint of the other, but
      the question is&mdash;which? On the one side we have Macdonald setting up his number 72a as
      the first edition, whereas Griffith, backed by Osborn, argues for 72b, or Macdonald's second
      edition. As a part of a fresh bibliographical examination of this play I have elsewhere tried
      to show in detail <pb n="003.053"/> too lengthy to be summarized here that while the basic
      fact on which each hinges his argument is bibliographical, the arguments from this fact are
      only inferential and therefore do not conform to the strictest requirements of bibliographical
      reasoning, that is, to a mechanical demonstration for which there is no possible alternative
      save in the realm of purest fantasy.<ref target="f003.03.22" n="22"><hi rend="super"
       >22</hi></ref></p>
     <p>It will be pertinent, however, to consider more fully in this play certain kinds of evidence
      which, for a very good reason, have not been published. The expos&eacute;, I hope, will offer
      an enlightening example, though at my own expense, of what bibliographical evidence is and
      what it is not. I can speak very feelingly on the subject because when I came to the problem
      as an editor I was completely booby-trapped, and at first I arrived at certain conclusions on
      grounds which I gullibly persuaded myself were bibliographical only to have the whole argument
      blow up in my face when at length the true evidence became apparent.</p>
     <p>A textual collation of the two editions quickly established that there had been no real
      rewriting between them, but that in a score of places&mdash;if 72a were
      first&mdash;corrections, possibly even revisions, had certainly been made in 72b, a few of
      which could have come only from the author himself. On the other hand, if 72b were first, in
      various readings the text had undergone a corruption rather more serious than one might expect
      in a first reprint. Mr. Osborn in his notes to Griffith's argument had confidently pronounced
       <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> the first on the evidence of this textual degeneration in <hi
       rend="italic">A</hi>.<ref target="f003.03.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref> This is a
      critical touchstone which experience has shown to be sound, provided the further inference is
      made that the author had no part in producing the reprint. However, I approached the <hi
       rend="italic">Gallant</hi> fresh from a study of <hi rend="italic">The Indian Emperour</hi>,
      in which without question Dryden had directly concerned himself with revising not only the
      second but also the third edition, the year before and after <hi rend="italic">The Wild
       Gallant</hi> respectively. With this example before me, I felt hesitant to accept Osborn's
      conclusions without further inquiry, for the second inference could not be automatically
      applied. Indeed, I came to feel that there was just about as much chance that the careless
      errors of <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> had been rectified <pb n="003.054"/> in <hi rend="italic"
       >B.</hi> by an errata list sent to the printer as that <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> represented
      a careless and unauthoritative reprint of <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> And I still do not think
      that the priority of one or other edition can be positively demonstrated on the readings
      alone. Whether one is corruption or the other correction is not demonstrable in the very
      strictest sense once we know that Dryden had concerned himself at this date with correcting
      reprints of at least one other play.</p>
     <p>I approached the two editions, therefore, not on the basis of the respective 'goodness' of
      their readings, but in search of some material evidence that one had been printed from the
      other. Here are some of the highlights of the preliminary case I evolved for the priority of
       <hi rend="italic">A.</hi></p>
     <p>In the <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> edition, the shortened name <hi rend="italic">Will</hi> is
      almost invariably followed by a period to indicate that it is an abbreviation for <hi
       rend="italic">William</hi>, and this period substitutes for other necessary punctuation such
      as commas, semi-colons, or even question marks. In <hi rend="italic">B., Will</hi> is treated
      as a simple familiar name and no period is ever found except once&mdash;and significantly this
      once is the first time the name appears. Inadvertent following of copy by <hi rend="italic"
       >B.</hi> in this single initial instance seemed the best answer.<ref target="f003.03.24"
       n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref> Given this hint, I continued looking for what one might
      describe as fossils in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> of strong characteristics present in <hi
       rend="italic">A.</hi> but not in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> Twice in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>
      one compositor set the extreme contraction <hi rend="italic">b's</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
       >be's</hi>, and, once later, <hi rend="italic">h'll</hi> for <hi rend="italic">he'll</hi>. In
       <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> the two <hi rend="italic">h's</hi> are normalized to the
      conventional <hi rend="italic">he's</hi>, but the fossil <hi rend="italic">h'll</hi> retained.
      More evidence appeared of what was apparently inadvertent following of copy. For example, the
      two compositors of <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> spelled the conjunctive adverb <hi rend="italic"
       >than</hi> indifferently as <hi rend="italic">then</hi> or as <hi rend="italic">than</hi>. In
       <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> the invariable spelling is <hi rend="italic">than</hi>, even when
       <hi rend="italic">then</hi> appears in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>, except for two cases, and
      one of these turned out to be in the uncorrected state of a press-variant forme in <hi
       rend="italic">B.</hi> where the <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> spelling <hi rend="italic"
       >then</hi> originally appeared in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> but was changed by the
      proof-reader to <hi rend="italic">than</hi>. There were various other instances in which the
      isolated appearance in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> of marked characteristics in <hi
       rend="italic">A.</hi> seemed significant, especially since the two pairs of compositors were
      different in each edition. <pb n="003.055"/> Moreover, on the textual principle that the
      'harder' reading is the original, there were at least two cases which seemed to point to the
      priority of <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the first, the form <hi rend="italic">wall</hi> in
      the phrase in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "she wall write" seemed to derive more plausibly from
      a manuscript colloquialism <hi rend="italic">wall</hi> or <hi rend="italic">wull</hi> than
      from a misprint of the <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> "she shall write." In the second, Constance
      is deceiving Lord Nonsuch that she is with child, and when he demands the name of the father
      she responds that she does not know. He exclaims, "Not know! went there so many to't?" and in
       <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> she answers, "So far from that, that there were none at all, to my
      best knowledge, Sir." In <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> the repetition <hi rend="italic">went</hi>
      substitutes for <hi rend="italic">were</hi>, and it seemed a plausible hypothesis that the
      'harder' reading was <hi rend="italic">were</hi>, and that memorial failure in the <hi
       rend="italic">B.</hi> compositor carried over the repetition of <hi rend="italic">went</hi>
      from Nonsuch's line. That the <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> compositor in such a circumstance,
      where the repetition seems most natural, saw <hi rend="italic">went</hi> in his <hi
       rend="italic">B.</hi> copy and set <hi rend="italic">were</hi> seemed more difficult to
      believe.</p>
     <p>There is not time to go into this next evidence, but in the light of general experience that
      irregularities between catchword and following word in an original edition usually tend to be
      normalized in reprints, it seemed to me at first highly probable that certain irregularities
      in the <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> catchwords were much better explained on the belief that it
      was the first edition rather than the second.</p>
     <p>Finally, I attacked the gap of eight pages in the pagination which appears between sheets G
      and H in both editions. In one edition this identical error could have resulted only from
      slavish following of copy. Hence if I could establish a reason for the gap in one edition, but
      no reason in the other, I felt I should have my original. Analysis disclosed that edition <hi
       rend="italic">A.</hi> was set by two compositors in sections of one or more full sheets and
      that their respective sections can be identified not only by the different lengths of their
      sticks but also by the difference in the use of skeleton-formes which is associated with each.<ref target="f003.03.25" n="25"><hi rend="super">25</hi></ref> 
      In <hi rend="italic">B.</hi>
      there is no evidence for any interruption in the presswork between sheets G and H, and indeed
      it seems likely that one compositor set the last pages of G and continued over into the first
      pages of H as <pb n="003.056"/> part of his stint. On the contrary, in <hi rend="italic"
       >A.</hi> the gap in pagination occurs between one of the clearly marked sections where the
      compositors shifted, and it seemed a reasonable inference that when the compositor of sheet H
      returned to duty and came to make his first impositions, he forgot the system under which he
      was working and miscalculated the pagination.</p>
     <p>I had, then, among various other pieces of evidence, the apparent survival in unique forms
      in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> of strongly marked compositorial habits manifested in <hi
       rend="italic">A.</hi>, among such fossils being the abbreviation of <hi rend="italic"
       >Will</hi>, the survival of the form <hi rend="italic">h'll</hi> and of a random <hi
       rend="italic">then</hi> spelling. I may also mention a few cases in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi>
      of the very common practice in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> of using a semi-colon for a question
      mark, the setting in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> of a period in over a dozen cases where a
      necessary question mark was used in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi>, and a very odd but marked use
      of the full -<hi rend="italic">ed</hi> ending in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> for the elided form
       <hi rend="italic">apostrophe d</hi> in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi>, an expansion difficult to
      account for with such frequency in a reprint. Then there were such cases as this. The
      colloquial form <hi rend="italic">u'm</hi> for <hi rend="italic">them</hi> is absolutely
      consistent throughout both editions except for one single late use of <hi rend="italic"
       >them</hi> in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> where <hi rend="italic">u'm</hi> appears in <hi
       rend="italic">B.</hi> The probability seemed much higher that <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> had
      normalized <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> than that <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> had wilfully departed
      from its copy <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> There were also two cases where proper names were
      found in italic in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi>, as customary, but in roman in <hi rend="italic"
       >A.</hi>, a reversal hard to account for. Finally, the evidence of the catchwords possibly,
      but almost certainly that of the mispagination, seemed to point to <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>
      as the original.</p>
     <p>I hope I have made this case reasonably convincing, even in an incomplete and digested form,
      because I am ashamed to confess that initially&mdash;before I began to prepare the text for an
      edition&mdash; it had me thoroughly convinced. Yet I hasten to point out that all these
      conclusions are quite wrong, that Griffith and Osborn are right. Edition <hi rend="italic"
       >B.</hi> indeed precedes <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>; and this case I have presented for
      Macdonald's order, though based mostly on 'bibliographical' facts, has been one only of
      inference and probability but never of true bibliographical demonstration.</p>
     <p>This, briefly, is the real evidence for <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> as the first edition which
      my subsequent investigation revealed. Only one press-variant forme emerged from collation of
      eleven copies of <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>, but from ten copies of <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> I
      finally turned up seven formes which had <pb n="003.057"/> undergone stop-press correction. Of
      these, two are indifferent since the uncorrected state agrees with <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>
      for one, and the other is the variant act-heading noticed by Professor Griffith in the
      apparently unique Texas copy. Of the remaining five, all&mdash;in their significant <hi
       rend="italic">B.</hi> readings&mdash;have an agreement between the <hi rend="italic"
       >corrected</hi> state of the formes and <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is no need to
      elaborate the bibliographical argument here.<ref target="f003.03.26" n="26"><hi rend="super"
        >26</hi></ref> Almost inevitably, <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> must have been set from <hi
       rend="italic">B.</hi></p>
     <p>Finally, to clinch the case, this evidence developed. On one occasion in <hi rend="italic"
       >A.</hi> the verb <hi rend="italic">tells</hi> in the phrase <hi rend="italic">she tells
       me</hi> is misprinted as <hi rend="italic">tel's</hi>. We can demonstrate the source of this
      misprint in <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> when we find that in the corresponding place in <hi
       rend="italic">B.</hi> the second letter <hi rend="italic">l</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
       >tells</hi> inks so very slightly in all observed copies that only its tip is visible without
      a magnifying glass; and since this inked tip would almost inevitably be taken as an
      apostrophe, the compositor of <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> read it as one and faithfully followed
      what he thought was the spelling of his copy. Correspondingly, in three places in <hi
       rend="italic">A.</hi> where rather essential punctuation is missing, we find that the actual
      commas are so lightly inked in some copies of <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> as scarcely to be
      seen. The evidence of the <hi rend="italic">tel's</hi> alone is sufficient on which to rest
      one's whole case for the order of the editions; but especially when so powerfully confirmed by
      the evidence of the press-variant formes in <hi rend="italic">B.</hi> followed by <hi
       rend="italic">A.</hi>, one could take the dispute to a court of law and secure a judgment for
      the priority of <hi rend="italic">B.</hi></p>
     <p>From this detailed example I draw a moral which applies to much of what I have been trying
      to say in this paper. Textual and pseudo-bibliographical evidence can seldom if ever afford
      more than a high degree of probability, and this is essentially different from positive
      demonstration. A very plausible chain of inferences can be built up, if the person is as
      stupid as I seem to have been; and if only the same line of evidence is employed to attack
      such a case, nothing but an indecisive stalemate can result. On the contrary, strictly
      bibliographical evidence such as that about the <hi rend="italic">tel's</hi> and the press
      variants&mdash;evidence which usually appears in <pb n="003.058"/> texts if one digs deep
      enough&mdash;crosses the line of probability into something close to the field which in
      science would be regarded as controlled experiment capable of being reproduced. Instead of
      high probability we have, in fact, practical demonstration on physical evidence of a
      mechanical nature, demonstrable by a mechanical process, evidence like the prose and verse
      measures of <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>, and this is what Greg means by bibliography's
      treatment of a book as a material object. To every point in my construction of the case for
      72a as the first edition, alternatives could have been suggested, and therefore any
      credibility it possessed depended on the cumulative bulk of the inferences. Yet when actual
      bibliographical evidence enters the scene, one little <hi rend="italic">tel's</hi> sweeps all
      before it.</p>
     <p>I draw the further moral as this applies to editing. Such minute yet crucial evidence on
      which the case hinges would normally be discoverable only by an editor. For example, the
      ordinary tests which a descriptive bibliographer would apply could not determine the truth;
      hence, if a textual critic, faced with the problem of corruption versus correction, felt that
      the standard bibliography of Dryden had sufficiently set up the material for him to proceed
      with 72a as his copy-text (and he could very well do so), he would be most seriously misled if
      he failed to come upon the bibliographical points which destroy Macdonald's case.</p>
     <p>In this paper I seem to have given a considerable number of examples where bibliographers
      were wrong. I have not intended to cast doubts on the validity of bibliographical findings, or
      to speak in a way to discourage the faint-hearted from depending upon bibliographical
      evidence. Quite the reverse. What has been paramount in my mind is, first, that bibliography
      may sometimes be imperfectly practised; and unless a textual critic is himself enough of a
      bibliographer to make his own discoveries independently, or else to submit existing
      bibliographical conclusions about his material to the acid test of his own bibliographical
      re-evaluation&mdash;unless he can do this, in many cases he will be living in a fool's
      paradise, either believing that there are no bibliographical problems, or else that the
      bibliographers have authoritatively worked over the material for him and he can go ahead on
      his own line without further consideration.</p>
     <p>Secondly, this principle seeps down from the very top, or the <pb n="003.059"/> choice and
      treatment of the copy-text, to the very bottom of the last, minute detail of an old-spelling
      critical edition which must be exhausted bibliographically before pure criticism can properly
      operate.</p>
     <p>Thus I think we may freely say that the bibliographer's text is by no means always the best
      that can be contrived if the editor has not got the mind of a true textual critic&mdash;only
      perhaps that such a text does the minimum of harm. On the other hand, as a practising
      bibliographer I do object mightily to critics who often nullify the brilliance of their
      substantive text by failing to observe bibliographical principles when they engage themselves
      to an old-spelling edition. I should be inclined to set up four operations which an
      old-spelling editor should perform, for the interpretation and application of the evidence
      discovered by these investigations lie at the heart of a sound edition. It is astonishing to a
      bibliographer to find how often various of these have been omitted by an editor who otherwise
      has exhibited every desire to be scrupulous in the details of his work. First, the
      determination of authority in all early editions and, on this evidence, the proper choice and
      treatment of the copy-text as we have heard it described by Greg. Second, the collation of
      multiple copies of each authoritative edition to disclose proof-corrections for analysis.
      Third, the analysis of running-titles for the interpretation of the presswork, a matter which
      is closely linked with the fourth, or compositor analysis, this last being positively
      essential, at least in Elizabethan texts, for any consideration of the variants between two or
      more authoritative editions in a direct line of derivation.</p>
     <p>These few demands are not especially severe and need not require any extraordinary technical
      training. But I place them as the basis for any bibliographical preparation of an individual
      text by an editor once the larger questions have been settled. And until they become standard
      procedure, at least in cases of any complexity where their chief value is found, our
      old-spelling texts are not going to be definitive in any real sense. Critical brilliance can
      settle many a substantive crux, although by no means all of them; but if these excellent major
      substantives are placed in a semi-substantive old-spelling background which is not itself
      accurate, then the reason for old-spelling texts degenerates into sentimentality or
      ostentation. Moreover, by an accurate background <pb n="003.060"/> of accidentals and minor
      substantives, much more should be implied in many cases than the mechanical ability to copy
      and then proofread accurately from an old edition. If we are to learn to reconstruct the
      accidentals and minor substantives of an author's manuscript with as much care as we labor
      over reconstructing his correct major substantives, a whole new and delicate biblio-critical
      art is involved in which criticism by itself can never be a sufficiently scientific
      instrument.</p>
     <p>I shall try to summarize the main points at which I have glanced. First, both textual
      criticism and analytical bibliography in their purest states are, in my opinion, independent
      arts which have no necessary relation in their disciplines, or frequently in the subjects with
      which they concern themselves. Textual criticism must deal with words and their meanings, with
      stylistic and linguistic considerations, and with the basic questions of authority in texts,
      both in whole and in part. Pure analytical bibliography, on the other hand, deals with books
      as material objects formed by the mechanical process of printing. In many investigations it is
      not concerned with texts as such; but when it does approach texts it endeavors to treat them
      not from the literary or critical point of view, which is that of the 'goodness' of readings,
      but instead as pieces of paper mechanically impressed with certain symbols. The mechanical
      relation between these sets of symbols is thereupon its chief concern.</p>
     <p>Second, although the two methods are essentially independent, textual criticism cannot
      controvert accurate bibliography in its findings when the subject is one on which bibliography
      can properly operate. However, the two often join in attacking certain problems of texts.
      These problems are by no means limited to editing, but nevertheless the construction of a
      critical text is most commonly the point at which the two methods cross.</p>
     <p>Third, even though the first and the last approach to a text must be the bibliographical
      one, neither method can achieve definitive textual results in any detailed manner if utilized
      without reference to the other. On a broad scale it is bibliography which establishes the
      physical facts of the derivation of texts from one another and which wrings from a given book
      every last drop of information about the mechanical process of its printing that may be of
      service in determining the relation of the printed result to <pb n="003.061"/> the manuscript
      or printed copy used by the printer. Still on a broad scale, it is the function of textual
      criticism to evaluate the authority of this manuscript and then to proceed to the correctness
      and the authority of the words in the text in the light of the ascertained physical facts
      which bibliography has furnished. Thereupon, in the process of fixing the text of a modern
      critical edition in every possible detail, the two methods are often so closely conjoined that
      an attempt to separate their respective functions would be futile.</p>
     <p>When we come to criticize the average edited text produced today, we find that the usual
      source of error lies in the insufficient bibliographical training of the editor. Either he has
      little concept of textual problems, and&mdash;scornful of the minutiae which sometimes concern
      the bibliographer&mdash;is content to have any kind of a text, because what he really wants is
      only a peg on which to hang his annotations; or else he is overconfident in his purely
      critical abilities to solve any problems which may arise. In either case he has ventured on a
      delicate literary task without knowing his grammar, and hence his results can seldom be
      definitive. Sometimes even greater harm is caused by a little knowledge than by none. It is
      enough to make the angels weep to find Saintsbury, for example, throwing out various correct
      readings in Scott's text of <hi rend="italic">The Wild Gallant</hi>, derived from edition 72b
      through the Folio and a later edition, to substitute absolute corruptions from 72a under the
      illusion he was restoring the purity of the text from the first edition. Or to find Davenport
      in the new edition of Joseph Hall's <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> declining the editorial
      responsibility to make a choice of readings, and basing his text on the derived reprint of
      1598 for the first six books of <hi rend="italic">Virgidemiarum</hi>, even though it was
      slightly revised, rather than the purer 1597 first edition.<ref target="f003.03.27" n="27"><hi
        rend="super">27</hi></ref> It is really the hardest job in the world for a bibliographer to
      convince a critic who is beginning to be conscious of old-spelling problems that an author did
      not set his own type, seldom proof-read his book and if he did cannot be taken as approving
      every minute detail of its accidentals, and that a printed book is a fallible second-hand
      report of the author's manuscript, not a facsimile of it set in type.<ref target="f003.03.28"
       n="28"><hi rend="super">28</hi></ref> One of the chief functions of textual bibliography <pb
       n="003.062"/> is to try to pierce this veil of the printing process and to restore, however
      imperfectly, the authority of the manuscript, which we know only through its printed and thus
      secondary form.</p>
     <p>On the other hand, a bibliographer who tackles the problems of text with insufficient
      critical and philological training is also in danger of false judgments in decisions which are
      not material and are therefore not strictly the business of bibliography. The usual result is
      that he may retreat to the narrowest conservatism to avoid having to face up to problems which
      are not wholly factual. And this timidity is as unbalanced as a critic's rashness in
      proceeding without the counterweight of bibliography. Such critical uncertainty may lead to
      good reprints of a single authority for a text but by no means to a true edition of the best
      text of an author.</p>
     <p>It seems to me that for an ideally definitive work an editor must combine in himself the
      knowledge of both methods, and the training to put both into practice, or else he must resort
      to an almost impossible attempt at collaboration. Collaboration can be effective between a
      bibliographer and a literary critic who will handle all problems of biography, attribution of
      authorship, literary estimates, and who will write the critical introductions and illustrative
      notes. In such a case each has his relatively independent responsibilities; and indeed Greg is
      inclined to recommend this procedure for many editions. But I find it harder to imagine save
      in the most exceptional circumstances an effective collaboration of bibliographer and critic
      on the minutiae of the text.</p>
     <p>I disclaim bibliography as the usurper of editorial privilege, and indeed I am concerned to
      aid the textual critic against the increasing pressure which editor-bibliographers are
      exerting on him. But if this potentially most valuable kind of an editor is to produce texts
      which in every detail will stand up under the increasingly exact and rigorous standards which
      are now being applied to this form of scholarship, he must learn his bibliography with a
      thoroughness not previously thought necessary. Only by this wider extension of scholarship can
      texts be achieved which will not need to be done all over again by the next generation.</p>

     <p>TEXTS WHICH ARE PRESERVED IN MORE THAN one form are objects of study.</p>
     <p>I. One legitimate aim of such study is the formulation of a consistent way of dealing with
      variants, and so to make an orderly selection among them, in such a fashion that another
      student to whom the method has been explained, would be able to make reasonable predictions
      about which alternatives would be selected by the editor in given situations. This type of
      study can be called scientific textual study, and is separate from such types of textual study
      as have for their purpose the improvement or modernization of texts.</p>
     <p>II. The study of texts can be pursued along more than one line, or by various combinations
      of lines. There are four principal approaches.</p>
     <p>1. The arrangement of differences in the surviving texts can be studied, without attention
      to the nature of the differences. This constitutes distributional study.</p>
     <p>2. Individual differences can be compared with each other in the hope of discovering the
      direction of change. This constitutes genealogical study.</p>
     <p>3. The physical characteristics of the various versions can be studied in the hope of
      throwing light on the process of copying. This constitutes external study.</p>
     <pb n="003.064"/>
     <p>4. Differences can be compared for the purpose of selecting those which are stylistically
      preferable, offer the best sense, are free of mistakes of grammar or fact. This constitutes
      literary study.</p>
     <p>III. Each of the above methods of study rests on certain basic assumptions.</p>
     <p>1. Distributional study rests on the assumption that it is more likely that unity of
      manuscripts represents unity in their source than that it represents coincidence. For
      convenience this assumption will hereafter be called the postulate of unity.</p>
     <p>2. Genealogical study rests on the assumption that certain differences are more likely to
      have been produced by a given direction of change than by another, and the second assumption
      that differences of this type can be identified by examination.</p>
     <p>3. External study rests on the assumption that human or other activity involving physical
      objects leaves physical effects by which the activity can be traced.</p>
     <p>4. Literary study rests on the assumption that an author is less likely to make mistakes
      than is a copyist, and conversely that an author is more likely to produce a positive
      excellence than is a copyist.</p>
     <p>IV. These assumptions are not all equally probable, or equally necessary.</p>
     <p>1. The postulate of unity can not be evaluated in terms of controlled probabilities.
      Further, coincidence does indeed occur, both in manuscript transmission and daily life. The
      postulate is therefore an axiom, which like other axioms can be tested only by the partially
      effective device of reversal. That is, we can make the reverse assumption that unity is more
      likely to reflect coincidence than unity of source. It is immediately evident that the result
      of such a reverse assumption would be to group together the most dissimilar manuscripts,
      rather than the most similar. In actual fact, moreover, we act on the postulate of unity in
      our daily lives. When two students turn in identical examinations, we do not assume that
      likeness is the result of coincidence.</p>
     <p>2. The genealogical assumptions given above would be reasonably easy to establish
      empirically if no scribe ever deliberately <pb n="003.065"/> improved his text, but
      unfortunately the order of correction can reverse that of mechanical change. The assumptions,
      more generally stated, are contained in those underlying external study, and differ from those
      of external study only in that they are applied to language material, where those of external
      study are applied to physical (non-language) characteristics.</p>
     <p>3. The assumption underlying external study is the most far reaching of those here given,
      and is actually the assumption underlying the investigation of all past activity. We act on it
      so constantly that we scarcely realize it is an assumption, capable of being tested only by
      reversal&mdash;namely by assuming that activity never leaves observable traces.</p>
     <p>4. The assumption on which literary study rests is the least likely and the least necessary
      of the group. It is, however, often the basic assumption of an editor, either explicitly or
      implicitly held. It has been used as a reason for rejecting the results of bibliographical
      study by no less a scholar than the late Professor Kittredge.<ref target="f003.04.01" n="1"
        ><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> The assumption would be reasonable were authors different
      from other men (more particularly scribes) in being free from mistakes and stupidities.
      Unfortunately they are not, as we know if we remember Keats' "stout Cortez."<ref
       target="f003.04.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> The assumption is not even acceptable
      if, as with such recent manuscript studies as those of Hitchcock and Wolf, it is made in the
      more limited form of a means of separating significant variants (mistakes) from nonsignificant
       variants.<ref target="f003.04.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> Essentially, such an
      assumption leads to <pb n="003.066"/> circularity. Variants are first judged as right or
      wrong. Rightness and wrongness is then used as a means of establishing authority, which in
      turn is used to establish rightness or wrongness. In other words, if it is possible to judge
      readings as right or wrong independent of authority, then no attention need be paid to
       authority.<ref target="f003.04.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref></p>
     <p>An even more important objection to the literary method is that as yet there is no
      convergence among critics as to what constitutes literary excellence. It is perhaps to be
      hoped that such convergence may emerge, but until it does, literary excellence can hardly be a
      tool in scientific investigation.</p>
     <p>I wish to be understood&mdash;I am not depreciating literary study, or literary criticism.
      Both have their own proper sphere, and both are legitimate forms of endeavour. I am merely
      saying that if the student of texts takes as his aim the orderly and methodical presentation
      of variants, he does well to ignore literary considerations. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>.
       In ignoring literary considerations I am following the practice of the most important of all
       general considerations of manuscript study, a work to which I owe a heavy debt throughout,
        <hi rend="italic">The Calculus of Variants</hi>, W. W. Greg, Oxford: Clarendon Press,
       1927.</q></p>
     <p>V. After the elimination of literary study, the remaining methods of study can be combined
      in various ways.</p>
     <p>1. Study of texts surviving in manuscript usually makes use of distributional and
      genealogical evidence. This method can be called, for lack of a better name, comparative
      study. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. I am here departing from traditional terminology as
       used by Greg and other students. The traditional term "genealogical" corresponds to my term
       "comparative," while "distributional" is not used.</q></p>
     <p>2. Study of printed texts often makes no use of distributional <pb n="003.067"/> evidence,
      since for reasons which will be supplied, such evidence is inapplicable. On the other hand,
      modern bibliography makes great and brilliant use of external evidence. Any method which makes
      use of external evidence, whether or not genealogical evidence is added to it, can be called
      bibliographical.</p>
     <p>3. Some term which would include all three methods, or any combination of them, is obviously
      needed. This is particularly so, since bibliographers are apt to think of their discipline as
      different from the study of books in manuscript, and are also apt to complain of the term
      bibliography because it is likely to be mistaken for the preparation of hand-lists. The matter
      is perhaps unimportant, but I should suggest <hi rend="italic">biblistics</hi>, or if this has
      too religious a sound, <hi rend="italic">libristics</hi>. Both terms are on the analogy of
      such others as <hi rend="italic">ballistics, linguistics</hi>.</p>
     <p>VI. It has been stated that the various methods of study can be combined to give complex
      methods. The various methods can not be combined in a random and inconsistent order, jumping
      from one to the other at will, unless the results are also to be random and inconsistent. It
      is then obvious that the student must know the advantages and limitations of each method, and
      be able to recognize which one he is using. Otherwise he will fail to exhaust a given method
      systematically before he passes on to another.</p>
     <p>VII. In all cases where all three types of evidence apply, the normally best order of
      application is distributional evidence first, then genealogical evidence, and external
      evidence last of all.</p>
     <p>1. Distribution of variants is an objective and readily verifiable set of facts. Further, if
      the student is lucky, it can lead to a complete and satisfactory conclusion, needing only
      checking from other types of evidence.</p>
     <p>2. Geneological evidence is less trustworthy than distributional evidence, since as has been
      said, the direction of change is different in processes of correction from what it is in
      mechanical copying. Geneological evidence needs, therefore, to be used in accord with
      conclusions drawn from previously studied distributional evidence. An example of a reading
      from <hi rend="italic">Philaster</hi> may make this statement clear. In Act III scene 1, line
      201, appears a set of <pb n="003.068"/> variants, <hi rend="italic">parallesse</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">parallelless</hi> (there is a third variant which need not concern us). Arguing
      genealogically, one would suppose that the form which drops out one of the two identical
      series of letters is the younger variant. Yet if we check this genealogical conclusion by the
      distributional evidence it becomes untenable. The fuller form occurs only in a late and
      unauthoritative edition, and is therefore a correction which reverses the order of mechanical
      change. The mechanical change, in other words, occurred somewhere in the limbo of versions of
      the text which are beyond our reach.<ref target="f003.04.05" n="5"><hi rend="super"
       >5</hi></ref></p>
     <p>3. External evidence might be presumed to be better studied first, and indeed, for reasons
      of convenience, it is often at least presented in that position. However there are reasons why
      at least some of the results of external evidence can be disregarded in manuscript work, if
      comparative evidence applies.<ref target="f003.04.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> It
      should not be thought that the results of external evidence can be safely disregarded in their
      entirety, but since some of them can be thus disregarded, there is a danger of confusing the
      comparative study unless it is exhausted before an external approach is used.</p>
     <p>VIII. The types of evidence are not equally applicable to every situation. The frequency of
      applicability is the reverse of the proposed order of study.</p>
     <p>1. Since all texts must be preserved in some form, external evidence always applies. It is
      worth noting that the mere statement that a text is preserved only in memory is a piece of
      external evidence quite worth having, since it leads to a conclusion about the reliability of
      the text.</p>
     <p>2. Geneological evidence can be applied at any point where a text survives in differing
      form, but not at any point where a text survives in unity, no matter whether this unity is
      produced by the fact that there is only one manuscript, or because there is unity among
      multiple manuscripts. To apply genealogical methods at a point of unity becomes the same thing
      as the improvement of texts. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. The application of genealogical
       methods in the face of unity of the <pb n="003.069"/> manuscripts is inherent in the "common
       mistake" method which is the classical Lachmannian technique. Thus E. K. Rand, "Dom Quentin's
       Memoir on the Text of the Vulgate," <hi rend="italic">Harvard Theological Review</hi>, XVII
       (1924), 209, "The first thing for which I look in the apparatus is the presence of errors
       common to all the manuscripts, and I find . . . that there are no common errors. Our 21
       manuscripts, then, do not descend from one faulty archetype." In other words, an editor in
       Rand's view, is perfectly justified in disregarding all manuscript evidence if he can find
       fault with it. Rand would almost have been forced to emend "stout Cortez" in Keats'
       sonnet.</q></p>
     <p>3. Distributional study can be used only in texts which survive in more than one form. It is
      often assumed that distributional evidence is valuable only if there are more than two
      manuscripts, but this assumption is not strictly true since when there are only two
      manuscripts, the editor must at least record the occurrence of unity and difference, and
      accept the unities.<ref target="f003.04.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref></p>
     <p>Distributional studies are powerless to deal with differences unless there are at least
      three surviving manuscripts, since in the two-text situation no variant has a better chance of
      having been in the original than another.</p>
     <p>Distributional studies, further, are not applicable to all texts which survive in multiple
      form. Before distributional study can be applied, the student must make the assumption that
      his text goes back to a single original, and that each version of it has been produced by a
      unified process of copying. If these are not reasonable assumptions, the method can not be
      applied. For instance we now know that the variant forms of differing exemplars of the same
      edition of an Elizabethan book are not the product of unified acts of copying, but are a
      nearly random arrangement of corrected and uncorrected press-variants. A student who attempted
      to draw a tree for such exemplars would be in a hopeless situation.</p>
     <p>Distributional studies become valueless when any type of evidence shows that the variant
      forms are the result of material revisions by the author or another. They remain, however,
      valuable up to the point at which such a conclusion is proved, and often distributional
      evidence at least contributes to such a conclusion. Thus the <hi rend="italic">Piers
       Plowman</hi> controversy arose because the distributional evidence had not been exhausted, so
      that it became possible to use genealogical evidence both to affirm and deny <pb n="003.070"/>
      multiple revision. An example of the effect of persistence in a distributional approach can be
      constructed with the aid of Meredith's <hi rend="italic">Evan Harrington</hi>, known to have
      been revised by the author. A passage in chapter eleven of that novel appears thus in the
      early form: <q>Eyes were on him, he could feel. It appeared that the company awaited his
       proceedings; . . .</q> And thus in the revised form: <q>Eyes were on him. This had ever the
       effect of causing him to swell to monstrous proportions in the histrionic line.</q> Were the
      fact of revision unknown, and were an editor sufficiently unwary, he might produce the
      following version, on the assumption that anything absent from either version was an omission
      from the original of both. <q>Eyes were on him, he could feel. This had ever the effect of
       causing him to swell to monstrous proportions in the histrionic line. It appeared that the
       company awaited his proceedings; . . .</q> In such a conflated passage, every word is genuine
      in the sense that it was written by Meredith, yet the totality of the passage is false.<ref
       target="f003.04.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref>
      <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. J. Burke Severs presents in chapter three of <hi rend="italic"
        >The Literary Relationships of Chaucer's</hi> Clerkes Tale (<hi rend="italic">Yale Studies
        in English</hi>, no. 96, 1942) a clear example of this principle. His study is of the
       manuscripts of Petrarch's Latin version of the story of Griselda. He begins by grouping
       certain manuscripts which lack material found in all the others. This group he sets up as
       family <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> He then goes on to set up a complete, but tentative tree not
       only for <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, but for all other families. All this he does on
       distributional evidence. He then turns to a genealogical study of the material lacking in <hi
        rend="italic">d</hi>. It is first of all striking that the text reads equally well with or
       without the additional material. He next turns to a further distributional fact, and its
       genealogical interpretation. The fact is that all the manuscripts which belong to <hi
        rend="italic">d</hi> lack an accompanying letter of introduction which tells how the first
       version of the letter had gone astray, and that Petrarch had therefore found it necessary to
       rewrite it. From all this evidence he then rightly concludes that the longer manuscripts
       represent an author's revision, and that it is therefore necessary to draw two trees, one for
        <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, and one for all other manuscripts. Such orderly procedure seems a
       model of clarity.</q></p>
     <pb n="003.071"/>
     <p>IX. If it can be assumed that the distributional approach is valid, the student makes the
      following operational assumptions in applying it.</p>
     <p>1. Each manuscript before him is the result of copying from one exemplar, though this
      exemplar is not assumed to be the same for all manuscripts. Mixing of exemplars is assumed not
      to have taken place unless the variants can be explained in no other way.</p>
     <p>2. All manuscripts before him spring from some one ultimate exemplar, present or
      hypothetical, by one or more steps of derivation. This also will be assumed to be true unless
      proved otherwise.</p>
     <p>X. In collecting distributional evidence the student handles the following types of
      phenomena:</p>
     <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Unity</hi>. Whenever the same language symbol occurs at the same place
      in two or more manuscripts, this occurrence can be called a unity. The term "at the same
      place" is taken to mean "at the same position in a series of surrounding language symbols,
      whether or not the surrounding symbols constitute a unity."</p>
     <p>Unfortunately "language symbol" is not a transparently clear term, since such symbols are
      arranged in a hierarchical series of entities, which for our purposes can be defined as
      letters, words, sentences, and still larger units such as verses or paragraphs. Thus the
      occurrence of <hi rend="italic">honor</hi> in two manuscripts, once with a <hi rend="italic"
       >u</hi>, and once without, is a word unity, though not a letter unity. Usually editors find
      themselves working on the word level, since most of the time the evidence from letters can not
      outweigh the evidence from words, and since the evidence from words will fully describe the
      evidence from larger units. It should be understood that I am using a definition of word which
      would be unsatisfactory in other contexts: namely that a word is any group of letters with a
      space before and after them, or habitually so written in forms later than the manuscript under
      discussion if the manuscript does not divide words.</p>
     <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Variation</hi>. The occurrence at the same place in two or more
      manuscripts, of differing language symbols, of zero and a language symbol, or of something not
      a language symbol and a language symbol, can be defined as variation or difference. The sum
      total of things occurring is a set of variants, and each thing which occurs is a variant.</p>
     <pb n="003.072"/>
     <p>XI. Both variation and unity, for purposes of comparative study, must be supposed to contain
      occurrences of language symbols. Examples of either unity or variation which do not contain
      language symbols belong rather to external than to comparative study. Things which are not
      considered to be language symbols can be exemplified by blots, tears, ornaments, <hi
       rend="italic">etc.</hi></p>
     <p>XII. Sets of variants are of differing sorts.</p>
     <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Positive sets</hi>. These are sets of variants consisting of different
      language symbols.</p>
     <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Variants consisting of a language symbol opposed to its absence</hi>.
      These are variants which include material which may be later defined as being either
      omissions, or additions. It is, however, important to avoid using the terms addition and
      omission until a conclusion has been reached. If the student is not using literary criteria,
      whether given variants are additions, omissions, or must remain undefined, can only be settled
      by all the distributional and other evidence. To use such a term as addition before that
      point, is to prejudge the evidence. A handy term which avoids the difficulty is
      "add-omission." <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. The general clarity of Severs' exposition of
       the manuscripts of Petrarch (<hi rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi>) is perhaps slightly marred by
       the fact that he sets up his family <hi rend="italic">d</hi> on the basis of "omissions." At
       worst the difficulty is only one of presentation, since at the end of his chapter he clears
       up the nature of this omitted material fully. But in reading the chapter for the first time,
       one is left in doubt as to the validity of his procedure, since if the missing material were
       genuine, omission would prove that <hi rend="italic">d</hi> was a late sub-family with an
       exclusive common ancestor, whereas if the material had been added later, the exclusive common
       ancestor would belong to the other manuscripts, not to <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, and the
       common ancestor of <hi rend="italic">d</hi> would be the original of all manuscripts. Such a
       term as that I have proposed would avoid this difficulty.</q></p>
     <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Sets which contain one member which is not a language symbol</hi>.
      These sets can be of significance only if the variants resemble each other physically or
      otherwise. Thus if one manuscript shows a small stain, and the other a comma, or if one shows
      an illustration, and the other substitutes a description of the illustration's contents, the
      conditions are fulfilled.</p>
     <p>XIII. The following phenomena do not constitute either <pb n="003.073"/> unities or sets of
      variants for comparative study, though some may be significant for external study.</p>
     <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The occurrence of zero in two or more manuscripts</hi>. Obvious as the
      statement may be, it is impossible to argue that two manuscripts are different because one
      leaves out <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, and the other leaves out <hi rend="italic">which</hi>.
      It is likewise impossible to argue, as emenders do, that all manuscripts of a text are
      descended from a single corrupt ancestor, differing from an unrecoverable original, because
      all manuscripts leave out something.</p>
     <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The occurrence of non-language objects in two or more manuscripts</hi>.
      Thus the occurrence of the same ornament does not constitute a unity for comparative purposes
      (however significant externally), nor does the occurrence of two blots.</p>
     <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The occurrence of a non-language object at the same place with a
       language symbol to which it bears no resemblance</hi>. For instance, a scribble may occur in
      one manuscript where the other has a line of verse. Such phenomena become simply
      add-omissions.</p>
     <p>XIV. The first step in actual study is the tabulation of all sets of variants, disregarding
      unities. Unities can merely reflect the single original of all manuscripts, and so are
      worthless for showing differences of derivation, no matter how much the student is forced to
      rely on them in his final critical text. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. Elaborate directions
       for the tabulation of variants are given in the writings of Dom Quentin and the various
       treatises derived from his work. See particularly, Henri Quentin, <hi rend="italic">Memoire
        sur l'Etablissement du Texte de la Vulgate</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Collectanea Biblica
        Latina</hi> VI; Rome and Paris: Descl&eacute;e and Gabalda), 1922, page 227, Quentin, <hi
        rend="italic">Essais de Critique Textuelle</hi> (Paris: Picard, 1926), pp. 63-72. The
       presentation of such statistical tables has been strongly attacked, but seems to me one of
       the great virtues of Quentin's method.</q></p>
     <p>XV. When the tabulation of variants is complete, the next step is an attempt to assemble
      groups of manuscripts. The set of concepts used here are as follows:</p>
     <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Derivation</hi>. I have refrained from using the word copying, since
      the two things are different. The distributional student is forced to assume a working
      hypothesis of copying whenever the arrangement of variants is such as to be compatible with
      it. Actual copying, on the other hand, is a physical fact, provable <pb n="003.074"/> only by
      external evidence. Suppose that our distributional student has this situation: manuscript <hi
       rend="italic">A</hi> shares readings with all individual manuscripts, and has no unique
      readings. Manuscript <hi rend="italic">B</hi> shares readings only with A, and has some unique
      readings. Such a state of affairs is not compatible with supposing that <hi rend="italic"
       >A</hi> is copied from <hi rend="italic">B</hi>, since then the shared readings of <hi
       rend="italic">A</hi> are left unexplained. The supposition that <hi rend="italic">B</hi> is
      copied from <hi rend="italic">A</hi> is not contradicted by this arrangement of variants, and
      the student will therefore adopt it. It is, however, merely a hypothesis adopted for the sake
      of describing the relationship of variants, and is in no case proof that actual copying
      occurred, since a long series of lost manuscripts may intervene. Further, if a new series of
      manuscripts is discovered whose variants change the relationship of the whole group, the
      student will be forced to change his hypothesis. Thus in all such situations it is advisable
      to speak of derivation&mdash;defined as a state of affairs compatible with a hypothesis of
      copying&mdash;rather than to speak of copying. The terminology is more important than it
      seems, since if copying is the term used, there is grave danger of misunderstanding the nature
      of the diagram in which the comparative student states his results.</p>
     <p>Another way of stating the operational hypothesis or procedure here described, is to say
      that the student begins by supposing, in turn, that each manuscript is derivable from each
      other, and rejects that supposition each time that he finds evidence to contradict it.</p>
     <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Absolute unity</hi>. Whenever two manuscripts are absolutely alike in
      the language symbols contained, they can be treated as one, and it makes no difference which
      one is chosen to exemplify the pair. This obvious statement is necessary to justify the
      practise of modern students who often work with photostatic copies rather than originals. The
      practise is interesting, since to say that an original mediaeval manuscript is copied from a
      modern photostat is nonsense, but to say that its readings are derivable from those of the
      photostat is acceptable enough. Once again, derivation and copying are different things.</p>
     <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Families</hi>, <hi rend="italic">sub-families</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
       >lines of descent</hi>. Every group of manuscripts which share a group of variants in
      opposition to those found in others will be spoken of as a family, derivable from some one
      manuscript, extant or hypothetical, spoken of as an <pb n="003.075"/> ancestor. A sub-family
      is a family whose ancestor is derivable from a manuscript which is the ancestor of still other
      manuscripts. A line of descent is a family, or family and sub-family, which share no ancestor
      with other families except the original from which all manuscripts are derived.</p>
     <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Hypothetical manuscript</hi>. A hypothetical manuscript is one which
      must be posited to explain similarities between two or more other manuscripts, extant or
      hypothetical. The explanation of such unities is the only reason for which a distributional or
      comparative student can posit such a manuscript. All other reasons are outside the reach of
      comparative evidence. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. This terminology differs slightly from
       that employed by Greg, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, pp. 2-3. Greg speaks of inferential
       manuscripts defined as are my hypothetical manuscripts, and then of others whose existence is
       suggested by non-comparative evidence, which he calls potential manuscripts. The essential
       difference is that I am denying that the comparative student can ever take account of
       potential manuscripts, so that Greg's distinction is unnecessary in my approach.</q></p>
     <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Original</hi>. This is the manuscript, hypothetical or extant, and
      presumed to be single unless proved otherwise, from which all extant and hypothetical
      manuscripts are derived. It is important to understand its nature. Since all that we know of
      it is ultimately derived from extant manuscripts, the original can have no characteristics not
      found in some at least of the extant manuscripts. The original, therefore, must be presumed to
      be the last version of the text produced before copying of the extant manuscripts and their
      ancestors began. Any number of lost versions may intervene between it and the author's
      original, which is forever out of our reach. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. This view of the
       original has been held by many of the ablest students of texts, e.g. Greg, <hi rend="italic"
        >loc. cit.</hi>, and John M. Manly and Edith Rickert, <hi rend="italic">The Text of the
        Canterbury Tales</hi> (University of Chicago Press, 1940), II, pp. 40-41. The view is also
       in accord with the view of the nature of starred ancestral forms held by modern linguists in
       the closely similar activity of linguistic reconstruction. For all that, the view is not
       universally held, necessary as it would seem to be. Note the explicit statement of Wolf, <hi
        rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi>, that the aim of his study was to recover the author's
       original. What I have called the original is what is called the archetype in Lachmannian
       textual criticism. I am, of course, denying that the "original" in the Lachmann sense is
       recoverable.</q></p>
     <pb n="003.076"/>
     <p>Well known as such statements about the nature of the original may be, they are still
      necessary since they close the door to much speculative tampering with texts. If the author's
      original is out of our reach, how much further out of our reach the author's
      intention&mdash;what he meant to write, but did not&mdash;must be! Yet, for instance, modern
      editors still defend Theobald's famous "'a babbled of green fields" on the ground that this is
      what Shakespeare must have meant to write.<ref target="f003.04.09" n="9"><hi rend="super"
        >9</hi></ref> I am not, of course, denying that Theobald's words are infinitely superior to
      those of the old text, nor that I should experience a sense of loss in a reading text which
      did not adopt the emendation. Yet it remains true that the emendation is without
      authority.</p>
     <p>XVI. Distributional evidence can establish the fact of derivation from a common ancestor.
      When, however, a single group of manuscripts is being considered in relation to the rest,
      agreement merely offers proof of some common ancestor, and does not define the relationship of
      that ancestor to manuscripts outside the group showing agreement. Thus if <hi rend="italic"
       >A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi> agree 99 times against the rest, <hi rend="italic"
       >A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi> have a common ancestor, but this ancestor may be derived
      from one of the other manuscripts, hypothetical or extant, or may even be the ancestor of all
      texts. Only the sum total of distributional evidence for all families offers any conclusion,
      or possibility of conclusion, about the exact nature of derivational relationships. <q><hi
        rend="italic">Note</hi>. It is exactly this sort of situation which faced Severs (<hi
        rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi>), in his development of family <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. The
       eight manuscripts which he set up as family <hi rend="italic">d</hi> agreed 13 times against
       all others. All but two of these agreements consisted of add-omissions absent in <hi
        rend="italic">d.</hi> Not until all the distributional evidence had been surveyed, and then
       only with considerable appeal to genealogical evidence, could Severs conclude that in effect
       the <hi rend="italic">d</hi> manuscripts were descended from <hi rend="italic">O</hi>, and
       that all others were descended from a later revision.</q></p>
     <pb n="003.077"/>
     <p>XVII. Normally some distributional evidence will be contradictory. Suppose that manuscript
       <hi rend="italic">A</hi> shares 99 readings with <hi rend="italic">B</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">C</hi>, which form a group that has previously been defined as exclusive. There
      are 4 readings which <hi rend="italic">A</hi> shares with <hi rend="italic">D</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">E</hi>, also previously defined as exclusive. For the neatness of manuscript
      diagrams, it would be convenient if such difficulties did not arise, but all manuscript
      experience leads the student to resign himself to them.</p>
     <p>XVIII. The postulate of unity was given in the form "it is more likely that unity among
      manuscripts reflects unity of source than that it reflects coincidence." The form of the
      postulate carefully avoids denial that coincidence&mdash;whether caused by convergence of
      change or by contamination&mdash;can and does occur. Yet if coincidence is less likely, it
      ought to occur less often, even though there is no accurate way of measuring what the
      proportions of occurrence should be. All that can be said is that the greater the disparity in
      frequency, the more likely it is that the smaller group represents coincidence. The proportion
      of 4 to 99 would probably trouble no wise editor. The closer the frequency comes to equality,
      then, the more suspicious the conclusion becomes. As a result of the fact that frequency of
      agreement and disagreement is a check on conclusions as to which readings reflect unity and
      which reflect coincidence, it becomes important for a student always to present a statement of
      the total distributional evidence in statistical form.</p>
     <p>XIX. Distributional facts settle some questions about the nature of derivation. Thus if in a
      group of more than two manuscripts having a common ancestor, all manuscripts have unique
      readings, and all manuscripts have shared readings in no constant arrangement, these facts are
      compatible only with derivation of the type known as radiation, in which all manuscripts are
      derived directly from the ancestor with no intervening sub-ancestors.<ref target="f003.04.10"
       n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> On the other hand, if the relationship is constant, so
      that the shared readings of <hi rend="italic">A</hi> are always shared only with <hi
       rend="italic">B</hi>, the facts can be taken to be incompatible with radiation. <pb
       n="003.078"/>
      <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. For our purposes, it makes little difference whether the
       student works directly with an arrangement of manuscripts thought of as proving or disproving
       a given kind of derivation, or if he works with the Quentin concept of "intermediaries." The
       Quentin term is a useful tool, but eventually arrives at essentially the same result as is
       stated in this paragraph. After the intermediaries have been studied and interpreted in terms
       of derivation, it is again shown that distributional evidence can prove the existence or
       non-existence of radiation, but can not settle the exact type of derivation if radiation is
       non-existent. The Quentin term "intermediary" can be briefly defined as a manuscript from a
       group of three related manuscripts chosen for comparison, of such a character that the other
       two manuscripts do not agree against it. Thus if manuscripts <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, <hi
        rend="italic">B</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">C</hi> constitute a family, Quentin would study
       the agreements and disagreements among them. If <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi
        rend="italic">B</hi> agree in some readings against <hi rend="italic">C</hi>, and <hi
        rend="italic">B</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C</hi> agree in some readings against <hi
        rend="italic">A</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C</hi> never agree
       against <hi rend="italic">B</hi>, <hi rend="italic">B</hi> is then defined as an
       intermediary. But the statement that it is an intermediary is not the same thing as saying
       that it is the ancestor, since it may be the ancestor of the other two, may be the middle
       term in a straight line derivation, or may be in still other relations to <hi rend="italic"
        >A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C</hi>. The concept can, however, be used to establish
       radiation. Suppose that there are four manuscripts, <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, <hi
        rend="italic">B</hi>, <hi rend="italic">C</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">D</hi>. If <hi
        rend="italic">A</hi> is intermediary in every combination of three, then all manuscripts are
       in radiation from <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If the relationship is not radiation, then the
       most that determination of the intermediaries can do is to place some limitation on the
       possible relationships. Thus if the family of three is in a straight line derivation and <hi
        rend="italic">B</hi> is the intermediary, as above, either <hi rend="italic">A</hi> or <hi
        rend="italic">C</hi> can be the original of the other two, but <hi rend="italic">B</hi> can
       not. Much the same sort of limitation, however, is arrived at by other means of studying
       distribution, as will be shown later. The wise student will, then, use whatever means of
       comparative study offers him the best possibility of reaching conclusions. The Quentin method
       is developed in the works by him already cited, but is perhaps most clearly explained in
       Severs, "Quentin's Theory of Textual Criticism," <hi rend="italic">English Institute Annual
        1941</hi> (Columbia University Press, 1942), pp. 65-93.</q></p>
     <p>XX. Distributional facts do not settle all questions of the nature of derivation. As stated
      above, distributional facts can establish radiation or the absence of it, but if radiation is
      absent, distribution can not establish the nature of derivation more narrowly. That is to say,
      distributional facts make the presence of sub-families evident, but will not demonstrate which
      groups are families and which sub-families, unless in turn the ancestral manuscripts can be
      shown to be derived by radiation.</p>
     <p>An example may make the statement that distributional facts <pb n="003.079"/> can not offer
      a complete solution unless the relationship of groups is radiational, somewhat clearer.
      Suppose that <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi> agree 99 times against <hi
       rend="italic">C</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D</hi> where <hi rend="italic">C</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">D</hi> disagree with each other. <hi rend="italic">C</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
       >D</hi> agree against <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi> 101 times where
       <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi> disagree with each other. These facts
      can be taken as incompatible with radiation. That is to say, <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">B</hi> have an ancestor which we can call <hi rend="italic">x</hi>, and <hi
       rend="italic">C</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D</hi> have an ancestor which we can call <hi
       rend="italic">y</hi>. The possibility that <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
       >y</hi> are descended by radiation from the original, <hi rend="italic">O</hi>, can be
      disregarded as uneconomical (as I will show), but two other possibilities remain, namely that
       <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is derived from <hi rend="italic">y</hi>, and that <hi rend="italic"
       >y</hi> is derived from <hi rend="italic">x</hi>. No further arrangement of readings within
       <hi rend="italic">ABCD</hi> will establish one of these alternatives. If, for instance, there
      are some readings where <hi rend="italic">B</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C</hi> agree against
      diversity in <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D</hi>, the most that can be said
      is that this suggests that in these instances the readings of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">y</hi> were like those now found in <hi rend="italic">B</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">C</hi>. Further, if there are some readings where <hi rend="italic">B</hi> and
       <hi rend="italic">C</hi> agree against unity in <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">D</hi>, we are forced to say that one set of agreements is the result of
      coincidence, and have still learned nothing about the relationship of <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
      and <hi rend="italic">y</hi>. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. It is this sort of difficulty
       that Joseph Bedier perceived and made use of as one of his most telling arguments against the
       whole of comparative study. In his <hi rend="italic">La Tradition Manuscrite du Lai de
        l'Ombre</hi> (reprint from <hi rend="italic">Romania</hi>; Paris: Champion, 1929), pp.
       51-52, occurs this possible tree for the <hi rend="italic">Lai</hi>: <figure entity="sb03791"
       /> In this tree <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is a manuscript posited merely for sake of argument,
       not actual or hypothetical. Bedier sets it up as differing from <hi rend="italic">w</hi> five
       times only, and makes the further condition that in all of these readings it agrees with <hi
        rend="italic">z</hi>. It is thus, in Quentin's terms, intermediate between <hi rend="italic"
        >w</hi> and <hi rend="italic">z</hi>. Bedier then goes on to say that all the relationships
       expressed by the tree above would be equally well expressed by this alternate tree, with <hi
        rend="italic">r</hi> made the archetype. <pb n="003.080"/>
       <figure entity="sb03801"/> In spite of the fact that these two trees as drawn by Bedier are
       open to some criticism, he is quite right in his main statement, since it amounts to no more
       than saying that distributional evidence will not settle whether it is <hi rend="italic"
        >w</hi> or <hi rend="italic">r</hi> which equals <hi rend="italic">O</hi>. To settle this
       question he would have had to give us the five readings, and let us decide on genealogical
       grounds which tree was better.</q></p>
     <p>If, however, we discover a new group of manuscripts which have a common ancestor <hi
       rend="italic">z</hi>, we can now compare the readings of <hi rend="italic">x</hi>, <hi
       rend="italic">y</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">z</hi>, and may be able to establish that
      contrary to our earlier necessary assumption, all three are derived by radiation from <hi
       rend="italic">O</hi>. We should not, of course, be troubled by the fact that new evidence
      upsets a previous hypothesis, but should on the other hand be thankful that our problems are
      now fully settled. If, however, the relationship of <hi rend="italic">x</hi>, <hi
       rend="italic">y</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">z</hi> is not radiation, there will be a constant
      grouping of two (<hi rend="italic">xy</hi>, <hi rend="italic">xz</hi>, or <hi rend="italic"
       >yz</hi>) and the only economical hypothesis is that one of the members of the constant group
      of two is identical with <hi rend="italic">O</hi>. But there is again no distributional
      evidence which will identify for us which of the two manuscripts is <hi rend="italic">O</hi>;
      in other words, we can not define distributionally which is derived from the other.</p>
     <p>XXI. The above discussion of ancestral relationships has implied the existence of a tool
      which has not yet been defined. This is the reconstructed or ancestral reading, which is the
      result in individual instances of the postulate of unity. The purpose of setting up ancestral
      readings is twofold. First, only by setting up such readings is it possible to examine whether
      the readings of possible daughter manuscripts are really compatible with a hypothesis of
      derivation; and second, the setting up of ancestral readings reduces the number of variants
      with which the student <pb n="003.081"/> must deal, so that when ancestral readings have been
      set up in successive stages, the student can eventually begin to set up the readings of <hi
       rend="italic">O</hi> by a relatively simple process of selection. The reconstruction of
      readings on distributional evidence can be reduced to a few type situations.</p>
     <p>1. If there are only two manuscripts, the ancestral readings can be given only where the
      manuscripts agree. This statement holds also for any situation where more than two manuscripts
      have been previously reduced to two ancestral manuscripts. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. It
       should be pointed out that an ancestral reading is simply the reading of an ancestral
       manuscript, and need not be the reading of a hypothetical ancestral manuscript. In the
       two-text situation, as will develop later, ancestral readings are commonly the readings of
       one of the extant manuscripts.</q></p>
     <p>2. If there are more than two manuscripts in radiational relationship, the ancestral
      readings can be given where all the manuscripts agree, and also where some of the manuscripts
      agree against diversity in the rest.</p>
     <p>3. If the group concerned is a sub-family, its ancestral readings can be given where all the
      manuscripts of the sub-family agree, or wherever one or more manuscripts of the sub-family
      show a reading supported outside the sub-family at a point where the other members of the
      sub-family show divergence from each other.</p>
     <p>4. In all other situations where reconstruction of readings is possible, some reliance must
      be placed on genealogical or other non-distributional evidence.</p>
     <p>XXII. When distributional evidence has been exhausted, the student must proceed to
      genealogical evidence. Geneological evidence can be summed up as the examination of the
      content of sets of variants for the purpose of answering the following generalized question:
      Is it more likely that <hi rend="italic">A</hi> is derived from <hi rend="italic">B</hi>, that
       <hi rend="italic">B</hi> is derived from <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, or are the probabilities
      equally balanced? Readings where the change seems equally likely to have occurred in either
      direction can be called reversible, those in which the order of change seems more likely in
      one direction than the other can be called non-reversible. The first task of the student is to
      separate the reversible readings from the non-reversible. Thereafter the reversible readings
      are to be disregarded.</p>
     <pb n="003.082"/>
     <p>XXIII. It is not my purpose to summarize the nature of nonreversible readings, since
      bibliographers who deal with such entities can be expected to know much more about them than
      can a strayed linguist like myself. There are, however, two types which I should like to
      discuss.</p>
     <p>1. Instances where a non-language object varies with a language symbol, over a bridge of
      similarity between the two. A brilliant piece of genealogical reasoning which illustrates this
      type of variation is Brusendorff's conclusion that the unique reading in one manuscript of
      Chaucer's <hi rend="italic">Purse</hi> "that of eye lowness hath no peer" can be derived from
      the usual reading "yellowness" by the bridge of an ancestral manuscript which read "yelowness"
      with accidental obliteration of the first <hi rend="italic">l</hi>. That is to say the
      non-language characteristic of faintness of a letter was interpreted as a meaningful space
      between words.<ref target="f003.04.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> Similar would be
      the not infrequent instances of variation between a smudge and a mark of punctuation. <q><hi
        rend="italic">Note</hi>. Probably the <hi rend="italic">locus classicus</hi> of genealogical
       evidence of this particular type is to be found in the manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic"
        >Dialogues</hi> of Epictetus. One manuscript (<hi rend="italic">Bodleianus, Cod. Graec.
        Miscellanei</hi> 251) has a greasy stain which covers text at the beginning of chapter 18 of
       the first book. All other manuscripts have a blank corresponding exactly to the number of
       letters covered by the stain, or present the letters which appear on either side of the
       stain, without recognition of missing material. In consequence editors have recognized <hi
        rend="italic">Bodleianus</hi> as the archetype of all known manuscripts. The course of the
       reasoning leading to such a conclusion is clear. It is more easily believable that copyists
       of manuscripts derived from <hi rend="italic">Bodleianus</hi> should have come upon the stain
       and been unable to decipher the letters which it covered, than that the copyist of <hi
        rend="italic">Bodleianus</hi> should have worked from a manuscript containing a blank, and
       have then concealed his inability to fill in the blank by putting text into it and covering
       it with a stain which made the text illegible. For the material on this manuscript family
       consult Joseph Souilh&eacute;, ed. and trans., <hi rend="italic">Epict&egrave;te
        Entretiens</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Livre I</hi> (Paris: Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
       d'&Eacute;dition "Les Belles Lettres," 1943), p. lxxii.</q></p>
     <p>2. If a set of variants consists of a non-existent and an existent language form, and if
      further, the non-existent form can be explained as the result of a known type of mechanical
      error such as <pb n="003.083"/> eye-skip, haplography, or the like, the existent form can be
      presumed to be the earlier, unless the distributional evidence proves otherwise. <q><hi
        rend="italic">Note</hi>. A typical, if somewhat extreme, example of a non-existent form
       fully explainable by a series of mechanical errors, is cited by Havet, <hi rend="italic">op.
        cit.</hi> p. 25. A single palimpsest manuscript of Cicero has the startling form
       COSOSNECVTVTVTVSEGVTVS . Part of this multiple error, resulting in a form which is both
       unique and scarcely conceivable as an existent Latin form, is due to misinterpretation of
       abbreviations ("coss. consecutus," <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, "consulibus consecutus"), and
       part to the well known mechanical error of perseverence. It is no wonder that Collomp (<hi
        rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> p. 9) remarks that this scribe must have been overcome by sleep.
       The reading of this manuscript is unique, so that an editor would be justified in rejecting
       it out of hand. Were it, on the contrary, supported in a large number of manuscripts, the
       distributional evidence might force the conclusion that the mistake was in the original. The
       presence of a known type of error can, of course, be used to decide the direction of change,
       even if all the several forms are existent, and offer perfect sense. An example of this sort
       of conclusion is found in Rand, (<hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> pp. 257-58, quoting Quentin
        <hi rend="italic">Memoire</hi> p. 477, and <hi rend="italic">Genesis</hi> 19,8). In this
       passage the variants, all of which offer sense, are as follows: <l>sub umbra culminis mei (9
        mss.)</l>
       <l>sub umbraculum culminis mei (2 mss.)</l>
       <l>sub umbraculum tegminis mei (5 mss.)</l> Quentin regards "umbra culminis" as derived from
       "umbraculum tegminis" by the omission of "-um teg-." Rand properly derives "umbra culminis"
       not from the source suggested by Quentin but from "umbraculum culminis" by omission of "-um
       cul-," which can be accounted for by eye-skip, where the omission suggested by Quentin can
       not be correlated with such a type of known error.</q> The caution given above is necessary,
      since the mistake may have been in <hi rend="italic">O</hi>, and the existent form produced by
      later correction; the relation of the readings <hi rend="italic">parallesse</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">parallelless</hi> cited earlier is an example of this sort of reversal.
      Nonetheless, it seems a safe assumption that the number of mechanical mistakes will exceed the
      number of conscious corrections&mdash;at least my own experience with secretaries seems to
      bear it out.<ref target="f003.04.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref></p>
     <p>The terms existent and non-existent used above need some <pb n="003.084"/> explanation. I
      have purposely avoided such terms as right, expected, or understandable, since to use them
      would be to reintroduce the literary criterion which I have attempted to avoid. Further, a
      form may obviously be existent without being understandable, as Professor Menner has shown
      with the unintelligible "lad hem bi lag mon" of <hi rend="italic">Gawain and the Green
       Knight</hi>.<ref target="f003.04.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> To use the term
      non-existent, however, necessitates an assumption which is inescapable, even though we know it
      to be false. To say that a form is non-existent in Middle English actually supposes that we
      know all about Middle English, when in fact we do not. We are, in short, using negative
      evidence which is always dangerous. There is, however, nothing we can do about it except to be
      sure that we have made a diligent search before we say that a given form is non-existent.</p>
     <p>3. The result of these statements is this: I regard individual pieces of genealogical
      evidence with distrust, and am firmly convinced that they should be used only after the
      distributional evidence has limited the alternatives. Also, genealogical evidence should be
      presented statistically, since some of it will be contradictory, as was distributional
      evidence. If the non-reversible readings have been well chosen, however, the group of them
      which is most frequent ought to give trustworthy evidence of the direction of derivation.</p>
     <p>XXIV. At the end of all his labors, the editor presents his results in the shape of a family
      tree, leading back to <hi rend="italic">O</hi>, whose reconstructed readings he will follow in
      his text. I should repeat that a tree is a description of the relationship of readings found
      in manuscripts, and ought never to be understood as a statement that <hi rend="italic">A</hi>
      was copied from <hi rend="italic">B</hi>. It merely states that the readings now found in <hi
       rend="italic">A</hi> are derivable from readings now found in <hi rend="italic">B</hi>, after
      examination of all the extant evidence. The fact that the readings now found in <hi
       rend="italic">B</hi> were in historical fact taken from a now irrecoverable manuscript is
      quite irrelevant to any study of readings and their distribution. I am laboring the point,
      since <pb n="003.085"/> students seem sometimes unnecessarily timid in the face of external
      evidence, particularly of chronology. Even such a soundly courageous student as Germaine
      Dempster, in arguing for a certain type of descent, finds it necessary to say that the date of
      copying of extant manuscripts is not out of keeping with her view of the descent studied.<ref
       target="f003.04.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref> Actually an editor who has derived
       <hi rend="italic">A</hi> from <hi rend="italic">B</hi> should be quite unmoved by external
      evidence that <hi rend="italic">B</hi> is on twentieth century paper, while <hi rend="italic"
       >A</hi> is on mediaeval vellum. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. The irrelevancy of date of
       copying for conclusions about the derivation of manuscript readings is a product of the fact
       that all families of manuscripts must be presumed to have been decimated. The date of copying
       is, however, relevant in drawing up a tree for printed books which are preserved in multiple
       copies, so that decimation is much less likely. It is probably a failure to realize the
       necessary differences between the decimated families of manuscript work, and families
       presumed to be complete, which is responsible for the fact that the Lachmannian type of
       student regularly assumed that the oldest manuscript was the best. An example of the way in
       which decimation can affect a tree is the following from Havet, <hi rend="italic">op.
        cit.</hi> pages 8 and 27. Havet cites a print of the <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> of
       Hyginus of 1535, which can be shown to be a direct copy of a ninth century manuscript which
       now exists only in fragments. Not only is such a time-spread a clear indication of the
       unreliability of guesses about authority based on date of copying, but since the ninth
       century manuscript is incomplete a student would be justified in deriving the readings of,
       say, an eleventh century manuscript from readings now found only in the print of 1535. The
       clearest statement of this principle is to be found in the Quentin <hi rend="italic"
        >Essais</hi>, p. 103, in answer to one of his many critics. ". . . 'on sera
       &eacute;tonn&eacute;,' &eacute;crit-il, 'de voir une g&eacute;n&eacute;alogie o&ugrave; le
       Ms. <hi rend="italic">Laud</hi>, du IXe si&egrave;cle [et autres] . . . d&eacute;rivent de
        <hi rend="italic">Leg</hi> qui n'est que du Xe si&egrave;cle. . . .' La
       v&eacute;rit&eacute;, c'est que mes g&eacute;n&eacute;alogies s'appliquent non aux manuscrits
       eux-m&ecirc;mes, mais aux types de transmission du texte qu'ils representent." An astonishing
       and most misleading misunderstanding of the conditions under which date becomes a good guide
       is in E. K. Rand's attack on Quentin, already cited, on pages 208-11. Quentin had performed
       the interesting experiment of copying out a Latin passage twenty-two times, labelling the
       copies from <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, the original, to <hi rend="italic">Z</hi>, the copy
       farthest removed from it. This known tree he then used as a test for the validity of his
       methods. Rand attempted to show that the classic "common mistake" technique gave surer
       results far more quickly than did the Quentin system. To do this he assumed that manuscripts
       labelled with letters late in the alphabet were late and corrupt, manuscripts labelled with
       letters early in the alphabet were older and more authoritative. Not unnaturally <pb
        n="003.086"/> he was able to reconstruct Quentin's experimental tree very quickly, since
       under these circumstances a mistake was readily and correctly defined as any reading which
       appeared for the first time in a manuscript labelled with a late letter. Such an attempt,
       however, is little more than a copying of the tree already given, and can not be accepted as
       a refutation of Quentin's theories. Rand had strangely failed to recognize that he was
       working with a family known to be complete, an assumption which would never apply in actual
       manuscript work. One can not wonder at the tone of slightly aggrieved patience with which the
       good Dom describes this treatment in his <hi rend="italic">Essais</hi>, page 55.</q></p>
     <p>XXV. A manuscript tree is a diagrammatic description, and is to be judged like other
      instances of description in science&mdash;by the same criteria that we apply, for instance, to
      a description of phonemes. It follows, therefore, that like other descriptive statements, a
      tree is non-unique. That is to say, some other description might also contain and present the
      facts and be quite different in shape from our own diagram. To say that a tree is non-unique
      is not, however, to state that all trees are equally good. Two trees are equally good only if
      they differ at points where choice is truly arbitrary, and in such instances the general
      similarity between the two should be very considerable. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. The
       non-uniqueness of manuscript trees was the basis of Bedier's famous attack on comparative
       study of manuscripts, from which he concluded that the only defensible method of editing was
       to select a single good text and depart from it as taste and judgment dictated. The attack is
       found in its fullest form in <hi rend="italic">La Tradition Manuscrite du Lai de
       l'Ombre</hi>, previously cited. He here attempts to reduce all investigations of authority to
       an absurdity by drawing no less than eleven different trees for this single text. It is true
       that all of these trees would explain the arrangement of readings, but Bedier made no attempt
       to judge between them, in spite of the fact that many of them are rather obviously
       unlikely.</q></p>
     <p>The relative worth of alternate trees can be judged by the criteria universal in descriptive
      science; completeness, consistency, and simplicity.<ref target="f003.04.15" n="15"><hi
        rend="super">15</hi></ref> The first two of these are relatively simple to apply, and are
      universally acknowledged in manuscript work; the third will need special discussion.</p>
     <p>1. A tree is incomplete if it leaves any body of readings out <pb n="003.087"/> of account,
      or if its author has failed to compare the readings of any manuscript, extant or hypothetical,
      with those of any other manuscript, extant or hypothetical.</p>
     <p>2. A tree is inconsistent if the same evidence, or type of evidence, is used to give
      contrary results. A startling example of inconsistency is pointed out by Mrs. Dempster in
      discussing the tree of Manly and Rickert for a part of the <hi rend="italic">Canterbury
       Tales</hi>.<ref target="f003.04.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> For a part of a
      sub-family Manly and Rickert use the presence of unique readings in each manuscript, and the
      absence of readings shared with other individuals within the group, to establish that the
      manuscripts are in radiation. Yet there is a smaller group of manuscripts which belong to the
      sub-family which they set up as a sub-family within the sub-family, in spite of the fact that
      this group has no constant body of readings necessitating the setting up of an ancester for
      it. Manly and Rickert meet the difficulty by assuming that the ancestor of the smaller group
      which they set up must have copied the ancestor of the whole family without making any
      mistakes. Thus they have used unique readings and the absence of shared readings to establish
      radiation, and used exactly the same set of relationships to set up an unnecessary
      sub-family.</p>
     <p>XXVI. The criterion of simplicity needs special discussion both because it has not been
      explicitly used in manuscript work, and because it will be useful to work out the definition
      in such a way as to give a simple operational procedure. Simplicity will be assumed to be
      inversely proportional to the number of hypotheses involved in a given explanation. That is to
      say, if two explanations equally well fit the facts, that which does so with fewer hypotheses
      will always be judged preferable. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. While it is true that (to my
       knowledge) simplicity has never been explicitly used as a criterion in manuscript study, it
       has, curiously enough, been at least once explicitly denied. Bedier (<hi rend="italic">op.
        cit.</hi> pp. 66-67) says of some of his less probable trees, "Certes, supposer un <hi
        rend="italic">O</hi>2, puis un <hi rend="italic">O</hi>3, c'est aller en compliquant
       toujours davantage. Mais ni la simplicit&eacute; d'une hypoth&egrave;se n'est un gage de sa
       justesse, ni sa complexit&eacute; n'est une marque de sa fausset&eacute;." Such a startlingly
       unique assumption goes far to explain how Bedier could revolt against nearly a century of
       literary scholarship.</q></p>
     <pb n="003.088"/>
     <p>1. A basic hypothesis which equally underlies all trees can not be used to compare one tree
      with another, unless there is a difference in the number of times the hypothesis is used. At
      the outset, then, it is necessary to point out that all manuscript work assumes the existence
      of a single original, which we have called <hi rend="italic">O</hi>. In other words, the
      minimum number of manuscripts with which a student must deal is always one more than the
      extant number. Even in trees which do not end in <hi rend="italic">O</hi>, the student has
      assumed its existence, but has made the further conclusion that <hi rend="italic">O</hi> is
      identical with an extant manuscript. At the moment, then, it is important to note that the
      existence of <hi rend="italic">O</hi> is not a special hypothesis inherent in only some
      trees.</p>
     <p>2. A second general assumption is, of course, that manuscripts assume their present shape by
      copying. In other words, no tree can be drawn without showing lines of derivation. But each
      such line of derivation is a separate hypothesis, and the general statement of simplicity
      given above means that the tree which shows the fewest lines of derivation is the
      simplest.</p>
     <p>This fact can be used to express simplicity by a simple device of scoring. Suppose that our
      arrangement of readings for three extant manuscripts is such as to permit either of the
      following trees: <figure entity="sb03881"/> Scoring each line as one, the first tree has a
      score of three, while the second tree has a score of two. Both trees have assumed that <hi
       rend="italic">O</hi> exists, but the second tree has been simplified by making the separate
      existence of <hi rend="italic">O</hi> unnecessary. In other words, other things being equal,
      whenever an extant manuscript can be identified with <hi rend="italic">O</hi>, a simpler tree
      results, and this simplicity will always be reflected in the number of lines of
      derivation.</p>
     <p>3. Another type of hypothesis made in trees is that of the existence of hypothetical
      ancestral manuscripts. Except for <hi rend="italic">O</hi>, such hypothetical ancestors are
      not equally necessary for all trees, so that their presence or absence becomes a measure of
      comparative simplicity. Further, the setting up of a hypothetical manuscript <pb n="003.089"/>
      other than <hi rend="italic">O</hi> is a double hypothesis, first of the existence of one more
      manuscript, and second of derivation from it. Thus in our scoring device, we will count any
      line of derivation connecting a manuscript with a hypothetical manuscript other than <hi
       rend="italic">O</hi> as having a value of two. Suppose that our tree can be either of the
      following: <figure entity="sb03891"/> The number of lines of derivation is equal, but the
      simplicity is not. Actually the first tree has dealt with four manuscripts (the three extant
      ones and <hi rend="italic">O</hi>), the second with five (the three extant ones, <hi
       rend="italic">O</hi> and <hi rend="italic">x</hi>). Our scoring device reflects this by
      giving the first tree a total of three, the second a total of six.<ref target="f003.04.17"
       n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> The first tree is then preferable.</p>
     <p>XXVII. Such a measure of simplicity, rough though it may be, gives the student a powerful
      tool in dealing with situations which have often been thought to be hopelessly ambiguous.</p>
     <p>1. In any two-text situation, or any situation which has been reduced to a two-text
      situation, either one manuscript must be descended from the other, or both from <hi
       rend="italic">O</hi>. If one manuscript is descended from the other, the resultant tree has a
      score of one; if both are descended from <hi rend="italic">O</hi> the tree has a score of two.
      Thus unless there is some evidence which positively contradicts the hypothesis, the student
      will assume that one manuscript is descended from the other, and proceed to genealogical
      evidence to decide which way the derivation goes. Later evidence may show that his hypothesis
      was false, but that danger is inherent in all decisions based on evidence. In the mean time,
      his decisions have been consistent and orderly, and so have a greater probability of being
      right than if they had been inconsistent and disorderly&mdash;unless, <pb n="003.090"/> of
      course, one is prepared to defend the horrifying position that there is no order at all in
      human experience. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. The statement here given constitutes an
       answer for one of the major objections raised by Bedier in the work previously cited. He
       surveyed a large number of trees drawn up by scholars using the Lachmann method. He found
       that a large majority of them, almost amounting to unanimity, were two-forked trees. Such a
       state of affairs, depriving the editor of the opportunity of bringing supported readings to
       bear against unique readings, could not, he felt, be either the result of chance or of
       falsification on the part of scholars. He concluded therefore that the almost unanimous
       choice of two-forked trees reflected a weakness in the method itself. If the criterion of
       simplicity is applied, the student is under a genuine obligation to resolve all two-forked
       trees, so that Bedier's objection would be met.</q></p>
     <p>2. In practice this statement means that a tree of the type <figure entity="sb03901"/> will
      always be rejected in favor of one of the types given below, which identify <hi rend="italic"
       >O</hi> with an extant manuscript. <figure entity="sb03902"/> It is for this reason that it
      was stated earlier that in a situation where both <hi rend="italic">AB</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">CD</hi> had ancestors, it is inadmissible to draw a tree in the form: <figure
       entity="sb03903"/> Such a tree is one which reduces a group to a two-text situation,
      wherefore it will always be assumed that either <hi rend="italic">x</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
       >y</hi> is identical with <hi rend="italic">O</hi>.</p>
     <pb n="003.091"/>
     <p>XXVIII. Of the three text situation Greg has said: <q>. . . it is clear that, where three
       manuscripts only are concerned, no merely formal process can throw light on the relationships
       between them. Either the readings will be all divergent or else the variants will be of the
       type . . . where one group is represented by one MS only . . . and since, in the latter case,
       the reading of the single divergent manuscript may always (theoretically at least) be
       unoriginal, it will never be possible to establish a common source for any pair of
       manuscripts to the exclusion of the third. Given three manuscripts, therefore, it is
       impossible either to prove or to disprove independent derivation. This fact, which I call the
        <hi rend="italic">ambiguity of three texts</hi>, we shall find meet us at every turn of the
       discussion. . . .<ref target="f003.04.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref></q> The
      measure of simplicity gives us a way of dealing with this situation which no longer leaves it
      ambiguous. We shall partly accept Greg's statement, partly deny it.</p>
     <p>1. There are two types of tree involving a common ancestor for two out of three manuscripts.
      They differ only in that the second has identified <hi rend="italic">O</hi> with an extant
      manuscript. Both trees are of course types, so that the labels attached to given branches are
      of no significance. <figure entity="sb03911"/> There is a slight difference in simplicity
      between these two, since the first has a score of seven and the second one of six. The fact
      that the second is slightly preferable is, however, irrelevant, since the choice is between
      these two and still simpler types.</p>
     <p>The simpler types are <figure entity="sb03912"/>
      <pb n="003.092"/> The first of these has a score of three, and the last two a score of two. By
      Greg's own statement the more complex trees can offer no explanation of the relationship of
      readings which is not equally well given by one of the three simpler trees. Therefore, the
      more complex trees are always unnecessary, and will never be used by a consistent student, no
      matter if there is a danger that later evidence might show him that his assumption of a
      simpler tree was actually false.</p>
     <p>2. If the three-text situation were truly ambiguous, it would be further impossible to
      decide between the simpler trees, that is to say, the type employing a separate <hi
       rend="italic">O</hi> and the two types in which <hi rend="italic">O</hi> is identified with
      an extant manuscript. This question also can be resolved.</p>
     <p>3. The tree which has a separate <hi rend="italic">O</hi> is less simple, it is true, than
      the other two trees, but it is also true that distributional evidence can establish the fact
      of radiational derivation. A generalized example will make this clear. Let <hi rend="italic"
       >A, B, C</hi> represent the three manuscripts. Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> represent
      supported readings, and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> represent unique readings. We can thus
      represent a situation in three differing text positions thus <table>
       <row>
        <cell><hi rend="italic">A</hi></cell>
        <cell><hi rend="italic">B</hi></cell>
        <cell><hi rend="italic">C</hi></cell>
       </row>
       <row>
        <cell><hi rend="italic">a</hi></cell>
        <cell><hi rend="italic">a</hi></cell>
        <cell><hi rend="italic">b</hi> position one</cell>
       </row>
       <row>
        <cell><hi rend="italic">a</hi></cell>
        <cell><hi rend="italic">b</hi></cell>
        <cell><hi rend="italic">a</hi> position two</cell>
       </row>
       <row>
        <cell><hi rend="italic">b</hi></cell>
        <cell><hi rend="italic">a</hi></cell>
        <cell><hi rend="italic">a</hi> position three</cell>
       </row>
      </table> If, in this situation, any one of the three extant manuscripts is taken to be the
      ancestor of the other two, one of the three text positions is unexplained. Thus if we draw the
      tree in the form <figure entity="sb03921"/> the readings in position three must represent
      coincidence, which is contrary to the postulate of unity. The same statement would apply to
      any tree placing either <hi rend="italic">B</hi> or <hi rend="italic">C</hi> as the ancestor.
      Thus in the situation where there are always two readings against one, but the grouping is not
      constant, the only reasonable conclusion is radiation from a hypothetical ancestor. <pb
       n="003.093"/>
      <q><hi rend="italic">Note.</hi>. An example of the way in which the procedure I have been
       trying to outline modifies the results of previous methods can be drawn from the following
       short Latin poem, to be found in Heinz Pflaum, "<hi rend="italic">Sortes, Plato, Cicero</hi>
       satirisches Gedicht des dreizehnten Jahrhunderts," <hi rend="italic">Speculum</hi>, VI
       (1931), 499-533. There are three manuscripts only, and at page 525 the editor gives the
       following Lachmannian tree: <figure entity="sb03931"/> The reasons for this tree are clearly
       given on the same page: "<hi rend="italic">N</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P</hi> bilden eine
       besondere Klasse, da sie, gegen&uuml;ber der richtigen Lesart von <hi rend="italic">T</hi>,
       an vier Stellen charakteristische gemeinsame Fehler haben . . . w&auml;hrend <hi
        rend="italic">T</hi> nirgendwo in einem unzweifelhaften Fehler mit der einen gegen die
       andere &uuml;bereinstimmt. <hi rend="italic">T</hi> is durchaus die beste Handschrift, obwohl
       Str. 35 in ihr fehlt; <hi rend="italic">P</hi>, die j&uuml;ngste Hs., is ziemlich stark
       verderbt." The tree above gives a stage beyond that recoverable by comparative study, since
       it separates <hi rend="italic">O</hi> and <hi rend="italic">OI</hi>. Second, it draws a
       needlessly complex tree, as the discussion of the three text situation has attempted to show.
       I give the first verse of the critical test, with variants, as follows: <l>Sortes pre
        consortibus currit in consorcio;</l>
       <l>in equis et curribus non est dispensacio.</l>
       <l>Platonis in manibus sonat disputacio</l>
       <l>et de sortis cursibus longa demonstracio.</l> In line 2 <hi rend="italic">T</hi> has <hi
        rend="italic">canibus</hi>, corrected to <hi rend="italic">curribus</hi>, the reading of <hi
        rend="italic">N</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P</hi>. In line 4, <hi rend="italic">P</hi> has
        <hi rend="italic">corsibus</hi>, <hi rend="italic">N</hi> and <hi rend="italic">T</hi> have
        <hi rend="italic">cursibus</hi>. In line 4, <hi rend="italic">N</hi> has <hi rend="italic"
        >longa</hi>, <hi rend="italic">T</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P</hi> have <hi rend="italic"
        >magna</hi>. I am not attempting to draw a complete tree for this poem, but it is striking
       that the first three variants exactly illustrate the scheme drawn for a three-text situation
       compatible with radiation from <hi rend="italic">O</hi>. It is curious, finally, that the
       editor in printing <hi rend="italic">longa</hi> in line 4, has adopted a reading which his
       own tree disproves.</q></p>
     <p>4. If, on the other hand, the readings are constantly arranged in a fashion which can be

      </table> the hypothesis of radiation from a hypothetical ancestor becomes unnecessary, and the
      student will adopt the simpler type of tree. As to which of the types of tree employing no
      hypothetical ancestor he will choose, distributional evidence will offer him no help, and he
      must base his choice on genealogical evidence. <q><hi rend="italic">Note</hi>. The first of
       the two schemes given in this paragraph places some limitation on possible trees, just as the
       Quentin "intermediary" does. The ancestor can be either <hi rend="italic">A</hi> or <hi
        rend="italic">B</hi> but not <hi rend="italic">C</hi>, if the copied manuscripts are
       independently derived. If the derivation is in a straight line, either <hi rend="italic"
        >A</hi>, <hi rend="italic">B</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">C</hi> can be the ultimate ancestor,
       but <hi rend="italic">C</hi> can not be the middle term. The second scheme, which represents
       a relatively rare state of affairs, places no limitation on the possible trees, except that
       radiation from <hi rend="italic">O</hi> is an unnecessary hypothesis.</q></p>
     <p>XXIX. It is, I believe, of no use to carry this analysis of the effects of measuring
      simplicity into situations involving more texts than three, since such situations will resolve
      themselves into larger radiational groups, two- or three-text groups, two- or three-text
      groups mixed with larger radiational groups. In any case, it is easy to carry the suggestions
      I have made into situations involving more manuscripts.</p>
     <p>XXX. A brief summary of what has been done may be useful. I have first of all tried to
      follow Greg and Quentin in setting up a method of dealing consistently with variants, making
      the minimum use of variants preclassified into right readings and wrong readings. In this I
      differ from the implicit assumptions of many editors, and the explicit assumptions of such
      students as Hitchcock and Wolf. Second, I have tried to make a few basic assumptions, <pb
       n="003.095"/> in themselves as simple as possible&mdash;indeed sometimes so simple as to be
      obvious&mdash;and see how far it is possible to carry them. Third, I have broken with Greg,
      whose view of a tree is that it must be unique before it can be regarded as free of ambiguity.
      Instead of accepting uniqueness as the only criterion, I have stated that trees are often
      necessarily non-unique (as Greg well knew), but that in instances where a simple tree and a
      complex tree both explain the arrangement of variants, the student can choose the simple tree.
      To do so will be as acceptable as if the simpler tree had been fully proved, since to do so
      will achieve the aim of distributional study, which is to set up an orderly and consistent
      method of dealing with the extant variants, subject always to the reservation that when more
      variants are discovered, the results will have to be re-examined.</p>

       however, the clearest statement of the circularity of the method based on "common mistakes"

     <p>THE TWO CAXTON VARIANTS WHICH PROVIDE the topic of discussion for the present investigation
      are by no means recent discoveries; quite to the contrary, they have been noted for many years
      in the standard books of reference. It is most strange, therefore, that these well-known
      variant states have been subjected neither to critical study nor to thorough technical
      analyses, especially since, as distinct from many other Caxton variants, it is absolutely
      certain in each instance which is the earlier state and which the later. This circumstance
      further permits the investigator to ascertain specific details as to the workings of Caxton's
      printing office, with special reference to the resetting of copy previously printed at the
      same press.<ref target="f003.05.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> The two variant
      states to be discussed here are found in: Lydgate, <hi rend="italic">The Pilgrimage of the
       Soul</hi>, Westminster, 6 June 1483 (Duff 267) and Christine de Pisan, <hi rend="italic">The
       Book of the Fayttes of Armes and of Chyvalrye</hi>, [Westminster], 14 July 1489 (Duff 96).
      The separate states are identified by the fact that one sheet in each book appears in two
      different settings of type.</p>
    </div2>
    <div2 type="section" n="2">
     <head>Pilgrimage of the Soul</head>
     <p>In E. Gordon Duff's <hi rend="italic">Fifteenth Century English Books</hi> (Bibliographical
      Society, Illustrated Monograph No. XVIII, 1917), one finds the following note appended to his
      description of No. 267: <q>There are two issues of this book: in the original issue (B.M.) the
       two inner pages of sheet f3 have been imposed wrongly, so that what should be on f3<hi
        rend="super">b</hi> is <pb n="003.098"/> on f6<hi rend="super">a</hi> and what should be on
        f6<hi rend="super">a</hi> is on f3<hi rend="super">b</hi>, and the whole book is in type 4.
       In the second issue (Britwell) this whole sheet has been reprinted in type 4<hi rend="super"
        >*</hi>, so as to read correctly.<ref target="f003.05.02" n="2"><hi rend="super"
        >2</hi></ref></q></p>
     <p>Of the six copies that have survived to our day,<ref target="f003.05.03" n="3"><hi
        rend="super">3</hi></ref> the British Museum is the only one to have sheet f3.6 in the
      original state,<ref target="f003.05.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> the remaining
      copies all belonging to the later "issue" (contrary to the opinion expressed in <hi
       rend="italic">STC</hi> 6473).</p>
     <p>Since it is absolutely certain that the Museum copy belongs to the earlier state, one may
      well ask how it compares with the "corrected" later form of sheet f3.6? The ready answer to
      this query is that the resetting (though corrected so far as the imposition is concerned) is
      much the more inferior text. Not only does the reprint contain eleven misprints to seven found
      in the original setting<ref target="f003.05.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> but it
      also omits nineteen words found in the original&mdash; a fact of much greater significance. To
      be exact, twenty words are omitted by the reprint but, by way of partial compensation, one
      word<ref target="f003.05.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> not found in the first
      setting is added by the second.</p>
     <p>Almost half the words wanting in the later sheet are clearly omitted because of careless
      type-setting. The compositor of the reprint, although he was setting type from printed copy,
      did not follow his original line for line.<ref target="f003.05.07" n="7"><hi rend="super"
        >7</hi></ref> On the verso of signature f3 (of the reprint) he departed so far from his copy
      that when he reached the bottom of the page he found that he had less than half a line to
      accommodate a full line of the original text. By making radical omissions, the compositor
      succeeded in having his page end at the proper place but not without doing violence to the
      text. In the original state (f6) the passage in question reads: <pb n="003.099"/>
      <q>. . . And leue &verbar;&verbar; it wel y<hi rend="super">t</hi> though the passi&omacr; of
       crist profite not these innoc&emacr;ts to their &verbar;&verbar; ful saluaci&omacr; yet it
       profiteth them so moch y<hi rend="super">t</hi> sathanas lyeth loken in &verbar;&verbar; the
       depthe of helle / so that he ne may not ne none of his mynystres &verbar;&verbar; [f4]
       annoyen ne tormenten none Innocent / as their malyce wold / ne &verbar;&verbar; harmen none
       persone / but by his owne assent . . .</q> In the reprint, the same text (f3 verso) appears
      as: <q>. . . &amp; &verbar;&verbar; leue hit wel that thong (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) the
       passion of Jhesu crist prouffite not &verbar;&verbar; these innocentes to their sauacion /

       lok&emacr; in helle y<hi rend="super">t</hi> none of his mynystres &verbar;&verbar; [f4]
       annoyen ne tormenten none Innocent / as their malyce wold / ne &verbar;&verbar; harmen none
       persone / but by his owne assent . . .</q> In making these omissions the compositor succeeded
      in having his text end with the correct word, but in order to achieve this both sense and
      grammar were sacrificed to expediency.</p>
     <p>Apart from this instance, the textual differences are slight and occasionally reflect no
      more than the spelling habits of two different compositors;<ref target="f003.05.08" n="8"><hi
        rend="super">8</hi></ref> for example, the British Museum state has "nought" eight times
      where the reprint has "not." In those cases where a choice can be made, however, the British
      Museum setting is always the better. Thus where the soul <hi rend="italic">asks</hi> the body
      "how hast thou lost al thy queyntyse" (BM, f3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, l. 33), the reprint
      offers "how thou hast lost al queyntyse." Clearly then, instead of seizing upon the
      opportunity to improve the text, a careless compositor has permitted the text of the reprint
      to deteriorate.</p>
     <p>Curiously enough, the reprint exhibits a technical&mdash;as well as a
      textual&mdash;deterioration. Concerning the use of "guide-letters" or "directors," Konrad
       Haebler<ref target="f003.05.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> observes that in order
      "to lighten the rubricator's work, the custom was gradually adopted of printing in small type
      (usually in lower-case), in the space left to be filled in by hand, the initial which the
      rubricator was to add in colors." This had been common practice on the Continent from as early
      as 1471-2, and directors appear in books printed at Caxton's <pb n="003.100"/> press even in
      the days of its activity at Bruges.<ref target="f003.05.10" n="10"><hi rend="super"
       >10</hi></ref> In the <hi rend="italic">Pilgrimage</hi>, guide-letters were used throughout
      the volume including the first setting of sheet f3.6, but directors are not present in the
      reprint of this sheet. Thus the reprint demonstrates the return to a more primitive practice
      of type-setting where such reminders were not considered necessary for the benefit of the
      rubricator.</p>

      the pertinent leaves&mdash;Windsor, Bodleian (Auct. QQ supra l. 25) and the York Minster copy
      now in the collection of Phyllis Goodhart Gordan and Howard L. Goodhart of New York. Seymour
      de Ricci informs us that the Sion College copy lacks S5, but I have been unsuccessful in my
      attempts to obtain information as to the state of S2 in this copy.</p>
     <p>Although the <hi rend="italic">Gesamtkatalog</hi> simply assumes without further proof that
      the G&ouml;ttingen state is that which was "neu gesetzt," there is plenty of evidence to prove
      that this is certainly the case.<ref target="f003.05.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref>
      <pb n="003.101"/> In this instance, positive proof is supplied by the different systems of
      punctuation employed by the two compositors. As will be seen from a perusal of the modern
      reprint, the enormously preponderant punctuation mark used in the <hi rend="italic"
       >Fayttes</hi> is the virgule (/). For example, on signatures S1, S3, and S4 (six pages common
      to all copies), there are 164 punctuation marks of which 163 are virgules, the remaining one
      being a semi-colon. In the first setting as represented by the copy in The Pierpont Morgan
      Library (PML 781), there are 118 instances of punctuation on S2 and S5; of these 117 are
      virgules and the remaining one is a semi-colon.</p>
     <p>For the other setting, the Kane-Princeton copy shows (on sheet S2.5) 105 cases of
      punctuation, of which 96 are periods, 6 are semi-colons and only 3 are virgules. Obviously the
      text of this sheet was set by a different compositor&mdash;one following his own rules of
      punctuation&mdash;than the one who had composed all the rest of the volume. Thus it is quite
      certain that sheet S2.5 of the Morgan copy belongs to the original setting and that the
      Princeton one is the reprinted sheet.</p>
     <p>Again we may enquire what a comparison of the two states reveals and again we will note that
      the reprint shows a deterioration of text. The state of the Morgan copy has six misprints,
      while the total in the Princeton setting amounts to some seventeen such errors; two misprints
      are common to both states.<ref target="f003.05.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref>
      Characteristic of the better text of the first is the reading "Consules of Mountpellyer" (S2,
      l. 4) where the reprint specifies "Consules Mountpollyer." Conversely, however, the second
      setting has the more correct last lines in the colophon which read: ". . . he may
      &verbar;&verbar; atteyne to euerlastyng lyf in heuen. whiche god graunte to &verbar;&verbar;
      hym and to alle his lyege peple. AMEN. &verbar;&verbar; Per Caxton &verbar;&verbar;". The
      first contained the misprints "euerlastpng" and "gaunte." However, since the far greater
      number of misprints is found in the form as represented by the Princeton copy, we must
      consider this second setting as the more inferior text.</p>
     <pb n="003.102"/>
     <p>A most singular peculiarity of the Princeton volume requires special mention. The blank last
      leaf (S6 recto) in this copy shows a distinct off-set of the text of S5 verso, a condition
      often encountered among Caxton imprints. But the startling fact here is that the Princeton
      leaf shows an off-set of the original setting, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> of the resetting
      which now faces it in the volume. There seem to be only two logical explanations for this
      phenomenon, either that the copy was "made up," perhaps when it was rebound by Bedford,<ref
       target="f003.05.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> or that the off-setting took place
      in Caxton's workshop. If the latter assumption be the correct one, we would have certain
      evidence that the copies of the <hi rend="italic">Fayttes</hi> were not bound up as soon as
      printed but that the sheets were stored unbound.<ref target="f003.05.16" n="16"><hi
        rend="super">16</hi></ref> Thus it would have to be argued that the Princeton sheet S1.6
      came into contact soon after printing (possibly by being gathered with it) with a sheet of the
      earlier setting of S2.5, but that, in the long run, it was not bound up with this particular
      sheet.</p>
     <p>Turning to the other alternative, it seems highly improbable that the blank leaf was added
      to this copy,<ref target="f003.05.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> since no one
      would ever have considered it necessary to supply such a leaf in order to create a "perfect
      and complete" example. Again one cannot assume that only leaf S5 was supplied, since S2 is its
      proper conjugate; therefore, if anything was added to the Princeton volume, it must have been
      the whole sheet (S2.5). Furthermore, if the blank be the original one, as we have good reason
      to believe, it seems unlikely that the important printed leaf just ahead of the useless blank
      could have been missing from this copy at any time; surely, if S5 was lost, S6 would have
      disappeared too. One must believe, then, that if the volume is not in the same condition as it
      was when sold by Caxton (at least, as far as the identity of leaves is concerned), one must
      assume that the Princeton book was so "made up" that S1.6 was supplied from one copy and S2.5
      from another. This seems to be so highly improbable a hypothesis that <pb n="003.103"/> the
      first explanation for the presence of the off-set in the Princeton <hi rend="italic"
       >Fayttes</hi> appears the more acceptable.</p>
     <p>In conclusion, a word should (I think) be said on the subject of the origin of these two
      variant settings. In the case of the <hi rend="italic">Pilgrimage</hi>, of course, the sheet
      was reprinted in order to correct an error of imposition;<ref target="f003.05.18" n="18"><hi
        rend="super">18</hi></ref> a similar technical error<ref target="f003.05.19" n="19"><hi
        rend="super">19</hi></ref> occurs in the very first book credited to Caxton's
      press&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">Recuyell of the Histories of Troy</hi>, [Bruges, <hi
       rend="italic">circa</hi> 1475]. The cause for the reprint of sheet S2.5 in the <hi
       rend="italic">Fayttes</hi> is less obvious. It illustrates, however, a phenomenon previously
      noticed in several volumes printed by England's prototypographer. Since the second setting
      contains more misprints than the first, it was probably not called into being through a desire
      to improve the text. True enough, two glaring errors in the colophon were corrected by the
      second setting, but this improvement could have been achieved by simple stop-press corrections
      and certainly would not have required the resetting of four entire pages.<ref
       target="f003.05.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref> It seems likely that the reprinting
      was necessitated either because something happened in Caxton's workshop which required the
      resetting of sheet S2.5, or that Caxton failed to print the correct number of sheets to
      complete the copies in hand and was thus obliged to make good the deficiency after the
      original formes had been distributed.</p>
     <pb n="003.104"/>
     <p>One must, then, assume that the reprinting of sheet S2.5 was the result either of an
      accident in the printing office or of a short count when the sheet was being machined. If an
      accident necessitated the reprint, it is scarcely probable that this took place during the
      printing of the sheet since it would be an incredible coincidence for both inner and outer
      formes to "pie" at approximately the same stage in the course of production.<ref
       target="f003.05.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref> If sheet S2.5 was not reprinted
      because a short count made this necessary, one must believe that some accident took place at
      the press <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the full number of sheets had been printed and the
      formes distributed, for the loss of a sufficient number of sheets would have compelled Caxton
      to reset the text and supply the necessary number in a new setting. While this would be a
      perfectly reasonable explanation for the reprinting of sheet S2.5 in the <hi rend="italic"
       >Fayttes</hi>, one can only with difficulty credit a theory which assumes that Caxton
      permitted such accidents to happen again and again. There are reprinted sheets of precisely
      this sort in the <hi rend="italic">Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers</hi> (Duff 123), the
       <hi rend="italic">Morte d'Arthur</hi> (Duff 283), the <hi rend="italic">House of Fame</hi>
      (Duff 86), and probably elsewhere, for aught I know.<ref target="f003.05.22" n="22"><hi
        rend="super">22</hi></ref> Surely these could not all be the results of physical accidents.
      On the other hand, contemporary accounts prove beyond question that short printing was a
      common enough occurrence to be a source of annoyance and trouble to both printers and
      publishers. Neither of these explanations for the presence of the variant setting in the <hi
       rend="italic">Book of the Fayttes of Armes and of Chyvalrye</hi> is completely convincing,
      but if there be a more satisfactory one, it is not apparent to me.</p>

       setting of S2.5 because of the errors in the colophon (representing the printer's official
       statement) and that the incorrect sheets were withdrawn from the made-up copies and the new
       sheets substituted for those suppressed. Thus the off-set in the Princeton copy could have
       come from the first sheet S2.5 before the corrected one was substituted for it. However, this
       seems to me an untenable theory in view of the fact that only four copies of the second
       setting are known against the thirteen of the first. If Caxton reprinted and substituted
       sheet S2.5 in order to correct the colophon, one would (I should judge) expect the <hi
        rend="italic">majority</hi> of copies to have the second (official) setting and only the
       occasional (overlooked) example to preserve the original reading. If, however, extra sheets
       of the second setting of S2.5 were printed because of an original short count, it may be
       argued that these were substituted (because of the superior colophon) for sheets of the first
       setting to the extent that these correct sheets were available; this also would explain the
       presence of the "wrong" off-set in the Princeton copy. But one should observe that errors in
       the colophon did not seem to disturb Caxton unduly; note the many instances of such misprints
       cited by W. J. B. Crotch, <hi rend="italic">The Prologues and Epilogues of William
        Caxton</hi> (Early English Text Society, Original Series 176, 1928). Other Caxton editions
       with errors in the colophons include: <hi rend="italic">Ars moriendi</hi> (Duff 33), two <hi

       presses, one to print one forme and the other to perfect the sheets. In that case it is easy

     <p>FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE SEAT OF THE Przemysls, royal family of the Czechs, and, in the
      fourteenth century, simultaneously the capital of the Holy Roman Empire, Prague owes her
      reputation in the various branches of learning in large measure to the founding of her
      University in 1348. As a royal residence from the tenth until the beginning of the seventeenth
      century, the city contained a considerable number of libraries established by the religious
      orders, the Metropolitan Chapter, the University, and the nobility. With a single exception,
      the rich collections of old manuscripts and printed books which existed in an earlier day were
      sacrificed to the ravages of war and other vicissitudes and were not brought together again
      until much later. The greatest losses were sustained at the end of the Thirty Years War when
      the Swedes took with them as booty all sorts of objects of art as well as the main parts of
      the libraries, especially the famous Rosenberg Library, at the time of their invasions of
      Bohemia and Moravia. Investigations conducted in Prague libraries in recent years in
      connection with studies of decorated mediaeval bindings have revealed clearly lacunae which
      have arisen in this manner.</p>
     <p>The wealth of the city in book collections is obvious in the following list of libraries
      whose holdings were examined for this study: The University Library with the libraries of the
      Princes Lobkowitz, Prince Moritz von Lobkowitz from Raudnitz, the Convent of the Knights of
      Malta (Hospitallers), and the Benedictine monastery Emaus; the library of the National Museum;
      the <pb n="003.106"/> library and the Museum of Arts and Crafts; the library of the Municipal
      Archives; the library of Prince Kinsky; the library of Strahow monastery; the library of the
      Metropolitan Chapter; the libraries of the Augustine, Capuchin, and Franciscan monasteries;
      and the library of the Convent of the Red Star Crusaders. A systematic investigation covered
      manuscripts, incunabula, and imprints prior to 1530, insofar as their bindings were decorated
      with blind stamps. From subsequent periods up to the eighteenth century only those books were
      chosen which were once in the possession of well known persons or could be differentiated from
      ordinary library books in some way or another.</p>
     <p>In all, 3,020 volumes were studied, of which sixty-nine belong to the period after the
      Reformation. 1,705 volumes belong to the University Library; 448 to the Metropolitan Chapter;
      370 to Strahow monastery; 198 to the National Museum; eighty-four to the Augustines;
      seventy-nine to the Red Star Crusaders; fifty-nine to the Franciscans; thirty-two to the
      Capuchins; twenty-five to the Museum of Arts and Crafts; twelve to the Municipal Archives; and
      eight to the library of Prince Kinsky.</p>
     <p>The only library in Prague whose holdings go back to the time of its foundation and have not
      been diminished by wars, conflagrations, and other calamities is that of the Metropolitan
      Chapter. On the other hand, the famous library of Strahow monastery was not re-established
      until the second half of the seventeenth century, and virtually nothing remains of its
      original holdings. The provenance of the surviving portions of the oldest part of the library
      of Prince Moritz von Lobkowitz from Raudnitz may be traced to the founder, Bohuslaw Lobkowitz
      von Hassenstein, the greatest humanist of Bohemia. In the University Library there is also the
      former library of the Celestine monastery of Oybin near Zittau, dissolved in the sixteenth
      century and turned over at that time to the University Library in the Clementinum. Parts of
      the library of the Danish statesman Henrik von Rantzau are also preserved here, brought to
      Prague by Wallenstein after he had taken Rantzau's castle in Breitenburg near Itzehoe by storm
      in 1627.</p>
     <p>The oldest decorated binding in Prague adorns parchment manuscript A 133, a Latin psalter of
      the twelfth century, in the Metropolitan Chapter. Both covers, like the manuscript itself, <pb
       n="003.107"/> come from Paris and are reproduced by Podlaha.<ref target="f003.06.01" n="1"
        ><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> In addition, there is another parchment manuscript of about
      the same age, B 16;2, containing the <hi rend="italic">De libero arbitrio</hi> of Aurelius
      Augustinus, from the library of Johann Herttemberger de Cubito. Podlaha describes this
      manuscript on pages 162-165 of his study of the library of the Metropolitan Chapter, and he
      assigns it to the end of the twelfth century. The general aspects of the execution of the
      binding and the stamps identify it as contemporary with the manuscript, for it has the
      characteristic smooth spine with barely perceptible bands (two in this case) and thick covers
      common to Romanesque bindings. An additional characteristic that may be noted in Figs. 1-3 is
      the frequent use of stamps whose limits are not marked by special lines for this purpose. In
      contrast with Ms. A 133, richly decorated with fifteen different stamps of which half
      represent persons, only five ornamental forms are used (Fig. 1). The yellow leather binding is
      sparsely decorated. The rectangular middle field of the covers is enclosed by four frames, of
      which the second and the fourth (reckoned from the edge) are broader and set with stamps,
      while ribbon-shaped undecorated diagonals divide the middle. Each of the triangular areas
      formed by the diagonals is decorated with a single stamp. This arrangement of the rectangle is
      unusual, to judge from available illustrations of other Romanesque bindings. Two clasps
      closing towards the rear unite the two covers, which measure 198 mm. (height) by 142 mm.
      (breadth). Presumably the manuscript was bound in what was formerly German-speaking
      territory.</p>
     <p>The University Library also owns two parchment manuscripts whose Romanesque bindings, just
      as the preceding one, were hitherto unknown. The first, Ms. XIV G 48, which contains the <hi
       rend="italic">Summa Raymundi</hi>, is from the last quarter of the thirteenth century, while
      the second, Ms. XIV H 3, which contains G. Paraldus' <hi rend="italic">Tractatus de
       virtutibus</hi>, was probably written at the beginning of the fourteenth century. Their
      bindings, which are only decorated with a few stamps representing animals and flowers, are
      presumably contemporary with the manuscripts. Fig. 2 reproduces the stamps on Ms. XIV G 48.
      The edges of the boards, covered with brown leather, are consistently rounded to a smooth
      surface <pb n="003.108"/> on the front covers. Two clasps which once hooked into place on the
      back cover were removed in later times. The spine is similar to that of the preceding book
      except that there are three double bands. Three frames, of which only the middle one is broad
      and decorated, surround a rectangle that is divided into two parts by a vertical middle band.
      Both of the two narrow rectangular areas are decorated with a vertical row of stamps. This
      type of decoration, quite common at the time, is found, for example, in Plates III and IV of
      the late G. D. Hobson's essay on "Some Early Bindings and Binders' Tools."<ref
       target="f003.06.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> The dimensions of the covers are 200
      mm. by 130 mm. No definite evidence as to the provenance of the binding is available, since
      the stamps vary somewhat from previously identified forms. The five stamps depicted in Fig. 3
      are found on the binding of XIV H 3, a French manuscript. Since the first stamp also appears
      in quite similar form on the binding of Cod. CCXLII of the Landesbibliothek in Karlsruhe,<ref
       target="f003.06.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> it may be assumed that the book was
      bound in Paris. The boards are covered with red leather, and their edges are consistently
      rounded. Four clasps which once closed towards the rear and nine out of ten studs are lacking.
      The spine is distinctly rounded and reveals the well-defined forms of four double bands. This
      circumstance permits us to suppose that this binding was executed somewhat later than the two
      previously mentioned. On the front cover the rectangular middle area is surrounded by four
      frames, on the back cover by three, of which the first and the third (reckoned from the edge)
      are narrow and undecorated. The middle area of the front cover is divided in two parts by a
      vertical line drawn through the middle, while that of the back cover is divided by two
      vertical bands into three narrow rectangles, each of which is decorated by a row of stamps.
      The covers are 190 mm. by 132 mm. The rarity of these early decorated bindings, which have
      been repeatedly and exhaustively treated in the literature, is readily apparent from the fact
      that the latest study by Hobson<ref target="f003.06.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref>
      reveals only 106 identified volumes in all. The reason lies partially in the fact that in the
      early period the decoration of leather bindings probably consisted predominantly of blind
      lines and partially in that a <pb n="003.109"/> large proportion of these older manuscripts
      were rebound towards the end of the fifteenth century.</p>
     <p>Some hundred years after the latest Romanesque binding, parchment manuscript C 104 in the
      Metropolitan Chapter was bound and decorated with only two stamps. According to a manuscript
      entry, the binding was executed in 1404. The binder of this book, <hi rend="italic">De
       diversitate novitiorum</hi>, dated by Podlaha<ref target="f003.06.05" n="5"><hi rend="super"
        >5</hi></ref> in the beginning of the thirteenth century, identifies himself as Prior
      Martinus from an unknown Bohemian monastery. His name appears again as a purchaser in the two
      manuscripts VIII B 16 and III D 15 of the University Library together with a note indicating
      that he came from Wyschehrad, a sector of Prague, with the dates 1412 and 1410 respectively.
      In Ms. VIII B 16 it is also indicated that he was a prior at that time. The fact that parts of
      a parchment record from the Strahow monastery were used as the protective leaf preceding the
      first page at the front of both manuscripts may not be accepted as definitive proof that the
      monk belonged to this monastery. The following thirteen manuscripts in the University Library
      came from the same shop: IX A 4, XVII A 1, IV B 25, III C 1, V C 8, IX C 1, X C 6, I D 24, V D
      6, XIII D 22, I F 29, X G 16, IV H 2. All were probably bound in the first quarter of the
      fifteenth century by Prior Martin or one of his colleagues. As decoration for their covers ten
      different stamps are used, among which the two-tailed, crowned lion rampant in a rhomboid
      frame appears in two versions, the later of which is enclosed with lines. Bindings from this
      early period also are numbered among the rarities and have been described only in individual
      instances in the literature.</p>
     <p>From the second half of the fifteenth century on we have the period of the Gothic binding
      with its extraordinarily great wealth of stamp forms, going up into the thousands, and
      decorations. While the stamps probably were cut only by secular craftsmen, both secular and
      clerical craftsmen executed the bindings. But provenance from definite shops is still largely
      unknown today, partially because these binders almost never entered their name in a book and
      partially because they had no proper guild. Therefore, the search for bookbinders, especially
      in the tax lists, is extraordinarily difficult. Name stamps of the masters and the <pb
       n="003.110"/> monasteries or their arms, which were ordinarily used in only a few of the
      bindings, are also quite rare. Erfurt is an exception, and A. Rhein has listed the twenty-five
      names identified thus far.<ref target="f003.06.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref>
      Individual names, for example, Bartholom&auml;us, Jodocus, Severinus, etc., usually refer to
      saints. Further data on the characteristics of the decorated German binding may be found in
      Ernst Kyriss, "Der verzierte gotische Einband des deutschen Sprachgebietes."<ref
       target="f003.06.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref></p>
     <p>In dealing with such a large quantity of books as the some 3,000 volumes examined in Prague,
      only those which fall in certain well defined groups may be mentioned and designated by call
      number, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, (1) those for which the name of the binder or the
      location of the shop is perfectly clear, (2) those bound for a known patron, or (3) those
      whose bindings are superior to the great majority of ordinary bindings. As far as the imprint
      date usually given in the following notes is concerned, it should be observed that it is only
      an approximate indication of the date of the execution of the binding, since books are not
      necessarily bound at the time of printing or may be rebound years later. The earliest date
      means only that the activity of the shop did not begin before this time, and the latest means
      that it continued at least until that time. All references to dates in the following notes are
      made with these limitations on their significance.</p>
     <p>Many monasteries had their own binderies, in some of which hundreds of bindings were
      executed. Thus I have been able to assign 430 bindings to the Heilsbronn monastery<ref
       target="f003.06.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> and 768 to the Augustine monastery in

     <p>There were 707 bindings produced in thirty-seven Bohemian binderies, and twelve in seven
      Moravian binderies, but it has not been possible to ascertain the binder or the exact location
      of the shops. Seven groups, to each of which at least thirty volumes may be assigned, will be
      discussed later in detail together with 449 Bohemian bindings. From Augsburg and the
      surrounding territory 103 bindings from twenty-two shops could be identified. Sixty-one books
      were bound by fourteen Nuremberg binders whose names are not known. The intimate relations

     <p>766 bindings were the work of 225 unknown binders who operated in Germany, although the
      exact location of their shops has not yet been ascertained. From foreign countries, six French
      and seventy-six Italian bindings were identified. Bindings decorated with ribbons containing
      inscriptions in German may be listed among those which have been repeatedly discussed and
      reproduced in the literature, most recently by K. Holter.<ref target="f003.06.30" n="30"><hi
        rend="super">30</hi></ref> They are ascribed to Austria in the region between
      Kremsm&uuml;nster-Wilhering and Krems-G&uuml;ttweig during the period from 1460 to the
      beginning of the 1490s. Although Podlaha<ref target="f003.06.31" n="31"><hi rend="super"
        >31</hi></ref> reproduces the binding of Ms. D 6 of the Metropolitan Chapter in his Fig.
      190, Ms. I C 15 and Ms. VI G 4b of the University Library are noted here for the first time.
      With these two bindings the number of previously identified bindings with inscriptions on
      ribbons is increased to forty-two.</p>
     <p>Of the nineteen cuir-cisel&eacute; bindings Bollert<ref target="f003.06.32" n="32"><hi
        rend="super">32</hi></ref> has identified the following from the libraries of Prague: <q>
       University Library: Ms. III D 22 (Plates 10 and 11).<lb/> Lobkowitz-Raudnitz Library: Ms. VI
       Ea 1 (Plates 8 and 9).<lb/> National Museum: Ms. XV B 3 (Plate 14) and Ms. XVI C 10 (Plates
       12 and 13).<lb/> Municipal Archives: Ms Liber contractuum (Plates 16 and 17).<ref

      </q>
     </p>
     <p>Additional cuir-cisel&eacute; bindings identified by Podlaha<ref target="f003.06.34" n="34"
        ><hi rend="super">34</hi></ref> are in the <q>Metropolitan Chapter: Ms. A LXXIX 1 and C 5
       (Figs. 134 and 181) and Inc. C 62 (Plate IV in Podlaha's <hi rend="italic">Catalogus
        incunabulorum qu&oelig; in bibliotheca Capituli Metropolitani Pragensis
       asservantur</hi>).</q></p>
     <pb n="003.117"/>
     <p>The remaining eleven cuir-cisel&eacute; bindings are in the University Library (Ms. IX B 2,
      VII C 19, VIII C 5, VI D 19, Inc. 41 D 7, 41 F 12, and, in the Lobkowitz-Raudnitz Library,
      Inc. II Ab 19, II Da 25, IV Kb 22, VI Ba 23/1) and the Metropolitan Chapter (Inc. E 2). This
      volume was bound by B. Trnka, and the title "Decreta patr" is incised only on a cross strip at
      the upper edge of the front cover, whereas the remainder of the binding is decorated with
      individual stamps. The two rhomboid stamps, the crowned double eagle and the unicorn, indicate
      relations to the cuir-cisel&eacute; bindings described by H. Herbst<ref target="f003.06.35"
       n="35"><hi rend="super">35</hi></ref> and which appear in connection with the name stamp mair
      bb. The bindings are probably the work of several different artists of the cuir-cisel&eacute;.
      Mss. VII C 19, III D 22, and VI D 19 may be assigned to a shop dating from the beginning of
      the fifteenth century. Mss. IX B 2 and A LXXIX 1 belong to a somewhat later period. Inc. 41 F
      12, Ms. C 5, Ms. Liber contractuum, and the four volumes from Raudnitz date from the last
      quarter of the fifteenth century. Representations of musicians (Fig. 4), soldiers, school
      scenes, and animals in this last group undoubtedly make it one of the most interesting. The
      use of this technique on half-leather bindings is also unusual and unknown in the literature.
      The outer frame of the front cover of Inc. 41 D 7 contains the incised inscription "liber /
      domini / geor/gi plebani. The remaining bindings should probably be considered as individual
      jobs.</p>
     <p>Drawings on leather showing foliage forms are found in the University Library on Mss. VI A
      11, XVII C 22, VI F 10, and Inc. 39 A 39 as well as Ms. A 58 of the Metropolitan Chapter and
      XVI D 8 of the National Museum. The last book differs from the others in that here only the
      abbreviated two-line title "Bn&#x033E;hard<hi rend="super">9</hi> sr&vtilde;
      c&vtilde;c&vtilde; / c&amacr;tico&#x2643; appears on the upper edge of the front cover. It has
      been pointed out elsewhere that the rarity of books with the cuir-cisel&eacute; and drawing on
      leather may be ascribed to the manner of their execution.</p>
     <p>Two half-leather volumes from the first half of the sixteenth century may be considered
      unica. They are Inc. F 32 of the Metropolitan Chapter, depicted by Podlaha in Plate XII of his
      catalogue of incunabula in the Metropolitan Chapter, and Ms. XII D 4 of <pb n="003.118"/> the
      National Museum. On the upper edge of the front cover of both the title appears in three lines
      and is carved in wood. In the case of the second volume the title reads "prima.pars / speculi.
      sancto/ralis.1.5.2.2." (Fig. 5). The background of the inscription is blue. Fig. 5 also shows
      rubbings of the three rolls with which the cover was decorated, significant for showing the
      transition from Gothic to Renaissance styles.</p>
     <p>A more detailed consideration of the shops to which we may assign any large proportion of
      the books described thus far leads us first to the Celestine monastery of Oybin. Volumes which
      came from this monastery may be found in the following libraries: <q>University Library,
       twenty-seven manuscripts dated between 1434 and 1504: Ms. III A 1, A 4, IV A 10, A 20, X A
       18, IV B 4, V B 15, B 19, VIII B 13, IX B 7, III C 4, IV C 4, C 13, V C 16, IV D 11, D 23, IV
       E 7, E 15, X E 10, III F 17, V F 14, VIII F 19, XIV F 2, IV G 12, G 21, III H 2, X H 7, and
       twenty-six volumes printed between 1472 and 1515: Inc. 44 A 12, A 24, 44 B 14, 44 C 1 (four
       volumes, H 3175; 1, 3, 4, 7), C 10, 39 D 11, 40 D 18, D 19, 40 E 21, 42 E 10, E 11, 43 E 18,
       39 F 20, 42 F 38, 43 F 24, 44 F 35, 43 G 21, 44 G 17, G 38, 30 H 14, and 33 B 18, 34 B 85, 31
       E 16/2.</q>
      <q>Strahow monastery: twenty-two incunabula printed between 1474 and 1500: DM IV 30, DN III
       12, 13, 19, IV 2, 4, 17, V 17, 22, VI 31, DO II 21, 22, III 4, IV 6, 25, VI 14, DP III 13, VI
       23, DQ II 11, III 16, VII 14, DR I 6.</q></p>
     <p>These seventy-five volumes are decorated with thirty-four different stamps, of which the
      most frequently used are reproduced in Fig. 6. Characteristic for this monastery is the letter
      S in a square with a semi-circular elevation at the top. It is always impressed in a special
      place and in most instances between the crown with five points. The Bohemian lion also appears
      on a few volumes in the form of a shield. The inscribed ribbon "h.lucas" was encountered only
      twice. This shop operated from about 1472 until at least 1515.</p>
     <p>The following books of the Augustine monastery of Segeberg near L&uuml;beck came to Prague
      with the library of Heinrich von Rantzau: <q>University Library: Ms. XIV A 8 (two volumes),
       XIII C 8, VII E 17, IX F 10, XVI F 23, and thirteen volumes printed between 1483 and 1507:
       Inc. 44 B 15, 39 D 15, 44 D 3, 40 E 14, 44 E 4, E 42, 44 F 2, 42 G 15, 44 G 57, G 73, G 77, G
       79, and 9 A 30.</q>
      <q>Strahow monastery: Inc. DN VI 18 of 1486.</q></p>
     <pb n="003.119"/>
     <p>Of the twenty-eight stamps which appear on twenty volumes there is a roll of a foliate staff
      and a panel in pomegranate form as well as the letter m in a small rectangle. The active
      period of this bindery extended from about 1483 until 1507.</p>
     <p>Fifty-four early manuscripts were presumably rebound between 1478 and 1514 in the
      Premonstratensian monastery of Weissenau, located in Wuerttemberg between the mediaeval trade
      center Ravensburg and Lake Constance. The larger proportion has already been enumerated by P.
       Lehmann.<ref target="f003.06.36" n="36"><hi rend="super">36</hi></ref> While I was able to
      secure evidence of eighteen different stamps on ninety-seven bindings, only four were used
      here, among them a frequently employed roll showing a pair of dragons with their necks
      intertwined. This pictorial theme is not infrequently encountered on Gothic bindings of
      Southern Germany. With a single exception all of the manuscripts belong to the library of
      Lobkowitz-Raudnitz: Ms. 234, 241, 245, 247, 248, 266, 411, 422, 424-435, 437, 438, 440-442,
      444, 449, 469-472, 474, 476, 479-482, 484, 486, 488, 489, 494, 496, 499-501, 506, 508, 521,
      527, 528, 530, 539. In addition there is DA IV 42 from Strahow monastery.</p>
     <p>Of two binders who were residents of Prague, one was accustomed to signing his name on about
      half of his bindings with the stamp "bartholomeus," always in a special place. He was active
      between 1478 and 1489, and fifty-six volumes executed by him are in the following libraries:
       <q>Metropolitan Chapter: forty incunabula printed between 1478 and 1489: Ab 3, 15, 35, 46, B
       20, 25, 71, 86, 104, C 24, 30, 38, 44, 51, 53, 72, 77, D 1, 4-6, 18, 29, E 6, 15, 17, 18, 29,

      <q>University Library, ten incunabula printed between 1479 and 1489: 39 A 13, 40 A 17, 39 B
       32, 39 C 8, 40 C 27, 40 D 37, 40 E 32, 41 E 22, 40 F 9, 41 F 19.</q>

      <q>Red Star Crusaders: Inc. XVIII J 60, LXVI D 2 of 1484 and 1486.</q>
      <q>National Museum: Inc. 66 C 10 of 1486.</q>
      <q>Municipal Archives: Ms. 2212.</q> Of his twenty-five different stamps, the most commonly
      used are two versions of the Bohemian lion and the two-tailed mermaid.</p>
     <p>Half of the thirty-four volumes from the second binder are <pb n="003.120"/> decorated with
      the coat of arms of the city of Prague. His sixty-three stamps illustrate, <hi rend="italic"
       >inter alia</hi>, the double-headed heraldic eagle and the Bohemian lion, which, like the
      municipal arms, are present in different versions. There are also a mermaid and a shield with
      the unidentifiable initials C W. The books of this master are in the following libraries:
       <q>University Library: Ms. IV B 24, XVII A 11, H 26, and twelve incunabula printed between
       1487 and 1499: 41 C 28, 42 C 1, C 18, 42 D 12, 42 E 22, 43 E 19, 42 F 8, 44 F 45, 43 G 20, 44

      <q>Museum of Arts and Crafts: Inc. C 5335 of 1487.</q>
      <q>Municipal Archives: Ms. 2097.</q> This binder flourished between 1487 and 1499. In the
      interest of completeness, it should be noted that Prague's municipal arms appear on bindings
      in various forms during the subsequent centuries, a fact which may be verified by
      investigations in the Municipal Archives.</p>
     <p>It was probably in the first quarter of the sixteenth century that Rev. Bartholomeus Trnka
      of Krumau was active as a binder. In a parchment manuscript of the University Library, VI B 9,
      containing the <hi rend="italic">Martyrologium fratrum minorum</hi>, he advises that this book
      was rebound by him in 1527. A quatrefoil stamp surrounds a coat of arms with a wreath and four
      initialed semi-circles. The initials BT in the upper semi-circle are unquestionably an
      abbreviation of his name. Of the seventeen stamps identified thus far Fig. 7 shows the ones
      most frequently used. The following eighteen bindings from his shop are in four different
      libraries: <pb n="003.121"/>
      <q>University Library: Ms. VI B 9, XVII C 19, C 23, F 29, H 5, and Inc. 44 D 43, 41 E 21 of
       1499.</q>
      <q>Knights of Malta: IV B 61; 1, 4-6, 9 (five volumes) of 1506.</q>
      <q>Strahow monastery: Inc. DM VI 16, DP II 7, DQ II 6, of 1485 and 1486.</q>
      <q>Metropolitan Chapter: Inc. E 2 of 1489.</q>
      <q>National Museum: Ms. III H 28 and 71 D 19 of 1518.</q></p>
     <p>The binder of the Helia Ssech was also a resident of Bohemia. According to his own
      statements in the first volume of Inc. 65 A 3 (Cop. 6241) of the National Museum, he was an
      "administrator" in Leitomischl and a minister of the Gospel. In addition to initials and
      entwined borders, the first printed page contains two coats of arms illuminated with gold and
      colors. They also appear on some of his bindings in the same design but as a single stamp. One
      coat of arms consists of a two-pronged fork, the other of a simple cross. Presumably this
      binder was active between 1481 and 1494 as revealed by a study of nineteen of his bindings in
      the following libraries: <q>University Library: Ms. VI B 6, I D 27, XVII D 31, and Inc. 41 E
       27, 40 G 10, 41 G 51, 42 G 2, printed between 1484 and 1493, and 33 B 19.</q>
      <q>Strahow monastery: Inc. DN II 13, DQ III 19, V 19, V 20, printed between 1481 and 1489.</q>
      <q>Augustine monastery: Inc. N VI 121 of 1493.</q>
      <q>Franciscan monastery: Ms. Vf 29.</q>
      <q>National Museum: Inc. 65 A 3 (two volumes), 67 A 5, A 8, printed between 1482 and 1494.</q>
      <q>Municipal Archives: Inc. G 1451 of 1483.</q> The inscribed ribbon with the word "maria" in
      two versions and the four rhomboid symbols of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are found among
      the thirty-six different stamps.</p>
     <p>Two binders worked for Bohuslaw Lobkowitz von Hassenstein, probably in Komotau. The active
      period of the older one extends from 1475 to 1486, and thirty-four of his bindings are in the
      following libraries: <q>University Library: Ms. XVII B 6 and Inc. 44 C 35b of 1475.</q>
      <q>Lobkowitz-Raudnitz Library: Ms. VI Fe 39 and thirty incunabula printed between 1476 and
       1486: I Bc 2, Bd 1, II Ad 18, Db 24, Dc 17, III Gc 25, Lg 9, Ng 1, IV Fd 3, Gd 19, Gg 24, 29,
       Ka 30, Kb 3, Ma 1; 1, 2, 4 (three volumes), <pb n="003.122"/> Ma 4; 1-4 (four volumes), V Da
       5, Fa 51, VI Aa 2, Ba 13; 1, 22, 23; 3, 24, Ca 19, Cd 1.</q>
      <q>Franciscan monastery: Inc. Bg 7.</q> He had only fifteen stamps with which to decorate his
      bindings, among which are the rhomboid heraldic eagle in two versions and the lion
      rampant.</p>
     <p>The most productive Bohemian binder was the younger man with 171 identified bindings. Except
      for Inc. 43 D 8 and Lobkowitz II Ec 16 in the University Library, 73 D 6 in the National
      Museum, and Inc. C 1839 in the Museum of Arts and Crafts, all the books are from the Raudnitz
       Collection.<ref target="f003.06.39" n="39"><hi rend="super">39</hi></ref> Of the sixty-two
      stamps that he used there is one round stamp which shows a rhomboid field and a lion rampant
      on a shield divided into four parts. Of the twelve stamps which are used on at least
      one-seventh of the bindings, nine are reproduced in Fig. 8. The roof-shaped Gothic chain of
      tendrils appears in five forms. This binder, like his predecessor, and in contrast with the
      customary style of the time, bound his books almost exclusively in half-leather and arranged
      the clasps in the Italian style (reaching from the front cover to the back cover). His active
      period dates from the end of the fifteenth century until 1510, when his patron died.</p>
     <p>Among the individual stamps which are characteristic for the Bohemian shops are the
      two-tailed lion, which appears in numerous variations, as well as the otherwise rather unusual
      mermaid with two fish-tails. One binder, who is presumed to have worked in Wittingau between
      1474 and 1500, had among his forty-four different stamps (used on thirty-eight volumes) a
      small rectangular form with a group representing the Crucifixion and an inscribed ribbon with
      the name "ulricus". From the group the following bindings have been identified <q>University
       Library: Ms. I B 7, I C 34, XI C 1, XII D 4, I E 29, E 31, E 46, I F 38, <pb n="003.123"/>
       VIF 12b, VII F 25, XIV F 7, I G 22, and twenty-one incunabula printed between 1473 and 1500:

      <q>Museum of Arts and Crafts: Inc. C 6974 of 1488.</q> A peculiar characteristic of this
      master was his habit of frequently combining the stamps in broad, richly decorated transverses
      as the upper and lower limits of the covers (Fig. 9).</p>
     <p>Two other shops, of which fifty and seventy volumes respectively have been identified, may
      be dated at the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries and reveal a
      heavy dependence on Leipzig with respect to the forms of the stamps, the division of the
      covers of the books, and the use of at most five different stamps on a single book. The first
      binder had eleven stamps, among which were an ornamental open blossom, a roll and three
      roof-shaped Gothic chains of tendrils. His books are in the following libraries: <q>University
       Library: Inc. 41 A 2, B 12 (two volumes), 43 B 25, 41 D 4, 42 D 37, 43 G 28, 44 G 32, printed

     <p>The second master had seventeen stamps, among them a Gothic foliate staff designed in a
      negative image and five roof-shaped chains of tendrils. His books are in the following
      libraries: <q>University Library: twenty-two volumes with imprints ranging from 1483 to 1514:

     <p>The remaining portion of this essay deals with books which were once in the possession of
      well-known persons. It includes the period from the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries. The
      oldest volumes belonged to Johann von Kolowrat, a member of the old Bohemian noble family that
      appears as early as the beginning of the eleventh century. He was "administrator" of the
      archdiocese of Prague and died in 1483. Most of his books were richly illuminated in gold and
      other colors and adorned with his coat of arms. Pictures of these illuminations are reproduced
      by Podlaha in <hi rend="italic">Die Bibliothek des Metropolitankapitels</hi>, Figs. 294, 302,
      309-311. In Inc. Ab 42, C 50 and F 12 Kolowrat made a manuscript entry indicating that he had
      bought them in 1482. The Metropolitan Chapter has the following thirteen incunabula which
      belonged to him: A 1, Ab 42, B 12, C 50, E 6, 12, 14, 114, F 6, 7, 12, G 10, J 11; and Inc. 40
      A 7 of the University Library and Ms. XVI D 13 of the National Museum also were in his library
      originally.</p>
     <p>Of books which were once in the library of Canon Johann Herttemberger de Elbogen de Cubito
      the University Library owns Ms. A 79; 1 and Inc. 39 D 46, and the following thirteen volumes
      are in the Metropolitan Chapter: Ms. A 28; 2 (Podlaha <hi rend="italic">Die Bibliothek des
       Metropolitankapitels</hi>, Fig. 103), A 28; 3 (Podlaha, Fig. 105), A 73; 2, B 16; 2 (<hi
       rend="italic">supra</hi>), and Inc. B 25, 71, C 8, 30, 31, 37, 94, J 20, 56. Inc. C 8 bears a
      manuscript notation that it was bought in 1493, while Ms. A 73; 2 has a note that it was
      bought in 1495.</p>
     <p>Manuscript 418 of the library of the Princes Lobkowitz consists of medical treatises written
      in 1490 and 1491 by Dr. Ulrich Ellenbog in Memmingen, where he also had the book bound.
      Ellenbog was born around 1435 in Feldkirch and served, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>, as
      episcopal physician in Augsburg and personal physician of Archduke Sigismund of Tirol, and
      died in 1499 as municipal physician in Memmingen.</p>
     <p>The National Museum owns Inc. 66 A 7 (GW 3114), printed before 1473 in Strassburg and bound
      in Erfurt, originally in the library of Ellenbog's Nuremberg contemporary and colleague, Dr.
       <pb n="003.126"/> Hartmann Schedel (1440-1514). Schedel, a Nuremberg physician, was
      accustomed to identifying all his books with a red mark of ownership, usually inside of the
      front cover. The family coat of arms, designed around a Negro's head, was usually painted on
      the lower edge of the first written or printed page. Most of his library, which once consisted
      of more than 600 works, is a well known treasure of the Staatsbibliothek in Munich.
      Accordingly, it is quite unusual to find his books in other libraries. Schedel is famous above
      all for his <hi rend="italic">Weltchronik</hi>, printed in 1493 in Nuremberg in two editions
      with Latin and German texts and illustrated with almost 1,800 woodcuts, the most richly
      decorated printed book of the fifteenth century.</p>
     <p>A third great book collector was the Nuremberg jurist and humanist, Dr. Christoph Scheurl.
      In his case, too, only scattered examples of his books may be located in public libraries,
      since the collection remained in the ownership of the family. Scheurl was born in Nuremberg in
      1481 and died there in 1542. Inc. 42 D 35 of the University Library, containing three Venetian
      imprints of 1494 and 1495 (H 12220, HC 10824, and C 4555), is in an Italian binding and has an
      ownership notation dated 1500. In addition, on the inside of the front cover is the wood-cut
      bookplate Scheurl-Tucher (Warnecke no. 1896<ref target="f003.06.40" n="40"><hi rend="super"
        >40</hi></ref>), while that of Scheurl and his two sons is pasted on the inside of the back
      cover.</p>
     <p>The student Andreas Schwob of Freystadt left nine books, of which four are in the University
      Library (Inc. 41 C 14, D 15, G 5, 42 G 27) and five in Strahow monastery (Inc. DN IV 5, DO II
      14, VI 32, DQ III 1, 18). According to notes in his own hand, he bought them in 1490-1493
      while he was a student in the University of Leipzig. It may be assumed that Schwob studied
      theology, since the books contain fifteen theological treatises, one historical and one legal
      work. Such notes, rather uncommon in general, can give (<hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>)
      information about the locality in which the bindings were executed.</p>
     <p>Far out ahead of other sixteenth century collectors, Peter Vok von Rosenberg holds first
      place with the rich library collected at his estates in Bechin, Krumau, and Wittingau. When he
      died without issue at the age of seventy-three, all his property reverted to the crown. In
      1647 his books were transferred to Prague, <pb n="003.127"/> but in the next year they were
      sent to Sweden as booty of war.<ref target="f003.06.41" n="41"><hi rend="super">41</hi></ref>
      A book plate engraved by Aug. Sadeler in 1609 was executed in three different sizes and is
      used as the mark of ownership. In general the largest was used for folios (Warnecke, Plate
      XVI), and only in Ms. VII F 25 of the University Library could an example of the smallest be
      found. In spite of the sequestration, a hundred volumes could be found in Prague:
       <q>University Library: Forty-three manuscripts: I A 32, 35, 39, XIII A 1a, I B 7, 14, 25, 32,
       I C 10, 11, 34, 40, XI C 1, I D 16, 24, 30, 44, VI D 15, XII D 4, 14, XIII D 23, I E 5,
       29-31, 41, 46, I F 10, 21, 37, 38, VIF 12b, 20, VII F 25, XIV F 7, I G 12, 13, 22, XIII G 2,
       6, 10, 19, VIII H 54, and fifty-three incunabula: 39 A 18, 40 A 15, 39 B 21, 25, 40 B 1, 9,
       10, 13, 44 B 13, 40 C 2, 41 C 13, 21, 42 C 5, 44 C 4, 39 D 22, 27, 40 D 3, 17, 41 D 4, 43 D
       11, 44 D 4, 10, 11, 18, 39 E 10, 15, 41 E 7, 11, 26, 29, 42 E 21, 44 E 3, 26, 33, 38, 45, 55,
       39 F 9, 12, 40 F 7, 18, 41 F 16, 25, 42 F 41, 43 F 12, 13, 44 F 48, 63, 41 G 2b, 26, 39, 66,
       43 G 28.</q>
      <q>National Museum: Ms. XIV E 14, Inc. 66 C 1, 67 C 8.</q>
      <q>Capuchin monastery: Inc. N 33.</q> Moreover, fifty-six have the ownership mark of the
      Augustine monastery in Wittingau, nineteen that of the monastery in Borovany. The binding of
      the printed book 22 G 303 (1596) in the University Library has an oval panel stamp in black,
      fifty-nine mm. in height in the center of both the front and back covers. One panel reproduces
      the arms of Rosenberg with the numeral 1586, the other only a thirteen-line inscription within
      a frame (also inscribed).</p>
     <p>From the library of the older brother, Wilhelm von Rosenberg (died 1592), one volume has
      been located in the University Library and another in the Provincial Archives. On the front
      cover of both books his arms appear as a panel stamp, but in two different forms. The first
      book (54 B 13) is in the University Library and was printed in Bohemia in 1574, and the
      second, Ms. Wodnian 9, was bound in 1560 according to the stamped inscription.</p>
     <p>The University Library's 1544 imprint with call number 12 H 141 is identified by a coat of
      arms accompanied by an inscription on the front cover indicating that it was once the property
      of the president of the Prague Appelate Court, Johann von Hasenburg. <pb n="003.128"/> It may
      probably be dated in the middle of the sixteenth century.</p>
     <p>Printed books 19 C 92 of 1597 and 14 J 176 of 1551 in the same library have a bust of Tycho
      Brahe in an oval inscribed frame on the front cover and his coat of arms in black or gold
      impressions on the back cover. Both panels are reproduced by Bogeng<ref target="f003.06.42"
       n="42"><hi rend="super">42</hi></ref> in a form somewhat smaller than the original. The older
      book, Erasmus Reinholdus' <hi rend="italic">Prutenic&oelig; tabul&oelig; c&oelig;lestium
       motuum</hi>, is the presentation copy of the author to Counts Johann Georg and Johann Albert
      von Mansfeld, according to a manuscript note in red ink. Tycho himself has written in the
      volume that he bought it in Prague in 1601. Born in 1546 in Denmark, Tycho lived in his native
      land until 1597 and then spent the last four years of his life in Prague.</p>
     <p>The mark of ownership of the Danish statesman, historian, and wealthy art patron Henrik von
      Rantzau has been identified in eighteen volumes. From 1556 until his death in 1598 he was
      "Statthalter" of Slesvik-Holstein, and, as we have already noted, his books came to Prague as
      booty of war. Identified volumes are located in the following libraries: <q>University
       Library: Ms. XIV A 8 (two volumes), XIII C 12, IX F 10, XIV H 28, and Inc. 39 A 17 (two
       volumes), 44 B 15, 41 C 9, 43 E 23, 42 F 35, 43 F 4, 40, 42 G 15, 44 G 57 and 16 A 42, 24 B
       5.</q>
      <q>Strahow monastery: Inc. DO IV 19.</q> In addition to these early bindings decorated with
      single stamps, six additional ones from a later period have been identified on which the
      decoration consists of rolls and panel stamps. In the University Library there are 14 A 42, H
      13, 16 H 48, while the Knights of Malta owned C VI K 232; 6, 7, 9 (three volumes). Judging
      from the latter, Rantzau had four different panel stamps, two with his arms and the
      inscription "Heinrich Rantzau Stathalter" and two with the arms of his wife and different
      inscriptions. The smaller pair of panel stamps with the notation "Christinna von Halle" is
      described by Haebler.<ref target="f003.06.43" n="43"><hi rend="super">43</hi></ref> The larger
      panel stamps, used on 14 A 42, printed in 1572 and bought by Rantzau <figure entity="sb031281"/>

      <pb n="003.129"/> in 1574, vary from the others in the use of the numerical date 1572 in the
      panel of the man and in the use of the spelling "Christinae von Halle" (Fig. 10). In addition
      to the panel stamps, rolls with the initials G.V. are used (described by Haebler<ref
       target="f003.06.44" n="44"><hi rend="super">44</hi></ref>).</p>
     <p>Castiglione's <hi rend="italic">Il libro del cortegiano</hi> of 1541, shelved in the
      University Library as 13 J 114, represents the end of the sixteenth century. According to an
      inscription impressed in the center field of the rear cover, the richly gilded binding of
      brown leather drawn over cardboard covers was probably executed in Rome between 1541 and 1547
      for Apollonius Philaretus, the papal secretary. Its rarity was established by Hobson,<ref
       target="f003.06.45" n="45"><hi rend="super">45</hi></ref> who, although he dealt with this
      collector in detail, did not know this book. All in all, he could identify only nine bindings.
      The general execution and the decoration of the cover is similar to the one reproduced by
      Hobson as Plate 54.</p>
     <p>The two following centuries have produced only a few worth-while items for the University
      Library. The parchment-bound imprint of 1694 with the call number 5 J 62 comes from the
      collection of the old Bohemian noble family of Sternberg. A coat of arms within an oval laurel
      wreath with the inscription "Ignatius Carolus Comes de Sternberg" is impressed in gold in the
      center of the cover.</p>
     <p>A German book, C II D 58, from the first quarter of the eighteenth century, belongs to the
      Knights of Malta, and a Czech folio, 54 A 36, of the same period, belongs to the University
      Library. It is quite certain that both of them were printed and bound for the bibliophile
      Count Franz Anton von Sporck (born 1662). They are richly decorated with woodcuts, among which
      the baronial arms frequently appear. The coat of arms of the patron within a baroque frame is
      the sole decoration of the cover and appears in the form of a panel stamp 289 x 214 mm. in
      size. Another German book, <hi rend="italic">Die Tugend-Schule der Christen</hi>, a Prague
      imprint of 1715, is also preserved in a similar binding in the State Library in Eichst&auml;tt
      with call number Lit. N IV 160 (Fig. 11) and in the Library of the Landesgewerbemuseum in
      Stuttgart under No. 3822. Sporck was a patron of all fields of art. Among other projects, he
      maintained a theatre in Prague from his private <pb n="003.130"/> fortune, and Kilian Ignaz
      Dientzenhofer was one of his architects. In Kukus, his estate in north Bohemia, he established
      his own press. He died in Lissa in 1738.</p>
     <p>After this inspection of the treasures of the libraries of Prague, it may be stated that the
      Bohemian capital attained a high level of achievement in the narrow field of the book arts,
      and close relations with Germany have been noted. But the high competence of these craftsmen,
      designers, stamp cutters, and bookbinders only becomes apparent after a study of the fine
      craftsmanship and well handled materials in bindings which are hundreds of years old.</p>

    <div2 type="section" n="1">
     <p>FOR MOST OF SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS OF WHICH pre-folio quarto texts as well as the folio text
      itself exist, the relationship between Q and F has been determined.<ref target="f003.07.01"
       n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> About certain of the plays, however, some question
      remains. <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> is such a play. Two early printed
      editions of <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> exist: the quarto printed in 1609 by
      George Eld for the publishers Richard Bonion and Henry Walley, and the text in the first Folio
      published in 1623. Conclusive evidence as to the relationship of the Q and F texts has not
      been presented; it is the purpose of this article to offer new evidence that will establish,
      on a bibliographical basis, the textual relationship of the two extant early printed editions
      of the play.</p>
     <p>Serious study of the relationship of the Q and F texts of <hi rend="italic">Troilus and
       Cressida</hi> began with the work of the editors of <hi rend="italic">The Cambridge
       Shakespeare</hi> in 1865. W. G. Clark and W. A. Wright expressed a theory about the
      relationship that was widely accepted for the next fifty years: <q>The two texts differ in
       many single words: sometimes the difference is clearly owing to a clerical or typographical
       error, but in other cases it appears to result from deliberate correction, first by the
       author himself, and secondly by some less skillful hand. . . . On the whole we are of the
       opinion that the Quarto was printed from a transcript of the author's original MS.; that his
       MS. was afterwards revised and slightly altered by the author himself, and that before the
       first Folio was printed from it, it had been tampered with by another hand.<ref
        target="f003.07.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></q>
      <pb n="003.132"/> Charles Knight, however, in his edition of the play in 1875, offered a
      somewhat different theory: <q>From whatever secondary source it [the quarto] proceeded, there
       can be no doubt that it was printed from a genuine copy of the great poet. The slight
       variations between the text of the quarto and of the folio . . . sufficiently show that the
       original was most accurately printed. The alterations of the folio are not corrections of
       errors in the original, but, for the most part, slight changes in expression. We have no
       doubt that each text was printed from a different but genuine copy.<ref target="f003.07.03"
        n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref></q></p>
     <p>The only detailed study of the 1609 quarto in the nineteenth century was made by H. P.
      Stokes and appeared in his introduction of the Griggs facsimile of the quarto.<ref
       target="f003.07.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> He pointed out that "The Folio is
      careful to give a separate line to the commencement of <hi rend="italic">each speech</hi>;
      indeed this fondness for fresh lines is so great that if Q. by mistake has a new paragraph, F.
      is sure to 'say ditto'."<ref target="f003.07.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> But he
      then adds: "This [the stage directions] seems to suggest that the 'Troilus and Cressida' as it
      appears in the 1st Folio, was printed from the Theater copy."<ref target="f003.07.06" n="6"
        ><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref></p>
     <p>Appleton Morgan, in his preface to the Bankside edition of the play, wrote: "The variants in
      the quarto and folio texts (so carefully listed by Mr. Stokes) seem to me all chargeable to
      typographical sources . . . the later printer might easily have been responsible for them
       all."<ref target="f003.07.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> Nine years later, Sidney
      Lee stated that the editors of the folio "evinced distrust of the quarto by printing their
      text from a different copy."<ref target="f003.07.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> And
      in 1909, A. W. Pollard concluded that the quarto had not been used in the printing of the
       folio.<ref target="f003.07.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> Pollard's view, supported
      by J. Q. Adams,<ref target="f003.07.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> seems to have
      prevailed for the next twenty years, for in the Yale <pb n="003.133"/> edition, N. Burton
      Paradise states, "It is now believed that the Folio was printed from a manuscript belonging to
      the theater and the Quarto from a copy made for the private use of some friend of the
       actors."<ref target="f003.07.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref></p>
     <p>The first important work on <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> after Pollard was
      Peter Alexander's study of the quarto in 1928.<ref target="f003.07.12" n="12"><hi
        rend="super">12</hi></ref> In this article, Alexander differs with Pollard and comes to the
      conclusion that the folio text was printed from a copy of the quarto that had been corrected
      from a manuscript in the possession of Hemming and Condell.<ref target="f003.07.13" n="13"
        ><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> In the same year (1928), W. W. Greg had stated in a lecture
      before the British Academy that the folio text of <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi>
      was printed "not from the previous quarto text, but from an independent manuscript
      representing substantially the same version."<ref target="f003.07.14" n="14"><hi rend="super"
        >14</hi></ref></p>
     <p>Two years after Alexander's article, E. K. Chambers wrote that he was "inclined to think
      that F was set up from a copy of Q, not so much because of a few misreadings and abnormal
      spellings [Chambers must here refer to Alexander's article] which they have in common, since
      these might be derived from a common original, as because of a traceable resemblance in
      typography and the like."<ref target="f003.07.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref></p>
     <pb n="003.134"/>
     <p>In an attempt to refute the views of Alexander and Chambers, Dr. S. A. Tannenbaum published
      an extended textual study of <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> in 1934.<ref
       target="f003.07.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> Dr. Tannenbaum explained the
      similarities between Q and F (many of which he lists) by assuming that these were found in two
      manuscripts from which Q and F were independently printed, and, having listed certain
      corruptions in the F text, concludes: <q>Such absurdities serve to establish the facts that F
       was not printed from Q, was set up from a manuscript which was difficult to read (or that the
       copyist could not decipher his original), that the copies for Q [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]
       were prepared by different scribes, and that the F text, though better than Q's, is <hi
        rend="italic">not</hi> careful and was not authorized.<ref target="f003.07.17" n="17"><hi
         rend="super">17</hi></ref></q></p>
     <p>Reversing the opinion expressed in his British Academy lecture, W. W. Greg in 1939 came to
      support Alexander's view: "F appears to have actually been set up from a corrected copy of Q.
      I think there can be no doubt of this. Besides common errors and unusual spellings there are
      several points where the arrangement of F can only be explained by peculiarities in Q that the
      latter is unlikely to have taken over from its copy."<ref target="f003.07.18" n="18"><hi
        rend="super">18</hi></ref></p>
     <p>That the textual relationship of Q and F remains obscure is shown by the remarks of two
      recent editors of the play. G. L. Kittredge, in 1936, wrote: "The relation between the text of
      the Quarto and that of the Folio is not clear, but the differences are unimportant."<ref
       target="f003.07.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> And G. B. Harrison, the most recent
      editor of the play, states: "The quarto issued in 1609 is fairly well printed, but differs in
      many small points from the text printed in the folio. Each version contains short passages
      omitted by the other. From certain similarities in the setting of the two texts, it seems
      either that the folio text was printed from a copy of the quarto carefully but not uniformly
      corrected from a playhouse copy, or that both texts derive from a common original."<ref
       target="f003.07.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref></p>
     <pb n="003.135"/>
     <p>Although it is evident that since Alexander's article in 1928, the trend has, in general,
      been away from the view of Clark, Wright, Pollard, and Adams, the foregoing survey shows that
      there is still uncertainty about the relationship of Q and F. Until this relationship is
      settled, study of the text of <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> must rest on
      doubtful grounds.</p>
    </div2>
    <div2 type="section" n="2">
     <p>The problem of determining that one edition served as copy for a second edition has
      interested bibliographers for some time. R. B. McKerrow discusses the bibliographical evidence
      that can be used to determine the relationship of editions, his general conclusion being that
      the best proof of the relationship of two editions is the demonstration that the second
      edition reproduces abnormalities that had their origin in the shop where the first edition was
      printed: <q>. . . whenever he [the editor] comes across anything abnormal in the typographical
       arrangement of a text, it will generally pay him to consider whether this may be due to the
       blind following of an earlier edition.<ref target="f003.07.21" n="21"><hi rend="super"
         >21</hi></ref></q> Although no single piece of evidence that I shall now present can, in
      itself, be taken as indisputable proof that F was printed from a copy of Q, the cumulative
      effect of this evidence cannot, I think, be questioned: for this evidence demonstrates that F
      reproduces peculiarities found in Q that had their origin in George Eld's printing shop.
      Previous investigators have noted certain of the similarities between Q and F. As these
      similarities apparently have not been sufficient to clinch the relationship of Q and F, I
      shall confine myself to kinds of evidence that have not, for the most part, been previously
      considered.<ref target="f003.07.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref> This evidence will
      be drawn from (1) the use of roman and italic type, (2) speech-heading forms, and (3)
      significant spellings.</p>

     <p><hi rend="italic">Italic and Roman Type:</hi></p>
     <p>The fact that F agrees with Q in the use of italic or roman type when its use is dictated by
      the typographical conventions followed in each cannot, of course, be considered as evidence of
      their relationship; but when aberrancies in Q are reproduced in F, this agreement becomes
      significant. It is the normal practice in both Q and F to use italic type for proper names,
      both in the text and in the stage-directions. Exceptions to this general practice occur, in Q,
      and it is significant that F then reproduces the roman type used in Q:<ref target="f003.07.23"

      <hi rend="italic">Speech-headings:</hi>
     </p>
     <p>In the pre-1640 dramatic manuscripts that have survived, there is little consistency in the
      treatment of speech-headings save that they were written in the left margin of the page. In
      the manuscript of <hi rend="italic">John of Kent</hi>, speech-headings are invariably written
      out in full, and generally so in <hi rend="italic">Believe as Ye List</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">Ironsides</hi>; in other plays they are more often abbreviated.<ref
       target="f003.07.24" n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref> W. W. Greg, describing extant
      dramatic manuscripts, says: "Speakers' names are usually abbreviated, but the practice varies:
      Massinger tends to write them in full, while on some pages of <hi rend="italic">Thomas of
       Woodstock</hi> they are reduced to an initial. A scribe would often write a page of text
      first and add the speakers' names later: this tended to produce bad alinement, but ambiguity
      was generally avoided by the practice of drawing short lines on the left separating the
       speeches."<ref target="f003.07.25" n="25"><hi rend="super">25</hi></ref> In the three pages
      of the <hi rend="italic">Sir Thomas More</hi> manuscript written by Hand D, the thirteen
      speech-headings for the character Lincoln appear as follows: Lincolne, Linco, Linc, Lin, Lin,
      Lin, Linc, Linc, Linc, Linc, Lincolne, Lincolne, and Lincoln.</p>
     <p>I do not think the question has ever been specifically studied, but it is my impression that
      compositors attempted, consciously <pb n="003.138"/> or unconsciously, to normalize
      speech-headings. If the speech-headings in his copy were abbreviated fairly uniformly, the
      compositor would presumably follow his copy. If, however, the speech-headings were written out
      in full, or if they varied radically, the compositor would probably establish a norm
      abbreviation of his own, at least for the most frequently appearing speech-headings.<ref
       target="f003.07.26" n="26"><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref> An analysis of the speech-heading
      forms in <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> shows a tendency to normalize the
      abbreviations.</p>
     <p>In speech-headings Troilus' name is generally abbreviated in Q to <hi rend="italic"
       >Troy.</hi>, but there are exceptions. Between F1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and the bottom of
      F3, the form <hi rend="italic">Troy.</hi> appears seventeen times, but on F3<hi rend="super"
       >v</hi> the three speeches of Troilus are each prefixed with <hi rend="italic">Tro</hi>. On
      H1 we find the normal abbreviation <hi rend="italic">Troy.</hi>, but on the following two
      pages (H1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and H2) the abbreviation <hi rend="italic">Troyl.</hi> is
      used seven times. On H3 (Troilus does not have a speech on H2<hi rend="super">v</hi>) the
      shift is back to <hi rend="italic">Troy</hi>. On K3<hi rend="super">v</hi> and K4<hi
       rend="super">v</hi> we find the normal abbreviation <hi rend="italic">Troy.</hi> appearing
      seven times, but on K4, the form <hi rend="italic">Troyl.</hi> appears four times. Similar
      evidence of shifts at the end of the type-page is supplied by the speech-headings for
      Pandarus. On A4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, for example, we find the form <hi rend="italic"
       >Pand.</hi> used nine times, and the catch-word is <hi rend="italic">Pand.</hi>; but on B1
      there is a shift to <hi rend="italic">Pan.</hi>, which appears thirteen times. Similarly, the
      speech-headings for Hector are abbreviated <hi rend="italic">Hect.</hi> for his four speeches
      on L1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, but on L2 the shorter form <hi rend="italic">Hec.</hi> is used
      four times. On G3<hi rend="super">v</hi> the speech-heading for Thersites appears as <hi
       rend="italic">Thersi.</hi> (five times); but on the following page (G4) the form <hi
       rend="italic">Thers.</hi> appears eleven times. Other evidence of a similar nature can be
      drawn from the speech-headings of other characters.</p>
     <p>It will be noted that the shift in these speech-heading forms coincides with the end of the
      type-page. Now unless we are willing to believe that similar shifts occurred in the MS from
      which Q was set and that these shifts each time happened to coincide with the end of a
      type-page of Q, we must accept the fact that these shifts in speech-heading forms represent
      the tendency to normalize by the compositors of Q.<ref target="f003.07.27" n="27"><hi
        rend="super">27</hi></ref> In other words, the speech-headings <pb n="003.139"/> in Q cannot
       <hi rend="italic">all</hi> represent manuscript readings; for if we suppose that the Q forms
      reproduce manuscript readings, we must assume against all reason that these shifts in the
      manuscript coincided with the arbitrary (37 lines to a page) page division of Q. Such a
      hypothesis, involving such a chain of coincidences, seems to me to be untenable.</p>
     <p>Analysis of the speech-headings in F affords additional evidence that F was set from Q. We
      have seen that the variations in the forms of certain speech-headings in Q cannot represent
      readings found in the manuscript from which it was set. If, therefore, we find the
       compositors<ref target="f003.07.28" n="28"><hi rend="super">28</hi></ref> of F reproducing
      these variations, we shall have proof that F was set from Q. Although the folio compositors
      normalized speech-headings somewhat more uniformly than did the quarto compositors, there
      remains sufficient evidence to establish the relationship of the two texts.</p>
     <p>In the quarto, the speech-headings for Pandarus are normally abbreviated to either <hi
       rend="italic">Pan.</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pand</hi>. Both of the folio compositors
      generally normalize these speech-headings to <hi rend="italic">Pan</hi>. The following
      significant exceptions occur, with F reproducing the longer form found in Q: <table>

     <p>The speech-headings for Diomedes offer additional evidence that F was set from Q. The

      and ten times as <hi rend="italic">Diom</hi>. Eight of the ten cases in which the longer form
      is used in F reproduce the form found in Q.</p>
     <p>There is some confusion in the text of Q as to the spelling of <pb n="003.140"/> Calchas: it

     <p>In Q the Speech-heading for Ajax is sometines written out in full. In F it is usually
      abbreviated <hi rend="italic">Aia</hi>. F uses the longer form ten times, in each case
      reproducing the full form found in Q.</p>
     <p>And finally, the absence of a speech-heading in Q and F alike at II.iii.1 suggests that F
      was printed from Q. In Q, the first line on D4<hi rend="super">v</hi> is the centered
      stage-direction, <hi rend="italic">Enter</hi> Thersites <hi rend="italic">solus</hi>. His
      speech, indented but without speech-heading, begins on the following line. In F, the stage
      direction <hi rend="italic">Enter</hi> Thersites <hi rend="italic">solus</hi> is centered and
      the speech, indented but without speech-heading, begins on the following line.</p>
     <p>
      <hi rend="italic">Spellings:</hi>
     </p>
     <p>The fact that F reproduces a given spelling in Q cannot be considered evidence of the
      dependence of F upon Q. Such a single spelling, particularly if it were unusual, might
      represent a manuscript spelling independently reproduced in the two texts.<ref
       target="f003.07.29" n="29"><hi rend="super">29</hi></ref> But if F is independent of Q, we
      should not find F reproducing indiscriminate spelling variants found in Q; nor should we find
      F reproducing the characteristic spellings of the two compositors of Q. In two groups of
      words, F reproduces these indiscriminate variations; and in a third group, F reproduces the
      characteristic spelling of the two Q compositors.</p>
     <p>The use of final <hi rend="italic">ie</hi> for <hi rend="italic">y</hi> in polysyllables is
      not a characteristic spelling of the compositors of either Q or F. Seventy-two such <pb
       n="003.141"/> spellings, however, are found in Q; the compositors of F reproduce forty-six of
      these spellings. The explanation of these F spellings must be that the F compositors were
      influenced by their copy to depart from their normal spelling habits.<ref target="f003.07.30"
       n="30"><hi rend="super">30</hi></ref></p>
     <p>In Q, the exclamation 'Oh' is spelled indiscriminately 'O' and 'Oh.' In F, it is, with
      twenty-one exceptions, spelled 'O.'<ref target="f003.07.31" n="31"><hi rend="super"
       >31</hi></ref> Only seven times when Q has 'Oh' does F not reproduce the form; and only once
      does F use 'Oh' when the corresponding Q spelling is 'O.'</p>
     <p>Compositors A and B of the folio occasionally depart from their normal spelling habits.
      Compositor B, who normally spells <hi rend="italic">do</hi> and <hi rend="italic">go</hi>
      without a final <hi rend="italic">e</hi>, five times spells these words with a final <hi
       rend="italic">e</hi>. And Compositor A, who normally uses a final <hi rend="italic">e</hi>,
      thirteen times spells these words without the characteristic final <hi rend="italic">e</hi>.
      These exceptions to the characteristic spelling practices of the two F compositors furnish the
      most striking evidence of the relationship of Q and F. Seventeen of these eighteen exceptions
      reproduce spellings found in Q, and these Q spellings are characteristic spellings of the
      quarto compositors X and Y. In the following cases, we find the folio compositors reproducing
      significant Q spellings that are the peculiar spellings of compositors X and Y and cannot
      therefore <hi rend="italic">all</hi> have existed in any manuscript.</p>

     <p>The evidence presented here, supported by the evidence that previous investigators have
      brought to light, demonstrates, I hope, that F was indeed set up from a copy of Q. The
      implications of this fact may now be briefly considered.</p>
     <p>We can, first of all, define the authority of the two extant early printed editions of the
      play. W. W. Greg writes: <q>"In seeking to determine which is the most authoritative edition,
       an editor should distinguish between 'substantive' editions, namely those not derived as to
       essential character from any other extant edition, and 'derivative' editions, namely those
       derived, whether immediately or not and with or without minor intentional modification, from
       some other extant edition. It may be taken that the most authoritative edition will be a
       substantive one, but the distinction is in practice sometimes difficult to draw, so that this
       has less significance than at first appears."<ref target="f003.07.33" n="33"><hi rend="super"
         >33</hi></ref></q></p>
     <p>The 1609 quarto of <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> is a 'substantive' edition,
      and the 1623 folio text of <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> is a 'derivative'
      edition. But it is demonstrable that F is not wholly a derivative edition, for it has some
      thirty various lines that are not found in Q.<ref target="f003.07.34" n="34"><hi rend="super"
        >34</hi></ref> These lines are all clearly genuine and have been accepted as such by all
      editors. Since these lines were not in Q, from which F was set, they must have been supplied
      from some outside source, i.e. a manuscript.<ref target="f003.07.35" n="35"><hi rend="super"
        >35</hi></ref> This manuscript supplied not only the lines wanting in Q but also almost
      certainly some of the substantive variant readings found in F.<ref target="f003.07.36" n="36"
        ><hi rend="super">36</hi></ref> The folio text of <hi rend="italic">Troilus and
       Cressida</hi> must therefore be defined as a derivative edition containing some substantive
      readings emanating from an independent source.</p>
     <pb n="003.143"/>
     <p>But defining the authority of Q and F solves only the first of a series of problems
      confronting the editor of the play. He must next investigate the origin and nature of the
      manuscript behind the substantive readings in F, as well as the origin and nature of the
      manuscript from which Q was set; he should, however, make Q&mdash;the only substantive edition
      of the play&mdash;the copy-text for his edition. The use of F's variant readings, except to
      repair obvious corruption in Q, would be dependent on the editor's estimate of the nature and
      authority of the manuscript from which they come.<ref target="f003.07.37" n="37"><hi

       quarto ten "errors" found alike in both texts, and seven "readings, which, though not
       recognized as errors by Clark and Wright, are unlikely in independent texts" (pp. 269, 271).
       Mr. Alexander, as we shall see, is correct in believing that the folio text was printed from
       a copy of the quarto, but as E. K. Chambers implies (see below), he does not refute the
       possibility that these seventeen readings existed in the original manuscript or manuscripts

     <p>IN 1932 DR. E. E. WILLOUGHBY PUBLISHED, IN A now classic monograph, a reproduction and a
      brief discussion of the sole example of corrected proof for the First Folio of Shakespeare
      then known.<ref target="f003.08.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> The present writer

       target="f003.08.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> and an analysis of this, particularly
      in the light of evidence furnished by the other two, raises a number of questions about
      stop-press correction that may be of interest&mdash;and that seem to point to the soundness of
      certain conjectures that could heretofore be made only with great diffidence. Not that
      complete confidence is now possible: the new evidence is slight and rather slippery&mdash;but
      all the more interesting, perhaps, for this very reason.</p>
     <p>The first of our three concrete examples of First-Folio proof-reading occurs in an isolated
      leaf upon which are printed two pages of <hi rend="italic">Anthony and Cleopatra</hi>. One
      side of this leaf shows the uncorrected state of page 352 (xx6<hi rend="super">v</hi>) of the
      First Folio text. This page is clearly marked with a proof-reader's corrections, and these
      corrections, and these only, are the ones embraced in the text <pb n="003.146"/> presented by
      most of the surviving copies of the book. Quite probably, as is strongly suggested by both our
      other examples, this single leaf was once a part of a complete First Folio. Otherwise its
      chances of survival would have been extremely poor; and it is known to have been discovered in
      the 19th century "in a parcel of fragments of the First Folio"<ref target="f003.08.04" n="4"
        ><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> (which seems more likely to mean in a group of leaves from
       <hi rend="italic">a</hi> First Folio than, for instance, in a bundle of printer's waste from
      Jaggard's shop). In any event the surviving leaf is certainly only a part of what once was a
      full sheet. But what the other leaf of the sheet looked like&mdash;whether or not page 341
       (XXI<hi rend="super">r</hi>), the conjugate forme-page of page 352 (XX6<hi rend="super"
       >v</hi>), also contained a proof-reader's corrections&mdash;this, unfortunately, we cannot
      say. The question, however, is not so idle as it may at first seem, for it is basically a
      question about proofing methods, methods of which we would gladly know much more than we do,
      and about which our other examples appear to have something to teach us.</p>
     <p>The proof-sheet first fully described in 1942 is to be found in the Jonas copy of the First
      Folio, No. 47 in the Folger collection. Forme VV3<hi rend="super">r</hi>:4<hi rend="super"
       >v</hi> (pages 333 and 336, in <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>) is in the uncorrected state.
      Page 333 shows, in what is apparently the same hand and the same ink as the marks in the <hi
       rend="italic">Anthony and Cleopatra</hi> page, the proof-reader's marks that resulted in the
      corrected state of this page. <hi rend="italic">The conjugate forme-page 336, however, is
       unmarked</hi>.</p>
     <p>Another First Folio in the Folger collection (No. 48, once the W. T. Spencer copy) provides
      our new evidence, this time in a section of the book involving two further tragedies, <hi
       rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>. Page 281 (qq1<hi rend="super"
       >r</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>) presents a special problem, to be considered later
      in this paper. Let us first look at the conjugate forme-page 292 (qq6<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
      in <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>). Here, in what seem again the same hand and ink as before,<ref
       target="f003.08.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> a third set<ref target="f003.08.06"
       n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> of proof-reader's corrections appears. (See Plate I.) The
      changes called for are not numerous&mdash;only five in all. These changes were all made, and
      must have been made, indeed, before any large number of uncorrected <pb n="003.147"/> states
      had been printed off: 76 of the 82 copies examined (or about 92.7%) show the corrected state
      of this page (as in Plate II); only 6, including the copy with the proof-reader's marks, (or
      about 7.3%) were printed before correction was effected. The variant pairs are given below.
      (Positions are identified as to column within the page and line number within the column. The
      additional references in parentheses are to act, scene, and line in the Globe edition of <hi
       rend="italic">King Lear</hi>. The uncorrected readings, which can easily be examined further
      in the Lee facsimile, where no proof-reader's cancellations obscure them, are given
      first.)</p>

     <p>It may be noted of these variants that the earlier state is in every case wrong, but that
      correction in no case implies reference to copy. The errors are all patently compositorial,
      with the possible but improbable exception of "holly" for "holy" in <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
      46. Neither word appears in the quarto text and one or the other must rest on the authority of
      some manuscript.<ref target="f003.08.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> But even if the
      earlier Folio reading accurately reproduces the copy for the Folio print, both the error and
      the correct reading are sufficiently obvious to be recognized by the proof-reader
      independently of any other "authority." We may also observe of this variant that the
      correction was not faultlessly effected, since the space-quad added after "cords" to
      compensate for the lost "l" was not properly pushed down and so took ink. There is, perhaps,
      nothing very surprising in the fact that the correction of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 21 not
      merely removed the faulty setting after "that", the only thing in the line that was marked by
      the reader, but also resulted in improved spacing before <pb n="003.148"/> "he": the wider
      spacing here is an evident consequence of reducing the space between "that" and "strikes". Yet
      it is clear that the correction called for could more easily have been made otherwise, without
      disturbing so much type, and that the compositor who effected the required change was
      interested in producing generally well-spaced lines when possible; that, in short, some
      attention was paid to typographical refinement. And this is also shown by 2 (despite the
      inking space-quad) and by 5, though in this instance it is the proof-reader rather than the
      compositor who is responsible for a minor improvement&mdash;an improvement remarkable for its
      very triviality. Between this kind of thing and a serious and sustained concern for textual
      accuracy, however, there remains a very wide gulf.<ref target="f003.08.08" n="8"><hi
        rend="super">8</hi></ref></p>
     <p>Page 281 (qq1<hi rend="super">r</hi>, the conjugate forme-page of 292) presents a special
      problem because it obliges us to define <hi rend="italic">variant</hi> somewhat more narrowly
      than heretofore. A collation of 80 copies of this page reveals no variants in the sense either
      of verbal differences or of differences in spelling, punctuation, capitalization, or the like.
      Yet the page seems nevertheless to have been proof-read; for a minor typographical
      imperfection, although of a kind to which <hi rend="italic">we</hi> ordinarily have paid very
      scant heed, appears to have been corrected in it, and corrected at the same time as the five
      small errors in page 292 listed above. The facts are these. In <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 33 on
      page 281 (corresponding to V, ii, 358, in the Globe <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>) the last
      two letters of "thee" for some reason stood so high in the original setting that, whereas
      these two letters seem very heavily inked in the printed page, the "h" seems lightly inked and
      the right-hand part of it is barely perceptible (see Plate III&mdash;or the Lee facsimile).
      The word so appears in all 6 of the copies which show the uncorrected state of page 292. In
      all <hi rend="italic">but one</hi> of the 74 others which show corrected page 292 all four
      letters of the "thee" in page 281 are uniformly inked (see Plate IV for a random example). The
      one exception is provided by Folger copy No. 40, which shows the corrected state of page 292
      but the ill-printed "thee" in page 281. This, however, is surely the exception that proves the
      rule. For close examination demonstrates that the two leaves in question are <hi rend="italic"
       >not in this copy conjugate</hi>, as is perhaps most readily shown by <pb n="003.149"/> the
      fact that both qq1 and qq6 here bear a watermark: Folger No. 40 is clearly a "made-up" First
      Folio.</p>
     <p>The absolute constancy of the relationship between the two settings of "thee" in page 281
      and the two patently variant states of the text in page 292 clearly indicates that the changes
      in both pages came about at the same time, after the single unlocking for correction to which
      we know the forme was subject; and if all of these changes were intentional, it follows
      inevitably that page 281, no less than page 292, presents us with truly variant states that
      are the result of proof-reading. For we must certainly accept the principle that whenever a
      text is deliberately changed in the course of its transmission, genuine, if not always
      "substantive," variants are produced. "But how," it may be objected, "can we know that the
      change in page 281 was intentional? Obviously enough the crucial issue is not the relative
      triviality of the difference between two supposed 'states' but whether human volition can
      properly be adduced to account for this difference; and what is there to make us suppose
      direct human agency here responsible?"</p>
     <p>Unhappily, page 281 does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> show any sign of the proof-reader's mark
      that would resolve this difficulty. The suggestion presents itself, moreover, that the two
      insufficiently pushed-down types in page 281 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 33 might just possibly
      have assumed their proper places, as it were by accident, when the forme was loosened by the
      unlocking required for the correction of the errors in page 292. Such an explanation, however,
      will hardly do. It is initially unsatisfactory, especially in the light of the extreme
      unevenness of the "thee" in the 6 copies here considered uncorrected. Are such completely even
      impressions as we find in the 73 corrected copies likely to be the accidental result of work
      on the other page of the forme? How are we then to explain, if even impressions are thus
      easily and unintentionally produced, the unevenness in the stage direction "<hi rend="italic"
       >Enter Osricke</hi>." a few lines farther along in page 281? Here the "<hi rend="italic"
       >c</hi>" was somewhat high in the original setting, so that the preceding "<hi rend="italic"
       >i</hi>" inked poorly; and approximately the same unevenness appears to be characteristic of
      all copies. And the same thing is true of the "cracke a Noble heart" about ten lines below,
      where the consecutive letters "e a N" were a little high and therefore seem overinked, though
      in slightly different degree&mdash;in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> copies. Only in <hi
       rend="italic">b</hi> 33, then, does unevenness give way to perfect <pb n="003.150"/>
      regularity of impression. The difference is fairly extreme and the change occurred, not
      gradually, but at once; and it occurred at a time when five other small changes were
      introduced elsewhere in the forme, demonstrably as a result of proof-reading. The change in
      question is not likely to have been accidental, as other evidence from nearby lines indicates.
      Deliberate alteration as a result of proof-reading seems the only reasonable explanation.<ref
       target="f003.08.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></p>
     <p>If then we are obliged to assume that page 281 was proof-read, why does it not show, like
      its conjugate forme-page, the proof-reader's marks? Probably for the very simple reason that
      the proof-reader, unlike the pressmen, considered the single page, rather than the two-page
      forme, his basic working unit. The peculiarities of another pair of conjugate forme-pages, 333
      and 336, in <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, will perhaps now be recalled. Both pages exist in
      two clearly distinguished states, although only a single correction was made in page 336; and
      the corrected and uncorrected states of the one page are invariably found paired with the
      corresponding states of the other. In the Jonas copy, moreover, page 333 carries the
      proof-reader's corrections; <hi rend="italic">but page 336 is unmarked</hi>. "The most
      satisfactory explanation of these facts," it was suggested in 1942, "seems to be that the
      proof-reader handed his corrections to the compositor as soon as he had read one page of an
      impression taken from the forme for proofing purposes, and then used another impression as
      proof for the second page. Such a procedure is entirely plausible, since it would obviously
      save considerable time. (It is also possible, of course, that an impression from the
      uncorrected forme was given to each of two proof-readers and that one read p. 333 while the
      other was reading p. 336. This method would also save valuable time; but there is no need to
      postulate an additional workman.) We are doubly unfortunate, therefore, in that the <pb
       n="003.151"/>
      <hi rend="italic">Anthony</hi> proof-sheet is fragmentary. Since it represents only half of a
      two-page forme . . . it can provide us with no further basis for conjecture as to how commonly
      the method that seems to have been used in the proofing of VV4<hi rend="super">v</hi>:3<hi
       rend="super">r</hi> was employed elsewhere during the printing of the Folio."<ref
       target="f003.08.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref></p>
     <p>Now, however, we have new evidence. For in pages 281 and 292 of the Spencer copy we appear
      to find precisely the same peculiarities as in pages 333 and 336 of the Jonas copy. And hence
      we may conclude that, at least some of the time and when dealing with that portion of the
      First Folio that includes <hi rend="italic">Hamlet, Lear, Othello</hi>, and (probably) <hi
       rend="italic">Anthony and Cleopatra</hi>, the proof-reader returned a sheet after correcting
      only one of its pages. Presumably &mdash;for only thus would such a practice effect real
      gains&mdash;he then proceeded to correct the other page in another copy of the full sheet. The
      required alterations could by this means be begun sooner than otherwise; and by the time these
      changes had been made in the first type-page the reader would be able to return his second
      proof-page, suitably marked for immediate correction.</p>
     <p>Whether or not this practice was the usual one throughout the printing of the First Folio,
      and perhaps of a great many other books of the period as well, we still cannot say with
      assurance; but certain suggestions present themselves. Probably it would not be an efficient
      method whenever large numbers of errors were likely to be encountered (so that the <hi
       rend="italic">second</hi> proof-page might not be marked and ready as soon as required); nor
      is it a method that would ever be employed when the reader contemplated a careful comparison
      of proof-page and copy, since really conscientious proofing of this kind would certainly
      require much more time than a rapid reading of which the primary intent was merely the
      elimination of obvious typographical error.<ref target="f003.08.11" n="11"><hi rend="super"
        >11</hi></ref></p>
     <p>The implications of this last consideration are obviously of some moment; and although the
      subject cannot here be farther <pb n="003.152"/> pursued, at least one of these implications
      may be mentioned. If the stop-press variants in the First Folio, which we now have good reason
      to believe very abundant, were ordinarily the product of a method which itself precluded
      correction by reference to copy, it follows that we should be particularly interested in the
      readings of the various formes that make up the volume <hi rend="italic">before</hi> these
      were subjected to a process of arbitrary sophistication. Many of the First Folio's variants
      will no doubt be found to involve only the "accidentals" of which Dr. Greg speaks elsewhere in
      the present volume and to which less interest usually attaches than to "substantives." But
      substantives too there will unquestionably be; and a careful attention to the <hi
       rend="italic">un</hi>corrected members of variant substantive pairs may sometimes enable us
      to get closer to what Shakespeare himself wrote than the corrected readings that are but the
      swift guesses of a printing-house reader who seems to have been more concerned with the
      appearance than with the accuracy of the Folio text. It is still, of course, imprudent to
      generalize too widely about the press-correction method, or methods, employed during the
      printing of the First Folio; but all of the evidence so far available certainly indicates the
      customary use of the none-too-rigorous method described above.</p>
     <p>The examination of forme qq1<hi rend="super">r</hi>:6<hi rend="super">v</hi> throughout the
      entire Folger collection of First Folios brings to light one further and rather surprising
      fact that may also, finally, be recorded here. In addition to Folger No. 48, the copy which
      carries the proof-reader's mark on page 292, the copies showing the uncorrected state of the
      forme are Folger Nos. 15, 31, 47, and 69; and the Lee facsimile reveals that the
      Chatsworth-Devonshire copy is also uncorrected in this forme. (Folger No. 40, clearly a "made
      up" copy in which the two leaves in question are not conjugate, is uncorrected in page 292
      only.) And now let us once more recall forme VV3<hi rend="super">r</hi>:4<hi rend="super"
       >v</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>. The uncorrected state of this forme is found in
      Folger Nos. 15, 31, 47, and 69; and the Lee facsimile also shows the uncorrected state. In
      short, except that qq1<hi rend="super">r</hi>:6<hi rend="super">v</hi> is also uncorrected in
      No. 48 and in one page of made-up No. 40, <hi rend="italic">the very same copies and no
       others</hi> are uncorrected in two different formes&mdash;and in two formes, one involving
       <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>, the other <hi rend="italic"
       >Othello</hi>, that cannot have been dealt with consecutively in Jaggard's printing-house.

       and of <hi rend="italic">Anthony and Cleopatra</hi>) throughout the entire Folger collection
       of 79 First Folios. The work was done with mechanical aid made possible by a generous grant
       from the Old Dominion Foundation. Among the numerous variants that my "machine" turned up was
       abundant evidence that the proof-reader was constantly at pains to correct minor
       typographical infelicities&mdash;including space-quads taking ink (however slightly) and <hi

       uncorrected states, or probably rather less than half an hour's work by an uninterrupted
       press. To remove a forme from the press, to unlock it and correct one of its type-pages,
       would presumably take only about the same time, at most. But even if it took slightly longer,

     <p>THE MANY EXTANT AND READILY ACCESSIBLE books signed by the printer Thomas Newcomb afford a
      particularly good starting point in the large and tantalizingly complicated study of printers'
      ornaments in the Commonwealth and Post-Restoration periods.</p>
     <p>Newcomb was active as a printer for thirty-three years: he was the master of a large
      printing shop, and after the great fire became one of a handful of men who dominated London
      printing. Newcomb owned and employed a large assortment of ornaments which have a history of
      use totaling approximately fifty years, if one counts that group in use ten years before
      Newcomb acquired it and those which Newcomb's son used for at least seven years after his
      father's death. Finally, Newcomb printed well over a thousand items, a large number of them
      for the patentees of the King's Printing Office, but an even greater number for more than a
      score of stationers, including Henry Herringman, the foremost publisher of belles lettres in
      Post-Restoration London. Hence, one finds few prominent writers of history, science, theology,
      or literature in the last half of the century who had not had one or more compositions run off
      Newcomb's presses.</p>
     <p>Obviously a definitive study of the many ornaments in Newcomb's thousand or more
      publications must await first the appearance of Mr. Wing's <hi rend="italic">Short-Title
       Catalogue . . . 1641-1700</hi>, Volume III, and then the labors of other students. In this
      paper I attempt only to summarize the history of transmission of ornaments owned by Newcomb,
      to set down my observations on how ornaments were used in Newcomb-printed books, to offer some
      suggestions <pb n="003.156"/> to those obliged to work with Newcomb ornaments, and, finally,
      to introduce bibliographers to what I believe is a fair sampling of Newcomb ornaments,
      factotums, and decorative initials, with an accompanying list of their occurrences.</p>
     <p>The history of a portion of the ornaments used by Newcomb begins in 1638<ref
       target="f003.09.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> with the emergence of John Raworth as
      a London printer. I have examined far fewer of his publications than those of Newcomb, but my
      impression is that his ornament stock was a good-sized one. He owned a wide variety of
      decorative initials and many large, generally attractive ornaments; he preferred initials to
      factotums, and used both the initials and ornaments generously, especially in folios. The
      clearness and completeness of impression which many of his ornaments make would suggest that
      the bulk of his stock was newly purchased rather than bought up from some other printer. This
      observation is of course only conjectural. I have not tried to trace Raworth's ornaments in
      the books of earlier printers.<ref target="f003.09.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
     <p>Raworth's career as a printer was cut short by his death late in July of 1646. The
      uninterrupted flow of religious pamphlets from the Raworth presses indicates, however, that
      John's widow, Ruth, assumed charge of operations at once. Her activity as a printer extends to
      1648 when she married Thomas Newcomb, who had just become free of the Stationers' Company
      after serving a seven years' apprenticeship under Gregory Dexter.<ref target="f003.09.03"
       n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> Throughout her brief career Ruth Raworth used the
      ornaments at hand in her shop, and since the kinds of books she printed made no extraordinary
      demands on her ornament supply, the likelihood is that she added few or no ornaments to her
      late husband's collection.</p>
     <p>Once Newcomb had married Ruth Raworth, he seems to have taken over the direction of her
      shop, located on Thames Street <pb n="003.157"/> over against Baynard's Castle, where he
      remained until September of 1666 when the London fire destroyed his place of business and
      obliged him to seek new quarters west of the old city in the Savoy. Newcomb used enough
      Raworth decorations after 1666 for one to determine that Newcomb had saved his ornament
      collection from the flames, but after his removal to the Savoy he no longer relied on his old
      stock as he had done in the past. He continued to use the old Raworth ornaments, his
      compositors overworking a favored few until they were caked with ink and badly worn. But he
      replaced his Raworth factotums and a number of the old decorative initial sets with new ones,
      almost always bearing flower designs. These floral decorations Newcomb used with such
      consistency thereafter that more than any other feature of his presswork they especially
      characterize the books printed by him during the last thirteen years of his career. The study
      of Newcomb's decorations falls roughly, therefore, into two divisions: the years 1648 to 1667
      when Newcomb used Raworth's stock almost exclusively, and the years 1668 to 1681 when he
      employed Raworth's collection in combination with his own.</p>
     <p>Newcomb died suddenly on December 26, 1681, as one ardent conventicleer would have it,
      struck down by God in the king's presence for hating protestant dissenters.<ref
       target="f003.09.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> His printing equipment, including his
      ornaments, and his patent rights in the King's Printing Office were inherited by his only son,
      Thomas Newcomb, Jr., also free of the Stationers' Company, who remained active as a printer in
      the Savoy until July, 1688, when Edward Jones moved into the Savoy and took over the printing
      of the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi>. Whether the son ceased printing at this point or
      set up shop elsewhere and continued actively in his trade is difficult to ascertain.<ref
       target="f003.09.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> There is no question about the fact
      that he managed, despite the political upheaval, to maintain the right to publish some types
      of official documents and that he, his executrix, and his assigns continued exercising those
      rights well into the eighteenth century.</p>
     <p>Equally difficult to determine is when Thomas Newcomb, Jr., <pb n="003.158"/> disposed of
      his ornaments and to whom he sold them. One of Newcomb's factotums appearing in Dryden's <hi
       rend="italic">All For Love</hi> (1692) printed by Edward Jones suggests that either in 1688
      or after Newcomb's death Jones got hold of some of Newcomb's stock. The appearance of two
      well-known Newcomb ornaments in John Macock's printing of Cowley's <hi rend="italic"
       >Works</hi> dated 1688 but advertised in the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi> as early
      as December 15, 1687, poses a problem which further research alone can solve.<ref
       target="f003.09.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> The evidence pointing to a
      disturbance in the printing activities of Thomas Newcomb, Jr., about the year 1688 is
      sufficient, however, to warrant the conclusion that after 1687 one cannot use Newcomb
      ornaments to identify with certainty the printer of an unsigned book.</p>

    <div2 type="section" n="2">
     <p>From the outset of his career Thomas Newcomb was associated with a comparatively large and
      well established printing house, which grew even larger as he prospered in his trade. The
      observations which one formulates, therefore, on how ornaments were used in Newcomb-printed
      books can only be those reflecting the general policy of his shop, and not a list of
      typographical idiosyncrasies of the master himself. The practice of Newcomb's compositors in
      handling book decorations compared with that of the printing houses of several of his
      contemporaries indicates, however, that Newcomb's practice was in almost every respect
      typical.</p>
     <p>During the Interregnum and the early years of the Restoration Newcomb tended, like the other
      printers of that day, to use more ornaments and initials throughout the text of his octavos
      and quartos than he did in the late 1660's and 1670's. His folios were generally his most
      elaborately ornamented volumes, although he seldom decorated them so lavishly as did his
      predecessor Raworth.</p>
     <p>From 1667 to 1675 Newcomb used few ornaments in his smaller formats and only a sprinkling of
      initials and factotums throughout the text. The ornamentation in his play quartos was confined
      entirely to the initial gatherings: a headpiece and initial or factotum on the recto of the
      second leaf which was usually reserved <pb n="003.159"/> for the dedication; a headpiece on
      the first page of the preface, if one followed; and a headpiece or initial decoration, seldom
      both, on the first page of the text.</p>
     <p>After 1675 he used even less ornamentation in his play quartos than he had before that date,
      reaching a point finally about 1679 when he omitted it altogether. In this omission he was
      only following the practice of his fellow London printers, many of whom had been turning out
      ornament-less play quartos since the early 1670's. In attempting to identify the printers of
      unsigned quarto plays published in 1679 or thereafter for the next thirty years, the
      bibliographer finds a knowledge of printers' ornaments practically valueless.</p>
     <p>In the many normal and oversized folios issuing from his presses, one finds Newcomb's most
      elaborate book decorations. As a rule printers generally tended to pay deference to their
      folio ornamentation. Newcomb's practice was to use headpieces and initial decorations
      profusely in the initial gatherings. Thereafter for about two-thirds of the volume he used
      ornaments and factotums to mark only fresh divisions of text. The final third was often devoid
      of decoration.</p>
     <p>Generally Newcomb seemed slightly fonder of using ornamentation after the Restoration than
      those among his contemporaries whose books I have examined, and was markedly more generous in
      their use than his important competitor John Macock. Yet one comes upon enough exceptions to
      most of the generalizations made so far in this section to conclude that the price the
      publisher was willing to pay and the reading public for which he intended his publication
      dictate more often than not the amount of paper space the printer took up with decorations.
      Thus in a period when Newcomb employed ornaments rather consistently, his quarto edition of
      Nedham's <hi rend="italic">Interest Will Not Lie</hi> (1659) and his folio printing of <hi
       rend="italic">Certain Letters Evidencing The King's Stedfastness in the Protestant
       Religion</hi> (1660) are without ornamentation while in a period of dwindling ornamentation,
      even in folios, Newcomb's folio edition of <hi rend="italic">The Genealogical History of the
       Kings of England</hi> (1677), privately printed for the herald Francis Sandford, turns out to
      be perhaps the most attractively and profusely decorated volume of Newcomb's printing
      career.</p>
     <p>There are apparently no practices dealing with ornaments that <pb n="003.160"/> mark
      distinctively the workmanship of Newcomb's shop, but there are some practices used by the
      contemporaries of Newcomb which his compositors did not follow. Newcomb did not, for instance,
      use a printer's device; in fact, he seldom used a title-page ornament, and when he did, he had
      no favorite. The only ornament appearing more consistently on his title-pages than elsewhere
      is the emblem bearing the motto: "Premor Dum Attollor," but it occurs only five times on the
      title-pages of the more than 200 books which I have examined. Except for the early years of
      his career Newcomb did not use ornaments to mark the conclusion of a division of text, and
      never, to my knowledge, used a tailpiece although Raworth had in his collection handsome
      tailpieces which Newcomb must have acquired. Newcomb made no effort to use throughout a volume
      the decorative initials of one design; his son did so only in the portion of Shakespeare's
      fourth folio which he printed. Nor did Newcomb greatly concern himself about the nicety of
      proportion between decoration and format. Sometimes a very small initial meant for a duodecimo
      is buried on an oversized folio page; at other times, one finds a large factotum designed
      primarily for a folio appearing on a quarto page.</p>
     <p>On the other hand, there are a few positive practices worth mentioning. After 1666 Newcomb
      used factotums far more frequently than he used initials, and he used over and over the same
      small group of ornaments. He made some effort to decorate books authorized by or dedicated to
      the king with appropriate national and Stuart ornaments. The only other occasion on which a
      Newcomb compositor appeared concerned about using a particular ornament in a particular
      place&mdash;and this applies to compositors in other printing houses as well&mdash;was when he
      was working on a reprint of a volume previously issued from his shop. Then he would often
      reproduce in the new edition the identical ornament used perhaps five or ten years earlier,
      despite the fact that searching for it in his collection must frequently have involved a
      considerable waste of time.</p>

      <pb n="003.161"/> who may in the future make use of the chart of Newcomb book decorations that
      follows, I append these scattered observations.</p>
     <p>English ornament makers of this period show a marked tendency to copy and recopy earlier
      designs rather than create new ones. Those copies made in wood are more often than not
      distinguishable from each other, but on occasion recuttings were made with such precision that
      one is hard put to tell them apart. The many decorations made from metal rather than wood
      present a greater problem in that indistinguishable copies of an ornament cast from the same
      matrix were owned and regularly used by as many as a half-dozen printers. Wherever I have
      found a printer using an ornament very similar to Newcomb's, I have made a note of it after
      the list of occurrences; but since I have concentrated in this study on the ornaments of only
      a handful of printers and since there are tens of thousands of books which I have not seen,
      the likelihood is that future study will uncover very similar or indistinguishable copies of
      Newcomb ornaments in the stock of other printers.</p>
     <p>Measurements of ornaments are helpful in distinguishing between like ornaments but furnish
      conclusive evidence only where there is a marked difference in size between two otherwise
      identical ornaments. Different impressions of the same ornament vary in measurement because of
      light or heavy inking, newness or wear, or variable degrees of shrinkage in the paper. In the
      Newcomb chart I have at times given measurements down to a half millimeter; one should not,
      however, consider them other than the average, often made up from several varying
      measurements.</p>
     <p>A knowledge of printers' type-ornaments is generally useless in attempting to identify a
      particular printer in this period. I have found no one of Newcomb's many type-ornaments that
      was not also in the stock of other printers.</p>
     <p>When the identification of the printer of an unsigned book depends on the decorative
      initials H, I, O, or S, one should be sure to examine the letter both right side up and upside
      down. Compositors paid little attention to the proper position of such letters, and looked at
      wrong side up, these letters often present quite a different appearance.</p>
     <p>Ornaments in the text of a volume occasionally qualify or contradict the evidence of a
      printer's name in the title-page imprint. <pb n="003.162"/> A number of the large folios of
      this period were the work of two or more printers, but the imprint often carries only the name
      of the printer who ran off the title-page and the first or last portion of the volume. Thus
      the ornaments in Davenant's <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (1673), signed by Newcomb, indicate
      that Newcomb and Macock jointly printed the book, while those of the Beaumont and Fletcher
      folio of 1679, signed by Macock, point to the work of both Newcomb and Macock. Further, one
      should be wary of ascribing to a printer signing a title-page cancel the presswork of the
      text. In rare instances, as in Cornelius Burgess' <hi rend="italic">The First Sermon</hi>
      (1641) the imprint phrase "By I. L." means only that I. L. printed the cancel; the colophon
      and the imprint of the original title-page reinforce the evidence of the ornaments in pointing
      to T. Badger as the rightful printer of the text.</p>
     <p>Finally, in attributing to a specific printer the presswork of an unsigned book, one is
      always on surer ground if he can buttress the evidence of the ornamentation with that derived
      from other reliable sources. One of the obvious sources is the printer-employment habits of
      the stationer publishing the book. A study of the imprints on books published by Herringman,
      for example, reveals that he tended to patronize one or two printers consistently in a given
      period. Therefore anyone attempting to identify the printer of a Herringman volume can
      eliminate from consideration almost immediately all but the handful of likely candidates; and
      where the volume in question contains ornaments known to be used by several printers, one can
      on occasion establish with great probability the one printer whom Herringman hired to do his
      work.</p>
     <p>The other source is the wills of the printers with the appended probate statements. Ornament
      stocks seem to have passed almost overnight from one printer to another, and therefore it is
      frequently necessary to determine the terminal dates of a printer's activity, lest one
      interpret the evidence of the ornaments erroneously. For instance, the evidence of ornaments
      supported by that of the imprints suggests that Thomas Newcomb, Sr., was active as a printer
      from 1648 to 1691. The probate date of his will indicates, however, that he died late in 1681,
      and the text of the will points to the fact that Newcomb's son, who happened to have the same
      name as his father's, inherited the ornament stock and was <pb n="003.163"/> hence responsible
      for the Newcomb-printed books between 1682 and 1691. On the other hand, the ornaments of
      William Wilson appearing in unsigned books published by Herringman as late as 1671 suggest
      that Wilson was active until that date. Actually Wilson's will was probated in May of 1665;
      his shop was taken over by his heir and son-in-law, Edward Okes, who used Wilson's ornaments
      for the next eight years without signing, as far as I have been able to discover, more than
      two or three imprints in his entire printing career.</p>

    <div2 type="section" n="4">
     <p>The following is a list of occurrences which I have found of the Newcomb ornaments,
      factotums, and initials pictured in the final pages of this study. Each of the three types of
      ornamentation has its own heading and separate series of numbers. The entry for each
      decoration contains this information: (1) an identifying number corresponding to that
      accompanying the picture of the decoration; (2) the approximate millimeter measurements, with
      the vertical measurement occurring first; (3) a listing of the books in which the particular
      decoration is to be found, chronologically arranged and subdivided among the various printers
      who owned and used the decoration during specific periods of years. "RAWORTH" means always
      John Raworth, active from 1638 to 1646; "R. RAWORTH", Ruth Raworth, 1646-1648; "NEWCOMB,"
      Thomas Newcomb, Sr., 1648-1681; "NEWCOMB JR.," Thomas Newcomb, Jr., 1682-1688(?). Books in the
      following list printed before or during 1640 are cited according to the numbers assigned them
      in the Pollard and Redgrave <hi rend="italic">S.T.C.</hi> The remainder are cited according to
      the numbers given them in the three volumes of the Wing <hi rend="italic">S.T.C.</hi>; the
      numbers of books listed in the unpublished third volume have been supplied from proof sheets
      through the courtesy of Mr. D. G. Wing and the Princeton University Library. The occasional
      book not found listed in either <hi rend="italic">S.T.C.</hi> is cited by short title. Where
      Wing has assigned only one number to a play known to appear in two editions during a single
      year, I have appended to the Wing number the numbers assigned the different editions by
      Woodward and McManaway in <hi rend="italic">A Check-list of English Plays 1641-1700</hi>. The
      brackets enclosing any <hi rend="italic">S.T.C.</hi> number indicate that the book has been
      identified by means of the ornaments as <pb n="003.164"/> the presswork of a particular
      printer although his name does not appear in the imprint.</p>
     <p>The decorations pictured are reproduced usually at approximately life-size; those pictured
      at less than life-size&mdash;generally reduced about one-fifth&mdash;are marked with an
      asterisk accompanying the measurements beneath the picture.</p>

     <p>IN A RECENT STUDY OF PRESS FIGURES, WHICH appear in many eighteenth-century books, Mr.
      Walter E. Knotts offers a timely reminder of their importance as possible clues to
      bibliographical analysis, and from his examination of eight copies of a single work proposes a
      technique for the use of this tool.<ref target="f003.10.02" n="2"><hi rend="super"
       >2</hi></ref> These figures, if properly understood, are of potential value in the solution
      of numerous problems, for oftentimes they represent, in the absence or in the unhelpful
      uniformity of such indications as headlines or watermarks, the only discernible evidence of
      irregularity in the manufacture of a book. But this evidence, though occasionally observed, is
      more often ignored, or else is variously interpreted according to hypotheses exclusively
      derived from the ambiguous data of the figures. Thus far, no attempt has been made to record
      the incidence of the figures in a substantial number of books, to correlate this data,
      whenever possible, with other evidence, to formulate a theory comprehending the several
      vagaries in the use and distribution of the figures, and to present a series of examples
      illustrating their significance.</p>
     <p>This enquiry is directed toward the several ends which have been slighted in previous
      accounts, and though it may fall short <pb n="003.172"/> of its ultimate objective, endeavors
      to provide, at least, a more informative basis for further study. Investigation discovers two
      kinds of information: an explanation for the casual employment of figures in the production of
      a book, and a rationale for the interpretation of these figures as bibliographical
      evidence.</p>
    </div2>
    <div2 type="section" n="2">
     <p>In general, the received opinion concerning press figures<ref target="f003.10.03" n="3"><hi
        rend="super">3</hi></ref> is that they were inserted, one to a forme, by the compositor, at
      the direction of the overseer, in order to identify the press designated to receive the forme,
      to facilitate an equitable distribution of the work among the presses, and to corroborate each
      pressman's claim for pay.<ref target="f003.10.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref>
      Contradicting these several suppositions, all of which are founded on cursory comment in
      printers' manuals published early in the nineteenth century, is other comment from the same
      sources. Elsewhere it is noted, to the contrary, that it was the pressman's responsibility to
      work with figures, that in small shops the office of overseer was nonexistent,<ref
       target="f003.10.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> and that all employees were paid by
      the hour, the day, or the week, as the convenience of the employer might dictate, and not, as
      the figures would imply, according to the number of sheets they had worked.<ref
       target="f003.10.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> To this conflicting testimony may be
      added that of the books, which show no equitable distribution of the figures, in many
      instances no figures at all, and, in some, sheets which are only partially figured. And as a
      final piece of confusion, it is well to recall a chapel rule of 1734 enjoining the pressmen
      "to put in the Drawer, one of a Sort of every Job, with their Names, the No. wrought, and Day
      of the Month."<ref target="f003.10.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> For the shops in
      which this regulation applied, figures would be superfluous, whatever their purpose in the
      organization of the work or the payment of the men.</p>
     <pb n="003.173"/>
     <p>From the foregoing account it will be apparent that the information in the manuals is quite
      unenlightening, not only because it is inadequate, but because it indiscriminately reports
      practices which seemingly vary with the time, the shop, and the number of men employed. Custom
      or circumstance may require, for some books, the figuring of every sheet, whether or not the
      work had been predetermined; for others, figures only at the end of a specified period of
      time; and for others, figures only on those occasions when the work had been disrupted or
      reassigned. Thus any theory envisaging a uniform procedure in an unorganized, <hi
       rend="italic">laissez-faire</hi> handicraft must be regarded with suspicion.</p>
     <p>With this caveat against arguments based on selected testimony rather than direct
      observation, we may turn to those which have at least the merit of being empirical. An obvious
      approach to the problem, and the one taken by Dr. F. B. Kaye and Mr. Knotts, is to discover
      the procedure which results in the erratic employment of figures in a single book. For Dr.
      Kaye the unfigured formes represent the work of a press which is properly identified in the
      sheet immediately preceding or following the sequence.<ref target="f003.10.08" n="8"><hi
        rend="super">8</hi></ref> For Mr. Knotts, on the other hand, they designate the work of an
      unidentified press. <q>The indication that a forme of any gathering had been printed by this
       press would be the absence of a number. An examination of a number of eighteenth-century
       books reveals that often when some (but not all) sheets in a book are figured there are more
       without press numbers than with them. This suggests that the figures were used to identify
       formes of sheets which had been worked off by any press other than the one which was doing
       the bulk of the job.<ref target="f003.10.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></q> If this
      latter hypothesis is correct, then we must assume that the printing offices in the eighteenth
      century, most of which had a normal complement of about twelve pressmen and eighteen
       compositors,<ref target="f003.10.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> assigned the
      greater portion of their work to a single press, and only an occasional forme to others.
      Though we may doubt that the offices were managed as inefficiently as Mr. Knotts seems to
      imply, his interpretation of the figures is, theoretically, as plausible as the one advanced
      by Dr. Kaye.</p>
     <pb n="003.174"/>
     <p>The dilemma which confronts the bibliographer is easily resolved, for some books, by
      reference to the headlines, a kind of evidence overlooked by Mr. Knotts. When the headlines
      can be distinguished in books containing press figures, they provide a means for the analysis
      of the figures, and a measure for accepting or rejecting the opposing interpretations. In
      Gay's <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> (1727), for example, a quarto collating <hi rend="italic"
       >A</hi><hi rend="super">4</hi> B-Z<hi rend="super">4</hi> 2A<hi rend="super">2</hi>, the
      figures are so distributed that, as Mr. Knotts observes, no grouping results of the order
      required by Dr. Kaye's hypothesis. If the figures are correlated with the headlines, however,
      a pattern emerges which appears to substantiate the very theory Mr. Knotts intended to
      disprove.</p>
     <p>Discounting the headline skeletons for gatherings B, C, and D, all of which are
      indeterminable, we may represent the others as follows: <figure entity="sb031741"/> Now
      according to Mr. Knotts' belief, no less than forty formes were machined by a single
      individual, and only seven by the three pressmen identified as 4, 5, and 7. But according to
      the available evidence, as it may be read from the headlines, the work was more equally
      divided and the figures revealed to be somewhat more meaningful than Mr. Knotts supposes. The
      only acceptable interpretation, it seems to me, is this: Two men are originally assigned to
      the job at "half press" (i.e., one man to a machine), their names properly recorded in the
      ledger, and their work organized so that they operate in tandem, with one man machining both
      formes of the sequence?C-E-G-I, and the other, both formes of the alternate
      sequence?B-?D-F-H-K. Upon the completion of K, the work is interrupted: skeletons I and II are
      interchanged; III and IV are pied, discarded, or mislaid; V and VI are composed; and two other
      men take the place of those originally assigned. <pb n="003.175"/> These identify themselves
      as 5 and 7 in order to obviate any dispute as to where the "hours" of work for one group
      ended, and those for the other began.<ref target="f003.10.11" n="11"><hi rend="super"
       >11</hi></ref> Printing then proceeds through P in the same manner as before, when there is a
      second interruption, marked, we will note, by the insertion of a figure 4 in each sequence at
      Q and R. What this signifies, apparently, is that the work previously distributed between two
      machines operating, as we have conjectured, at half press, is now undertaken as a single
      sequence by one machine employing two men (4 and an assistant) at full press. Had 4 figured
      only one of the two sheets, R, for instance, the indication would be that he is replacing 5
      only in the one sequence while 7 continues with the other. But since he figures Q as well as
      R, he signalizes the termination of work by both of his predecessors, assumes credit for all
      of that which follows, and presumably operates at such a rate&mdash;at full press,
      probably&mdash;that he requires for his work the services of the same number of compositors,
      and the same number of formes, which had been used before. If a single compositor, using two
      formes, were needed for each of the two presses operating from B to P at half-capacity, then
      the total of two compositors and four formes might be required for a single press operating
      from Q to X at full capacity. That 4, with an assistant, is able to work twice as fast and
      thus to accomplish twice as much in a given period, is confirmed, it would seem, by the time
      divisions, which show that while the other pressmen, working individually, machine only two or
      three sheets in a week, 4 machines no less than six.</p>
     <p>Unlike the others, 4 anticipates the end of his assignment, and marks it at outer X. Once
      again work is suspended, over Sunday, we may suppose, to be resumed by 5. And since 5 also
      requires the labors of the two compositors who had been previously assigned to separate
      presses, he too figures one of the formes supplied by each, verifying the fact that 4 is no
      longer at work, and then finishes the production by machining Y, Z, 2A, and presumably <hi
       rend="italic">A</hi>. The grouping throughout, we may conclude, is quite apparent, the
      significance of the numbers for this work not incomprehensible, and their distribution exactly
      in accordance with Dr. Kaye's premises. For this poem, at any rate, the figures mark the <pb
       n="003.176"/> inception and the extent of the work undertaken by those not originally
      assigned to the job.</p>
     <p>If this is a reasonable interpretation of the evidence, it follows that an examination of
      books containing press figures and headlines will permit inferences not to be drawn when one
      or the other of these indications is absent. In the <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> the figures
      alone allow no demonstrable theory, and the headlines only a presumption that two presses were
      operating throughout. But the facts do not always conform to our expectations. Where there are
      no figures, as in the second volume of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>
     <ref target="f003.10.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> and in sheets K-2F of the fifth
      volume, the presumption is, for want of other evidence, indisputable. Where there are figures
      of a pattern like that in the fourth volume, the presumption is apparently confirmed. But
      where they are of another pattern, as in the <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi>, and in the fourth
      edition of the <hi rend="italic">Fable of the Bees</hi>, the presumption applies only for
      certain sheets. And for such works as John Williams' <hi rend="italic">Vindication of the
       Answer to the Popish Address</hi> (1688) it does not seem to apply at all. This tract, a
      quarto collating A-E<hi rend="super">4</hi> F<hi rend="super">2</hi>, is of the following
      pattern: <figure entity="sb031761"/> Throughout the major portion of this work, and
      occasionally in the two <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> we have considered, a single press,
      first &tgr; for A-B, and then * for C-D, seems to be operating at such speed (at full press?),
      or processing so few sheets, that four skeleton formes are allocated for the job in order to
      lend more fluidity to the time of distribution. Only in the last two sheets is there a shift
      in the arrangement, and then the skeletons are distributed, not in the manner we might expect,
      with I-II to one press and III to another, but with I-II to two presses, and III again to one
      of these, probably &tgr;.</p>
     <p>A correlation of the evidence necessitates a modification of our views concerning books with
      two sets of headlines as well as <pb n="003.177"/> with those having four. Again there seems
      to be more disorder than the headlines alone reveal. For the eighth volume of the <hi
       rend="italic">Spectator</hi> the absence of figures implies only a continuance of a process
      as it had been prearranged, which might be that of a single press machining all sheets, or
      that of two presses simultaneously machining the inner and outer formes. For the several
      editions of Clement Ellis's <hi rend="italic">The Protestant Resolved</hi> (1688), on the
      other hand, some other and more specific explanation is required. The patterns are these:
       <figure entity="sb031771"/> In each of these there is no indication, from the headlines, of
      two presses. From the figures, however, we learn that while * and &tgr; have individually done
      most of the work performed in shop "B", both simultaneously machined sheets I and K of the
      first edition, and G, H, and presumably I of the second. Also observe that the termination of
      the work by the extra press is carefully marked, by a &tgr; in outer L of the first edition,
      and by an * in inner K of the second. Once again the figures prevent unwarranted claims for
      pay.</p>
     <p>James Macpherson's <hi rend="italic">Temora</hi> (1763) presents another instance of the
      extent to which the headlines or the figures, if considered separately, may mislead the
      bibliographer. In this poem the identification of two sets of headlines, each used
      successively, one for the inner forme, one for the outer, might indicate work on a single
      press. The notation of a variety of marks, however, would seem to justify the assertion that
      the sheets were simultaneously processed by as many as ten different pressmen. Actually
      neither assumption appears to be valid. Either a number of men were working in relay on two
      presses or, less plausibly, the formes were allocated to any available press, but to no more
      than two at a time. Whatever the procedure, it was obviously erratic, undetermined by the
      overseer, and thus necessitated the marking <pb n="003.178"/> of every forme to certify the
      identity of the men performing the work.<ref target="f003.10.13" n="13"><hi rend="super"
        >13</hi></ref></p>
     <p>One other relationship remains to be examined: that between the figures and three sets of
      headlines. When the third skeleton appears only occasionally it is very probably the one
      usually employed for the proofing press, but used for final work if one of the other skeletons
      is unavailable. If intermittently employed, as in sheets B-F of the first edition of Ellis's
       <hi rend="italic">The Protestant Resolved</hi>, no identification is required for any of the
      formes, since all would represent the work of a single press. An example of a more systematic
      use of the third press is observed in Susannah Centlivre's <hi rend="italic">The Busie
       Body</hi> [1709]<ref target="f003.10.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref>
      <figure entity="sb031781"/> Here, for some reason (perhaps it may be&mdash;as we have
      conjectured before&mdash;that 3 is working full press), all but one of the formes through F
      are marked.<ref target="f003.10.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> After F there is a
      disruption involving, this time, not a discontinuance of certain forme-skeletons, but a
      reallocation, apparently for half-press work by three presses operating in succession. Number
      3 worked both formes of G, presumably, 5 those of H, 2 those of I, and 3, again, those of K.
      The regular pattern of figures and headlines which might appear when several presses are
      operating successively would not be evident, however, when they are operating simultaneously.
      In this situation any one of the three formes would go to the press that was ready to take it.
      Consequently the sequence would be indeterminable, subject to arguments later on as to the
      hours of work performed, and requiring, therefore, as in similar instances cited above, the
      identification of every forme. A typical example of such an operation appears in the first
      volume of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>.</p>
     <pb n="003.179"/>
     <p>From this preliminary survey of the correspondence or, more often, the discrepancy between
      the headlines and the figures in eighteenth-century books, it will be agreed that
      investigation based on one kind of evidence to the exclusion of the other leads to an
      oversimplification of the problems involved. Before the expiration of the Licensing Act in
      1695 the process of bookmaking was undoubtedly less confused than afterwards: only thirty-five
      master printers were authorized to practice the trade,<ref target="f003.10.16" n="16"><hi
        rend="super">16</hi></ref> and most of these, we may be sure, conformed to the regulation
      limiting the number of presses and apprentices for each shop. During this period, then,
      extraneous conditions have not only provided the bibliographer with certain means for
      detecting occasional irregularities in the production of a book, as these are discerned in
      various types, headlines, and paper, but limited the output of books he has to examine to
      relatively few and comparatively well-organized establishments. After 1695, though, the
      conditions for disorder increase in approximately the same ratio as the means for detecting it
      disappear. By the end of the eighteenth century the personnel of the trade numbered no less
      than 2815,<ref target="f003.10.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> but the materials of
      the trade&mdash;ink, paper, and type&mdash;had become so standardized that little is known or
      will ever be known of what these several thousand persons were doing. Even the press figures
      are uncommunicative. When they appear they seem to indicate a process which is disrupted,
      reassigned, or uncontrolled, printing engaged at half or full press, simultaneously or
      sequentially, and, rather obscurely, production over a certain period of time.<ref
       target="f003.10.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref> But they do not reveal, in all
      instances, the necessity for their appearance, nor the precise information conveyed to the
      person who ordered their insertion. Thus they remain, at best, as intimations of what will
      never be fully divulged.<ref target="f003.10.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref></p>
    </div2>
    <div2 type="section" n="3">
     <pb n="003.180"/>
     <p>Whatever may be the significance of the figures to the pressmen of the eighteenth century,
      their importance in contemporary investigation cannot be underestimated. By ignoring these
      convenient indices to the formes and sheets of various books, bibliographers have devised
      descriptions so general as to encompass as a single entity works which actually exist in
      innumerable states, impressions and editions. Even such authorities as Kaye, Griffith, Gulick,
      Sale, and Worthington, all of whom have occasionally reported the figures as a means of
      differentiation, fail to report them consistently and completely. Hence their accounts of
      Mandeville, Pope, Chesterfield, Richardson, and Scott are, one and all, inadequate. Indeed my
      casual enquiry into the use of these figures as a positive sign of variation among copies
      allows the assertion that practically every scholarly bibliography and edition of
      eighteenth-century literature rests on undiscriminated texts.</p>
     <p>The great value of these figures lies in the convenience with which they may be recorded and
      subsequently used to distinguish and classify the variants they disclose. For this purpose one
      need not fill reams of paper with the distinguishing characteristics of the headlines (a
      fruitless procedure, I might observe, for most editions in this period) or travel about the
      country with cases of microfilm. The figures are sufficient criteria.<ref target="f003.10.20"
       n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref> In most cases they may be recorded, as a necessary part
      of the description of a book, by a simple reference to the page and number [as 39&mdash;7]. In
      some, however, it may be necessary, for the purpose of bibliographical analysis, to convert
      this reference to less simplified notations <pb n="003.181"/> indicating the forme in which
      the figure is located [C(i)7], the position of the figure within the forme [C7<hi rend="super"
       >v</hi>(i)7], or, for half-sheet imposition, the sheet [C&mdash;7] or page [C4<hi
       rend="super">v</hi>&mdash;7] identified by the figure. The method of notation employed
      should, I think, be determined by the book, and not by any arbitrary principle requiring the
      presentation of useless information for some works and not enough of what would be essential
      for others. In the discussion which follows I have, therefore, adopted the most convenient
      system for the book considered.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">The analysis of variants</hi>. Variation in the presence or kind of
      figures for a sheet in copies which are otherwise of a single impression indicates (1) a
      disrupted impression, as this may be occasioned by the substitution of one pressman for
      another at the same press, (2) a reimpression at other presses to compensate for a
      miscalculation at the time the tokens were set out for the original printing, or (3) a
      resetting for the same reason as that accounted for in (2).<ref target="f003.10.21" n="21"><hi
        rend="super">21</hi></ref> Though an examination of copies which vary in this respect will
      usually not permit a discrimination between (1) and (2),<ref target="f003.10.22" n="22"><hi
        rend="super">22</hi></ref> it will reveal (3) and allow the explanation suggested. Whether
      (2) or (3), a decision concerning the priority of variants may be offered on the basis
      suggested by Dr. Kaye: the later one will have a pattern of figures differing from that
      evident in the other sheets.<ref target="f003.10.23" n="23"><hi rend="super"
      >23</hi></ref></p>
     <p>Imagination can easily supply any number of incidents as the occasion for an interruption of
      the kind indicated under (1)&mdash;the failure of the first man to report for work after an
      evening at his favorite pub, or his departure for lunch, or his dismissal for one reason or
      another. And sometimes a reasonable hypothesis may be deduced from the aberration. In the
      previously undifferentiated second editions of Pope's Imitations of Horace, <hi rend="italic"
       >The</hi>
      <pb n="003.182"/>
      <hi rend="italic">First Epistle of the Second Book</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Second
       Epistle</hi> (1737), the work was performed by four numbered men and one designated as
       "&tgr;".<ref target="f003.10.24" n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref>
      <figure entity="sb031821"/> For both of these second editions numbers 2, 3, 4, and
      occasionally 1 complete the impression of their formes, but &tgr; works infrequently and then
      only on the press operated by 1. I think we may presume from this circumstance that 1 is the
      master printer in Woodfall's shop (perhaps Woodfall himself), and has under his tutelage a
      young apprentice who is allowed, now and then, to try his hand with a few sheets. If this much
      is presumed, the conjecture follows that where both figures and symbols appear in the same
      book, the figures may designate the master and journeymen, who are assigned numbers according
      to seniority, and the symbols, the apprentices, printers' devils, or "smouters" who are only
      occasionally employed at press.</p>
     <p>Consistent variation in the figures for all sheets indicates different impressions or
      editions. Since the figures are usually entered on or immediately below the direction-line,
      they may be tied up with that line and the adjacent letter-press when the latter is removed
      from the forme, and remain as a part of the type page until they are replaced by the figures
      of other pressmen assigned to <pb n="003.183"/> work a subsequent impression. When this is the
      practice the numbers, as always, will change between impressions, but their relative positions
      within the formes will remain unchanged. A typical example of this procedure is observed in
      the two "editions" of Samuel Johnson's <hi rend="italic">Thoughts on the Late Transactions
       Respecting Falkland's Islands</hi> (1771), an octavo in half-sheets collating <hi
       rend="italic">A<hi rend="super">2</hi></hi> B-K <hi rend="super">4</hi> L<hi rend="super"
       >2</hi>, and bearing these figures: <figure entity="sb031831"/> Here, as the figures imply
      and as inspection confirms, the second variant, though called a "Second Edition" on its
      title-page, is actually a reissue (reimpression).<ref target="f003.10.25" n="25"><hi
        rend="super">25</hi></ref> Not infrequently, however, the figures will be dropped, along
      with other superfluous matter, before the pages are retied for storage, and thus reappear in a
      new impression as different numbers in different positions. Where this has occurred, it is
      impossible to ascertain, from the figures alone, whether the variant is of the same or another
      setting of type.<ref target="f003.10.26" n="26"><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref></p>
     <pb n="003.184"/>
     <p>During the course of an impression regularly processed according to the order of its
      signatures, it may be decided to overprint the remaining sheets in anticipation of a second
      edition. Such a decision will be reflected in the figures, which will vary in number and
      position throughout that portion of the text which has been reset or reimpressed, but will
      usually remain invariable in the latter portion, where a single expanded impression suffices
      for both editions. Thus the incidence of identical figures provides, for the books concerned,
      instances of a procedure for which Dr. Bowers found no evidence in books of an earlier period:
      <ref target="f003.10.27" n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref> that of a deliberate increase
      in the number of very late sheets machined at one time to be divided between two editions. The
      other practice to which Dr. Bowers refers as normal for sixteenth and seventeenth century
      printing is that of laying aside and later reimpressing the pages to be overprinted. Of the
      many examples of both procedures, apparently only five are now on record for the eighteenth
      century: those involving the two editions, first volume, of Gibbon's <hi rend="italic">Decline
       and Fall</hi>; volumes 2 and 4 of the second and third editions of Chesterfield's <hi
       rend="italic">Letters</hi>; volumes 1 and 3 of the third and fifth editions of the <hi
       rend="italic">Letters</hi>; volume 7 of the first and third editions of Richardson's <hi
       rend="italic">History of Sir Charles Grandison</hi>; and two editions of <hi rend="italic"
       >The New Ministry</hi>.<ref target="f003.10.28" n="28"><hi rend="super">28</hi></ref></p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">Printing according to the order of accessibility</hi>. Occasionally it may
      be inferred, with varying degrees of certainty, that the initial impression of a book has not
      proceeded according to the order of its signatures, but in some abnormal sequence determined
      by the availability of the formes. Irregularity is implied, but not demonstrated, whenever
      identical figures in a second variant reappear, not in the latter portion of that variant, as
      we should expect for a normal overprint, but scattered throughout several interior sheets. In
      the absence of indications to the contrary, one explanation for these reiterated
      figures&mdash;as they occur, for example, in <pb n="003.185"/> sheets D, F, and H of Johnson's
       <hi rend="italic">Thoughts on the Late Transactions</hi>&mdash;is that the pressmen so
      identified accidentally returned to the same formes they had machined before. But for some
      works, certain considerations disallow this conjecture. For these, we may presume that the
      formes involved were overlooked in the process of the first impression, either by the
      pressman, who for one reason or another neglected to machine them until toward the end of his
      work, when they were then used for an overprinting, or by the compositor, who pushed them
      aside while he imposed or distributed the type for the others.</p>
     <p>Before fixing the responsibility upon one or the other we should trace the progress of the
      forme from the compositor's bench to the press-room and back again in order to determine where
      and how it could be mislaid. Normally, of course, the proportion between compositors and
      pressmen will be such that the work proceeds without interruption. Once the intended date of
      publication has been advertised, however, the distribution of work must be so arranged that
      the pressmen are never allowed to be idle, for the schedule depends upon their machining a
      certain number of formes in a given time. It will be of advantage to the overseer, therefore,
      that he have one or more formes ready at each press so that there will be no delay and
      consequent disruption of the schedule. The practice of stacking the formes awaiting impression
      we may consider to be a custom, for a regulation covers the matter: <q>When a compositor
       carries his form down for press, he is not to put two forms together without a partition
       between, or forfeiture of two-pence; and in case, through neglect of such partition, a form
       should be battered, the compositor guilty of such neglect shall forfeit six-pence.<ref
        target="f003.10.29" n="29"><hi rend="super">29</hi></ref></q> Since preservation of type is
      the primary concern, it is probable that the formes were laid, even with partitions, not one
      on top of the other, but against a wall where they would be convenient to all the pressmen,
      or, if they were previously assigned to one, against that man's press. Wherever their
      location, <hi rend="italic">the formes last imposed would be those most accessible to the
       men</hi>.</p>
     <p>Infrequently it might happen, particularly if the preceding work is running to a great
      number of copies, that all the formes of <pb n="003.186"/> a pamphlet would be stacked and
      ready for impression, in which case they would be machined throughout in the inverse order of
      their signatures.<ref target="f003.10.30" n="30"><hi rend="super">30</hi></ref> So long as the
      pressman keeps the two formes of a sheet together, it is immaterial whether he selects those
      for sheets G or M or X, for he knows that sooner or later he and his companions will "work
      their way to the wall," where he may find some of the early formes&mdash;B, D, and F, for
      example. And if, before he gets that far, the issue has been increased, then B, D, and F will
      constitute a single impression for the two editions, while G, M, and X, though later in the
      alphabetical sequence, will be reset or reimpressed in the second.</p>
     <p>Though there must necessarily be an accumulation of ready-formes in the press-room in order
      to avoid delay, any accumulation of used formes was considered a nuisance and subject to fine.
       <q>As soon as a form is wrought-off, the pressman to carry it to a lie-trough, and there
       completely rub it over with lie, rinse it with water, and then carry it to the wrought-off
       place, or to the end of the compositor's frame it belongs to. Three-pence for each neglected
        form.<ref target="f003.10.31" n="31"><hi rend="super">31</hi></ref></q> After it has been
      returned to the "wrought-off place" or directly to the compositor, he too must not be dilatory
      in distributing type. <q>Jobs to be cleared away immediately after notice being given by the
       overseer, under the penalty of two-pence for every hour's delay.<ref target="f003.10.32"
        n="32"><hi rend="super">32</hi></ref></q> Usually, of course, the compositor would need no
      urging to perform this task, for it would often be essential that he distribute in order to
      keep himself provided with enough sorts to continue composition. And as it takes only
      one-sixth as long to break type as it does to set it up,<ref target="f003.10.33" n="33"><hi
        rend="super">33</hi></ref> he not only has the compulsion of a penalty and the necessity for
      reusing the type as encouragements to distribute, but sufficient time for the job. It may be
      said, therefore, <pb n="003.187"/> that whenever interspersed formes of the first impression
      reappear in the second impression or edition, these formes have been machined according to the
      accessibility of the type in the press-room.</p>
     <p>It is one thing to construct a plausible hypothesis, quite another to prove it. The three
      examples cited below are arranged according to the degree of irregularity and the amount of
      corollary evidence supporting the argument advanced. In the first of these, Chesterfield's <hi

      identically positioned figure in the sheet presumably imposed as A<hi rend="super">2</hi>+M<hi
       rend="super">2</hi> would seem to indicate a single impression; but since the date on A1 of
      the "A" edition invariably reads "M.CDD.XLIII.", while that in "B" reads, correctly,
      "M.DCC.XLIII.", an interruption has occurred between the variants. The sheet in "B" must be
      considered, then, either as a reimpression, with the presence of the identical figure
      accounted for as the accidental return of the man to the forme he worked before, or as a
      continuous impression, with the corrected state appearing, again accidentally, only in the
      later edition of the copies examined. Though accidence may similarly account for the
      reiterated figures in F, H, I, and K, the possibility of this diminishes with each additional
      sheet and may be discounted altogether with reference to four. It would be a strange
      coincidence indeed that out of the eleven formes of this book, number 2 should return to one
      of the two formes he had previously impressed. More likely is the supposition that the sheets
      for "A" were impressed in the order of their accessibility, those later <pb n="003.188"/>
      reset being the first, followed by those subsequently reimpressed and, as the stack was
      uncovered, those continued as a single impression for the planned overprint. The progress of

      <figure entity="sb031881"/> Since the formes for every sheet, except C and E, were
      simultaneously impressed in the one issue, but consecutively impressed in the other, it would
      appear that there was some reason for a shift in the printing arrangements. And that reason,
      we may confidently assert, can be found in the circumstances pertaining to the impression of
      C, a sheet which, unlike the others, is apparently of a single impression, and simultaneously
      machined throughout. What happened, presumably, is that the formes for C were covered by those
      for D-G, and were thus not available until inner and outer G had been picked up by 1 and 6.
      Then, after the completion of a run of&mdash;let us say&mdash;500 copies of G, but before the
      completion of the same run on C, the decision was made to double the issue, whereupon x and 4
      together continued to impress about 900 copies of C in approximately the same amount of time
      that it took 8 and &tgr; individually to print and perfect 500 copies <pb n="003.189"/> of B
      and E. Number 8 then completed the work on AG while 4 machined D and F. The facts of printing,

     <p>Since H, I, and N are both by figure and by readings confirmed as a single impression for
      the first and second issues, we may suppose that they were printed toward the end of the
      sequence of sheets for the first and in sufficient quantities to provide copies <pb
       n="003.190"/> for both issues. Yet they must precede the last two or three sheets, for
      sometime during the work on P, first issue, the press was stopped for the correction of
      "requium" to "requiem" (105.5), one of the fifteen errors noted by Lewis when he returned the
      proof for preliminary gathering A. If H, I, and N had followed A, then it is reasonable to
      assume that they too would have been corrected at press, especially since number 3 worked on A
      as well as H and N. And not only must P and A therefore come after the three but very probably
      the invariant O, a sheet worked by 6, who, we will observe, is lately assigned to this job,
      apparently for the purpose of hurrying it up.</p>
     <p>Taking these several factors into account, we are obliged to assume that the first issue was
      overprinted for three sheets (H-I, N), then reduced to the original quota of copies for three
      more (O-P, A) in order to insure the publication of the original issue on the scheduled date.
      After this date there were a number of other improvisations in the making of subsequent
      issues, all of which may be represented in a formulary. <table>

      the sequence machined for the first issue can be inferred from the construction of subsequent
      impressions. For the third issue ("Second Edition") sheet A was discarded, four new sheets
      prepared (<hi rend="super">i</hi>, a, Q-R), and the remainder of the second issue combined
      with these to form a complete copy. As all the type for the first issue, excepting H and I,
      was still standing at the time the fourth issue (also titled "Second Edition") was ordered, it
      was corrected according to the author's latest desires, <pb n="003.191"/> then machined by a

      occasionally these differentiae are so minute that they escape notice unless attention is
      directed to them by evidence of a more conspicuous nature, such as that provided by the

      </table> Other cancels in Burke's <hi rend="italic">Appeal</hi> for which the figures provide
      no clue, however, are B5 (signed) and D8 (signed 'D7'). If there were no signature on the
      first of these to signify cancellation, it might be inferred, nevertheless, from the absence
      of a figure. All sheets except B have in their uncancelled state, presumably, two figures; B
      departs from the pattern by having only one. And as this is on the inner forme (B8-&sect;),
      the other was very probably on the outer forme of B5 in its original state.</p>
     <p>Where there is, as in the <hi rend="italic">Appeal</hi>, an evident pattern of figures, any
      irregularity should be regarded with as much suspicion as duplicate figures. In Johnson's <hi
       rend="italic">Thoughts on the Late Transactions</hi>, to cite again an oft-quoted example,
      the missing figure in sheet K of the first impression (see p. 183) is doubtless explained by
      the existence of a cancel at K2. Similarly in Edward Young's <hi rend="italic">Centaur Not
       Fabulous</hi> (1755), an octavo, various deviations from customary practice are observed: the
      register of signatures through &dollar;4 for all sheets, except N2 and R2; and the insertion
      of a single figure for each sheet, except T and 2C, which have two, and E and U, which have
      none. As the copies examined have all been tightly rebound, corollary evidence is not easily
      obtained; but the occasional presence of stubs in some exemplars allows a provisional
      conclusion that this book contains at least five cancels&mdash;N1.2, R1.2, and T8 or
      U1&mdash;and probably has several more, or perhaps a complete resetting, in sheets E, T, and
      2C.</p>
     <p>Like the grouping of figures discussed in the previous section, the appearance or
      disappearance of figures is not always a certain sign of abnormality. To the several instances
      of this in which cancellation is confirmed, we may add several more which seem to indicate a
      cancellation that has not occurred. The first, Chesterfield's <hi rend="italic">Vindication of
       the Case of the Hanover Troops</hi> (1743, 8<hi rend="super">0</hi> in half-sheets), has a
      figure 1 entered at D3<hi rend="super">v</hi> of the initial issue, the same 1 and another at
       D4<hi rend="super">v</hi> of the reissue (reimpression).<ref target="f003.10.43" n="43"><hi
        rend="super">43</hi></ref> As this <pb n="003.194"/> pamphlet was printed by half-sheet
      imposition, requiring only one figure to a forme, the presence of a second calls for
      explanation. And the only plausible one is that upon the return of the forme for a reissue,
      the pressman, perhaps realizing that he was subject to a fine for working without figures,
      <ref target="f003.10.44" n="44"><hi rend="super">44</hi></ref> looked about for the symbol of
      the previous man, and not finding it, inserted his own at D4<hi rend="super">v</hi>. Had he
      looked on the other side of the forme, we may presume, he would not only have found the
      figure, but discovered it to be his.</p>
     <p>Another appears in a cheap reprint of Charles Shadwell's <hi rend="italic">Fair Quaker of
       Deal</hi> (1769, 12<hi rend="super">0</hi>) where, curiously enough, two figures, a 2 and a
      4, are found on B11. Quite possibly&mdash;my conjecture rests on a single copy (NcD)&mdash;one
      man replaced another at press and failed to remove the figure belonging to his predecessor. A
      third example, evident in Fielding's <hi rend="italic">Voyage to Lisbon</hi>, is more
      appropriately considered in the next section.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">Imposition</hi>. When the format of a book is for any reason subject to
      various interpretations, the figures should provide a clue to the disposition of the pages
      within a given forme, and thus identify the process employed. For the normal method of
      half-sheet imposition, in which all the pages for a signature are placed within the same
      chase, the process, involving the use of a single machine, is revealed by a single figure in
      each gathering. For the alternate method, requiring an arrangement of two successive outer
      formes in one chase, the corresponding inner formes in another, the process, involving two
      presses or two distinct operations on the same press, would be occasionally signified by two
      figures, both of which will appear in one of the half sheets, none in the second, or one in a
      certain forme of the first, the other in the <hi rend="italic">obverse</hi> forme of the
      second. Again, as with all of my remarks concerning the figures, these generalizations have
      exceptions. One, Chesterfield's <hi rend="italic">Vindication</hi>, has already been mentioned
      as an instance of accidental duplication in the figures. Another, possibly, occurs in
      Fielding's second-printed, first-published edition of the <hi rend="italic">Voyage to
       Lisbon</hi> (1755), a duodecimo with its final gathering <pb n="003.195"/> imposed as a
      half-sheet and figured N3<hi rend="super">v</hi>(i)7, N4<hi rend="super">v</hi>(o)2. Here we
      would expect, for one gathering, imposition according to the first method, but find,
      apparently, the arrangements required by the second. Perhaps, if the figures are a reliable
      indication, the second half-sheet produced was used in another book.</p>
     <p>In duodecimoes the manner of imposition can be determined, in most instances, by the
      position of the figures. Normally these will be found only at the most convenient point of
      insertion, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, at the <hi rend="italic">exposed</hi> foot of unsigned
      pages at either end of the forme. If the pages are, conveniently, of an outer rank, but so
      positioned that their headlines are exposed, the feet of these pages are as inaccessible as
      those for the inner rank, and thus remain unfigured. To illustrate the arrangement of the
      pages in the impositions usually described (<hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
       >d</hi> below), possible variations in these arrangements, and the probable location of the
      figures in all varieties, I present the following data for the outer formes: <figure
       entity="sb031951"/> Practically all eighteenth-century books of duodecimo format were imposed
      as described under (a); some few, as for example those discussed below, have sheets
      accidentally imposed, it would seem, in the manner of (b) or (c); but none, so far as I have
      observed, were imposed as indicated by (d).</p>
     <p>One instance of disarranged imposition appears in a reprint of <pb n="003.196"/> Thomas
      Southerne's <hi rend="italic">Oroonoko</hi> (printed for C. Bathurst and others, 1776), in
      which sheet B is aberrantly signed through &dollar;6 (not &dollar;5, as normally) and figured
       7<hi rend="super">v</hi>(i)3, 10<hi rend="super">v</hi>(o)2. The added signature as well as
      the location of the figures suggests (b) as the manner of imposition. Very probably the rank
      of leaves 5&mdash;8 was not discovered to be misplaced until the outer forme of B had been
      partially machined. Then, to avoid wastage, the inner was imposed in the same manner, and a
      signature added to &dollar;6 so that the binder would be certain, whatever forme was up, to
      sect the lower and not the upper third of the sheet.</p>
     <p>Other instances of irregularity, but only in the location of the figures, are implicit in
      Mandeville's <hi rend="italic">Fable of the Bees. Part II</hi> (1730),<ref target="f003.10.45"
       n="45"><hi rend="super">45</hi></ref> where an asterisk is inserted at M10<hi rend="super"
       >v</hi>, and in Smollett's <hi rend="italic">Humphry Clinker</hi> (second edition, 1771),
      where there are the following discrepancies from the normal pattern: F11<hi rend="super"
       >v</hi>(i)4, F10<hi rend="super">v</hi>(o)7; H8(i)4, H9(o)7; and M4<hi rend="super"
      >v</hi>(o)7. All of these except F conform, again, to (b); and F, apparently, to (c). For
      these the evidence of aberration becomes less certain, of course, when it rests on the figures
      alone, and may be explicable on other grounds at present undisclosed. (Outer 11 and 12 would
      be conjoined whether imposition is [a] or [c].)</p>
     <p>One example of the confusion that may result when the figures are abnormally placed in a
      normal imposition appears in the first-published edition of Fielding's <hi rend="italic"
       >Voyage to Lisbon</hi> (1755), a book of many bibliographical mysteries, not all of which
      have as yet been fathomed. In this all gatherings have two figures, one for each forme, except
      E, F, and G, each of which has three: <figure entity="sb031961"/> If the figures in the inner
      rank were not duplicated in the outer, we might suppose, as for <hi rend="italic">Humphry
       Clinker</hi>, that the first two sheets are instances of (b), the third of (c). Since the
      figures are reiterated, however, and since the chainlines for all leaves are contiguous with
      those for their normal counterparts, we must discount, not only this possibility, but another
      pertaining to <pb n="003.197"/> cancellation. A third conjecture, that these three gatherings
      were imposed by 4's and 8's to dispose of split sheet remainders, must also be dismissed; for
      if this were the procedure, then F would have two figures on the inner four-leaf segment to
      represent the work of a single press, and only one on the outer eight-leaf segment to
      represent the work of two. Thus we are perforce reduced to the comment that these figures must
      reflect some irregularity, not in the production of the book, but in the assignments for its
      production. Perhaps two agents were involved, the compositor, who accidentally inserts the
      figures in the middle rank of pages as he imposes them, and the pressman, who fails to
      discover them in the outer ranks, where they belong, and therefore figures again, number 1 at
       E12<hi rend="super">v</hi>, number 2 at F5<hi rend="super">v</hi> and G8.</p>
     <p>Though the figures raise, in the <hi rend="italic">Voyage to Lisbon</hi>, an intriguing
      little problem which may not be decided to the satisfaction of all, they do provide the means
      for solving one of much greater consequence. Excluding those in the inner rank of E, F, and G,
      which are demonstrably superfluous, and those appearing in I and K, which ambiguously identify
      either (a) or (d) imposition [I7<hi rend="super">v</hi>(i)3, I12<hi rend="super">v</hi>(o)7;
       K7<hi rend="super">v</hi>(i)3, K12<hi rend="super">v</hi>(o)2], the ones remaining are
      invariably disposed in locations accessible only for imposition with cutting (a). The
      watermarks, however, seem to indicate the alternate method without cutting (d). These are
      located, in each gathering, at the outer margin, half-way down the page, and overlapping
      leaves 9 and 10, their approximate position for the latter method. Between the two kinds of
      evidence we must choose, I am now convinced, that afforded by the figures, and explain the
      other as uncommon paper of foreign make, probably Genevan, with the watermark in the <hi
       rend="italic">middle</hi> of the sheet.<ref target="f003.10.46" n="46"><hi rend="super"
        >46</hi></ref> In this unusual position it <pb n="003.198"/> appears exactly at the location
      described for the sheets of the <hi rend="italic">Voyage to Lisbon</hi> and verifies the
      imposition which the figures certify as (a). Thus the information to be derived from the
      figures is completely justified and leads to a conclusion which might not have been
      forthcoming had it been ignored.</p>
     <p>From these several demonstrations of the value of press figures in various phases of
      bibliographical analysis it is obvious that they are entitled to consideration whenever they
      appear in eighteenth-century books. In many instances they constitute the only convenient
      procedure for disclosing hidden variants, "presumed editions,"<ref target="f003.10.47" n="47"
        ><hi rend="super">47</hi></ref> and sophisticated or mixed copies,<ref target="f003.10.48" n="48"><hi rend="super">48</hi></ref> 
       the only practicable method for detecting and
      deciding problems at present unknown or unresolved, the only expedient means for selecting and
      organizing the material to be studied in any investigation, and for describing the exact
      nature of that material in the bibliographical record. Their presence in the record may not
      always be informative, but their omission must inevitably deny the scholar the opportunity of
      confirming the research of others and seriously inhibit his own.</p>

     <head>ADDENDUM</head>
     <p>The recent publication of Mr. Philip Gaskell's article on "Eighteenth-century Press Numbers"
       [<hi rend="italic">Library</hi>, 5th ser., IV (1950), 249-61] allows me the privilege of
      anticipating, in his commentary, some of the criticism which may be evoked by my own account.
      Again I feel constrained to remark that the exclusive interpretation offered by Mr. Gaskell,
      like the one ventured by Mr. Knotts, cannot prevail against the conflicting testimony of <pb
       n="003.199"/> the headlines. Perhaps information other than this may be found to support the
      ambiguous intimations of the figures&mdash;such as that recorded in the printers' ledgers, for
      instance&mdash;but until it is forthcoming I shall continue to refer to the corollary evidence
      now available, and to reaffirm my conviction (1) that Kaye's theory is, essentially, the only
      one that comprehends all the facts; (2) that the presence of an anonymous pressman need not,
      therefore, be presumed for all unfigured sheets; (3) that reiterated figures in both formes of
      a sheet cannot be regarded as the idiosyncrasy of a compositor or foreman (a surmise which
      overlooks the strangely intermittent indication of what would be a persistent trait), but
      rather as the sign of full-press operation or of the termination of simultaneous printing; (4)
      that a shift in the position of a figure does not necessarily signify reimposition; or
      conversely, (5) that the appearance of a second figure in the same position as the first may
      not result from the transfer of the forme, during the course of an impression, to another
      machine. If one recognizes the probabilities which seem to be confirmed by the examples that I
      have cited, first, that the figures designate the man and not the machine, and secondly, that
      the figures may be tied up with the letterpress between impressions, then it can be maintained
      that the occasional appearance of an alternate but identically positioned figure in some
      sheets usually indicates a replacement at the same press, and the appearance of this figure in
      all sheets, a subsequent impression at other presses. Moreover, the association of the figure
      with the man also permits a rational explanation of the large numbers in a few works, such as
      the '22' which Mr. Gaskell found in Mrs. Piozzi's <hi rend="italic">Observations on a
       Journey</hi> (1789). Actually, Strahan, the printer, may have owned only seven or eight
      presses and assigned to each three or more men working in shifts.</p>
     <p>Despite our several disagreements, Mr. Gaskell and I concur in rearranging the order and
      reducing the number of impressions which Mr. Knotts devised for the variants of <hi
       rend="italic">The Beggar's Opera</hi> (1728). But where Mr. Gaskell, as a consequence of his
      premise concerning the variable figures, supposes only one reimposition, and thus limits the
      total impressions to two&mdash;constituting for the first, the groups he labels A&mdash;C, for
      the second, D&mdash;G &mdash; I wish to defer a commitment on those described as D&mdash;E
      (corresponding <pb n="003.200"/> to the miscellaneous group 3 in my review) until their status
      has been determined by the headlines. Meanwhile, it should be mentioned that, in addition to
      the variants already disclosed, several others have been reported. These I describe according
      to Mr. Gaskell's classification. <table>

       as well as the pressmen, and thus serve as a means for insuring the return of the wrought-off
       formes to the proper persons for distribution. This would be a plausible assumption were it
       not for the fact that the figures are highly variable, not present in some formes of an
       impression, constant in others, shifting in still others, and changing in every forme of a
       reimpression. Thus for any one setting of type, presumably the work of a single compositor,
       there may be in the course of its use as many as eight different figures, all identifying the
       succession of men at press, but none the man who composed the type. An exceptional case is
       evident, however, in the initial gathering of Mandeville's <hi rend="italic">Fable of the
        Bees. Part II</hi> (1730, 12<hi rend="super">0</hi>&mdash;the second edition?), where a
       figure &Dagger; appears at the foot of every page from A7 to A11<hi rend="super">v</hi>.
       Professor James L. Clifford has offered what seems to be the only reasonable explanation for
       this phenomenon. An apprentice has composed these ten pages and is held responsible for

       several definitions set forth in Dr. Bowers' <hi rend="italic">Principles of Bibliographical
        Description</hi> (1949). From the available evidence concerning planned overprints of
       certain eighteenth-century books, I am, however, unwilling to abandon McKerrow's
       classification of these as "editions" and to assume with Dr. Bowers (p. 48) that they
       represent states. For books printed before 1695 it is no doubt true that since legal
       restrictions operated to prevent an excessive issue of copies from a single setting, the
       necessary resetting for overprints "presumably occurred," as Dr. Bowers remarks, "during
       'continuous printing' and concerns the text of only a small portion of the book." But the
       lapse of these restrictions brought about a modification of procedure which is evident in
       numerous books of a later period. In one, Gibbon's <hi rend="italic">Decline and Fall</hi>
       (cited by Dr. Bowers [p. 48, n. 7] as an unusual case), the resetting admittedly involves
       only about one-third of the text; but this amounts to the impression of 500 sheets on
       fifty-four formes&mdash;or to some 13,500 perfected sheets, in all, which could hardly have
       been processed simultaneously with the work on the original issue. In a second the resetting,
       comprising 50% (160 pages) of the text, was certainly not undertaken until <hi rend="italic"
        >after</hi> the overprinting of the remainder, for the author was demanding publication of
       the first issue at the earliest possible date. In a third, resetting constitutes 60% (192
       pages) of the text, and some of this was continuously impressed for the "third edition." And
       for others, as in the several editions of Pope's <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi>, and of <hi
        rend="italic">The New Ministry</hi> cited in the text, printing apparently proceeded up to
       the last sheet or so before resetting or reimpression was begun. Quite obviously, then, the
       time-consuming process of recomposing and reprinting early sheets for most, if not all of
       these books must have been subsequent to the initial publication of the copies produced
       according to the original plan. Thus the evidence for this period is sufficiently complete, I
       believe, to deny the necessity and the practice of resetting during continuous printing, and
       to reject the designation of "states" for books in this category. Actually, if this
       designation must apply, it will be necessary to subsume under these "states" variant
       impressions and other "substates"; and this is quite impractical. I have, therefore, accorded
       such books the status of editions.</p></note>

     <p>BY 1800 BINNY AND RONALDSON WERE DOING rather well for themselves financially. It was only
      four years before that James Ronaldson, deciding not to rebuild his fire-gutted bakery, had
      become the partner of Archibald Binny, just arrived from Edinburgh equipped with the skill and
      tools of type founding. The two men formed an excellent combination: one the business man, the
      other the craftsman, and both were canny Scots. After a short period of partnership they
      absorbed the New York foundry of Adam Mappa and later expanded their own shop in Philadelphia.
      At the turn of the nineteenth century they owned the only foundry in the United States casting
      English letters.</p>
     <p>But like most of the other manufacturers of this period, they constantly faced the problem
      of maintaining an adequate supply of raw materials. Although some of these could be procured
      in America, many others had to be imported, so Congress, attempting to encourage native
      manufacturing, admitted a number of items duty free. Importation, however, was a
      time-consuming process and an expensive one; if, like antimony, the material did not appear on
      the free list, the duty to be paid was large. When Binny and Ronaldson received approximately
      three tons in 1800, they were charged the sum of &dollar;161.54 as duty. The partners paid the
      bill, but not without protest. On January 8, 1802, this petition<ref target="f003.11.01"

      <p>That your Petitioners have established the Manufacture of Printing Types in Philadelphia,
       in the prosecution of which they have had many obstacles to encounter, which by industry,
       attention, and &oelig;conomy, they have hitherto surmounted&mdash;That the high price of the
       Metals of which their Types are composed, together with the difficulty of procuring some of
       them, particularly Regulus of Antimony, is a considerable bar to the success of their
       establishment &mdash;That after many unsuccessful endeavours to procure Regulus, or Antimony
       from which it might be extracted, in this Country, they have been obliged to send to Europe
       for it, and with much difficulty and after long delay they succeeded in procuring a quantity
       of it in London at a very high price, which for the sake of greater security they directed to
       be shipped in two different vessels, and it was accordingly sent out on board the Susanna and
       the Pennsylvania, who both arrived in the Delaware in October 1800&mdash;That Regulus of
       Antimony being a new material, not to be procured in this Country and imported for the
       express purpose of being Manufactured here, they did not expect any duty would have been
       charged upon its importation, and therefore applied to the Collector of this Port who
       informed them that he had no power to remit the Duties&mdash;That they then applied to Oliver

     <p>Such a petition was not unusual and the House referred it, along with others, to the
      Committee of Commerce and Manufactures. The Committee must have studied these petitions very
      carefully for on February 10, 1802, it submitted a detailed report recommending various
      changes in the tariff. The Committee stated that <q>such manufactures as are obviously capable
       of affording to the United States an adequate supply of their several and respective objects,
       ought to be promoted by the aid of Government. Two modes of administering this aid have
       presented themselves to your committee: The one, to permit, free of duty, the importation of
       such gross articles as are essential to those manufactures. The other, to impose higher
       duties on such articles (on importation) as can be supplied by our own citizens to advantage.
       <ref target="f003.11.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></q> And in this vein it
      recommended that the duty on regulus of antimony be lifted and that the duty on imported
      printing types be twenty per cent <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi>&mdash;an increase of seven
      and a half per cent.</p>
     <pb n="003.210"/>
     <p>The news might well have remained buried in the list of proposed duties on such items as fur
      hats, glue, tarred cordage, pickled fish, and dried fish. But to one journalist, William
      Duane, publisher of the Philadelphia <hi rend="italic">Aurora</hi>, who was in Washington
      hoping to get the government contract for printing and stationery, this was exciting
      information. In fact, it is probably true that the duty on type was increased at his
      suggestion. In 1800 he had married Margaret Bache, widow of Benjamin Franklin Bache, the owner
      of the <hi rend="italic">Aurora</hi> as well as of the type founding materials which Benjamin
      Franklin had brought from France in 1786. Thus Duane could appreciate the possibilities of
      establishing a lucrative type foundry once imported types were priced prohibitively high. He
      proceeded immediately to notify the <hi rend="italic">Aurora</hi>. Five days later, it printed
      the following: <q> From the Editor.<lb/>
       <hi rend="italic">Washington, February 10, 1802</hi>.<lb/> The duty on Antimony is taken
       off.<lb/> A duty on foreign types of 20 per cent. laid on.<ref target="f003.11.03" n="3"><hi
         rend="super">3</hi></ref><lb/>
      </q>
     </p>
     <p>This laconic communication set off a chain reaction which was felt in six cities. A
      narrative of the effects in chronological order would be confusing even if more scientific.
      Instead, they will be described city by city.</p>

     <head>Philadelphia</head>
     <p>On the day following the appearance of Duane's dispatch, Zachariah Poulson Jr.'s <hi
       rend="italic">American Daily Advertiser</hi> reprinted the second sentence and added a
      paragraph of editorial comment. It pointed to the fact that there was but one type foundry in
      the United States and that there were "perhaps not more than twelve persons employed."<ref
       target="f003.11.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> The <hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi>
      found it hard to understand why, since there were about three thousand persons who derived
      their support from the printing business, so "many Peters must be robbed to compensate
       Paul."<ref target="f003.11.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> On the evening of the same
      day, Samuel Relf's <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia Gazette</hi> called attention to this
      editorial <pb n="003.211"/> and noted that the increased duty "must materially retard the
      progress and perfection of the printing business."<ref target="f003.11.06" n="6"><hi
        rend="super">6</hi></ref></p>
     <p>The next day the <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia Gazette</hi> announced that it would publish
      a detailed consideration of the duty in the following issue.<ref target="f003.11.07" n="7"><hi
        rend="super">7</hi></ref> Then, launching the campaign, it devoted almost two columns to the
      attack. The editor stressed the fact that while Fry and Steele, of London, could furnish more
      than one hundred different sizes of English letters in addition to characters in many foreign
      languages, Binny and Ronaldson could not supply more than one twentieth of this amount. While
      he did not deny that the firm possessed the skill required to make the additional type, he
      noted that the cost of the matrices would have to be borne by the printer who ordered the
      type. Nevertheless, even <q>on the limitted (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) scale on which it is
       conducted, (the english, pica, long-primer and brevier forming at least nine tenths of the
       demand from them) these gentlemen, possessing a monopoly of the business in America, have, in
       a few years realised an handsome property.<ref target="f003.11.08" n="8"><hi rend="super"
         >8</hi></ref></q> At this point, the editor made a rather unfortunate error. He interpreted
      the duty to be an additional twenty per cent, not an increase to twenty per cent. After
      elaborating on the injustice of such an excessive amount, he accused Duane, a British subject,
      of instigating this increase and concluded with the lament that <q>our public councils should
       be disgraced by an adherence to the opinions or suggestions of an individual blinded by an
       inveterate hatred to the country to which he owes his birth and allegiance.<ref
        target="f003.11.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></q></p>
     <p>Meanwhile, the members of the book trade had been discussing the new tariff among
      themselves. Finding themselves in general agreement on the steps to be taken, they called for
      a meeting at Mr. Cameron's, on North Third St., at seven o'clock on Saturday, February
       twentieth.<ref target="f003.11.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> When they assembled,
      Mathew Carey was chosen chairman and John H. Oswald secretary. A committee was directed to
      draft a memorial to Congress, the chairman was requested to ask the representative in Congress
      to postpone action, <pb n="003.212"/> and the chairman was also requested to communicate the
      measures adopted to the printers and booksellers of Boston, New York, and Baltimore. After a
      resolution to publish the proceedings of the meeting,<ref target="f003.11.11" n="11"><hi
        rend="super">11</hi></ref> the members adjourned to meet and receive the memorial on Monday,
      February twenty-second.</p>
     <p>Duane, of course, did not neglect to answer the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>. His
      two-column reply included a brief resum&eacute; of English type founding, praise for the
      beautiful type of Binny and Ronaldson, as well as the statement that they employed more than
      twenty people.<ref target="f003.11.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> Some of his
      remarks emphasized his personal interest in the increased duty. He declared that there were
      three different foundries in America which were idle through want of protection; he referred
      to a foundry in Philadelphia which possessed matrices for every type from non-pareil to
      five-line Pica, with Greek, Hebrew, and other oriental characters and three hundred different
      species of typographical ornaments. And, in conclusion, he repeated that several founders
      would resume if provided with protection. The <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> printed its reply
      two days later. Its major point was that the Philadelphia foundry was in Duane's possession,
      having been acquired from Bache: "This is the clue, which at once unravels the mystery of his
       <hi rend="italic">pretended</hi> attachment to the encouragement of <hi rend="italic"
       >American manufactures</hi>!"<ref target="f003.11.13" n="13"><hi rend="super"
      >13</hi></ref></p>
     <p>The Philadelphia book trade continued its campaign, and two papers carried notices of book
      trade meetings in New York and Baltimore.<ref target="f003.11.14" n="14"><hi rend="super"
        >14</hi></ref> On March 8, 1802, the following petition was read in the House of
      Representatives: </p>
     <q>
      <p> To the Honorable the Members of the House of<lb/> Representatives of the United
       States,<lb/> The memorial of the undersigned Printers and<lb/> Booksellers of the City of
       Philadelphia,<lb/> Respectfully represents,<lb/>
      </p>
      <p>That your memorialists view with extreme concern a proposition which they understand is at
       present under the consideration of your Honorable body, for imposing an additional duty upon
       the importation of printing types&mdash;a <pb n="003.213"/> measure which they cannot but
       consider as a new proof of the paternal solicitude of the Legislature, extended to the infant
       manufactures of our country,&mdash;but against which your memorialists are urged by imperious
       considerations to remonstrate.</p>
      <p>That the encouragement of Domestic Manufactures is an object worthy of Legislative
       attention, your Memorialists readily acknowledge. They are, however, of opinion, which with
       all due deference is submitted, that in those instances where our own manufactures are
       incompetent to the current demand, it is both unwise and impolitic, to prevent, by excessive
       imposts, a necessary supply by importation from foreign countries</p>
      <p>Your memorialists beg leave to state, that there is, perhaps, no manufacture in our common
       country which so little requires the aid contemplated to be afforded by the duty in question,
       as that of Types. There is at present but one Foundry of English Type in operation within the
       Union, which they are warranted in saying is inadequate to the supply of the great and
       growing demand. The proposed duty will in no wise increase the capacity of supply and must
       operate merely, as a heavy and unequal burden on all persons mediately or immediately
       concerned in the printing business.</p>
      <p>Your Memorialists also beg leave respectfully to state that the present duty on the
       importation of Type, affords sufficient encouragement to the manufacture within the country,
       so that they are neither altogether dependent on a foreign nation for their supply, nor lie
       at the mercy of the manufacturers at home.</p>
      <p>Your memorialists forbear trespassing on the patience of the Legislature, and conclude with
       expressing a hope that your honorable body will take the premises into serious consideration,
       and adopt such measures therein as to your wisdom shall seem proper. And your memorialists,
       as in duty bound, will ever pray, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>

     <p>Within two days after Duane's dispatch appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Aurora</hi>, it was
      reprinted in at least three New York newspapers.<ref target="f003.11.15" n="15"><hi
        rend="super">15</hi></ref> The <pb n="003.214"/> following week, the New York editors
      printed the formal reports of the Philadelphia meeting<ref target="f003.11.16" n="16"><hi
        rend="super">16</hi></ref> and the <hi rend="italic">Daily Advertiser</hi> printed a short
      comment on the proposed duty. It called attention to the long article in the <hi rend="italic"
       >Philadelphia Gazette</hi>, and repeated the <hi rend="italic">Gazette's</hi> mistake in
      thinking that the duty was an <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> twenty per cent.<ref
       target="f003.11.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> By this time the trade, ready to go
      into action, requested the printers and booksellers to meet at the Old Coffee House at seven
      o'clock, Saturday evening, February twenty-seventh.<ref target="f003.11.18" n="18"><hi
        rend="super">18</hi></ref> According to the official report, Samuel Campbell was chosen
      chairman and George F. Hopkins, secretary. After the circular letter from Philadelphia was
      read, it was unanimously resolved to cooperate with the brethren of Philadelphia, and the
      Union. A petition to the House of Representatives was drafted, adopted, and ordered
       engrossed.<ref target="f003.11.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> The unofficial
      report, however, told a much more interesting story. Cheetham and Denniston's <hi
       rend="italic">American Citizen</hi> published it in the course of an article which defended
      the increase and which stated that Binny and Ronaldson opposed it because it would create
      competitors. According to the <hi rend="italic">Citizen</hi>: <q>The meeting consisted of <hi
        rend="italic">sixteen</hi> printers, booksellers, and <hi rend="italic">type importers</hi>.
       It was with some difficulty that a chairman was obtained. Mr. Samuel Campbell was at length
       prevailed upon to take it, and Mr. George F. Hopkins was appointed Secretary. Mr. James
       Swords opened the business of the meeting by reading a letter which he had received from the
       chairman and secretary of the meeting of the printers of Philadelphia. This letter merely
       stated what they had done, and invited their co-operation; it entered not into the merits of
       the proposed additional duty. Mr. Swords then stated that he had mentioned his reception of
       the letter <hi rend="italic">privately</hi> to Mr. <hi rend="italic">Pintard</hi>, (now
       editor of the Daily Advertiser) who had prepared a suitable remonstrance against the proposed
       increase of duty. Mr. Denniston asked for specific information of the nature of the
       meeting&mdash;what the additional duty proposed by the committee of commerce and manufacture
       against which they intended to petition? Mr. Lang, alias Lawyer Lang, then rose, and moved
       that Mr. Denniston should give to himself the information which he himself required, and
       instantly <hi rend="italic">dropt</hi> upon his chair. Finding that no information could be
       given him, Mr. Denniston produced the report of the committee of commerce and manufactures in
       which they propose an additional duty on types. This was read by the secretary. The meeting
       were <pb n="003.215"/> astonished. Because Mr. Duane stated that a duty of 20 per cent. would
       be laid on types, it had been conceived by the typo's present, that this meant 20 per cent.
        <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> duty, which added to the 12&frac12; now paid, makes
       32&frac12; per cent. Whereas the report proposes an <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> duty of
       7&frac12; per cent. only, which, if added to the 12&frac12; now paid, would make the whole
       duty on types amount to 20 per cent. On this misconception the meeting was called. It is
       probable the Philadelphia meeting laboured under the same error. Mr. Denniston examined the
       subject, and stated two grounds for enquiry. 1st. Whether the establishment of foundaries
       would not benefit the country? 2d. If so, what means ought to be adopted to give them
       efficacy? He was decidedly in favor of the legislature affording such aid as would enable us
       to cast our own types, and concluded that this aid ought to consist of an adequately
       increased duty on the importation of foreign types. Mr. James Swords acknowledged the
       correctness of Mr. Denniston's remarks, but was of opinion, that to establish foundaries
       sufficient to supply our wants was impracticable. After a few words in reply from Mr.
       Denniston, the Chairman very gravely, if not very <hi rend="italic">sagely</hi>, informed the
       meeting that they did not come there to <hi rend="italic">discuss</hi> the subject, but to
        <hi rend="italic">co-operate without discussion</hi> with their brethren of Philadelphia.
       Mr. Campbell and Mr. Swords are both importers of types, and, of course, interested in the
       non-increase of duty. Many of the Philadelphia meeting are also importers. This is sufficient
       to account for <hi rend="italic">their</hi> opposition. Discussion being thus closed, Mr.
       Pintard's memorial was read and passed in the affirmative with the exception of Mr.
       Denniston's vote. The memorial, however, underwent some alteration. It was written under the
       impression that the proposed increase of duty was 20 per cent; and as this was viewed as
       tantamount to a prohibition of the importation of foreign types, the memorial was couched in
       correspondent terms. The error being at length discovered it underwent a suitable alteration.
       The public are left to draw their own conclusions from this statement of <hi rend="italic"
        >true facts</hi>.<ref target="f003.11.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref></q> Two
      days later, the <hi rend="italic">American Citizen</hi> reprinted Duane's long <hi
       rend="italic">Aurora</hi> article<ref target="f003.11.21" n="21"><hi rend="super"
       >21</hi></ref> and on the same day the <hi rend="italic">Evening Post</hi> defended the
      attack on the duty, declaring that the only persons who oppose them are Duane and Cheetham,
      "two foreigners." It concluded with a jeer at Thomas Jefferson as well as at his "protege,"
      Duane: <q>Blest era of philosophism and philanthropy, which knows no distinction between
       natives and foreigners, citizens and aliens, other than forever to give an indiscriminate
       preference to the latter over the former!<ref target="f003.11.22" n="22"><hi rend="super"
         >22</hi></ref></q></p>
     <p>And so on March 8, 1802, this petition was read in the House of Representatives: </p>
     <pb n="003.216"/>
     <q>
      <p>To the Honorable the House of Representatives of the United States;</p>
      <p>The Memorial of the Printers and Booksellers of the City of New York, respectfully
       sheweth,</p>
      <p>That, thro' the medium of the public papers and private correspondence, your memorialists
       have been informed that a proposition is now before your Honorable House for imposing a duty
       of Twenty per cent. on imported printing Types.</p>
      <p>Conceiving this measure to be highly impolitic in itself, as directly calculated to do
       extensive injury to all persons concerned in printing, and indirectly to tax every reader in
       the United States for the emolument of the few persons who are concerned in<ref
        target="f003.11.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref> the business of Type-founding,
       they trust your Hon. House will not give its sanction to a measure which, according to the
       practical knowledge, and the most diligent inquiry of your memorialists, they believe to be
       founded in error and fraught with extensive mischief.</p>
      <p>They beg leave to submit to your Honourable House, that at present there exists but one
       Type-Foundery<ref target="f003.11.24" n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref>&mdash;in the
       United States&mdash;that they presume it is wholly out of the power of this concern to supply
       a twentieth part of the demand from printers in America: That there are many species of
       letters not made at this foundery which are essentially necessary in order properly to
       conduct the printing business&mdash;That the existing duty of 12 1/2 per cent. on printing
       types appears to be amply sufficient as a <hi rend="italic">protecting</hi> duty to this
       manufacture, as the Foundery at present established in Philadelphia can afford to make and
       supply Types at a rate quite as reasonable as those imported from Europe.</p>
      <p>On these grounds your memorialists respectfully trust that your Honourable House, taking
       the premises into consideration, will not impose a further duty on Printing Types, which
       would almost amount to a prohibition; a result which your memorialists, from their
       professional knowledge and pursuits, are persuaded would operate as a public evil, and would
       materially and injuriously affect the whole business of Printing and Bookselling throughout
       the United States.</p>
      <p>All which is humbly submitted.<lb/> Signed in behalf of the associate meeting of the
       Printers and Booksellers of the City of New York, by</p>

     <p>The leading members of the book trade were not the only New Yorkers who protested. The
      Franklin Typographical Association, one of the earliest and least known of the typographical
      societies, forwarded this memorial, read in the House of Representatives on March 15, 1802: </p>
     <q>
      <p>To the Hon. the House of Representatives of the United States.</p>
      <p>The Memorial of the undersigned members of the Franklin Typographical Association of the
       City of New York respectfully sheweth . . .</p>
      <p>That your memorialists have been informed, through the medium of the Public Prints, that
       there is a proposition before your Honourable House, to impose a duty of twenty per cent. on
       imported Printing Types.</p>
      <p>Under a full conviction, that every measure entered into by your Honorable House is
       intended to benefit the Union, your memorialists beg leave to suggest the impropriety of the
       proposed duty, and hope to be able to show, that, so far from being a beneficial act, it
       would be highly injurious, not only to your memorialists, but to all persons whose
       occupations are connected with the Printing Business, either as Printers, Book-binders or
       Paper-makers . . .</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">First</hi>---Your memorialists beg leave to state, that the addition of
       7&frac12; per cent. would almost prohibit the importation of Types; and as the business of
       Type-founding is yet but in its infancy in the United States, (the present foundery in
       Philadelphia not being able to furnish a twentieth part of the Type in general use, and being
       totally destitute of the Oriental, and of almost all the ornamental characters) resort must
       be had to the measure of importing Books; a measure which the master-printers and Booksellers
       of New York, by forming themselves into an association, have been patriotically endeavoring
       to suppress, and which would, almost immediately, deprive two thirds of the Journeymen
       Printers in the United States, of their means of subsistence, not to mention the great number
       of Boys, who are at present learning the Printing business, on which they must hereafter
       depend for a livelihood.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Second</hi>---The business of Printing being very expensive to establish,
       from the high price of materials, very few of those, who are obliged to resort to
       journey-work when they become free, ever have it in their power to realize a capital
       sufficient to commence business on their own account; and the contemplated <pb n="003.218"/>
       additional duty, by enlarging the barrier, would still diminish their number, to the very
       great injury of the whole.</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Third</hi>---As the characters for Printing Books in the dead Languages
       cannot be had in the United States, nor is it reasonable to expect that they will be
       furnished for forty years to come; and as there are a number of other works which cannot be
       done without European materials, all such characters and materials, at least, must, of
       necessity, be imported from Europe. . . . The consequence would be, that the printing of such
       Books must either be relinquished, or they must be done at such an expense, as would render
       them dearer to purchasers, than those of the same kind imported. This would be a severe blow
       to printing in this country, rising, as it now is, rapidly, to excellence:&mdash;and, indeed,
       in a short time, almost every description of Books must be had from Europe; which would not
       only distress your memorialists, in a very severe degree, but destroy, in a great measure,
       the business of Book-binding, and Paper-making, and give a heavy check to the dissemination
       of learning and useful knowledge.</p>
      <p>Your memorialists beg leave, also, respectfully to state, that as no art is more conducive
       to the promotion of learning, liberty and happiness, than that of Printing, so it would seem
       the policy of the government of our country, to leave unshackled every article appertaining
       to it; and as the taking off the duty on Regulus of Antimony will be a very considerable
       encouragement to any foundery that may be established in the United States; and as the
       present Philadelphia foundery has been, and must still continue to be liberally encouraged;
       and, in fact, as Types may be here considered as a <hi rend="italic">raw material</hi> to <hi
        rend="italic">manufacture books</hi>; in order to promote the manufacture within ourselves,
       and thereby to prevent the importation of foreign Editions, we humbly submit to your
       Honourable House the propriety of taking off, altogether, the duty on Printing Types, or at
       least of reducing it, so that it may not, in any degree, impede the importation of them; and
       of laying an additional one, even more than equivalent, on imported Books, for the
       encouragement of the printing business. . . . If such encouragement be given, no doubt can be
       entertained of its being fully adequate, in a very few years, to the supply of not only the
       ordinary works of instruction, and amusement, but of the higher order of classics. But if
       shackled in the way which has been proposed in your Honourable House, your memorialists
       foresee an end of enterprize in Printing, and will probably have to seek some other means of
       obtaining subsistence.&mdash;To take off the duty on Types, and to lay an additional one on
       Books, your memorialists deem not only a wise, but a necessary measure, as the number of
       people now employed in the printing business, is very large, and is daily increasing.</p>
      <p>Your memorialists beg leave further to remark, that all those who have arrived at any
       degree of eminence in the business of Type-founding in Europe, have so great a share of
       encouragement at home, as to render it highly improbable that any of them would emigrate to
       this country: Therefore we must expect, <pb n="003.219"/> at best, if the duty takes place,
       to have those only (if any should come) who have been but newly established, or who might
       make their first commencement after their arrival here: consequently, we should still labor
       under the heavy disadvantage of having but imperfect founderies, and be obliged still to pay
       the heavy duty; or, which is more probable, import the Books which we should be unable to
       print. And your memorialists would add, for the information of those of your Honorable House
       who may not be acquainted with the nature of the Type founding business, or may not have had
       leisure to make sufficient inquiry, that it is such as to require, at, least, from fifteen to
       twenty years, before a foundery can be made in any manner perfect: And the truth of this
       assertion will appear manifest, when it is considered, that the foundery of Mesrs. Binney
       &amp; Ronaldson, in Philadelphia, had been established in Europe for several years previous
       to its removal to this country, which took place at least six years ago, and they cannot now
       furnish a single perfect fount of common Type, owing to the labor and time indispensably
       necessary to cut the matrixes, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;</p>
      <p>Independent of these considerations, it must be obvious to all; that if the additional duty
       is laid on, the domestic founders will greatly enhance the price of their Types, which must,
       of course, occasion a rise on all kinds of Printing Work, and operate as a tax on every
       reader; from the student in college, to the peruser of the daily newspapers, throughout the
       United States.&mdash;</p>

     <p>With characteristic caution, the Bostonians moved slowly but steadily. The announcement of
      the proposed tariff revision appeared nine days after it was printed in the <hi rend="italic"
       >Aurora</hi>.<ref target="f003.11.25" n="25"><hi rend="super">25</hi></ref> And it was <pb
       n="003.220"/> not until the ninth of March that a book trade meeting voted to present a
      memorial to Congress.<ref target="f003.11.26" n="26"><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref> Three days
      later, the Boston Franklin Association passed a similar resolution.<ref target="f003.11.27"
       n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref> Quite properly, they might have considered their task
      completed, but they continued to keep the public aware of the controversy. Two papers
      reprinted the report of the Committee of Commerce and Manufactures<ref target="f003.11.28"
       n="28"><hi rend="super">28</hi></ref> and as late as March twenty-fourth, the <hi
       rend="italic">Centinel</hi> reprinted an attack on the duty which originally appeared in
      Worcester a month before.<ref target="f003.11.29" n="29"><hi rend="super">29</hi></ref></p>
     <p>On March 25, 1802, the following resolutions were read in the House of Representatives: </p>
     <q>
      <p>To the Honourable the Senate, and the Honourable the House of Representatives, of the
       United States in Congress assembled.</p>
      <p>The Memorial of the Subscribers, Printers, Booksellers, and others, residing in Boston and
       its Vicinity, most respectfully represents,</p>
      <p>That they have been informed from Sources which they have cause to fear are correct, that
       it is in Contemplation of a Committee of your Honourable Body to propose that a considerable
       additional Duty be laid on the Importation of Printing Types.</p>
      <p>Considering it as a Fact that such is the Intention of your Committee, your Memorialists
       feel themselves necessitated to lay before your honourable Body the Reasons which induce them
       to conceive that the Measure, if adopted, will be oppressive to them and injurious to their
       Country.</p>
      <p>1<hi rend="super">st</hi>. Because at present, they humbly conceive, it would be impossible
       to procure a Supply of Types in the United States, equal to the necessary Demand for them;
       more especially when it is considered that there is a necessity for a much greater variety of
       founts than can be manufactured in America, in order that the productions of the American
       press may hold any reasonable competition with those of Europe&mdash;</p>
      <p>2<hi rend="super">d</hi>. Because the additional duty, by enhancing the expense on Imported
       Types, will probably induce the American type founders to advance their present prices in
       proportion to the additional expense of importation; so that, in fact, it will be burthening
       several hundred citizens, and cramping an important and interesting manufacture, merely to
       benefit an individual type foundery, or, at most, perhaps only two; the principal of which,
       has already, we learn, more orders <pb n="003.221"/> than it can execute; and which, having
       no competition, will assume a monopoly of the business. On the disadvantages to a community
       of such monopolies, we trust, we need not enlarge.</p>
      <p>3<hi rend="super">d</hi>. Because your memorialists conceive, that the business of making
       types, in the United States, with a suitable capital, can now be carried on to more advantage
       than in Great Britain; for the present charges of importation on them amount to about 25 P<hi
        rend="super">r</hi>.Ct. and the raw materials of which types are made, or old type metal,
       can probably be procured nearly as cheap as in England; so that, excepting the extra price of
       labour, in America, the founders here may now command 25 per cent. more for their types, than
       the same types would cost at the European founderies, provided they are equally good.</p>
      <p>4<hi rend="super">th</hi>. Because your memorialists respectfully conceive, that, under any
       circumstances, it is injurious to the public interest, and a discouraging precedent, to lay
       duties on articles used in necessary manufactures, which amount nearly to a prohibition,
       merely to enable individuals to manufacture, and make a large profit on any
       commodity:&mdash;it is, they conceive, oppressing the <hi rend="italic">many</hi> for the
       benefit of the <hi rend="italic">few</hi>.</p>
      <p>5<hi rend="super">th</hi>. Because your memorialists have been in the habit of experiencing
       under former impost laws, particularly those of Massachusetts previous to the establishment
       of the present government of the United States that printing types have been considered as
       the implements of an important manufacture, and as such deserving encouragement, and
       therefore they have either been admitted to be imported free of duty, or considered as a raw
       material, and subjected to the lowest rate of impost only; the Legislators of both the
       General and State Governments considering, in this indulgence, that without such
       encouragement the art of Printing would be embarrassed; that it was important, in a
       Republican Government, that Books and Newspapers should be afforded as low as possible, in
       order that they may be within the means of purchase of every citizen; and that it were much
       more essential to the interests of this country that the means of learning and information
       should be cheap, than that the single business of type-making should be taken under the
       patronage of Government.</p>
      <p>6<hi rend="super">th</hi>. Because, your memorialists conceive, that every measure which
       has a tendency to embarrass the art of Printing, not only discourages literature, and
       increases the expences of educating the rising generation, but is essentially injurious, in
       its operation, to the interests of the Bookinders (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>), Papermakers,
       and other manufacturers connected with them.&mdash;</p>
      <p>7<hi rend="super">th</hi>. Because, we cherish a hope, that there is sufficient patriotism
       in the body of Printers to encourage type founding in America, without any restrictive
       laws;&mdash;and we feel confident, when we assert, that no types will be imported, when they
       can be procured as perfect, and on as good terms, manufactured in the United States. The
       encouragement afforded to the foundery at Philadelphia is a proof in point:&mdash;and it is
       easy to demonstrate, that a number of inconveniences, <pb n="003.222"/> / of which procuring
       imperfections in founts is not the least / arise from the importation of types from <hi
        rend="italic">Europe</hi>. The only plea for the additional duty, which has come to the
       knowledge of your memorialists, is, that the price of types in Great Britain will be reduced
       by the Peace. This we readily believe and hope; but we respectfully enquire, will not Peace
       in Europe also reduce the price of labour in the United States; and thus enable the American
       type founder more advantageously to prosecute his business, and if he imports his raw
       materials from Europe, will not their prices also be reduced? especially as we learn with
       pleasure that the duty on antimony is to be taken off.</p>
      <p>8<hi rend="super">th</hi>. Because your memorialists conceive, that such are the demands
       for types on the founderies in Great Britain, and so few the number of those founderies
       therein; that no fears need be entertained that English types will be sent to this country,
       for a market, with a view to injure the American founding: a number of your memorialists now
       find it difficult to have any considerable order expeditiously answered at the English
       founderies. For these reasons, and many others, which we trust will readily suggest
       themselves to your honourable body, your memorialists earnestly request, that no additional
       duty may be laid upon the importation of Printing Types. And as in duty bound will ever
       pray.</p>

      <p>To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in
       Congress assembled.</p>
      <p>The subscribers, members of the "Boston Franklin Association," journeymen Printers of
       Boston;&mdash;beg leave with all due respect and consideration, to present the following
       Memorial:&mdash;</p>
      <p>---</p>
      <p>---Placed, by Providence, in a land that fosters the civil and political rights of
       freemen;&mdash;in a country that has built its liberties and happiness upon social
       intercourse, justice, and knowledge;&mdash;and whose citizens enjoy the superior privilege,
       at all times, in a proper manner, to express their sentiments on public measures, whether
       they be actually adopted, or merely proposed:---Considering that "such Manufactures as are
       obviously capable of affording to the United States an adequate supply of their several and
       respective objects, ought to be promoted by the aid of Government:"&mdash;but when such
       domestic Manufactures are not "obviously capable" of supplying the various <pb n="003.223"/>
       and necessary demands of the country; should they be so far preferred as to injure the best
       interests of those classes of society, who are, and from existing local circumstances must
       continue to be dependent for some time to come on foreign Manufactures?&mdash;Laudable as is
       the intention of Government, to afford prompt and friendly assistance to our own
       Manufactures, in preference to those of foreign countries; we yet feel confident they will
       first consult their nature, their expediency, and their utility.</p>
      <p>---Fully impressed with these general truths; and having observed that your Committee of
       Commerce and Manufactures have proposed "that it is expedient to impose a duty, in future, of
       20 per cent. ad valorem on Printing Types;" we should be wanting in justice to ourselves, and
       perhaps to our common country, did we not promptly and respectfully remonstrate; and on
       principles, we trust, that even those who petitioned to have the additional duty laid on,
       cannot, but consent to as just and equitable.</p>
      <p>---Having a perfect knowledge of the relative branches that constitute our profession; and
       of course knowing what materials are necessary to its use, whether for elegance, convenience,
       or durability;&mdash;we feel assured, that the Philadelphia Type Foundery could not possibly
       furnish either the quantity or the quality requisite:&mdash;nor could it be able to afford
       those numerous improvements which we may receive from Europe; and which are most essential,
       not only to our interest, but the typographical character of the United States.</p>
      <p>---as well, in our opinion, might an additional or burthensome duty be laid on foreign hemp
       and cotton, because, in some small part of this country, it <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be
       raised:&mdash;Those States, who <hi rend="italic">could not</hi> raise the articles, could
       not feel greater embarrassment or injury, than the proposed additional duty on Types would
       affect Printers, and others concerned:&mdash;for as the non-producing States would have to
       pay whatever price was demanded, and the consumers also have to suffer by the inferiority and
       want of the articles;&mdash;in a similar manner the proposed additional duty on Types would
       affect us, and through us the community at large.</p>
      <p>---Whoever <hi rend="italic">is</hi> acquainted with the nature of our business, will
       undoubtedly be fully sensible, that the duty proposed goes to sap if not destroy its most
       respectable and useful existence;&mdash;that, particularly to young men, like us, about
       entering business, after a laborious, and not far above penurious apprenticeship, it
       threatens to annihilate our prospects as future masters and as happy and useful members of
       society:&mdash;while our country itself reaps no essential benefit, but actually suffers;
       perhaps without receiving an honor for maintaining, by heavy duty, a trifling and partial
       manufacture, which, without competitors, would not only monopolize to itself; but tend to
       cause Europeans, who must be acquainted with the futility and barreness of our foundery, to
       encrease their demands;&mdash;and thus place our avocation in an impoverished, fatal
       situation.</p>
      <p>---If our country has derived any glory from the freedom of inquiry <pb n="003.224"/>
       permitted; if it has become, like Rome and Athens, celebrated for its general literature; if,
       in short, knowledge ought not to be taxed, and its circulation thereby impeded, if not
       annihilated:&mdash;then your Memorialists conceive, that they, the promulgators, ought not to
       suffer in an occupation, so necessary, and so important;&mdash;particularly as their
       materials were formerly free of all duty, and merely considered as the tools of
       mechanics.</p>
      <p>---From these considerations, and others too numerous to particularize; your Memorialists
       humbly pray and hope, That the proposed additional duty on foreign printing Types, be not
       laid on, as recommended.</p>

       soon as possible; and as several members who have not signed it, are either absent, or cannot
       be obtained for signature perhaps in reason; it has been thought most prudent and eligible to
       forward it in its present state.</p>

     <p>As soon as the notice of the Philadelphia meeting reached Baltimore, it was printed with the
      following paragraph appended: <q>As no time ought to be lost in arresting the progress of a
       bill which aims so deadly a blow at one of the most flourishing mechanic arts in this
       country, those interested in this city should be early in co-operating with their brethren of
       Philadelphia. A meeting therefore of the printers, booksellers, paper-makers, book-binders
       and stationers, of this city, is requested at James Bryden's Fountain Inn, on Friday evening
       next at 6 o'clock&mdash;All of whom will, more immediately or remotely, be affected by the
       operation of the contemplated duty.<ref target="f003.11.30" n="30"><hi rend="super"
        >30</hi></ref></q> At the meeting, Samuel Butler, Vincent Bonsal, and Matthew Brown were
      appointed to prepare a memorial for approval the following evening.<ref target="f003.11.31"
       n="31"><hi rend="super">31</hi></ref> After it was approved, it was set up in type and
      forwarded to Congress in print, the only one presented in this fashion. It was read in the
      House of Representatives on March 8, 1802: </p>

      <p>United States <hi rend="italic">of</hi> America;</p>
      <p>The Subscribers, Printers and others, of the City of Baltimore, who feel themselves
       affected by the additional duty which they learn is contemplated to be laid on imported
       Printing Types,</p>
      <p><hi rend="italic">Beg leave respectfully to represent</hi>,</p>
      <p>That in the opinion of your Memorialists, any further duty on the Implements of Printing
       would at this time be impolitic, inasmuch as it would encrease the already too great
       embarrassments to young beginners in the manufacture of Books; and unjust, inasmuch as it
       would tax the many for the benefit of the few (for a mere individual) and oppress those whose
       taste, genius and exertions in a science, if such it may be termed, still in its infancy,
       have produced specimens of correctness and elegance in the new world, which begin to form a
       competition with the works of the long established and extensive printing houses of the
       old&mdash;That to encrease the present difficulty of obtaining those implements absolutely
       requisite, and which in the printing business are more expensive than perhaps in any other,
       and require even under present circumstances a considerable capital, will be to many, a
       serious interdiction of the trade, and must force the country for a long time to depend for
       the Book already <hi rend="italic">made and bound</hi>, upon those, who in a little while,
       with proper encouragement to the Press, can furnish only the <hi rend="italic">tools</hi>
       wherewith to make it.</p>
      <p>To check the progress of an art already sufficiently embarrassed, would also, your
       Memorialists believe, materially injure other and essential branches too, of mechanics in
       this country&mdash;those of the paper-maker, of the book-binder and of the skin-dresser. Nor
       could the book-seller repair the injury done <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, even by supplying
       himself from abroad with those school and common books, which the manufacturer now furnishes
       him with at home.</p>
      <p>Your Memorialists would request your serious attention to the following facts,&mdash;facts
       which they hope will have their due influence with your honorable body: On a moderate
       computation there are nearly one thousand printing houses in the United States, which,
       notwithstanding the great number of hands they employ&mdash;the vast quantity of paper they
       consume&mdash;and the constant supply of various sized types they require&mdash;are able to
       raise but a feeble mound against the flood of imported literature, which threatens to
       inundate the country. To supply even those offices with type, not to mention others daily
       establishing, there is but one foundery* in operation on this extensive quarter of the
       globe&mdash;and this but a partial one, since not half of the various denominations and sizes
       of types used in our mother tongue are cast at it; and not one of the Greek, Oriental and
       numerous other characters. To erect other founderies, or to complete the present, much taste
       and many years application are requisite, whilst in the mean time old established founderers
       will scarcely be induced by the proposed duty, to remove from Europe to this country. From a
       correct view of the consequences <pb n="003.226"/> of a dependence on this foundery, or on
       others which may be established, for that supply of implements which the business daily
       requires, your honorable body will be fully able to judge whether the apprehensions of your
       Memorialists be not well founded.</p>
      <p>The foundery at Philadelphia, it is, however, the interest of the country, it is the
       interest of the printer to encourage, as far as it can be done consistently with the
       prosperity of thousands, which should never be sacrificed to the aggrandizement of any
       individual&mdash;and encouraged it has been, as the proprietors themselves acknowledge by the
       multiplicity of their business and the handsome property they have already acquired&mdash;Nor
       can it arise from a want of patronage, that the money must be deposited with them in advance,
       at the time of sending an order, although the type, from the great demand, cannot be
       furnished for many months after. The desire of your petitioners, for the further prosperity
       and extension of this foundery shall prevent them, although there is but too much room, from
       drawing an injurious comparison between the durability, symmetry and requisite finish of the
       type cast there, and of that which is procured from abroad.</p>
      <p>To tax then, the industry, genius and enterprize of so useful a class of manufacturers as
       Printers confessedly are, by an exorbitant addition to an impost, already heavy, on the only
       implements almost with which the manufacture can be carried on, would inevitably be to
       encourage the importation of literature from abroad&mdash;to cause a great rise on foreign as
       well as domestic made books&mdash; to injure if not ruin, a young and flourishing art with
       its dependencies among us&mdash;to multiply the obstacles to knowledge&mdash;and to
       strengthen the empire of ignorance and vice.</p>
      <p>Your Memorialists pray your honorable body to excuse their prolixity on a subject which
       few, except professional men, can sufficiently know or appreciate.</p>
      <p>Note. There is a small foundery at Germantown, which casts German letter only.</p>

      Philadelphia meeting,<ref target="f003.11.32" n="32"><hi rend="super">32</hi></ref> carried

       George Town is requested at Mr. Barney's Tavern on Saturday at 1 o'clock P. M. in order to
       consult with a committee of the Printers and Booksellers of Alexandria on measures proper to
       be pursued in relation to anv contemplated imposition of additional duties on imported Types.
       <ref target="f003.11.33" n="33"><hi rend="super">33</hi></ref></q> Curiously enough, no

     <p>At the Carolina Coffee House on March 15, the printers, booksellers, bookbinders, and
      stationers of Charleston considered "the propriety of addressing congress on the additional
      duty proposed to be laid on Printing Types."<ref target="f003.11.34" n="34"><hi rend="super"

      <p>To the Honorable the Speaker &amp; members of the House of Representatives of the United
       States of America:</p>
      <p>The Memorial of the Subscribers, printers, booksellers, &amp; Stationers, in the City of
       Charleston,</p>
      <p>Respectfully sheweth,</p>
      <p>That it is with concern your memorialists learn, that your honorable body have it in
       contemplation to lay an additional duty on Printing Types, imported into the United States;
       which, when laid, will be equal to 20 p cent on the Cost; and that this will be done under
       the idea of giving encouragement to the manufacturers of Types in the United
       States.&mdash;Your Memorialists beg leave to assure your honorable body, that if they thought
       this Idea was well founded, &amp; they could believe that the different fonts of Types used
       in their Business, could be obtained in the United States, it would give them great
       satisfaction to find encouragement, in the way proposed, given to the manufactures of their
       country; but knowing that at this time, there are not founderies amongst us that can furnish
       the twentieth part of the existing demand, they can <pb n="003.228"/> view the intended
       additional duty in no other light than an act that will distress your memorialists, and all
       others concerned in the business of Printing, Bookselling, &amp;c. and not add to the general
       good of the Country. Your memorialists beg leave also to observe to your honorable body, that
       while duties on almost every species of merchandise will fall but lightly on individuals,
       being borne by the great mass of consumers, duties on mechanical Implements, coming out of
       the pocket of the laborious artisan alone, must tend to check the progress of trade, and damp
       the incentives to industry.&mdash;Therefore they pray that your honorable body will not agree
       to the proposed additional duty on Types.</p>
      <p>And your memorialists, as in duty bound, will pray.</p>

     <p>Since the report of the Committee of Commerce and Manufactures had been committed to the
      Committee of the Whole House, each of the above petitions, when read, was also referred to the
      Committee of the Whole House. On December 14, 1802, these petitions were referred to the
      Committee of Commerce and Manufactures. The committee reported back on February 21, 1803, when
      the House, adopting their report, resolved that <q>the Secretary of the Treasury be, and he is
       hereby, directed to prepare and lay before Congress, early in their next session, a plan for
       the levying new and more specific duties . . . .<ref target="f003.11.36" n="36"><hi

      antimony was exempted from duty, but there was no mention of any additional duty on imported
      printing type. Like most of the lobbies which were to come, this one had been successful.</p>

     <p>THERE ARE TIMES WHEN A WRITER FINDS HIM-SELF with the leisure time and the inclination to
      burrow among the artifacts of his literary past. During his sixty-fifth year. James Kirke
      Paulding began "rummaging" among his old manuscripts. What he found were yellowed and
      mutilated copies of poems written during his youth and middle age&mdash;"careless" verses, he
      rightly called some of them. Largely to amuse himself, Paulding transcribed into a copybook a
      large number of these poems and, as the alterations reveal, he later busied himself with
      polishing and revising some of them. To the collection he added some poems newly written.</p>
     <p>With the instincts of a writer, Paulding carefully provided his copybook with a preface.
      Because it is brief and because it gives some indication of his attitude toward his poetry, it
      deserves quotation in its entirety. </p>
     <q>
      <p>In rummaging among my old Manuscripts, I came across the following careless, and
       occasionally, mutilated, copies of verses, written at various and distant periods, and most
       of them long since forgotten. I have amused my leisure hours in copying them here, rather as
       indications of the progress of my feelings and of past events of my youth than as
       compositions worthy of being preserved. They may serve as memorials to my children, of me,
       the progress of whose life without being checquered by any remarkable events, has been
       regularly onwards from Poverty and obscurity to competent independence and honourable
       distinction. I am now drawing near its close anticipating little and fearing less here, for
       the result of my various experience has satisfied me how small a portion of <pb n="003.230"/>
       our real, substantial happiness, is derived from the gratification of vanity, ambition, or
       avarice.</p>
      <p>JKP.<lb/> New York 1843<lb/> P. S. A few of these pieces have been published in
       Periodicals.</p>
     </q>
     <p>Paulding was a little pessimistic in thinking that he was drawing near the close of his
      life. He was to live seventeen years more, until his eighty-second year, and was to publish
      three more volumes.</p>
     <p>Perhaps because of his modest view of the literary value of his poems, Paulding did not seek
      to collect them in printed form. Certainly his literary reputation is built upon prose in many
      forms&mdash;humorous essays, satirical sketches, short stories, biography, drama, patriotic
      and sectional writings. He published only two volumes of poetry, the satirical <hi
       rend="italic">Lay of the Scottish Fiddle</hi> in 1813 and the long narrative <hi
       rend="italic">Backwoodsman</hi> in 1818. Nonetheless, throughout his life he continued to
      experiment with verse.</p>
     <p>No adequate survey has been made of Paulding as poet. The first book-length study of
      Paulding was his son William's slipshod memoir-anthology, <hi rend="italic">Literary Life of
       James K. Paulding</hi> (1867). William Paulding quotes several short poems and excerpts
      longer ones, actually giving a whole chapter to <hi rend="italic">The Backwoodsman</hi>, but
      he provides no critical estimate of his father as a poet.<ref target="f003.12.01" n="1"><hi
        rend="super">1</hi></ref> In <hi rend="italic">James Kirke Paulding, Versatile American</hi>
      (1926), Dr. Amos L. Herold gives little attention to the poetry and he lists only a handful of
      single poems. A study of Paulding's verse&mdash;its subject matter and technique&mdash;yet
      remains to be done. A prior task is to locate and call attention to his fugitive poems,
      scattered though they are. Inasmuch as Paulding's copybook of 1843 is still preserved and
      available, this forms a logical starting point for such a study.<ref target="f003.12.02"

      twentieth year) to 1843 (his sixty-fifth year).<ref target="f003.12.03" n="3"><hi rend="super"
        >3</hi></ref> The largest number of these dated poems falls within Paulding's twenties.
      There are twenty-two written during these years, ten during his thirties, seven during his
      forties. As one might expect from a young romantic, the earlier poems are on the subjects of
      love and death; but gradually he began to write about the literary scene, about America, and
      about persons whom he knew.</p>
     <p>Many types of poetry and subject matter are represented. A large number are lyrics. Many are
      love poems and the names of women are frequent. Some are elegiac and of the graveyard school.
      Many are conventionally moral in tone. A few, such as "Lament of the Faithless Shepherdess,"
      show the pastoral influence. Several are appreciations of natural beauty, including Niagara
      and the Hudson river. Two of the poems are highly critical of N. P. Willis and John Jacob
      Astor; some are on human foibles in general. One criticizes the ubiquitous English traveller
      as a "creature of arrogance, folly, conceit." There are several on patriotic themes: "The
      Stripes and Stars," a criticism of the "national apathy" during the War of 1812, a poem
      welcoming Texas into the Union. A few are concerned with national letters, literary critics,
      and "these dull prosy times." In length the poems range from mere moralizing couplets to the
      long, 810-line narrative poem, "The Pilgrim and His Guide," apparently written to illustrate
      how the easterner's materialistic greed can lead to personal tragedy on the hostile western
      plains.</p>
     <p>It is the writer's immediate purpose only to describe this manuscript volume, to place on
      record a briefly annotated list of its contents, and to record such periodical printings of
      these poems as he has been able to identify for the first time. Of the seventy-three <pb
       n="003.232"/> poems, one of them (number 22 in the check-list) may not be Paulding's, for he
      writes that he has "some doubts as to its being mine." Three of the seventy-three are listed
      in Herold's biography as having been published periodically. The periodical publication of
      eighteen of the poems is here newly identified.<ref target="f003.12.04" n="4"><hi

     <p>In the following listing, the titles are given exactly, but no attempt has been made to
      follow Paulding's capitalization. Following each title are the following data: the date (when
      indicated in the copybook), the total number of lines of each poem, and the copybook page on
      which the poem appears. The first line is given for each poem. For those poems whose
      periodical publication has been discovered, the wording of the printed title has been added
      when a variant occurs. In those cases in which the number of lines in the printed poem
      differs, the number of printed lines is recorded. Following the check-list is an abbreviated
      index of titles and first lines.</p>

       call this ms., using the date of the preface). He refers to one poem (number 41 in the

       copybook, he would have seen a poem (number 42 in the check-list) written a year earlier. W.
       I. Paulding does mention (page 43) "an early Commonplace book" from which he prints a poem
       found there as a newspaper clipping. He estimates its date as "about 1810" and prints it as
       "no doubt" of his father's authorship. It is a highly doubtful attribution. The copybook

      Drama</name><lb/>

    <div2 type="subsection">
     <p>The antagonism that existed so strongly between the theatre and various religious groups
      during the Elizabethan and Stuart periods, and which achieved its strongest expression,
      perhaps, in Prynne's <hi rend="italic">Histriomastix</hi> and in such plays as <hi
       rend="italic">The Puritan</hi>, may cause us to overlook a minor but definite countertendency
      of the theatre to play up to the religious interests of a part of the populace. In the earlier
      decades of the era, mystery and morality plays, though no longer as once under the aegis of
      the church, remained as reminders to us of the religious origin of the English theatre. We
      know that down into the 'eighties such plays continued, in diminished numbers, to be written
      and produced. And from 1590 on, in a theatre increasingly secular and especially anti-Puritan,
      there were occasional plays that, in whole or in major part, showed a desire in the writers
      and producers of plays for a raprochement with the bourgeois, church-going elements of the
      community.</p>
     <p>As examples of the tendency we may name Greene and Lodge's <hi rend="italic">A Looking-glass
       for London and England</hi> (printed 1594); <hi rend="italic">Sir John Oldcastle</hi>, by
      Drayton and others (1600); <hi rend="italic">Thomas Lord Cromwell</hi> (1602); Heywood's <hi
       rend="italic">If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody</hi> (1605); Rowley's <hi rend="italic">When
       You See Me You Know Me</hi> (1605); Dekker and Massinger's <hi rend="italic">The Virgin
       Martyr</hi> (1622); Shakespeare and Fletcher's <hi rend="italic">Henry VIII</hi> (1623);
      Heywood's <hi rend="italic">England's Elizabeth</hi> (1631); his <hi rend="italic">Life and
       Death of Queen Elizabeth</hi> (1639); and Shirley's <hi rend="italic">The Martyred
       Soldier</hi> (1638). In the long roll of lost plays there are a number that, judging by their
      titles, must belong to the same group. All or a substantial part of the following plays must
      have been, at least, not utterly repugnant to religious-minded people: <hi rend="italic">Pope
       Joan</hi> (produced ca. 1580-1592); <hi rend="italic">Abraham and Lot</hi> (ca. 1580-1594);
      Haughton's <hi rend="italic">The English Fugitives</hi> (? 1600); <hi rend="italic">Judas</hi>
      (1601-2); Rowley's <hi rend="italic">Joshua</hi> (1602); Dekker and Munday's <hi rend="italic"
       >Jephtha</hi> (1602); and <hi rend="italic">Samson</hi> (1602). It may be argued, of course,
      that these plays could not have been very popular or successful, or they would not <pb
       n="003.242"/> have been lost; but their mere existence is enough to demonstrate that the
      minor tendency was present. The period from 1606 to 1621, when no such play is recorded as
      printed or produced except by such frankly religious groups as that of St. Omers, is the
      longest hiatus before the closing of the theatres.<ref target="f003.13.01" n="1"><hi
        rend="super">1</hi></ref></p>
     <p>Among plays of this sort, and perhaps as good an example of the type as we shall find, is
       <hi rend="italic">The Duchess of Suffolk</hi>, by Thomas Drue, produced at the Fortune
      Theatre in 1623, and printed in 1631.<ref target="f003.13.02" n="2"><hi rend="super"
       >2</hi></ref> It is a historical drama, and like most of that sort, it appeals strongly to
      community pride; but the community in this case is not the nation, primarily, but the strongly
      Protestant left wing of the English Church&mdash;the moderate Puritans.</p>
     <p>There is also a very strong vein of local interest in the play and its production in 1623.
      The Fortune Theatre stood in Golden Lane, Cripplegate. Scarcely a stone's throw away stood the
      Barbican, the home of the Duchess and the scene of the first part of the play. An ancient
      watchtower rebuilt into a residence, the house stood near the corner of Red Cross street and
      what was later known as Barbican street. It had been a possession of the holders of the
      Suffolk title since the time of Edward III. As late as 1599, Peregrine Bertie, the son of the
      Duchess, bequeathed to his son a parcel of land on this street, possibly including the old
      residence. The Barbican was in a state of ruin in 1682, but did not entirely disappear until
      late in the 18th century. In its later years it was known as Willoughby House, possibly to
      distinguish it from the street.<ref target="f003.13.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> In
      Dryden's day the locality was given over to brothels.<ref target="f003.13.04" n="4"><hi

     <p>The players at the Fortune were the Palsgrave's Company. They had been under the protection
      of the German princeling Frederick V, Elector of the Rhenish Palatinate, since 1612, when he
      had come to England to marry the Princess Elizabeth; and they remained under his aegis until
      1631. During all this time the Fortune was their special theatre; it burned and was rebuilt
      (1621-23); it was the scene of riots; the players left it on occasion for excursions in the
      provinces. But through all their existence as the Palsgrave's Company the Fortune was their
      center and their home.<ref target="f003.13.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref></p>
     <p>The Palsgrave, as the king of Poland, is one of the characters in the play, <hi
       rend="italic">The Duchess of Suffolk</hi>. Presumably the players thus honored their patron
      by presenting a flattering portrait of his predecessor. The Palsgrave's residence is not
      known, but his son Prince Rupert is said to have lived in Barbican Street.</p>
     <pb n="003.243"/>
     <p>Thomas Deloney, the ballad maker whose version of the Duchess' story, as we shall show,
      influenced the play, lived in Cripplegate.<ref target="f003.13.06" n="6"><hi rend="super"
        >6</hi></ref> And John Foxe the martyrologist, from whose <hi rend="italic">Acts and
       Monuments</hi> the material for the play is chiefly drawn, from 1570 to his death in 1587 had
      owned a house in Grub street, an easy stroll from the theatre, and was buried in St. Giles,
      which fronts Red Cross street in the same neighborhood. The play, then, knits together a
      number of neighborhood interests.</p>
     <p>The lady whose adventures are the subject of the play was the historical Katharine, Dowager
      Duchess of Suffolk, born in 1519. She was the daughter of Lord Willoughby and of Mary de
      Salinas, a Spanish Lady of the court of Henry VIII. At her father's death in 1526 she became
      Baroness of Willoughby. Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, became her guardian, and married her
      in 1533. She was the Duke's fourth wife, and by him she had two sons. The Duke died in 1545,
      and the two boys in 1551. Richard Bertie, the Duchess' second husband, whom she married in
      1553, was the son of a prosperous stonemason who, like Shakespeare's father, became a
      gentleman by act of the College of Heralds when his son came up in the world. Richard was a
      graduate of Oxford, reputed to be an accomplished student of French, Italian, and Latin, and a
      man of tact and ability. He had been the Duchess' gentleman usher. In the later period of his
      life he was a member of Parliament for Lincolnshire.<ref target="f003.13.07" n="7"><hi
        rend="super">7</hi></ref></p>
     <p>There can be little doubt that the character named Foxe, who opens the play, was intended to
      represent the martyrologist. In a play in which practically every character is historical,
      which is based on his own book and set and produced in his own old neighborhood, it could
      scarcely be otherwise. The record of Foxe's ordination as a deacon indicates that he was a
      tutor in the household of the Duchess in 1550.<ref target="f003.13.08" n="8"><hi rend="super"
        >8</hi></ref> But Foxe, the Duchess' servant in the play, who envies Bertie's good fortune
      but goes into exile with his master and mistress, has little in common with his historical
      counterpart. Drue lavished more attention upon him, however, than upon any other minor
      character in the play, and made him an individual with more than a spark of life in him. He
      becomes the chief instrument of the Providence that watched over the Duchess. That the sober,
      studious, godly Foxe should be shown as worshipping his Protestant heroine, foiling the
      villainous prelates, and smoothing the path of Protestant exile might be taken, not too
      cynically, as an allegory of the effect of his book upon the Protestant world. At the very
      least, this is neither the first nor the last time that Foxe the man has been misunderstood.
      Almost any history of English literature will serve as another example.</p>
     <p><hi rend="italic">The Duchess of Suffolk</hi> comes near the end of a surprisingly long list
      of plays <pb n="003.244"/> whose plots, in whole or in part, are drawn from the pages of
       Foxe.<ref target="f003.13.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> In this case, the entire
      plot, with only minor modifications, is from the <hi rend="italic">Acts and Monuments</hi>.
      Indeed, the play's indebtedness to Foxe is so obvious that its source was probably known and
      recognized from the beginning. The story of the Duchess' exile on the continent during Mary's
      reign was not reported in the 1563 edition&mdash; the first in English&mdash;of the "Book of
      Martyrs." The only reference to it occurs in a marginal note on page 1680: "Lady Francis,
      Duchess of Suffolk, who hazarding bothe life, lands, and so great possessions fled her
      countrey with her husband in cause of her conscience." Foxe, or more probably the translator
      who Englished his 1559 Latin version, had confused the Dowager Duchess with her stepdaughter.
      <ref target="f003.13.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> The detailed story was
      inserted, when the book was revised for the second (1570) edition, among other accounts
      dealing with "divers saved by God's providence"&mdash;persons who, in spite of strong
      Protestant sympathies, had survived Mary's reign by one means or another.<ref
       target="f003.13.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> It remained substantially unchanged
      in succeeding editions. The <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi> asserts,
      quite plausibly but without offering any proof, that the account was written by Richard
       Bertie.<ref target="f003.13.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> The whole story is
      copied, word for word, by Holinshed's editors in the second edition of the <hi rend="italic"
       >Chronicles</hi>.<ref target="f003.13.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref></p>
     <p>Foxe's account tells of the Duchess' flight with her husband and children to escape the
      enmity of Bishop Gardiner. They made their way by slow stages, suffering hardships and meeting
      many adventures, to Poland. There they were befriended by the king and allowed to remain in
      security until the death of Mary made their return to England possible.</p>
     <p>The story of the Duchess' wanderings had been made into a ballad by Thomas Deloney, and
      published in 1602 or earlier.<ref target="f003.13.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref>
      Deloney had taken some liberties with the story as told in Foxe, and it is possible, as a
      result, to say with certainty that the dramatist Drue knew and used the ballad version as well
      as Foxe's book. Drue follows Deloney rather than Foxe in including an attack by thieves on the
      Duchess and her party. Foxe has nothing of this. Foxe had told of the party's taking refuge in
      the church-porch at Wesel; Deloney added that the sexton came and tried to drive them out.
      Bertie "wrung the churchkeys <pb n="003.245"/> out of his hand," and beat the drunken janitor
      over the head with them. This incident also is used by Drue.</p>
     <p>Deloney also had told of the son, Peregrine, born to the duchess during the early days of
      the exile, and had named the daughter, Susan, a babe in arms at the time of their flight, who
      afterward became Countess of Kent. These facts are used in the play, and Drue may have taken
      them from the ballad. But it is highly probable that Drue had later and more direct sources of
      information about the personages in the Willoughby family.</p>
     <p>The influence of the <hi rend="italic">Acts and Monuments</hi> upon the play is not confined
      to Foxe's story of the Duchess' flight and exile. Latimer, Ridley, and Cranmer, Marian
      martyrs, and Dr. Sands, an exile, appear on the stage. Sands, with little effect on the plot
      but with much damage to his academic and ecclesiastical dignity, is pursued onto and off the
      stage so often as to become ridiculous. Foxe's story of Dr. Sands is told a few pages after
      that of the Duchess, but the two stories are not connected. Historically, Sands and Katharine
      were friends, and they may have met on the continent. The connection may have been suggested
      to the dramatist by this sentence in Foxe: "Dr. Sands . . . conveyed himself by night to one
      master Bartly's [i.e., Bertie's?] house, a stranger, who was in the Marshalsea prison with him
      for a while; he was a good Protestant, and dwelt in Mark-lane."<ref target="f003.13.15" n="15"
        ><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> But Bertie was not a "stranger," never was in prison, and
      did not live in Mark lane. In one speech in the play Sands is called Saunders; a man of that
      name, according to Foxe,<ref target="f003.13.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> had
      been Sands' prison-mate. These minor elements of the play are confused and confusing, but the
      whole complex suggests the hack-dramatist searching out details to fill up his scenes without
      too much regard for verisimilitude where his main character is not concerned.</p>
     <p>Latimer, Ridley, and Cranmer are introduced in the fourth act, where the dramatist
      compresses into a single scene the stories of the three martyrs. These he would have found in
      great detail in Foxe.<ref target="f003.13.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref>
      Historically, the Duchess was a staunch friend of Latimer, and some of his volumes of sermons
      are dedicated to her. Presumably the playwright's purpose in bringing in these characters is
      to show dramatically what the Duchess escaped by her flight, and perhaps also to associate her
      more closely with the main stream of historical events. But the connection is not made obvious
      in the drama, and the playwright lost a real opportunity to knit his story more closely
      together when he failed to bring Latimer into an earlier and more organic association with the
      main plot. To make room for him, Sands could have been eliminated entirely; he is never
      necessary to the action. One suspects he is present because a part had to be made for one of
      the comedians of the company. Perhaps the groundlings would have been less pleased, but the
      development of Latimer's part and the exclusion of <pb n="003.246"/> Sands would have caused
      less pain to the Muse of History than she suffers from other things in the play. The burning
      of Cranmer's hand, for instance, is distorted completely out of its true significance to
      provide a momentary dramatic sensation.</p>
     <p>Sir Henry Herbert's Revels Book contains the following entry: <q>For the Palsgrave's
       Company; <hi rend="italic">The History of the Dutchess of Suffolk;</hi> which being full of
       dangerous matter was much reformed by me; I had two pounds for my pains; Written by Mr. Drew.
       <ref target="f003.13.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref></q> It would be interesting,
      if it were possible, to know what "dangerous matter" Sir Henry excised from the play.
      Perhaps&mdash;this is offered as pure speculation&mdash; he softened the anti-prelatical
      elements of the play, which would have been displeasing to the then-crescent high-church
      party.</p>
     <p>In 1600 Philip Henslowe listed thirty shillings as paid to William Haughton in earnest of a
      play called <hi rend="italic">The English Fugitives</hi>. Collier assumed that this play was a
      dramatization of the Duchess of Suffolk's story. Greg, however, thinks it more probable that
      the play dealt with other matters.<ref target="f003.13.19" n="19"><hi rend="super"

    <div2 type="subsection">
     <p>In a paper read before the Bibliographical Evidence group at the meeting of the Modern
      Language Association in Chicago in 1945 I made the point that careful bibliographical analysis
      of the text of Thomas Middleton's <hi rend="italic">A Mad World</hi>, <hi rend="italic">My
       Masters</hi>,<ref target="f003.14.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> 1608, along with a
      study of Middleton's scribal habits, might afford a more generally satisfactory explanation of
      the aberrations in the quarto than the previously held theory of revision.</p>
     <p>The publication since then of F. T. Bowers' article, "An Examination of the Method of Proof
      Correction in Lear,"<ref target="f003.14.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> has led me
      to believe that the analysis of the composition and printing of <hi rend="italic">A Mad
       World</hi> might be interesting in its own right, apart from its application to the editorial
      problem; for the first five sheets of the play were printed with three skeletons used in a
      pattern somewhat different from that in <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>. To complicate matters a
      bit, no variant formes in <pb n="003.247"/> these sheets appear in the nine copies of the
      first edition which I have collated.</p>
     <p>Incidentally, the two compositors of the first five sheets were accomplished workmen, one of
      whom set almost all the type for these first sheets&mdash;all but D1-4 and E3v-4. The point is
      significant because apparently a single compositor was not pressed for time in setting all the
      type for sheets A, B, and C.</p>
     <p>Some of the phenomena to be detailed here are sufficiently similar to those in <hi
       rend="italic">Lear</hi> to recommend comparison, and sufficiently different to prove puzzling
      and perhaps enlightening. To facilitate comparison, I have used in the following table the
      same system of indicating running-title transfers that was used by Bowers. <figure
       entity="sb032471"/>
     </p>
     <p>Several oddities deserve special comment, if only as a warning to future students of
      running-titles used as bibliographical evidence. As indicated in the above table two slightly
      different titles are used on A4<hi rend="super">v</hi>. Printing starts with title IIIa, found
      in copies of the play in the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Bodleian, the Folger, the
      Huntington, and the New York Public Library. <pb n="003.248"/> After a considerable number of
      copies had been printed the broken initial A was replaced by a better one, but the rest of the
      running-title was not changed. The title in its improved form, IIIb, appears on A4<hi
       rend="super">v</hi> in the copies of the play in the British Museum, Harvard, the Library of
      Congress, and the Boston Public Library. Thereafter title IIIb appears in all copies on B3<hi
       rend="super">v</hi> and C3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, after which it is rejected.</p>
     <p>Meanwhile what is apparently the rejected initial A from IIIa re-appears in a new title on
       B4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, labeled now IXa, which is used again on C4<hi rend="super">v</hi>
      and then set aside temporarily. It appears again on E4<hi rend="super">v</hi> but its broken
      initial A is replaced almost immediately, quite by chance by what is apparently the same
      initial A which had replaced it in title III. Title IXa is found only in the British Museum
      copy.</p>
     <p>The notable fact, it seems to me, is that these pages are invariant except for the changed
      letter in the running-titles. If these pages were proofed, as their general excellence
      suggests, what sort of proofing before printing might allow the broken running-title to escape
      notice? That there was ample time for proofing in the first five sheets of the play is obvious
      when we study the probable order of the formes through the press.</p>
     <p>The cumulative effect of admittedly inconclusive evidence leads me to believe that the outer
      formes of both sheet A and sheet B preceded their inner formes through the press. If inner B
      had been imposed and run before outer B, we should be obliged to account for the delay
      occasioned by the use in inner B of running-titles from both formes of A. This demands the
      assumption that sheet A was completed at the end of a working day, in which event both
      skeletons should have been ready for normal transfer to their respective quarters in the
      formes of B.</p>
     <p>Instead we find new running-titles used in outer B, one of them with the previously
      discarded broken A. Apparently outer B was imposed before either skeleton of A was ready for
      transfer. Then while outer B printed white paper, the running-titles and furniture from both
      formes of A were used in inner B.</p>
     <p>Similarly, if inner A had been first run, its running-titles would presumably have been
      first ready for transfer to inner B, in which case normal transfer of running-titles would
      have placed title IV on B3<hi rend="super">v</hi> instead of on B1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and
      title V on B4 instead of on B2. But if outer A was first run, first rinsed, and first
      stripped, normal transfer would place title II on B4 and title IIIb on B3<hi rend="super"
       >v</hi>, which is precisely where they are used. This conjecture, unfortunately, leaves the
      puzzle of why title I from A2<hi rend="super">v</hi> was not used. I suspect that by the time
      the workman was ready to impose B1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and B2 he had available the
      running-titles from the two adjacent type pages of inner A, which he preferred to use rather
      than the single remaining running-title from outer A plus another odd one.</p>
     <p>It seems likely, then, that the order of formes through the press thus far was outer A,
      inner A, outer B, inner B; and the pattern of running-title transfers <pb n="003.249"/> could
      be indicated as follows: set X, set Y, set Z, set XY, or three different sets plus a fourth
      composed of parts of the first two.</p>
     <p>This last point may seem unduly labored; the reason for the insistence lies in the odd
      repetition of that same pattern in sheets C and D, though of course the running-titles used in
      inner and outer C are not newly set.</p>
     <p>The outer forme of C uses the titles from outer B, and is presumably first printed, to be
      followed by inner C, which uses three titles from inner B plus one new one. The new title can
      be plausibly accounted for if we assume that imposition of outer C was begun after outer B had
      been rinsed and stripped. But when the imposition of inner C was begun, the skeleton of inner
      B was not quite ready for transfer. Overlooking the set-aside running-title from A2<hi
       rend="super">v</hi>, the compositor set a new one and imposed C1<hi rend="super">v</hi>. By
      the time he had completed that task the inner forme of B had been rinsed and stripped and its
      running-titles were available for normal transfer.</p>
     <p>The situation in sheet D is similar. Outer D, like outer B, uses in effect a new skeleton,
      though two running-titles previously set aside from A2<hi rend="super">v</hi> and B1<hi
       rend="super">v</hi> form part of the skeleton. Composition is again far ahead of presswork;
      the outer forme of D is imposed with a new skeleton, and the inner forme of D is being imposed
      shortly before the outer forme of C has been rinsed. Rejecting the broken title IXa, the
      compositor imposes three quarters of the inner forme of D, making two normal transfers from C3
      to D4 and from C1 to D2, and one unusual transfer from C2<hi rend="super">v</hi> to D3<hi
       rend="super">v</hi> instead of to D1<hi rend="super">v</hi>. By this time the inner forme of
      C has been rinsed and is available. The normal transfer of running-title from C1<hi
       rend="super">v</hi> to D1<hi rend="super">v</hi> completes the imposition of the inner forme
      of D.</p>
     <p>It will be noted that inner D might have been imposed entirely with the skeleton from outer
      C, had the broken running-title not been rejected. It remains a fact, nevertheless, that the
      inner forme of D uses running-titles from both formes of C, thus completing the cycle of four
      sets as in sheets A and B with the same pattern, X, Y, Z, XY.</p>
     <p>Laboring the point may be wasted effort, especially when one cannot explain exactly why the
      pattern exists; the point is made because it suggests that sheets B and D were completed at
      the end of a working day and immediately calls attention to a somewhat similar pattern in <hi
       rend="italic">Lear</hi>.<ref target="f003.14.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref></p>
     <p>In any case, composition was well ahead of presswork, the new compositor at work in D is not
      needed to relieve any pressure, and the compositor evidently had sufficient type for sixteen
      standing pages. As a corollary it seems clear that the resources of the shop were fully
      utilized in the printing of these sheets.</p>
     <p>If both formes of D marked the end of a working day, both skeletons might have been
      available for the imposition of either forme of E. As a matter of fact, both formes of E use
      running-titles from D. In sheet E, however, it is <pb n="003.250"/> rather difficult to
      determine which forme was first imposed and printed because the outer forme of E uses two
      running-titles from inner D and in addition a single running-title from each of two other
      formes, outer C and inner C.</p>
     <p>The problem is not insoluble, however, if we can correctly interpret the following facts: <list>
       <item>1. Title X from C1<hi rend="super">v</hi> is used on D1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and
         E2<hi rend="super">v</hi>.</item>
       <item>2. Title V from C2 is used on E1.</item>
       <item>3. Titles IIIb and II from the other two pages of inner C were probably distributed
        before outer E was machined, for we note that the initial A from title IIIb is used to
        replace the rejected A in the previously set aside title IXa that now appears on E4<hi
         rend="super">v</hi>.</item>
       <item>4. The use of title X on E2<hi rend="super">v</hi> and VIII on E3 is the normal pattern
        of running-title transfers from an inner to an outer forme; and the only sensible reason why
        the other two titles from inner D were not used must be that the other quarters, E1 and
         E4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, were already imposed.</item>
      </list>
     </p>
     <p>In short, the compositor went back to earlier set-aside running-titles because neither
      skeleton of D was available, but by the time he had imposed E1 and E4<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
      side-by-side on the stone, the skeletons of D had been rinsed and were available. The needed
      two running-titles were taken from the quarters of inner D which are appropriate to normal
      transfer from inner to outer formes, D1<hi rend="super">v</hi> to E2<hi rend="super">v</hi>
      and D4 to E3.</p>
     <p>Finally the entire skeleton of the outer forme of D was transferred in normal order to the
      inner forme of E. And that concluded the printing of the first five sheets of the play.</p>
     <p>With sheet F a wholly new situation arises. All running-titles from the first five sheets
      are discarded; they are replaced in sheet F by four new running-titles, one of which has a
      comma instead of a period after the word "<hi rend="italic">Masters</hi>." These four are used
      in both formes of F and G and in the inner forme of H. Four other running-titles, one of which
      has a badly broken upper case <hi rend="italic">W</hi> in the word "<hi rend="italic"
       >World</hi>", were used in outer H, and three of these in the final three pages of the play,
      I1-2.</p>
     <p>Apparently the outer forme of H was imposed and printed before the inner forme, a second
      skeleton being introduced to speed up completion of the job. It is likely that the order of
      the formes through the press was inner F, outer F, inner G, outer G, outer H, inner H. There
      is obviously nothing to prevent simultaneous imposition of both formes of I. In fact
      half-sheet imposition seems likely, the running-titles from outer H being transferred as
      follows: H1 to I1, H2<hi rend="super">v</hi> to I1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and H3 to I2.</p>
     <p>Signatures F-I differ from the earlier sheets of the play in another important
      respect&mdash;composition. The two efficient compositors of sheets A-E were replaced by one
      compositor who is not an accomplished workman. His work is easily distinguished from that of
      the other two by his spelling, by his handling <pb n="003.251"/> of contractions and
      apostrophes, and by his sometimes stupid blunders, which are noticeable chiefly in sheet H.
      Evidently, sheets F and G underwent some sort of correction, for we find only three variants
      in these two sheets, two on F1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and one on G3<hi rend="super">v</hi>.
      When we find numerous errors throughout sheet H, the comparative absence of errors in F and G
      strongly suggests that F and G underwent some sort of proofing earlier.</p>
     <p>Sheet H is truly amazing, exhibiting as it does both formes variant in wildly erratic
      fashion. For instance we find in outer H in the uncorrected state these flaws: on H1 seven
      stupid blunders; on H2<hi rend="super">v</hi> a generally good page with one nonsense line at
      the bottom; on H3 a faulty speech-tag, <hi rend="italic">An.c</hi> later changed to <hi
       rend="italic">Anc.</hi>; on H4<hi rend="super">v</hi> a good invariant page.</p>
     <p>In inner H the situation is much the same; on H1<hi rend="super">v</hi> there are five
      stupid blunders limited to the upper half of the page; signature H2 is invariant and good, and
      shows signs of having been set or extensively corrected by the compositor of the greater part
      of the first five sheets; on H3<hi rend="super">v</hi> one word is wrong and one speech-tag is
      changed from <hi rend="italic">Short.</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Short.R.</hi>; signature H4
      exists in three states. The wholly uncorrected state,<ref target="f003.14.04" n="4"><hi
        rend="super">4</hi></ref> found only in the British Museum copy, has the incorrect catchword
       <hi rend="italic">Short</hi>. All other copies properly read <hi rend="italic">Mast Pan</hi>.
      The third from the last line of text in this copy reads in part "&#x017F;hall I intreat a
      cute&#x017F;y?" All other copies properly add the missing <hi rend="italic">r</hi> in
      "curte&#x017F;y" and omit one of the l's in "&#x017F;hall", probably to avoid the necessity of
      spacing out the line anew; it was certainly not lack of room in the line. The British Museum
      copy uses <hi rend="italic">Short</hi>. as a speech-tag five times. The partially corrected
      states remove all the errors listed above except the use of <hi rend="italic">Short.</hi>,
      which is hardly an error. The twice corrected states change <hi rend="italic">Short</hi>. to
       <hi rend="italic">Short.R.</hi> twice near the top of the page, but leave it unexpanded the
      other three times it occurs. Here surely is haphazard correction!</p>
     <p>To complete the discussion of composition we may add that the three pages of sheet I exist
      in two states. Signature I1 is uncorrected in the Dyce copy of the play in the Victoria and
      Albert Museum. The variants in I1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and I2 seem to me to be the result
      not of correction strictly speaking but of an accident in the course of printing. In those
      copies of the play that do not lack the <hi rend="italic">FINIS</hi> the upper part of
      signatures I1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and I2 near their common margin show signs of badly
      justified lines with type slipping from side to side. I assume that the type in this area pied
      locally and necessitated re-adjustment. In those copies that lack the <hi rend="italic"
       >FINIS</hi> these badly justified lines have been tightened up, but in those areas mistakes
      have crept in; for instance the i from "&#x017F;eriou&#x017F;ly" slips down into the next line
      with this result: <q> &#x017F;erou&#x017F;ly<lb/> ainother<lb/>
      </q>
     </p>
     <pb n="003.252"/>
     <p>When we add to all this evidence of careless work the significant fact that the badly
      damaged running-titles in the last sheets of the book were not replaced, as were those in the
      first sheets, we get a picture the cumulative force of which demonstrates beyond a doubt that
      the two bibliographically distinguishable sections of <hi rend="italic">A Mad World</hi> were
      composed and printed in quite different ways.</p>
     <p>Sheets A-E were carefully composed and printed with all the resources of Ballard's shop
      directed toward turning out a reasonably good piece of work. Then for some reason the printing
      of <hi rend="italic">A Mad World</hi> was stopped. The distribution of running-titles as
      outlined in step number three above suggests that the decision to set aside this play was
      reached before sheet E was in the press, but after its type had been set at least in part.
      When the printing was resumed, a wholly different attitude prevailed. Composition was done by
      one man in the main, probably an apprentice, certainly not a good compositor.</p>
     <p>For, as I demonstrated before the Bibliographical Evidence group of the Modern Language
      Association in Chicago, the entire play shows signs of having been set from Middleton's
      holograph manuscript, and Middleton's handwriting is very easy to read, unlikely to prove
      troublesome to a good compositor. Even the printing did not make use of all the facilities of
      Ballard's shop, presumably because his accomplished workmen were busy with some other job.</p>
     <p>This entire analysis undoubtedly introduces more questions than answers, but it may prove
      helpful to some other student with a similar bibliographical problem.</p>

     <head>(1) The Two 1695 Editions of Wycherley's <hi rend="italic">Country-Wife</hi></head>
     <p>The first edition of William Wycherley's <hi rend="italic">Country-Wife</hi> appeared in
      1675 with the collation 4<hi rend="super">0</hi>, [A]<hi rend="super">2</hi> B-O<hi
       rend="super">4</hi>. Before the end of the century four more quarto editions were published,
      each regularly derived from its predecessor: 1683, collating A<hi rend="super">2</hi> B-K<hi
       rend="super">4</hi>; 1688, a line-for-line paginal reprint of 1683; and two editions in 1695
      collating [A]<hi rend="super">2</hi> B-I<hi rend="super">4</hi>, one a line-for-line paginal
      reprint of the other.</p>
     <p>Before the appearance of the Woodward and McManaway <hi rend="italic">Check List of English
       Plays 1641-1700</hi> the fact that there were two editions, not one, in 1695 had not been
      recognized; but the <hi rend="italic">Check List</hi> separated them, assigning no. 1325 to
      the edition with "Country Wife" (no hyphen) in the running-titles, and no. 1326 to the edition
      with the hyphenated running-titles "Country-Wife."<ref target="f003.15.01" n="1"><hi
        rend="super">1</hi></ref> Other <pb n="003.253"/> differences may be added for
      identification. In 1325 the imprint contains plain italic caps; on sig. C4, line 33,
      Pinchwife's aside "Will nothing do?" is enclosed in parentheses; and on sig. D1<hi
       rend="super">v</hi> the first speech-heading reads "<hi rend="italic">Sr. Jas.</hi>" In 1326
      swash italic caps head the imprint names Briscoe, Russel-street, and Daniel Dring; the aside
      is bracketed; and the speech-heading reads "<hi rend="italic">Sir Jas.</hi>"</p>
     <p>These two 1695 editions have not previously been subjected to bibliographical examination to
      determine their order, but when this is done it is seen that the Woodward and McManaway order
      should be reversed: 1326 is the true fourth and 1325 the true fifth edition. Since one is a
      paginal reprint of the other, independent derivation is eliminated and the question resolves
      itself to the simple determination of which edition was set from 1688 and which was not. Of 86
      variations between the two 1695 editions in Act II, for example, 77 in no. 1326 follow 1688
      where no. 1325 differs. Three of these are substantives: <list>
       <item>1688-no. 1326: that is no wit, out of friendship to me? (C3<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
        line 47)</item>
       <item>no. 1325: that is no whit out of Friendship to me.</item>
       <item>1688-no. 1326: to our honours (C4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, line 38)</item>
       <item>no. 1325: to our honour</item>
       <item>1688-no. 1326: do not use that word naked. (D1, line 3)</item>
       <item>no. 1325: do not use the word naked.</item>
      </list> In 46 cases, no. 1326 follows 1688 in spelling, capitalization, or contraction where
      no. 1325 differs; and in 28 punctuation variants no. 1326 conforms to 1688, where no. 1325
      does not. In the light of this overwhelming evidence that no. 1326 was printed from 1688 and
      that, as a paginal reprint, no. 1325 must derive from 1326, the four minor examples of
      spelling and punctuation variants in which no. 1325 and 1688, but not no. 1326, agree may
      readily be dismissed as fortuitous.</p>
     <p>Collation against the 1675 and the 1683 editions discloses that no. 1326 did not consult
      these editions and that it is a straight reprint of 1688.</p>

     <head>(2) The Two 1692 Editions of Otway's <hi rend="italic">Caius Marius</hi></head>
     <p>The first edition of Thomas Otway's <hi rend="italic">History and Fall of Caius Marius</hi>,
      listed in the Woodward and McManaway <hi rend="italic">Check List</hi> as no. 880, was
      published by Thomas Flesher in 1680. The <hi rend="italic">Check List</hi> follows with no.
      881, an edition for Robert Bentley in 1692, which has a long "s" printed in the word "<hi
       rend="italic">eft</hi>" on the title-page; no. 882, with a short "s", or "<hi rend="italic"
       >est</hi>" in the quotation on the title, thereupon follows in the listing as "another issue"
      of no. 881, with the same date and publisher. This listing as an issue is in error, for no.
      882 is throughout <pb n="003.254"/> in a completely different typesetting from 881, and is the
      true third edition of the play.<ref target="f003.15.02" n="2"><hi rend="super"
      >2</hi></ref></p>
     <p>The order 880, 881, and 882 is readily established by collation. Nos. 881 and 882 agree in
      their makeup (a slight condensation of 880), one being a paginal reprint of the other. That
      edition, therefore, which derives directly from 880 must be the earlier. Various substantive
      readings point to the agreement of 880 and 881 in cases where 882 differs.</p>
     <list>
      <item>880-881: Lay my gray Hairs low (page 8, line 4)</item>
      <item>882: Lay my gray Heirs low</item>
      <item>880-881: This D&aelig;mon (page 8, line 15)</item>
      <item>882: The D&aelig;mon</item>
      <item>880-881: its most dear-bought Honours (page 11, line 29)</item>
      <item>882: its more dear-bought Honours</item>
     </list>
     <p>This same line of derivation is clearly exemplified by the accidentals, as well: </p>
     <list>
      <item>880-881: my wish'd-for Peace (page 9, line 4)</item>
      <item>882: my wish'd for Peace</item>
      <item>880-881: Sh'has bin with Sylla (page 10, line 46)</item>
      <item>882: Sh'has been with Sylla</item>
     </list>
     <p>The second instance is especially good evidence, for although "bin" is the invariable
      spelling of 880, "been" is the normal form in 881; hence, the few cases in 881 of "bin"
      reflect its copy-text, and 882 quite naturally normalizes the form to "been."</p>
     <p>The whole trend of the evidence demonstrates this order without question, and the expected
      few cases of agreement in accidentals between 880 and 882 against 881, resolve themselves
      without difficulty into normal corrections by the compositor of 882.<ref target="f003.15.03"
       n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref></p>
     <p>The seventeenth-century history of this play may be continued by remarking that no. 883,
      listed as a 1692 issue for Flesher, is a "ghost," the single recorded copy, that at
      Northwestern University, being in fact no. 882. No. 884, a 1694 edition reported by Montague
      Summers but without confirmation, has no recorded exempla and very likely does not exist.
      Finally, collation establishes that no. 885, the 1696 edition for Bentley, is a reprint of no.
      882, a fact which points to 882 as an authorized edition and not a piracy.</p>

     <head>(3) Three 1695 Editions of Jevon's <hi rend="italic">Devil of a Wife</hi></head>
     <p>Following the first edition in 1686 (no. 662) and the second in 1693 (no. 663) of Thomas
      Jevon's farce <hi rend="italic">The Devil of a Wife</hi>, the Woodward and McManaway <hi
       rend="italic">Check List</hi> records as no. 664 an edition for James Knapton in 1693 (4
      preliminary leaves, 47 p.) and another (no. 665) in the same year, also for Knapton (3
      preliminary leaves, 42 p.). Under no. 664 it is noted that the Henry E. Huntington Library has
      another copy of this edition with variant readings. This second copy, which is the same as
      that held by Chicago and Duke, is, on the contrary, a completely new reset edition and should
      be assigned the number 664a.</p>
     <p>Collation establishes that no. 664, the first of the 1695 editions, was set in a condensed
      makeup from a copy of Knapton's 1693 edition (no. 663), and that 664a is a paginal and
      line-for-line reprint of 664.</p>

     <p>The similar title-pages and makeup of 664 and 664a furnish no points of identification, but
      the two editions may be distinguished on the basis of the above readings, although other
      points may be mentioned. Thus 664 has the correct page number 19 but 664a transposes this in
      the copies seen to 91. In the persons, in 664 Lovemore is described as "beloved for good old
       <hi rend="italic">Engl</hi>. House-keeping" whereas 664a reads "House-keeper."</p>
     <p>Various unique readings confirm the evidence of its compressed makeup to indicate that the
      third 1695 edition, no. 665, did not precede 664. Collation establishes, moreover, that it is
      derived directly from 664 and not from 664a or from any earlier edition, for it follows the
      major readings in which 664 varies from 663 but ignores the variants in 664a from 664.</p>

     <p>The only modern edition of Addison's poetic works which has any authority is that of
      Guthkelch. In spite of the many merits of this production, the editing of <hi rend="italic"
       >The Campaign</hi>,<ref target="f003.16.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> the poem
      which marked the turning point in Addison's career, is based on an erroneous bibliography of
      the early editions (also found in the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Bibliography of English
       Literature</hi>); and the text is not contrived according to present-day standards of
      editorial practice. Accepting Tickell's text in the posthumous folio edition of Addison's <hi
       rend="italic">Works</hi> (1721), Guthkelch assumes that the variants from the first edition
      of 1705 made their initial appearance in the edition of 1708 with the Latin translation. This
      assumption posits a delay of four years between the first appearance of the poem and Addison's
      revision of his text. In fact, no such delay occurred, for the poem was revised for the first
      and only time in the third London edition of 1705.</p>
     <p>It is the purpose of this study to present a corrected bibliography of the critically

        from the first London edition. Owing to the speed with which the second London edition seems
        to have been prepared, whether the Edinburgh immediately preceded or succeeded it is
        impossible to determine. This Scots edition has no independent authority and is described
        here only because of its rarity and to complete the roster of 1705 editions.</item>
      </list>
     </p>
     <p>The three 1705 London editions are all that can possess textual authority, but the precise
      assignment of authority to all details rests in part on the bibliographical evidence of their
      printing. In the opinion of the writer, the first edition was hurried to completion in order
      to be put on sale on the day of Marlborough's return to London. In addition to the evidence
      which has been cited elsewhere,<ref target="f003.16.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref>
      one may offer signs of haste in the book itself, for at least two and possibly more
      compositors were concerned in setting its few pages. A marked feature of the spelling in
      sheets B-C is the invariable form "Brittish," "Brittain," "Brittania," and "Britton," whereas
      in D-G are consistently found the forms "British," "Britain," and so on. We have, then, what
      seems to be simultaneous two-section printing of this book in the respective parts A-C and
      D-G. And if inferences are valid from the University of Chicago copy, which contains sheets B
      and D from the second edition, it is possible that the edition was enlarged after the type of
      these first-printed sheets had been distributed.<ref target="f003.16.04" n="4"><hi
        rend="super">4</hi></ref></p>
     <p>That a very brief interval elapsed between the printing of the first and second editions is
      suggested by the fact that standing type from the first-edition titlepage was utilized in the
      second, although all other type had been distributed as printed. Very considerable haste in
      the preparation of this second edition is <pb n="003.259"/> shown by bibliographical analysis
      of its characteristics. A major break in the book between sheets D and E, indicated by the
      change in the size of the headline square brackets, shows that at least two-section printing
      with two presses obtained. The separate setting, at a minimum, of sheets F-G is indicated by
      the use of a very small-font possessive "s" following words set in small caps, which differs
      from the practice shown in sheet D of using a small-cap "s" as throughout the first edition.
      This difference is buttressed by the setting of "Marlbro" in F-G without a circumflex,
      although the form "Marlbr&ocirc;" is found in D (the name does not appear in B-C).</p>
     <p>Sheet E, which may be taken as beginning the second section, is irregular because of the
      unique wide measure used to set its inner forme. The two measures used in the sheet
      demonstrate composition by formes in order to begin printing with the least possible delay.
      The compositor of inner E differs from that of sheet D in dropping the circumflex in
      "Marlbro," but he also differs from F-G in using a small-cap possessive "s" for words set in
      small caps. That sheet E was not the only sheet to be set by formes may perhaps be indicated
      by a certain feature of the typography. In the first edition the cases contained a mixture of
      two kinds of commas, one perceptibly thinner than that proper for the font. These mixed commas
      are found in the second edition in both formes of sheet B, in inner C and inner D. Only the
      regular commas which go with the font are found in outer C and D and in all formes of E-G.</p>
     <p>If the inference is correct that in the first edition sheet D, and possibly B as well, was
      underprinted by accident or by reason of a subsequent enlargement of edition-sheet, then the
      fact that in the second edition sheet D, uniquely, was reset with the same measure as the
      first edition and printed on first-edition paper throughout very likely indicates that this
      sheet preceded all others through the press as a separate unit in order to complete the
      edition-sheet for the first edition.<ref target="f003.16.05" n="5"><hi rend="super"
       >5</hi></ref> The second edition may, therefore, have been sent to the presses in sections as
      A-C, D, E, F-G, or possibly as A-C, D, E-G. If, then, typesetting for the reprint began and
      was pushed forward rapidly before the complete exhaustion of first-edition sheets, we may
      combine this evidence with the standing type of the first-edition title-page to suggest that
      sale of the first edition was brisk and that no very great time elapsed between the printing
      of the two editions.<ref target="f003.16.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref></p>
     <p>Collation of the text of the second against that of the first edition discloses no
      substantive variants, indicative of revision, but only the scattering of <pb n="003.260"/>
      punctuation and capitalization variants which are encountered in any resetting. The number of
      compositors employed resulted in varying degrees of exactitude with which copy was followed.
      The relatively short time between the printing of the first and second editions, combined with
      the absence of substantive revision, makes it extremely unlikely that Addison had anything to
      do with the copy for the second edition or that any of its variants have authority.</p>
     <p>This point is of considerable importance for the minutiae of the text, for since the revised
      third edition was set from a copy of the second, the vast majority of the alterations from the
      first in the "accidentals" were retained. That by the retention in a substantively revised
      edition of compositors' variants Addison automatically gave them authority and his approval is
      a contention that would be utterly unsupported by modern views of the transmission of
       texts.<ref target="f003.16.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> On the other hand, the
      changes made in the third edition from the accidentals of its copy-text, the second, may be
      compositorial or may reflect Addison's markings, or both: that is a decision for an editor in
      each specific case. Otherwise, only the "accidentals" of the first edition, set from
      manuscript, have authority.</p>
     <p>The substantive revisions in the third edition are recorded by Guthkelch, but with the
      erroneous assumption, previously noted, that they originated in the 1708 edition. At least
      sixteen such alterations attest to Addison's labors of revision. Twelve alterations are slight
      changes in wording such as the shift from "indites" to "recites" (line 5), or from "A Captive
      Host" to "Whole Captive Hosts" (line 355). More positive revisions are confined to four
      passages, each a single couplet. Although these are strictly rhetorical in interest, they may
      be regarded as pointing out those passages in which Addison could have sensed the dangers of
      the kind of turgidity that led Pope to score on <hi rend="italic">The Campaign</hi> in his <hi
       rend="italic">Peri Bathous</hi>.<ref target="f003.16.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref>
      Since the revised couplets appear in widely separated passages on pages 4, 8, 13, and 16, it
      is apparent that Addison submitted the whole poem to critical scrutiny. One example, lines
      153-154 on page 8, will suffice to show the general character of his polishing. <q>
       <l>Whole Nations trampl'd into Dirt, and bruis'd</l>
       <l>In one promiscuous Carnage lye confus'd. (<hi rend="italic">First edition</hi>)</l>
       <pb n="003.261"/>
       <l>Nations with Nations mix'd confus'dly lie,</l>
       <l>And lost in one promiscuous Carnage lye. (<hi rend="italic">Third edition</hi>)</l>
      </q>
     </p>
     <p>With the recognition that Addison's work on <hi rend="italic">The Campaign</hi> was complete
      with the third edition, subsequent reprints retain but slight importance, although they do
      show continued interest in the most successful of the several score of Blenheim poems or,
      indeed, of the larger group of Marlborough panegyrics. The 1708 edition with the Latin
      translation, Hill's piracy of 1710, T. Warner's edition of 1713, and the reprint in Part VI of
      the reissue of the Dryden-Tonson <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> in 1716, all listed by
      Guthkelch, have no textual importance. Unnoticed by Guthkelch are two Tonson editions, of 1713
      and 1725, which are labeled as the fifth and sixth editions respectively. The 1713 edition is
      embellished by an engraving which depicts an Angel bearing a sword and riding the storm clouds
      above Marlborough's head, while he, mounted on a rearing horse, towers above squadrons of
      cavalry on the field of combat below. The 1725 edition is an unpretentious octavo, interesting
      only in that it is the final separate printing to be identified with the name of Tonson,
      although of course the elder Jacob had retired in 1720. Thus a total of six editions, four of
      them separate printings, are to be associated with the press of the eminent Kit-Cat
      printer.</p>
     <p>The final question remains: which of the three 1705 Tonson texts of <hi rend="italic">The
       Campaign</hi> is to be preferred? Although conventional editorial procedure would select the
      revised third to reprint, the McKerrow-Greg bibliographical school&mdash;conscious of the
      derivation of some of the "accidentals" of the third from the unauthoritative second
      edition&mdash;would choose the authoritative first edition as copy-text and in this would
      incorporate the authoritative substantive revisions of the third and such of its unique
      "accidentals" variants as might be due to Addison's own alterations.<ref target="f003.16.09"
       n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> To date no edition is available which, according to this
      standard, is completely satisfactory.<ref target="f003.16.10" n="10"><hi rend="super"

    <div2 type="subsection">
     <p>Although in England reprints and collections of Elizabethan and seventeenth-century poetry
      and drama were popular throughout the eighteenth century, this eminently critical age lacked
      easy access to its rich heritage of literary criticism. Only slowly were the classics of
      Elizabethan and seventeenth-century criticism reprinted, and for these there was so little
      demand that the editors usually had to share or assume the financial risk of publication. No
      history of English criticism appeared to supplement Thomas Warton's <hi rend="italic">History
       of English Poetry</hi>. In 1737 Elizabeth Cooper promised "<hi rend="italic">some Account of
       the Progress of Criticism in</hi> England; <hi rend="italic">from Sir</hi> Philip Sidney, <hi
       rend="italic">the Art of</hi> English <hi rend="italic">Posey (written by Mr.</hi> Puttenham,
       <hi rend="italic">a Gentleman Pensioner to Queen</hi> Elizabeth:) <hi rend="italic">Sir</hi>
      John Harrington, Ben Johnson, &amp;<hi rend="italic">c</hi>."<ref target="f003.17.01" n="1"
        ><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> But the volume which was to contain this account never
      appeared, nor did Dr. Johnson ever write his more ambitious "History of Criticism . . . from
      Aristotle to the present age."<ref target="f003.17.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
     <p>The first separate English reprint of Elizabethan literary criticism seems to have been that
      of Sidney's <hi rend="italic">Defence of Poesy</hi> issued in 1752 by G. Robert Urie, one of
      Glasgow's foremost publishers. This book, though neatly printed and adorned with a portrait,
      was an isolated phenomenon, since it did not promote further republication of literary
      criticism.</p>
     <p>The unpretentious forerunner of future scholarly collections was published in 1787 by Joseph
      Warton. Warton had acquired experience as an anthologist by assisting Dodsley to select
      material for his <hi rend="italic">Collection</hi>. He had established a reputation as
      literary critic by his edition of Virgil, his critical papers in <hi rend="italic">The
       Adventurer</hi>, and his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Writings and Genius of Alexander
       Pope</hi>. On 18 April 1784 Warton suggested to the printer John Nichols the small compendium
      which appeared in 1787 as <hi rend="italic">Sir Philip Sydney's Defence of Poetry, and
       Observations on Poetry and Eloquence, from the Discoveries of Ben Jonson:</hi>
      <q>I have a little Printing-Scheme to mention to you and imagine you will not mislike to join
       with me in the <hi rend="italic">Profit</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Loss</hi>. We all know
       what a Taste is diffused for reading our old Poets. I think some of our old <hi rend="italic"
        >Critics</hi> might be made as popular and pleasing.<ref target="f003.17.03" n="3"><hi
         rend="super">3</hi></ref></q> For this venture Warton thus offered to share the expenses
      and undertook to furnish copy, supply notes, and read proof. Nichols promptly accepted and,
       <pb n="003.263"/> evidently on 27 April, Warton sent copy to the printer. For some reason
      publication was delayed until early in 1787, possibly because Warton was remiss in performing
      his editorial duties. Of the second volume of his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Writings and
       Genius of Pope</hi> two hundred pages had lain in the warehouse for more than a score of
      years while the publishers waited for him to complete the volume. Finally, on 12 December
      1786, Warton sent in the preliminaries for his collection of literary criticism, suggesting
      that publication might coincide with his presence in London about January the sixth or
      seventh. About that date, probably, it appeared, published by G.G.J. and J. Robinson and J.
      Walter.</p>
     <p>This slender compendium was possibly Joseph Warton's greatest service to English
      scholarship; but it had its deficiencies. Warton did not attempt to reproduce the original
      texts, or probably even to consult them. Instead he used for copy eighteenth-century editions
      of Sidney's and Jonson's <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, even further modernizing the
      punctuation and paragraphing and marking for omission several passages in Jonson's <hi
       rend="italic">Timber, or Discoveries</hi>. Nor did the edition include the explanatory notes
      which the editor had intended to supply. Despite these modernizations, however, sale of the
      book was slow. Indeed most copies were evidently still unsold when on 8 February 1808
      Nichols's warehouse burned with all his stock, so that soon Warton's book was difficult to
      obtain.</p>
     <p>Meanwhile at the very end of the eighteenth century, in 1800, accurate scholarly methods
      were finally applied to the editing of literary criticism. For his edition of Dryden's <hi
       rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Prose Works</hi> Warton's friend Edmond Malone used
      and collated originals, employing methods which he had helped to perfect in editing
      Shakespeare.</p>
     <p>In 1810, two years after most of Warton's edition burned, Sidney's <hi rend="italic"
       >Defence</hi> was reprinted by Edward Hovell, Lord Thurlow. He was prompted to replace
      Warton's editon and, possibly, to help satisfy interest aroused in Sidney by Thomas Zouch's
       <hi rend="italic">Life and Writings of Sir Philip Sydney</hi>, published in 1808. In his
      edition of <hi rend="italic">The Defence</hi>, which appeared in December, 1810, Thurlow made
      no attempt to apply Malone's scholarly methods to the editing of Sidney. Instead he merely
      reprinted Warton's text, modernizing the capitals and prefacing five original sonnets. This
      edition, elegantly printed by W. Bulmer in quarto on large wove paper, evidently found so few
      purchasers at the shop of White and Cochrane on Fleet Street that Thurlow decided to get rid
      of some copies by preparing a private or gift issue. For this issue he used the original
      sheets containing the text of Sidney's <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi> but printed new
      preliminaries. He deleted the publishers' names on the title-page, acknowledged there the
      sonnets included in both issues, changed the date of publication to 1811, suppressed the
      advertisement, and added a two-leaf gathering to include an additional original poem. The
      leaves he had only slightly cut and gilded; and the whole issue he had elegantly bound.<ref
       target="f003.17.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref></p>
     <pb n="003.264"/>
     <p>Thurlow's edition of Sidney's <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi> probably helped to lead Joseph
      Haslewood, who was already editing scarce and curious Elizabethan material, to publish in 1811
      an edition of Puttenham's <hi rend="italic">Arte of English Poesie</hi>. At least Haslewood in
      1815 omitted Sidney's <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi> from his anthology of criticism because
      it had already been edited by Thurlow's "noble hand." In his edition of Puttenham, Haslewood
      followed Malone in the tradition of scholarly accuracy and on some points was even more
      meticulous than his predecessor had been. Haslewood's edition is a page by page reprint of the
      1589 Field edition. Even in bibliographical features such as pagination, signatures, and
      gatherings all the accidental oddities of the original were reproduced. Haslewood skipped page
      numbers 93 to 100, which had in his original been left unused to compensate for four
      unpaginated leaves, omitted from many copies, including that used by him. He signed his leaves
      in the style Field had used, C, C ij, C iij, C iiij, <hi rend="italic">etc.</hi>, though why
      he signed leaf aiij as a 5 and aiiij as a 7 does not appear. In reproducing the original
      gatherings he was just as scrupulous, imitating the original two-leaf gathering I and only the
      three leaves that he saw of the original <hi rend="italic">AB</hi> gathering. Haslewood's
      leaves [Bij] and Biij are conjugate and correspond to Field's [<hi rend="italic">ABij</hi>]
      and <hi rend="italic">A B iij</hi>. The single leaf B, blank like Field's leaf <hi
       rend="italic">AB</hi>, Haslewood had his binder paste onto the preceding leaf. Since in
      Haslewood's copy of Field's edition the original leaf [<hi rend="italic">ABiiij</hi>],
      containing the woodcut portrait of Queen Elizabeth, had been removed from its original
      position, Haselwood, thinking that he was following Field, omitted this leaf from his B
      gathering, but had the portrait printed with sheet a to face his general title-page.</p>
     <p>Accompanying the publication of Puttenham's <hi rend="italic">Arte</hi>, Haslewood announced
      his intention of publishing a uniform edition of all the essays on poetry up to Dryden.
      Meanwhile he continued to edit and encourage the publication of rare old volumes. In 1812 he
      helped to found the Roxburghe Club for this purpose. During the same year he became, with Sir
      Edgerton Brydges, joint editor of <hi rend="italic">The British Bibliographer;</hi> and in the
      fourth volume he printed critical extracts from Henry Reynold's <hi rend="italic"
       >Mythomystes</hi>.</p>
     <p>In 1815 finally appeared Haslewood's anthology of critical essays, <hi rend="italic">The
       Arte of English Poesie, &amp;c.</hi>, later designated, with the Puttenham volume, as <hi
       rend="italic">Ancient Critical Essays on Poets and Poesie</hi>. Complaining of the difficulty
      of locating copies, Haslewood here renounced his project of reprinting a complete series of
      critical essays, but this 1815 volume is in itself a magnificent collection. It comprises
      Gascoigne's <hi rend="italic">Certayne Notes of Instruction</hi>, Webbe's <hi rend="italic"
       >Discourse of English Poetrie</hi>, King James VI's <hi rend="italic">Treatise of the Airt of
       Scottis Poesie</hi>, Harrington's <hi rend="italic">Apologie of Poetrie</hi>, Meres's <hi
       rend="italic">Comparative Discourse of our English Poets</hi>, Campion's <hi rend="italic"
       >Observations in the Art of English Poesie</hi>, Daniel's <hi rend="italic">Defense of
       Rhyme</hi>, Bolton's <hi rend="italic">Hypercritica</hi>, and five letters on poetry by
      Spenser and Harvey. Here Haslewood again tried to reproduce his originals as accurately as
      possible, and he indicated variant <pb n="003.265"/> readings when he could locate more than
      one authoritative text. At least some of the volume is, again, a page for page reprint; and
      though he could not here follow the original pagination and signatures, he varied the style of
      his signatures to follow his originals. It was beautifully printed in an edition of 220 copies
      by T. Bensley, Sir Edgerton Brydge's printer. It was a worthy culmination of the renaissance
      of interest in older criticism begun with Warton's thin collection in 1787. Only a century
      later was it superseded, and even then the modern editors like G. Smith frequently abstracted
      what Haslewood had printed in full and modernized punctuation which he had reproduced
      faithfully.</p>

     <name type="author">Atcheson L. Hench</name>
    </head>
    <p>The Alderman Library of the University of Virginia was happy to find recently that the
     annotations in a fragment of a black-letter Chaucer which it owns are those of the great
     english scholar and editor Thomas Tyrwhitt. It finds further that nearly all the matching
     fragments of the volume, also annotated, are in the Britism Museum.</p>
    <p>In 1944 the Alderman Library purchased, at the suggestion of the English department, from
     Myers and Co. of London, a book-fragment (catalogue 340, item 107) described as "ninety-nine
     leaves and portions of several others of Speght's edition of Chaucer, 1602, most extensively
     annotated and corrected by Timothy Thomas . . . in connection with Urry's edition of Chaucer's
     works . . . of which he was the final editor."</p>
    <p>In 1946, Dr. George Pace, at that time of the University of Virginia English faculty,
     examined the emendations and came to the conclusion that they were not those of Timothy Thomas
     but were probably those of Tyrwhitt; they bore no relation to the Urry text but were identical
     with Tyrwhitt's text.</p>
    <p>That the emendations are Tyrwhitt's, Pace has now happily established as true. Recently in
     London, he writes, he examined a fragment of a black-letter Chaucer in the British Museum
     (press mark 641.m.19). He saw written on the recto of the leaf which precedes the title page a
     note, "Bequeathed by Tho<hi rend="super">s</hi> Tyrwhitt Esq. 1786." Furthermore the volume
     lacks folios 1-85 and 92-108, the very folios which&mdash;except for two two-folio
     breaks&mdash;are present in the Alderman fragment. All this makes a pleasing discovery.</p>
    <p>The Alderman fragment contains the prologue to the <hi rend="italic">Canterbury Tales</hi>
     and all the tales now held authentic except for the two two-folio breaks already mentioned and
     a segment of the Parson's tale; it also lacks a large part of the apocryphal Plowman's Tale.
     The marginal emendations, of which there are thousands, and the instructions make it clear that
     the fragment is part of <pb n="003.266"/> Tyrwhitt's copy for the printer. They reveal the
     pains-taking devotion of a great scholar to his task. His five-volume edition of the <hi
      rend="italic">Tales</hi>, the first of the modern ones, was published, part in 1775 and the
     rest in 1778. He was the first to make sense out of what were then the baffling mysteries of
     Chaucer's language and the supposed crudities of his verse.</p>
    <p>The volume deserves and awaits close study.</p>

    <div2 type="subsection">
     <p>The bibliographer of George Crabbe's works has strange opportunities in the United States of
      America, for on this side of the Atlantic have been preserved several early editions which
      have not thus far come to light in the libraries of Europe and have not been listed in the
      bibliographies of Crabbe hitherto published.<ref target="f003.19.01" n="1"><hi rend="super"
        >1</hi></ref> One of these scarce early editions is a collection of the tales and
      miscellaneous poems of Crabbe which was brought out in 1847 by H.G. Bohn. A copy of this
      collection, once owned by the Public School Library of Municipality No. 2, New Orleans,
      Louisiana, is now in the New Orleans Public Library.<ref target="f003.19.02" n="2"><hi

     <p>The volume is of interest both as a rarity and as an additional testimonial of the
      popularity of Crabbe's works about the middle of the nineteenth century. I regret that I have
      not been able to identify the makers of the drawings and the plates or to determine what

    <div2 type="subsection">
     <p>The story of the establishing of the Cambridge, Massachusetts, Press, the first printing
      house in England's North American colonies, has been told and retold many times during the
      past one hundred and forty years, but the known facts about its founding are still relatively
      few, singularly open to various interpretations, and really not materially augmented over
      those set down by Isaiah Thomas in the first edition of his <hi rend="italic">History of
       Printing in America</hi> (1810).</p>
     <p>Especially lacking are details about the financing of the original printing house
      established at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the autumn of 1638. Writers on the subject have
      been understandably reluctant to accept as sole founder and benefactor of the Cambridge Press
      the Reverend Jose Glover, Non-Con-formist clergyman of Surrey, who died at sea in the summer
      of 1638 while conveying the press and other printing equipment and supplies to Massachusetts.
      There is, indeed, some evidence that others besides Glover helped to procure the press and
      fonts of type for the new colony.</p>
     <p>Speculation about these circumstances by writers on the Press seems to stem almost
      completely from two entries made by the third president of Harvard College, Leonard Hoar, in
      the early records of the college. In 1674 Hoar, attempting to list for posterity various
      benefactors of Harvard in its early days, wrote down seven names as follows: <q>
       <l>Benefactors to the first ffont of</l>
       <l>Letters for printing in Cambridge.</l>
       <l>Their names collected p L H 1674</l>
       <pb n="003.268"/>
       <l>Major Thomas Clark</l>
       <l>Capt James Oliver</l>
       <l>Capt Allen</l>
       <l>Capt Lake</l>
       <l>Mr Stoddard</l>
       <l> ffreake</l>
       <l> Hues<ref target="f003.20.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref></l>
      </q> At a different time, but during his twenty-seven months as President, Hoar collected and
      entered the following information: </p>
     <q>
      <p>Mr Joss: Glover gave to the Colledge a ffont of printing Letters.</p>
      <p>Some Gentlemen of Amsterdam gave towards the furnishing of a Printing-Press with Letters
       gave [sic] fourty nine pound &amp; something more.<ref target="f003.20.02" n="2"><hi
         rend="super">2</hi></ref>
      </p>
     </q>
     <p>The purpose of this note is to correct a widely-accepted legend that identifies the seven
      names on the list made by Hoar with the "Gentlemen of Amsterdam." Both of Hoar's entries were
      printed by Thomas in 1810, but Roden seems to have been the first to make this identification
      with a misleading passage in his <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Press</hi> (1905), pp. 10-11:
       <q>At his [Glover's] own expense he provided a font of type and procured funds from friends
       in England and Holland for a complete printing establishment, '&pound;49 and something more'
       being donated by seven men whose names were collected by Leonard Hoar in 1674: Major Thomas
       Clarke, Captain James Oliver, Captain Allen, Captain Lake, Mr. Stoddard, Mr. Freake, and Mr.
       Hues.</q> An examination of the actual information as preserved in the manuscript records at
      Harvard shows that Roden came to the wrong conclusion. The list of names and the entry about
      the benefactors of Amsterdam are not even preserved in the same volume of records; thus there
      is no physical connection between these two scraps of information, and the sum of &pound;49 is
      wrongly associated with the seven English names.</p>
     <p>G. P. Winship has helped to perpetuate this false identification, first in an article in
      1938<ref target="f003.20.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> and again in a further
      consideration of the Cambridge Press in 1939.<ref target="f003.20.04" n="4"><hi rend="super"
        >4</hi></ref> Finally, in 1945, when Mr. Winship wrote his extensive monograph <pb
       n="003.269"/> on the Cambridge Press, he printed the two excerpts from the early Harvard
      records and then wrote the following: <q>The two entries made at different times must refer to
       the same gift, and this gift must have been made before a press was set up in the colony. . .
       . There are circumstances which render an Amsterdam contribution toward a New England venture
       at the time explicable. . . . Holland had long been the principal purveyor of type and
       supplies to English printers. The Dutch ports were the most frequented commercial centers of
       northern Europe, and their normal trading advantages were strengthened for English merchants
       by the large numbers of disaffected fellow countrymen who were living in the Low Countries.
       Taking these factors into account it would not be surprising if a group of shipmasters and
       supercargoes engaged in the Massachusetts Bay trade, happening to sit together of an evening,
       agreed that it might be a profitable speculation to help to establish a printing shop
       overseas where the illicit Puritan printing that was being suppressed in Holland could be
       done without danger of interference. Circumstances can be imagined which might have led such
       a group to contribute generously to such a proposal.<ref target="f003.20.05" n="5"><hi
         rend="super">5</hi></ref></q></p>
     <p>Although thus conjecturally connected by Winship, there is nothing implicit in the entries
      to suggest that the seven names might be identified as the gentlemen of Amsterdam.
      Furthermore, none of the scholars who have written about the Cambridge Press seem to have
      investigated the list to see if the names may not be identifiable. Actually, such an
      investigation provides proof that the names are not those of the gentlemen of Amsterdam.
      Instead, at least four of them can be positively identified as residents of New England many
      years after the printing house at Cambridge was established. Major Thomas Clark was actually
      an Overseer of Harvard College during Hoar's administration;<ref target="f003.20.06" n="6"
        ><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> Captain James Oliver was a resident of Massachusetts and had
      given money to Harvard about twenty years before Hoar recorded his name;<ref
       target="f003.20.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> Mr. Stoddard was both an Overseer of
      the College and its Librarian: he had not yet been born when the Cambridge Press was
       founded.<ref target="f003.20.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> There was a Captain John
      Allen who lived <pb n="003.270"/> in Massachusetts at this time, although identification of
      him as a benefactor of Harvard College cannot be definite.<ref target="f003.20.09" n="9"><hi
        rend="super">9</hi></ref> Mr. Freake cannot be positively identified, although two English
      brothers, Ralph and John Freck, are known to have given books to the Harvard Library not long
      before Hoar's administration.<ref target="f003.20.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref>
      Lake and Hues do not seem to appear in early Massachusetts records.</p>
     <p>There seems no doubt, then, that in light of this information all previous speculations that
      Hoar's two entries refer to the same gift are erroneous.</p>

    <div2 type="subsection" n="1">
     <p>To this day the question of who first cast type in America remains unsettled. Although the
      claims in behalf of Abel Buell, of Connecticut, are the strongest, there remains an element of
       doubt.<ref target="f003.21.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
     <p>That we cannot be certain is due largely to a statement in the <hi rend="italic"
       >Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News-Letter</hi> for September 7, 1769, that
      "Printing Types are also made by Mr. Mitchelson of . . . [Boston] equal to any imported from
      Great-Britain." This casual remark seems destined to cast a lengthening shadow over the
      problem of Buell's priority. It is given further weight by the statement made by Isaiah Thomas
      in his <hi rend="italic">History of Printing in America</hi> that "An attempt was made to
      establish a foundry for casting types in Boston about 1768, by a Mr. Mitchelson from Scotland,
      but he did not succeed."</p>
     <p>The "Mr. Mitchelson" of the <hi rend="italic">Massachusetts Gazette</hi> and of Isaiah
      Thomas has been plausibly identified by Mr. Lawrence Wroth as David Mitchelson, who had
      arrived in Boston from Scotland in October, 1764. He was a member of the religious sect called
      Sandemanians, the leader of which, Robert Sandeman, came to America at the same time. By trade
      he was a goldsmith and lapidary&mdash;like Gutenberg, and like Abel Buell as well&mdash;and
      thereby qualified, at least by precedent, to turn his skill to casting type.</p>
     <pb n="003.271"/>
     <p>In discussing Mitchelson's possible merits as a type founder, in the appendix to his <hi
       rend="italic">Abel Buell of Connecticut</hi>, Mr. Wroth suggests that Mitchelson was working
      in co-operation with John Mein, the Boston bookseller and partner in the printing shop of Mein
      and Fleeming.<ref target="f003.21.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> That Wroth does so
      is on the basis of a letter from Benjamin Gale to Ezra Stiles of April 1, 1769, where Gale
      writes, "However as Buel is jealous of his being intercepted by Mein you will not mention
      Bismuths entring that Composition." The context implies that Mein, like Buell, was interested
      in the founding of type, and Mr. Wroth is able to assume that Mein was linked with
      Mitchelson's activities.</p>
     <p>The conjunction is a reasonable one. Mein and Mitchelson were probably acquainted, for they
      apparently were fellow-passengers aboard the shop <hi rend="italic">George and James</hi>
      which brought Mein to America. That Mein was also a Sandemanian is not known, but a member of
      the Sandeman family was a partner in the first shop he set up in Boston. His subsequent
      partner, John Fleeming, had also come to New England earlier in 1764, and had, with William
      McAlpine, printed <hi rend="italic">Some Thoughts on Christianity</hi>, the first work by
      Robert Sandeman to be published in America.</p>
     <p>But can we, even so, find any evidence that Mitchelson did cast type, to substantiate his
      reported efforts? And are we justified in connecting him with John Mein?</p>
     <p>Before Mein set up his shop with John Fleeming he apparently employed William McAlpine to do
      his printing. Early in 1767 he and Fleeming began to issue works with a joint imprint which
      are distinctive in a curious bold-face roman type so unusual as to make its presence valid
      evidence of Mein and Fleeming printing even when their imprint does not appear on the
      title-page.<ref target="f003.21.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> As a type face it is
      a prototype of that which became so popular in the early nineteenth century, when it came to
      be known in the printing trade as "Scotch" type.</p>
     <p>The need for accounting for the Mein and Fleeming type is perhaps the strongest support for
      Mitchelson's actual activity as a type founder and for linking him to John Mein that exists.
      For if Mitchelson did not cast the type, who did?</p>
     <p>Although Mr. Wroth has noted the use of this bold-face roman only in Boston at a slightly
      later period (when the type may have come from Fleeming's possession after Mein's departure
      for England late in 1769), and by John Carter in Providence, it does occur in other printing
      of the 1770's. For instance, John <pb n="003.272"/> Howe, the printer set up by the British
      forces in Newport during their occupation of the town, possessed a supply, probably brought
      from Boston.</p>
     <p>More significant is the fact that Alexander Purdie, of Williamsburg, like-wise employed it
      in his <hi rend="italic">Virginia Gazette</hi> and elsewhere, such as the title-page of <hi
       rend="italic">The Proceedings of the Convention of Delegates . . . the 6th of May</hi>, 1776.
      <ref target="f003.21.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> John Dunlap, of Philadelphia, is
      also known to have used it.</p>
     <p>Despite the fact that Dunlap came from northern Ireland (which was, none the less,
      culturally and economically related to Scotland), it is noteworthy that Alexander Purdie, like
      both Mein and Fleeming, was a Scotchman. If our bold-face roman type was not cast in America,
      it is probable that it came from Scotland, as suggested by the popular name given to its
      descendants. According to Isaiah Thomas, Fleeming in 1766 had returned to Scotland to secure
      printing supplies: that these included type follows.</p>
     <p>A comprehensive examination of Scottish books of the period has not been feasible, but it
      may be noted that the first edition of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclop&oelig;dia
       Britannica</hi>, the publication of which was completed in 1771, is in the same bold-face
      roman. Scattered instances of its use are found in other British works such as William Woty's
       <hi rend="italic">Poetical Works</hi> (London, G. Scott, 1770), and for the text of John
      Tait's <hi rend="italic">Poetical Legends</hi> (London, J. Donaldson, 1775). That the printer
      of the latter, John Donaldson, was a Scotchman may be deduced on the basis of his name alone;
      but before moving to London he had in fact been a printer in Edinburgh. On the other hand, the
      London, 1767, edition of Tissot's <hi rend="italic">Advice to the People</hi>, cited by Mr.
      Wroth as an English use of the type, proves to be an American edition with a false imprint.
      <ref target="f003.21.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref></p>
     <p>In their <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Specimens of Printing Types</hi> (London, 1935), W.
      T. Berry and A. F. Johnson list no Scottish examples of the 1760's or 1770's other than those
      issued by Alexander Wilson. A comparison of Wilson's faces with the Mein and Fleeming types
      eliminates effectively any likelihood that Wilson produced the latter. During this period
      there was, however, another type founder in Scotland, a relatively obscure person named John
      Baine. Mr. George H. Bushnell, Librarian of St. Andrews University, is currently engaged on a
      biography of him, but as yet very little is known regarding Baine. At one time a partner of
      Alexander Wilson, Baine appears to have been active many years before the appearance of his
      first recorded type specimen book, <hi rend="italic">A Specimen of Printing Types by John
       Baine &amp; Grandson &amp; Co.</hi> (Edinburgh, 1787). Of it a unique copy, which belonged to
      Isaiah Thomas, is preserved at the American Antiquarian Society. A comparison of Mein's type
      specimen sheet of <hi rend="italic">ca.</hi> 1768 with the Baine types leaves no more than a
      perfunctory doubt that it was from Baine that Mein and Fleeming secured their type.</p>
     <pb n="003.273"/>
     <p>The possibility that the Mein and Fleeming type may none the less have been cast in America
      from matrices supplied by Baine is largely disposed of by at least one strange phenomenon
      observed in printing done by their shop. In setting <hi rend="italic">A Sermon Delivered July
       31st, 1768</hi>, by Sylvanus Conant (Boston, 1768), the compositor, probably following the
      author's copy, set the words "Lord" and "God" in large capitals throughout the work. Its
      theological nature, needless to say, gave frequent occasion for their appearance. A close
      examination of some of the capital O's reveals a slight deformity at the foot of the letter
      which on further scrutiny proves to be a vestige of the tail of a Q. The demand for capital
      O's for the words "Lord" and "God" may well have taxed the resources of the shop: in any
      event, the Q's were obviously cut down either for this or an earlier need. The same modified
      Q's will be found in the running titles of Mein's newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Boston
       Chronicle</hi>, which were kept as standing type during the early months of its career.
      Amusing as this is as a demonstration of the printer's ingenuity, its importance for us lies
      in the fact that, if matrices were available, to cast the needed O's would have been easier
      than to file off the tails of the Q's.</p>
     <p>Whatever the truth may be regarding the newspaper reference to Mitchelson, there is even
      less reason for linking him with the Scotch type of Mein and Fleeming, in face of a recognized
      source for it in the foundry of John Baine. It is perhaps wisest and safest to accept Isaiah
      Thomas's statement that in his efforts to set up a foundry Mitchelson did not succeed. If Mein
      were associated with him, then Mein had other more pressing problems on his hands, for the
      year 1769 found Mein engaged in political controversy which led to his being mobbed in the
      streets of Boston and to an ignominious flight to England.</p>
    </div2>
    <div2 type="subsection" n="2">
     <p>In attributing the Mein and Fleeming type to John Baine, a new pattern in American type
      history is made possible, a new continuity with British typography established. In his essay
      on "British Influences upon American Printing," recently published in his <hi rend="italic"
       >Typographic Heritage</hi> (1949), Mr. Wroth recognizes the r&ocirc;le played by John Baine
      and his grandson in casting the type used by Thomas Dodson in printing Rees's <hi
       rend="italic">Encyclop&oelig;dia</hi>, although the face used is a traditional face unlike
      the bold-face roman of Mein and Fleeming.</p>
     <p>Continuing, Mr. Wroth speaks of the work of Binny and Ronaldson of Philadelphia, the first
      type founders to achieve significant and lasting stature in America. Both were Scotchmen, and
      in the partnership it was Binny who contributed the knowledge of printing and of punch
      cutting. Although they began business in 1797 their first specimen book of types did not
      appear until 1812. Of the two distinct faces displayed, the first was a transitional letter
      which, recast in recent times, has been named "Oxford," and, even more recently, has been
      recut by the Linotype Company as "Monticello."</p>
     <pb n="003.274"/>
     <p>The other face cast by Binny and Ronaldson is one which, in Stanley Morison's words, is a
      "fat grotesque," one of the "bold, bad faces" which none the less achieved great popularity.
      But in speaking at some length of this face Mr. Wroth does not call attention to the fact that
      its resemblance to the Baine type is most remarkable. The obvious question arises: Was there
      any connection between Baine and his fellow Scots Binny and Ronaldson?</p>
     <p>The evidence for such a connection is at present inconclusive. The research in which Mr. P.
      J. Conkwright, of the Princeton University Press, is currently engaged concerning Binny and
      Ronaldson should ultimately clarify the matter. In the meantime we do know that Baine and his
      grandson came to Philadelphia around 1790, where shortly thereafter the elder man died. There
      is reason to believe that Binny was as a young man apprenticed to Baine, and the ledgers of
      the firm record that on June 12, 1799, J. Baine (presumably the grandson) sold to Binny and
      Ronaldson &dollar;300 worth of tools. What these tools included is not specified, but in the
      sale there is evidence of continuity. That the boldface Binny and Ronaldson type is a lineal
      descendant of the Baine face becomes a very real possibility.<ref target="f003.21.07" n="7"

    </div2>
    <div2 type="subsection" n="3">
     <p>As the innovator of the type known as "Scotch" John Baine's significance is consequently far
      greater than has been hitherto acknowledged in the history of typography, both in America and
      in Great Britain. As a result, the importance ascribed to Richard Austin and to Robert Thorne
      by A. F. Johnson, discussing the evolution of modern-face roman in his <hi rend="italic">Type
       Designs</hi> (1934) should be reevaluated and reconsidered. Obscure as he may have been, to
      Baine should apparently be attributed the bold-face roman type which, unfortunately, makes so
      much early nineteenth-century printing hideous to our eyes.</p>

    </head>
    <div2 type="subsection">
     <p>The early summer of the third year of the Revolutionary War was a period of crisis for the
      struggling colonials. One British army under General Burgoyne had launched an invasion of New
      York State from Canada and, having conquered Ticonderoga, was moving down the Hudson towards
      Albany. Another, commanded by General Sir William Howe, was being herded aboard the troopships
      that were to take them from New York to the Head of Elk in Maryland, from which they were to
      march overland to the rebel capital at <pb n="003.275"/> Philadelphia. In that city, the
      Continental Congress was busy with the varied complex of problems, military, diplomatic, and
      financial, that were all crying for attention and action.</p>
     <p>There, on the seventh of July, 1777, a petition from a group of Presbyterian clergymen was
      received, which called on the Congress to underwrite the printing of an edition of the Bible
      for the use of patriot families. This petition was sponsored by the Reverend Francis Allison,
      assistant pastor of the first Presbyterian church of Philadelphia; John Ewing, provost of the
      University of Pennsylvania; and William Marshall. These gentlemen were much concerned over the
      lack of Bibles in the colonies and the difficulty of importing them from abroad, and they
      apparently felt that a war for liberty could not be won by bullets alone. The petition<ref
       target="f003.22.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> was immediately referred to a
      committee consisting of John Adams of Massachusetts, Daniel Roberdeau and Jonathan Bayard
      Smith of Philadelphia.<ref target="f003.22.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
     <p>The petition, the original manuscript of which appears in the Papers of the Continental
      Congress, is printed here below for the first time: <list>
       <item>1. As the Price of Bibles for the Use of Families and Schools is greatly advanced
        beyond what was formerly given for them, thro their Scarcity and Difficulty in importing
        them from Europe, it is highly expedient for Congress to order a common Bible to be printed
        under their Inspection for the Use of y<hi rend="super">e</hi> united States of
        America.</item>
       <item>2. That as there are about 500,000 families in the united States, each standing in Need
        of one or more Bibles, many Thousand Copies of the holy Scriptures are immediately wanted
        and ought to be furnished at a moderate Price.</item>
       <item>3. That as there are not Types in America to answer this Purpose, there should be a
        compleat Font, sufficient for setting the whole Bible at once, imported by Congress at the
        Public Expence, to be refunded in a stipulated Time by the Printer.</item>
       <item>4. That in Order to prevent the Paper Makers from demanding an extravagant Price for
        the Paper, and retarding the Work by Breach of Contract or otherwise there should also be
        imported with the Types a few Reams of Paper, not exceeding a thousand, at the Beginning of
        the Work, to be paid for by the Printer in y<hi rend="super">e</hi> same Manner as y<hi
         rend="super">e</hi> Types are to be paid for.</item>
       <item>5. That a Printer be employed, who shall undertake the Work at his own Risque &amp;
        Expence, giving a Mortgage on y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Font &amp; Printing Materials, with
        sufficient Personal Securities for his Fidelity, until the first Cost of y<hi rend="super"
         >e</hi> Font, y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Paper, &amp; such Sums of Money as the Congress may
        think proper to advance to him for Dispatch of the Work, be refunded to the Public.</item>
       <pb n="003.276"/>
       <item>6. That in Order to render the Price of Binding as low as possible, the Congress order
        their Commissary General for Hides etc to deliver to the Printer at a moderate Price all the
        Sheep Skins furnished at y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Camp, to be tanned for this
        Purpose.</item>
       <item>7. That the Printer be bound under sufficient Penalties to furnish Bibles to y<hi
         rend="super">e</hi> Public at a limited Price, not exceeding ten Shillings each, &amp; to
        prevent any Retailer, under him in the united States from asking an higher price on any
        Pretence whatsoever.</item>
       <item>8. That, as the greatest Precaution is necessary to preserve the sacred Text
        uncorrupted &amp; free from Errors, an accurate &amp; skillful Corrector of the Press be
        employed at a proper Salary, to superintend the Impression, untill the whole Bible be
        composed: and then that the Frames be carefully locked up in proper Places prepared for y<hi
         rend="super">e</hi> Purpose, to guard against an accidental or designed Alteration of them,
        and to have them ready for constant Use to supply the Public Demand.</item>
       <item>9. That the Printer on no Pretence whatsoever presume to strike off any Sheet of the
        Bible, untill the Corrector has examined a sufficient Number of Proofs &amp; judged it to be
        sufficiently accurate &amp; corrected: and that this Precaution be taken as often as any
        Frame is used after having been locked up for some Time past.</item>
       <item>10. That y<hi rend="super">e</hi> most correct Copy of the Bible that can be found be
        delivered by y<hi rend="super">e</hi> Congress to the Printer, who shall be bound by solemn
        Oath not to vary from it knowingly in his Edition, even in a single Iota, without first
        laying the proposed Alteration before Congress &amp; obtaining their Approbation.</item>
       <item>11. That the Corrector be bound by a similar Oath, to correct the Sheets according to
        that Copy.</item>
       <item>12. That instead of the old Dedication to King James, a new Dedication to the Congress
        be drawn up &amp; prefixed to the Bible.</item>
       <item>13. That instead of the Words, <hi rend="italic">newly translated out of the original
         Tongues, &amp; By his Majesty's special Command</hi>, in the Title Page of our Bibles, it
        be said, <hi rend="italic">translated from the original Tongues</hi>, and, <hi rend="italic"
         >Printed by Order of Congress</hi>.</item>
       <item>14. That the Printer employed in the Work devote himself to this Business alone; &amp;
        that no other Printer in the united States be suffered to interfere with him in the Printing
        of that Form or Kind of a Bible, which he has undertaken.</item>
       <item>15. That after the Bible is published, no more Bibles of that Kind be imported into the
        American States by any Person whatsoever.</item>
      </list>
     </p>
     <p>This was no ordinary printing job which Mr. Allison had proposed and of which Congress was
      expected to dispose. Up to 1777, there had been no complete English Bible printed in the
      colonies, and the English-speaking inhabitants depended on British presses for their copies of
      the Scriptures. There had been Bibles printed in the colonies, but these had been in
      non-English tongues and <pb n="003.277"/> had been produced in relatively small numbers. Thus,
      as early as 1663, Samuel Green and Marmaduke Johnson of Cambridge, Massachusetts, had issued
      one such printed in the Maumee tongue, the <hi rend="italic">lingua franca</hi> of the New
      England Indians. This was the famous and rare Eliot Bible, prepared by the Reverend John Eliot
      for the use of Congregationalist missionaries to the red heathens of Massachusetts. Then, in
      1743, Christopher Saur, a Rhenish German printer settled in Germantown, Pa., issued a Bible in
      German, the first to be published in a European tongue in North America. Even Saur had had to
      use imported paper and type. However, another edition of the German Bible, which appeared in
      1763, was the first to use American-made paper. Then, in 1776, Saur's son, also Christopher,
      published the first Bible to be printed from American-cast types. However, these were all
      limited editions, the Saur or German Bible, running only to 1200 copies, while the third or
      1777 edition to only 3000.<ref target="f003.22.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> The
      project now before Congress, on the other hand, called for 20,000 English Bibles to be run off
      by an American printer at a time when every resource was at least theoretically devoted to war
      production. However, the committee to which Mr. Allison's petition had been referred began
      studying the most practicable way of solving the problem, and before arriving at a solution
      turned to the printers of Philadelphia, inviting them to submit estimates and to give their
      advice on the best way to print 20,000 Bibles. This was quite natural, since at that time many
      of the competent printshops in the Confederation were located in that city. Of the other two
      colonial printing centers, New York was in the hands of the enemy, while Boston was many days'
      hard travel from the capital of the Confederation. At least five printers, all of them
      Pennsylvanians, submitted estimates in which every phase of the work, the cost of every piece
      of equipment and every material was quoted.</p>
     <p>One of those submitting bids was Robert Aitken<ref target="f003.22.04" n="4"><hi
        rend="super">4</hi></ref> (1734-1806), a Quaker of Scotch birth, who was already established
      in his profession by his work as publisher of the <hi rend="italic">Pennsylvania Magazine</hi>
      and of an edition of the New Testament. Figuring 24 pages to each sheet and the weight<ref
       target="f003.22.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> of type necessary to print one sheet
      at 144 (6 per page), he estimated a total of 34 sheets (or 4896 wt) for the entire job, then
      added 600 additional weight of type to reach an estimated font of 5496 weight of type for the
      whole. Allowing a cost of 5 shillings per sheet or per 144 weight of type, Aitken set the cost
      of type alone at 1374 pounds. Although the specifications called for the use of nonpareil
      type, Aitken, feeling that this type would wear out sooner than brevier "being of smaller
      face," maintained that 200,000<ref target="f003.22.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref>
      Bibles could be run off from the latter, and submitted <pb n="003.278"/> a sample sheet of the
      Bible printed in this type. The types, he thought, should be purchased at the foundry of Dr.
      Wilson in Glasgow, for these produced "the best metal and the neatest letter in Europe."
      Aitken made no suggestions, however, as to how the embattled colonies were to obtain this
      superior metal while Glasgow remained loyal to the Crown and while the British fleet
      maintained its blockade.</p>
     <p>As for paper, Aitken based his estimates on a total of 200,000 Bibles and called for 146,000
      reams, 73 reams sufficing to print a thousand. Since the domestic product seemed adequate
      neither in quality nor quantity, he advised that this commodity be imported from Germany or
      France and allowed a cost of 15 shillings per ream or a total cost of 10,950 pounds. (At this
      rate, 20,000 would have cost 1095 pounds.) By way of fixed equipment, he felt 13 presses, one
      of which was to be used for running proofs, would be necessary. These like "penny pies" could
      be obtained for 10 pounds each in Glasgow, but for not less than 42 pounds in Pennsylvania. It
      is significant that he used the lower figure in totalling up his estimates. Chases, 84 of
      which were necessary, were obtainable for 3 pounds each in the colonies but could be had for
      only 15 shillings each in that paradise for impecunious printers, the loyal city of Glasgow. A
      labor force of 6 compositors and 24 printers (2 to a press) could complete the work, Aitken
      felt, in 20 months. Calculating from the price of leather then prevailing, he estimated the
      binding cost per volume at 4 shillings. Arriving at a total cost for the job of 33,281 pounds,
      5 shillings and 4 pence (after allowing for a difference of 66-2/3 in the exchange price of
      all material imported from abroad), Aitken showed that the actual cost per Bible was only 3
      shillings 4 pence apiece.</p>
     <p>Another printer who submitted a bid on the job was Thomas Bradford (1745-1838), son of "the
      patriot printer," William Bradford, and co-publisher with him of the <hi rend="italic"
       >Pennsylvania Journal</hi>.<ref target="f003.22.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> He
      submitted two sets of estimates, one for printing 20,000 Bibles and one for 30,000. For the
      former number, he estimated that 1100 reams of paper would be sufficient, whereas 2000 reams
      would be necessary for an edition of 30,000 copies. Bradford, like the other printers, was
      acutely aware of the paper shortages within the colonies and advised that that commodity be
      imported from either France or Holland, where it was obtainable for 6 to 8 shillings the ream,
      and expressed a preference for the Dutch product. His type estimates, which he based on a
      Bible of 45 sheets, each taking a font of 200, allowed for imperfections and deterioration,
      for he called for a font of 10,000 weight. He estimated that 8 hands could complete the job in
      6 months, and he fixed the expenses of composition at 14 pounds per sheet and press costs at
      20 pounds. Apart from his estimates and possibly looking to his <pb n="003.279"/> own
      interests in the event that the Congress should award him the contract, Bradford recommended
      that no Bibles be imported, once the Congressional edition was completed, for ten to fifteen
      years. He was the only one of the five printers to make this suggestion specifically.</p>
     <p>The founder of the <hi rend="italic">Pennsylvania Packet</hi> and the man who had printed
      the Declaration of Independence, John Dunlap, also entered the competition on July 10, 1777.
      <ref target="f003.22.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> Dunlap estimated that 300 pounds
      of type would be necessary to set one sheet, but pointed out that it would be desirable to
      obtain a total of 8000 weight to set all sheets at once, since the types were so small and
      delicate that they would be worn out "if frequently worked." Paper, which might formerly have
      been purchased from Great Britain at 10 shillings per ream, posed a problem. Dunlap hoped that
      if enough could be imported to begin the job, he would be able to get the remaining stock made
      in Pennsylvania. The cost of paper and type was estimated by him at 4000 pounds sterling, and
      he allowed &dollar;500 for labor. Binding would cost 4 shillings per volume.</p>
     <p>Another printer who submitted estimates on the Congressional Bible was Henry Miller
      (1702-1782), native of Waldeck, Germany, and publisher of the <hi rend="italic">Wochentliche
       Philadelphische Staatsbote</hi>.<ref target="f003.22.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref>
      Allowing a font of 156 weight for each sheet and figuring that 35 sheets would be necessary
      for the work, Miller stipulated a total type weight of 5460, but allowed an additional 1360 to
      allow for errors. He estimated that the type alone would cost 1687 pounds 10 shillings, and
      pointed out that types of good metal and having the proper depth would be sufficient for two
      impressions of 10,000 copies each. While making no estimate of the quantity or cost of paper
      needed, the German felt that it should be made by master workmen in that craft, "which will
      hardly be possible in this Country at this present time." Pointing out that the number of
      printers and compositors would have to be fixed "and their attendance assured" before an
      estimate could be made on the time to finish the job, he guessed that it could not be done in
      much less than a year. As leather was not to be had, he refrained from making any estimate of
      binding costs.</p>
     <p>The last of the Philadelphia group submitting bids was William Sellers (1725?-1804), who had
      served his apprenticeship in London before he set up his shop in Philadelphia in 1764 and who
      with David Hall had published the <hi rend="italic">Pennsylvania Gazette</hi>.<ref
       target="f003.22.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> Sellers figured on a total font of
      6000 weight, which would cost about 1500 pounds sterling. If these were cut "clear and deep,"
      he felt that they would suffice for two impressions of 10,000 copies each, but a third
      impression from the same type could not be expected to be as satisfactory. Calling for
      approximately 1500 reams of paper, he found no satisfactory supply <pb n="003.280"/> existing
      in the United States, and thereby implied the need for importation. As to the time element,
      Sellers thought that two compositors might set the whole in nine months, and that two presses
      could run off 10,000 copies in the same length of time.</p>
     <p>The committee considered these propositions for a little better than two months before it
      reported to the Congress. In that interval, the military developments had been sufficiently
      disastrous to the American cause that all but the most urgent business was delayed. By the
      25th of August, "Blue Billy" Howe's expeditionary force had established a beachhead at the
      Head of Elk in Maryland and was deploying for a strike at Philadelphia itself. By the tenth of
      September, that army had defeated Washington's at the Battle of the Brandywine, and only the
      Schuylkill river stood between the invaders and the capital of the Confederation. In the
      north, the news was not so bad, but it was bad enough. Burgoyne had advanced almost to the
      junction of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers, and though both his right and left wings had been
      defeated, he was still in a position to capture Albany and to seize the Hudson Valley for the
      Crown. Benedict Arnold and Daniel Morgan were to annihilate this threat at the battle of
      Bemis's Heights in late September, but at the time it seemed very likely that Gentleman
      Johnny's reckless stroke would succeed.</p>
     <p>Thus, on the eleventh of September, Mr. Adams, Mr. Roberdeau, and Mr. Smith submitted their
      report on Mr. Allison's petition to a Congress that undoubtedly was more concerned with the
      military situation, particularly the one on its own doorstep. The committee, tacitly
      considering the advice of the Philadelphia printers, but also, it must seem, influenced by the
      nearness of Blue Billy's veterans, reported unfavorably on the project. Noting that "the
      proper types . . . are not to be had in this country" and that "the paper cannot be procured
      but with such difficulties and subject to such casualties as render any dependance on it
      altogether improper," the committee's report dwelt on "the risque of importing them" and on
      the uncertainty of any calculations of expenses "in the present state of affairs." Thus, they
      recommended that no attempt be made to import these materials. Recognizing, however, that "the
      use of the Bible is so universal and its importance so great," they recommended also that the
      Committee of Commerce be ordered to import the 20,000 Bibles from Holland, Scotland "or
      elsewhere." A motion to this effect was approved with all four New England states, New Jersey,
      Pennsylvania, and Georgia supporting the measure, while New York, Delaware, Maryland,
      Virginia, and both Carolinas opposed it. The resolution being read a second time, final action
      was put off until the nineteenth.<ref target="f003.22.11" n="11"><hi rend="super"
       >11</hi></ref></p>
     <pb n="003.281"/>
     <p>Before that date, however, the body was concerned almost exclusively in finding enough
      reenforcements to stop Howe and save Philadelphia. On the eighteenth, the emperilled
      legislators discreetly resolved to adjourn their deliberations to the more restful atmosphere
      of Lancaster. Two days later, General Charles Grey surprised the usually vigilant Anthony
      Wayne in his bivouac at Paoli; Howe slipped across the Schuylkill with his main body; and on
      Friday, the twenty-sixth of September, the British marched into the erstwhile Continental
      capital. The government in exile at Lancaster returned to Philadelphia the following summer,
      but it did not resume the Bible project until 1782. In that year, the Quaker printer, Robert
      Aitken, working under Congressional auspices, produced the first complete Bible printed in
      English in the New World.<ref target="f003.22.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> But by
      then, Philadelphia had been four years restored to American rule, France had recognized the
      independence of the revolted colonies, and Yorktown had been fought and won. The new nation,
      though far from being out of the political or financial woods, no longer had a well-armed
      hostile army on the outskirts of its capital. A printing project, which the exigencies of war
      and invasion had made impractical and relatively unimportant, became attainable within a year
      after Cornwallis' surrender.</p>

    <ref target="f003.23.00" n="*">*</ref><lb/>
     <name type="author">Coolie Verner</name></head>
    <div2 type="subsection">
     <p>The Huth Catalogue<ref target="f003.23.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> in 1880
      described two different states of the 1651 Farrer Map of Virginia, and Col. Lawrence Martin in
       1936<ref target="f003.23.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> further distinguished a
      total of four states. There is, however, a copy of the map in the Huntington Library which was
      pulled from an earlier state of the plate than any previously described. It can be
      distinguished from the earliest of Col. Martin's states by the absence of the words "Fort
      Orang." on the right border above "Septen." There is no other difference.</p>
     <p>It is not often enough emphasized that 17th-and 18th-century map plates had an active life
      expectancy of well over a decade. The Jefferys' plates for the 18th-century Fry &amp;
      Jefferson Map of Virginia were, for example, in use for at least 21 years; moreover, additions
      were made to the plates after Jefferys' death.</p>
     <pb n="003.282"/>
     <p>The Farrer Map has peculiar interest as showing the survival of two related but inaccurate
      geographical beliefs: a northwest passage through the North American land mass; and the close
      proximity of the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. Although in general the Farrer Map is derived
      from the more important and more accurate 1646-7 Dudley Map of Virginia,<ref
       target="f003.23.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> it nevertheless has a significance of
      its own in that it places for the first time on any known map the names of the original
      shires: Henrico City, Charles City, Elizabeth City; and Anandale County, Maryland. For
      historical as well as bibliographical reasons, therefore, it is worth recording with some care
      the additions to the plate, with their probable dates.</p>
     <p>The map was first engraved by John Goddard for Stephenson's 3rd edition, 1651, of Edward
      Williams' <hi rend="italic">Virgo Triumphans</hi>, which announced the addition of the map on
      its titlepage. This 3rd edition is, however, known only by an inserted titlepage in the Huth
      copy of the 2nd edition. Stephenson also apparently added the map to some copies of another of
      his 1651 publications, Edward Bland's <hi rend="italic">The Discovery of New Brittaine</hi>,
      its relevance to which was, however, only approximate, since Bland's explorations were
      southwest of the chief placename locations on the Farrer map. Copies of the two works in
      question have been so long sought for by collectors of Americana and have so often been
      sophisticated by dealers and binders, that it is no longer possible to speak with precision
      about occurrences of the map with either book. It is, however, assumed from available evidence
      that <list>
       <item>1) Copies of the first and second editions of Williams which contain the map are either
        late gathered copies or sophisticated ones.</item>
       <item>2) Any of the first four states of the map (see below) might properly be found with the
        3rd edition of Williams, and the 3rd edition would be incomplete without one of them.</item>
       <item>3) The copies of the Bland with the Farrer map are accidental, or special copies, or
        sophisticated ones.</item>
       <item>4) The plate was obtained by Overton from Stephenson or his successors, and was used by
        him under his own imprint for separately issued (or Atlas bound) copies of the map. The
        assignment of the date 1667? to the final state of the plate is based on indirect evidence
        in Plomer<ref target="f003.23.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> and on the fact that
        after 1668 the Term Catalogues carry notices of Overton's publications with a different
        imprint address.</item>

    <div2 type="subsection">
     <p>The lines entitled "Alone," first published in 1875, twenty-six years after Poe's death,
      have been generally accepted by his editors as an early Poe poem.<ref target="f003.24.01"
       n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> Various details concerning the background of this poem
      and bearing on its attribution to Poe have not previously been known, for the correspondence
      of John Ingram, the English biographer of Poe, seems never to have been examined for the light
      it throws on the poem.<ref target="f003.24.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> In addition
      to discussing the prepublication background of "Alone" and the source from which the poem is
      derived, this paper will present information concerning the manuscript of the poem which only
      recently has been definitely located.</p>
     <p>The poem was first published in <hi rend="italic">Scribner's Magazine</hi> for September,
      1875, with a prefatory note by Eugene L. Didier, who claimed to have found the poem "in the
      album of a lady of distinguished social position."<ref target="f003.24.03" n="3"><hi
        rend="super">3</hi></ref> The poem is reproduced in what Didier calls "fac-simile," but very
      likely it is a reproduction either by wood-cut or zinc-plate; this is different in several
      ways from modern <pb n="003.285"/> facsimile processes since the hand of the engraver
      intervenes between the document and its printed reproduction.<ref target="f003.24.04" n="4"
        ><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref></p>
     <p>Nearly a year before the poem's publication, Didier had offered Ingram on the first of
      October, 1874, a transcript of this poem for &dollar;100, along with other information he had
      been collecting for "five or six years . . . for a correct life of Poe." Concerning "Alone,"
      Didier wrote, "I have in my possession a <hi rend="italic">M. S.</hi> poem of Poe's which has
      never been printed. Poe wrote it in a lady's Album in this city [Baltimore], from which I
      copied it. It is dated March 17, 1829, and signed E. A. Poe. This will be very valuable to
       you."<ref target="f003.24.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> Ingram appears to have been
      interested enough in this writer and the materials he offered to write to a Baltimore friend
      for details about Didier. For, on May 17, 1875, John Parker, an assistant in the Peabody
      Institute Library, wrote Ingram that Didier was "a magazine writer, who had been collecting
      and writing in regard to Poe for some years, but from what I hear of him I do not believe he
      would impart much knowledge."<ref target="f003.24.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> Two
      months later Parker was able to send Ingram a copy of this poem under rather strange
      circumstances: <q>I send you two photographic copies of a poem which bears Poe's name and
       which I have never seen before. I obtained them quite accidentally. A gentleman, who is doing
       some work for our librarian, has invented a new style of photography, and one day about a
       month ago one of his assistants brought up to the library some samples of this new mode of
       photographing manuscripts &amp;c and among these samples was this poem. As soon after this as
       I was able I obtained some copies of it and also made enquiries as to where they had seen
       this poem. All the information I could get was that they had photographed it from the
       autograph album of some <pb n="003.286"/> gentleman whose name they did not remember. They
       also said that the page whereon it was written was very yellow with age and that the writing
       had almost faded away.<ref target="f003.24.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref></q>
      Ingram probably had his doubts of the poem's authenticity and must have asked Parker for
      further details; thus, in December, after the poem had appeared in the September <hi
       rend="italic">Scribner's</hi>, Parker wrote: <q>From the photographer of the poem I learnt
       the following items. Mr. Didier borrowed the album containing the poem from its owner and
       brought it to him to have some copies photographed. He kept several copies for himself, some
       of which I sent you. He says he photographed directly from the album which was a very old
       one. Mr. Didier refused to give me the name of the owner of the album and insisted that it
       was Poe's writing. He was rather indignant when I suggested to him in a note that it might
       possibly be a copy of Poe's writing.<ref target="f003.24.08" n="8"><hi rend="super"
        >8</hi></ref></q></p>
     <p>Later, in an essay on the Virginia Edition of <hi rend="italic">Poe's Works</hi>, Didier
      himself gives us an important piece of information concerning these lines. Again claiming the
      poem to be a genuine one, although Professor Harrison had classed it under "Attributed Poems,"
      Didier declared, <q>I discovered it in the autograph album of Mrs. Balderston, the wife of
       Judge Balderston, formerly Chief Judge of the Orphan's Court in Baltimore. I had it engraved
       and published in <hi rend="italic">Scribner's Monthly</hi>. I gave the poem the name of
       "Alone," and dated it, as it had neither name nor date, but the poem and signature as
       published in the magazine are an exact <hi rend="italic">fac simile</hi> of the writing in
       the album.<ref target="f003.24.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></q> Thus, although
      the poem purported to be in Poe's handwriting, Didier admitted that he added a title and a
      date to the manuscript. The title has been retained by Poe's editors, but the date has been
      suspect. Although Didier had implied to Ingram that the dating of the poem, "Baltimore, March
      17, 1829." was in Poe's hand, actually it was his own handwriting. This fictitious date has
      not been accepted by editors: indeed, the chronology of Poe's life does not allow acceptance.
      After the funeral in Richmond of Mrs. Allen, Poe's foster mother, Poe had returned to Fortress
      Monroe by March 10, 1829, and presumably <pb n="003.287"/> was there until his discharge from
      the army on April 15, 1829. Although it is possible that he could have visited Baltimore
      sometime in that month before his discharge from the army, a letter from Baltimore, May 20,
      1829, seems to indicate that he had but recently arrived.<ref target="f003.24.10" n="10"><hi
        rend="super">10</hi></ref></p>
     <p>The handwriting of the poem as it appears in the reproduction in <hi rend="italic"
       >Scribner's</hi> has sometimes been doubted by Poe's editors and friends. For instance, Mrs.
      Whitman, the "Seeress of Providence," was outraged by "so audacious and so palpable a
      forgery." Nevertheless, she saw that the poem might after all be Poe's: <q>I think that the
        <hi rend="italic">poem</hi> might readily be accepted as genuine. If it had been in Poe's
       writing I should not have questioned it even without signature. . . . Still, the <hi
        rend="italic">poem may</hi> be his, but if so why was it not given in his own
        handwriting.<ref target="f003.24.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref></q></p>
     <p>Although there are many difficulties in determining the authenticity of the handwriting with
      only the reproduction in <hi rend="italic">Scribner's</hi> as a basis, it is now possible to
      examine the original of the poem, which only recently has been definitely located.<ref
       target="f003.24.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> It is written in an early
      nineteenth-century autograph album, 12.5 by 20.5 centimeters, bound in red morocco with gold
      and black stampings; on the spine in the lettering in gilt, "ALBUM." Its pages are numbered in
      script, the odd numbers on the recto, the even on the verso, from 1 to 258. Some of the leaves
      bear the watermark, inverted, with the outline letters "S &amp;A Butler / U S"<ref
       target="f003.24.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> at the fold near the bottom of the
      sheet. The paper, which is of the "wove" type, appears to be fully consistent throughout the
      album.</p>
     <p>There are seventy-six poems in the album, many of them bearing datelines; these dates range
      from August 1, 1826 (p. 15) to October 7, 1848 (p. 99). Many of the poems bear signatures as
      well: one is signed by Lucy Holmes, the original owner of the album; another signature is that
      of I. Balderston, who <pb n="003.288"/> married Miss Holmes. In addition to members of the
      Balderston and Holmes families, several of the other writers can be identified.<ref
       target="f003.24.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref></p>
     <p>The poem that is of the greatest interest in the album is that signed "E. A. Poe" (p. 55).
      It is headed "Original" and bears no date-line. Yet traces of the title "Alone" and the
      date-line which Didier admitted that he added can be seen, for they appear to have been
      carelessly erased from pencilling. The traces left, however, are sufficient to indicate that
      the writing is that of Didier, and that this is the manuscript that he had photographed and
      from which he was working for the <hi rend="italic">Scribner's</hi> publication.</p>
     <p>Of almost equal interest is a poem, p. 51, headed in this way: "by W. H. Poe&mdash;copied at
      his / request by E. A. Poe&mdash;"<ref target="f003.24.15" n="15"><hi rend="super"
       >15</hi></ref> Although there is a slight difference in appearance in the handwriting of this
      poem and Poe's own poem, it is very probable that they were written by the same person.
      Especially the formation of short words like <hi rend="italic">my</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
       >in</hi>, the long pendulums on certain letters, the general cursory nature of the script,
      and the characteristic of crossing the "t" some distance after the letter itself lead me to
      believe they are in the same hand.</p>
     <p>From several pieces of evidence it appears that these are genuine Poe manuscripts. First,
      there are no blank rectos of leaves in the first hundred pages of the album except in one
      instance where a poem is written on the verso following (p. 48). It seems rather improbable,
      then, that two leaves, p. 51 and p. 55, would be left blank (to be utilized by a forger) in
      this rather full first section; the leaving of these rectos blank here would be more than
      chance. The latest poem in the album (p. 99), dated October 7, 1848, may indicate that there
      were no blank rectos suitable for autograph in this first section at that time; otherwise, the
      writer here would have utilized them. His alternative was to turn to the back of the album
      where there are many blank leaves, but he seemed to have wanted his poem as near the first of
      the album as possible, and therefore he may have taken the first blank recto he came to.</p>
     <p>Two other items may be mentioned to authenticate the poems: both pages 51 and 55 are
      conjugate to their gathering, and there is no evidence of any kind of insertion of these two
      leaves. The stitching is plainly evident, and it has not been tampered with. The other item is
      a drawing, p. 258, the last page of the album, of a series of visiting cards bearing the names
      of writers in the album. These are the work of a skilled penman, and the cards are in
      contemporary styles of engraved cards. Among these cards is the name of "E. A. Poe." The ink
      used seems to be of the same age throughout this page, and the addition <pb n="003.289"/> of
      Poe's name at a later date might be indicated by a difference in ink, which is not present.
      There is every indication that this card was drawn with the others.</p>
     <p>But the most conclusive evidence rests on the handwriting, which examination shows to be the
      same in the two poems. It would seem an unnecessary and almost unbelievable forgery to head a
      poem "by W. H. Poe copied . . . by E. A. Poe," since it would clearly be more advantageous for
      a forger to give us another poem by Edgar Poe. But this problem is subordinate to the
      handwriting of the poem "Alone." The signature of Poe on both poems is very similar to those
      of the Poe letters to John Allan in 1829 and 1830, which Mrs. Whitman and Ingram did not know;
      their conclusion that the poem was not in Poe's handwriting was very likely based on the Poe
      script that they knew, which was some years later than the presumed date of this poem. The
      handwriting within the poems, aside from headings and signatures, has been carefully examined
      for me by several specialists. Especially, Mr. Robert W. Hill, Keeper of Manuscripts, The New
      York Public Library, has very generously examined this poem and compared it with Poe letters
      particularly of the years 1829 and 1835. He has written that while this examination has been
      hindered by the necessity of comparing <hi rend="italic">letters</hi> against <hi
       rend="italic">poem</hi>, "nevertheless, there are common characteristics in both: the 'th,'
      the long pendulums of the 'f,' 'g,' and the 'y' and the beginning strokes of the 'm' and 'n.'"
      He summarizes his examination by stating that, "An examination of the photostats which have
      been furnished me and which have been made from the autograph album described in this paper
      leads me to lean toward acceptance of the poem as being in the handwriting of Poe."<ref
       target="f003.24.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref></p>
     <p>Thus this poem which has been long suspect because of the method of first publication and
      the temporary disappearance of this album now seems to be authenticated, and may be accepted
      as a genuine Poe manuscript.</p>
     <p>Poe's editors have generally agreed that, as Killis Campbell describes it, the poem "is
      clearly in Poe's early manner."<ref target="f003.24.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref>
      The tone of the poem is certainly not that of the mature poet, but it contains many
      resemblances to his early work. As Swinburne wrote Ingram, the verses "seemed to me not
      unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them."<ref target="f003.24.18" n="18"><hi
        rend="super">18</hi></ref> Indeed, the lines are particularly infused, as we shall see, with
      a reflection of Byronism that is very common in the early poems. It is likely that Poe had
      "read all of Byron's poems, and that he had read and re-read many of them";<ref
       target="f003.24.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> this early reading obviously <pb
       n="003.290"/> influenced Poe's earliest volumes, and "Alone" shares a kinship with those
      early volumes because of the strong Byronic element common to all of them. While the mere
      presence of a Byronic influence does not guarantee the authenticity of "Alone," it strengthens
      the claim that this is a genuine Poe poem.</p>
     <p>It has not hitherto been pointed out that the first nineteen lines of "Alone" are derived
      from Byron's <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>, II, ii, 50-75, although the last three lines are
      a Po&euml;sque conclusion using only a slight hint from Byron. A comparison of Poe's lines and
      the passage from <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> shows clearly the strong similarity of the
      two.</p>
     <p>Both "Alone" and the speech of Manfred are autobiographical. Both begin with a similar
      phrase, and both put an emphasis on the act of seeing. Manfred declares: <q>
       <l>From my youth upwards,</l>
       <l>My Spirit walked not with the souls of men,</l>
       <l>Nor looked upon the earth with human eyes.</l>
       <l>(ll. 50-52)</l>
      </q> Poe writes: <q>
       <l>From childhood's hour I have not been</l>
       <l>As others were&mdash;I have not seen</l>
       <l>As others saw.</l>
      </q> Both poets continue in the description of their isolation from humanity. In Byron it is, <q>
       <l>The thirst of their ambition was not mine,</l>
       <l>The aim of their existence was not mine;</l>
       <l>My joys&mdash; my griefs&mdash; my passions&mdash; and my powers,</l>
       <l>Made me a stranger; though I wore the form,</l>
       <l>I had no sympathy with breathing flesh.</l>
       <l>(ll. 53-57)</l>
      </q> This difference in the poet's passions from those of the common man is reemphasized in
      Poe: <q>
       <l>I could not bring</l>
       <l>My passions from a common spring&mdash;</l>
       <l>From the same source I have not taken</l>
       <l>My sorrow&mdash; I could not awaken</l>
       <l>My heart to joy at the same tone&mdash;</l>
       <l>And all I lov'd&mdash; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> lov'd alone.</l>
      </q>
      <pb n="003.291"/> This is the same sense of isolation that Byron expresses in <q>
       <l>. . . with men, and with the thoughts of men,</l>
       <l>I held but slight communion.</l>
       <l>(II. 60-61)</l>
      </q>
     </p>
     <p>Byron, for dramatic foreshadowing, mentions the "One" who, as Manfred later explains, has
      been destroyed by heart and not by hand. Poe does not reflect these two lines, but begins a
      description, following Byron, of the mystery which binds him, a Byronic love of nature. The
      elements that the two poets mention are similar, Poe's "red cliff of the mountain," Byron's
      "iced mountain top," Poe's "the torrent, or the fountain," Byron's, <q>
       <l>to plunge</l>
       <l>Into the torrent, and to roll along</l>
       <l>On the swift whirl of the new-breaking wave</l>
       <l>Of river-stream, or Ocean, in their flow.</l>
       <l>(II. 65-68)</l>
      </q> Byron's "the moving moon, / The stars and their development," becomes in in Poe "the sun
      that 'round me roll'd / In its autumn tint of gold." Byron's "the dazzling lightnings" is
      Poe's "the lightning in the sky / As it passed me flying by&mdash;." Byron's "the scattered
      leaves" and "Autumn winds . . . at their evening song" is compressed by Poe to "the thunder
      and the storm."</p>
     <p>Poe's conclusion, <q>
       <l>. . . the cloud that took the form</l>
       <l>(When the rest of Heaven was blue)</l>
       <l>Of a demon in my view,</l>
      </q> is not directly derived from the passage in <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> but was
      perhaps suggested by the Witch of the Alps to whom Manfred had spoken the lines of
      autobiography.</p>
     <p>Here again it appears that Poe was familiar with Byron's writings and did not hesitate to
      rely on them for ideas. It would be interesting to know if Poe composed these lines on the
      spur of the moment for Mrs. Balderston's album. If he did, the performance shows a remarkable
      memory for his reading and an admiration for this particular passage in Byron. But, of course,
      it is possible that he had composed the lines some time before and that he took the
      opportunity of a proffered album to set them down. Although he was probably satisfied in the
      suitability of his paraphrase for a lady's album, he was not proud enough of its to include it
      in his later volume of poems.</p>

       Library. In a private communication, October 21, 1949, he writes that, because of the use of
       the word "fac-simile" by Didier, "we may be sure that photography was employed." Ringwalt's
        <hi rend="italic">American Encyclopedia of Printing</hi> (1871), states that
       "wood-engraving, which, as applied to printing purposes, precedes all others, still holds a
       front rank for popular purposes; and its utility has been immensely increased during the
       present century by the readiness and certainty with which perfect copies of an engraved block
       can be electrotyped, and the rapidity with which impression can be made on machine presses."
       (p. 158). It is also pointed out that "designs can readilv be photographed on wood for the
       use of the engraver" (p. 348) and, furthermore, on the same page, he states that "various
       attempts have been made to produce cuts capable of being printed on typographic presses
       without the aid of an engraver." Later (p. 506) he notes that zinc plates are "specifically
       useful when only small editions are required." As Mr. Silver writes, "we can arrive at the
       conclusion that the manuscript was printed from a plate which may have been made from a
       wood-cut or from a zinc-plate. The consensus of opinion in these parts is that no one person
       can be sure of identifying the method employed." It must be pointed out that, while modern
       facsimiles do not employ a human element, this <hi rend="italic">Scribner's</hi> plate most
       likely had the engraver's hand between the photograph that Didier submitted and the final,
       published plate. Thus handwriting characteristics might be slightly modified, and certain
       irregular formations that might partake of the appearance of forgery could very well be
       incorporated.</p></note>

     invited to send references to books or articles which should appear here. This annual listing
     does not propose to treat the large number of enumerative catalogues which acquaint scholars
     with secondary publications in their field or assist libraries in the performance of their
