                    Y'r letter of<lb/>
                    The 20<hi rend="super">th</hi> inst was recd last night and<lb/>
                    I hasten to reply to-day.  I had been<lb/>
                    anxious to hear from you all for some<lb/>
                    time and would have written, but did<lb/>
                    not know you were at home.  I am very<lb/>
                    sorry to hear of <add place="top" hand="author">(father-in-law R D Simms)</add>
                    Mr. Simms' illness, but<lb/>
                    hope that as the warm weather comes<lb/>
                    one he may improve.  If I could leave<lb/>
                    just now, would come and see him,<lb/>
                    but such is the nature of my work<lb/>
                    that I cant well leave: tho' I think<lb/>
                    I will be forced to do so in less than<lb/>
                    a month's time.  It is pretty currently<lb/>
                    reported that our army will fall<lb/>
                    back from Manassas to <reg orig="Gordon's-|ville">Gordon'sville</reg><lb/>
                    to prevent a flank movement<lb/>
                    of the enemy from Winchester by<lb/>

                    Bank's column.  If that is so, and<lb/>
                    I have right strong reasons to believe<lb/>
                    it, then all this portion of Va. must<lb/>
                    fall into the hands of the enemy, and<lb/>
                    I think I shall fall back too.  In <lb/>
                    reference to my marrying, the time<lb/>
                    was set, the 1<hi rend="super">st</hi> Wednesday morning<lb/>
                    in April: but under the present <reg orig="cir-|cumstances">circumstances</reg><lb/>
                    I reckon it will not take<lb/>
                    place.  I can't say positively, as I<lb/>
                    have not recd a letter for some ten or<lb/>
                    twelve days.  In the last written, she<lb/>
                    stated, that she expected that they<lb/>
                    would be overrun by the enemy, but<lb/>
                    that she would be faithful &amp;C.  We<lb/>
                    intended to marry and start right off,<lb/>
                    having no wedding at all.  If we<lb/>
                    had determined to have a wedding,<lb/>
                    I should have wanted you and Jimmie<lb/>
                    to wait on me.  I reckon under<lb/>
                    the present prospects, will be better <lb/>
                    to wait now until the <reg orig="dark-|-clouds">dark<add place="top" hand="author">-clouds</add></reg><lb/>

                    pass away; and then it may <unclear>[-]</unclear><lb/>
                    be.  I sometimes feel like it would be<lb/>
                    best for me to remain single, tho' I<lb/>
                    know I should be happier, suitably<lb/>
                    married.  I see very clearly that we <lb/>
                    are to have very trying times before<lb/>
                    we gain our independence, and it is<lb/>
                    possible that the whole of Va. may be<lb/>
                    overrun before that event.  I expect<lb/>
                    to go to Loudoun next week, as I<lb/>
                    have an appointment very near the line<lb/>
                    and presume the matter will be decided<lb/>
                    about the marriage.  I shall not insist<lb/>
                    I believe at all, as I don't know that<lb/>
                    it will be best.  I am sorry to hear<lb/>
                    that y'r health is precarious, hope<lb/>
                    that it may improve as we have better<lb/>
                    weather.  I hae been very much <reg orig="an-|noyed">annoyed</reg><lb/>
                    noyed with Diarrhoer for a month:<lb/>
                    have been enabled to check it for a<lb/>
                    little while, and then taking <reg orig="fresh-cold">fresh<add place="bottom" hand="author">-cold</add></reg><lb/>
                    
                    <pb entity="DSSR_000002755_0030" n="[page 4]"/>
                    it would break out again.  I feel<lb/>
                    better today as it is now under a<lb/>
                    check.  I had supposed, until I<lb/>
                    recd y'r letter that Wesley was a<lb/>
                    prisoner, but could hear nothing<lb/>
                    from home about it at all.  I hope<lb/>
                    that you are correct about it.  I<lb/>
                    hear this morning that there is<lb/>
                    some expectation of a fight at<lb/>
                    Manassas, but know not how<lb/>
                    much truth there is in it.  The <lb/>
                    sick are being removed from this<lb/>
                    place and being sent to <reg orig="Charlottes-|ville">Charlottesville,</reg><lb/>
                    so that some thing seems to<lb/>
                    be on hand &mdash; The times are very<lb/>
                    squally. And I shall have to keep<lb/>
                    a look out.  If the roads get in<lb/>
                    order very soon, and I can leave<lb/>
                    I think I'll ride over to River Hill<lb/>
                    about the 5<hi rend="super">th</hi> Sunday in Ma'h, tho'<lb/>
                    every thing is uncertain.  I hope Mr<lb/>
                    Simms is enable to repose his faith<lb/>
                    in Christ, as his Savior, and rest<lb/>
