                    comply with the Act and the University's policy on Conflict of Interests (the
                    "Policy"). This delegation shall be effective until revoked by the Board. The
                    University Comptroller shall revise the Policy as necessary to incorporate (i)
                    this delegation of authority to the President and (ii) the requirements imposed

                    <p>Chapters 995 and 933 of the 1996 Virginia Acts of Assembly (House Bill No.
                        884 and Senate Bill No. 389, respectively) provide that, subject to certain
                        conditions established in subsection 2 of § 23-77.4 of the legislation,
                        operating leases entered into by the University of Virginia on behalf of the
                        University of Virginia Medical Center shall be exempt from § 2.2-1149 of the
                        Code of Virginia and from any rules, regulations and guidelines of the
                        Commonwealth's Division of Engineering and Buildings in relation to leases
                        of real property from others. Contracts entered into by the University on
                        behalf of the Medical Center are also exempted from § § 2.2-1155 and 23-4.1
                        of the Code of Virginia in relation to leases of Medical Center real or
                        personal property to others. Exercise of this autonomy in entering into
                        operating leases is to be in compliance with policies, procedures and
                        guidelines adopted by the Board of Visitors which are to direct that
                        competition be sought to the maximum practical degree, that all costs of
                        occupancy are to be considered, and that the use of the space to be leased
                        is necessary and is efficiently planned. Subsection C of § 4-5.08 of the
                        1996-98 Appropriation Act delegates to the University as a whole the
                        authority granted the Governor and the Commonwealth's Department of General
                        Services ("DGS") in § 2.2- 1149 of the Code of Virginia regarding operating
                        leases for the University other than the Medical Center. This latter
                        delegation supplants the supervisory role of DGS which is established
                        pursuant to § 2.2-1149, the provisions of which have been implemented by
                        policies, procedures and guidelines promulgated by DGS pursuant to this
                        section of the Code of Virginia. This authority has since been continued
                        through 2002- 04 by subsequent legislative action. This latter delegation of
                        authority is subject to certain conditions, the foremost of which is that
                        the Board of Visitors must develop and submit policies, procedures and

                        personal property to others and 2) capital leases to the University as a
                        whole provided that such capital leases have been specifically authorized by
                        the Governor <pb n="2"/> or the General Assembly pursuant to the
                        Appropriation Act and have been reviewed and approved by the Treasury Board. </p>

                        <p>The decision to enter into a lease shall be based upon cost, demonstrated

                            actually is necessary and is efficiently planned. Leases shall also

                        <p> The enabling legislation requires that all leases entered into by the

                            of law except those from which such leases have been exempted. The
