        		<p>
            I sit down<lb/>
            to write you a few lines to let<lb/>
            you know that I am well and<lb/>
            away down south in dixie. The last<lb/>
            time I wrote we had just returned<lb/>
            from Centreville to Fairfax Court<lb/>
            house.  well we stayed there 3 or 4<lb/>
            days then marched to within 2 miles<lb/>
            of Alexandria through a heavy rain<lb/>
            and we all got wet through to the <lb/>
            skin and it was cold and windy and<lb/>
            it rain,d all night and we had to<lb/>
            lay on the ground and it come pretty<lb/>
            tough but we come out in the morning<lb/>
            all right and being used to such<lb/>
            scrapes we did not take cold and all<lb/>
            felt as happy as kings.  We went on to<lb/>
            Alexandria last friday afternoon and <lb/>
            went aboard the steamer Georgia and<lb/>
            started down the river the next morning   
            
        		<pb entity="DSSR_000002759_0018" n="[page 2]"/>
            
            there was 35 vessels in all.  we went<lb/>
            as far as the mouth of the Potomac<lb/>
            that night and cast anchor and stayed<lb/>
            all night then went on to Fortress<lb/>
            Monroe about 200 miles from Alexandria<lb/>
            we had a splendid time of it.  the<lb/>
            weather was warm and clear.  we passed<lb/>
            all the rebel batteries along the Potomac<lb/>
            but they were all deserted.  there was<lb/>
            some splendid forts and fortifications<lb/>
            along the river that the rebels boasted<lb/>
            of their efficiency to blocade the river<lb/>
            but the rebels had left on suspicion.<lb/>
            Before we got to Fortress Monroe we<lb/>
            got out of sight of land which was<lb/>
            something new for me.  we arrived in<lb/>
            port about 4 oclock sunday afternoon<lb/>
            and landed the next morning and<lb/>
            marched out to Hampton village about<lb/>
            3 miles.  the rebels evacuated the place<lb/>
            last fall and burnt the village so that<lb/>
            there is not a house left.  we stayed<lb/>
            there that night and started for
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002759_0019" n="[page 3]"/>
        			
            Big Bethel the next morning about 11<lb/>
            or 12 miles distant but before we got<lb/>
            half way there our scouts came in and<lb/>
            brought the news that the rebels had<lb/>
            evacuated the place as usual.  we then<lb/>
            halted and encamped in the woods where<lb/>
            we are yet.  we heard last night last<lb/>
            night that Norfolk <del hand="author" rend="line-through">had</del> was being<lb/>
            evacuated and that is a great stronghold<lb/>
            of the rebels.  it is a little up the James<lb/>
            river and on the opposite side from<lb/>
            Fortress Monroe.  it seems that the rebels<lb/>
            retreats as soon as they hear of the<lb/>
            Potomac army coming.  there is 40 or 50,000<lb/>
            of the Potomac army here now and they<lb/>
            keep a coming all the time and you<lb/>
            can depend upon it we are going to drive<lb/>
            everything before us.  I think we will<lb/>
            be in Richmond in less that 2 weeks<lb/>
            Our western armies are doing well<lb/>
            there has not been a battle lost in<lb/>
            over 3 months and that aint all we<lb/>
            don't calculate to lose any neither.

            The Galway boys are all well.  the<lb/>
            weather is very fine and we are all<lb/>
            enjoying ourselves well.

            Well I must close for this time
