            <p>
            Glad to get your 
            good letter this noon along
            with prints.  Sorry the
            one of Kiffin and you
            didn’t come out.  Next
            time you’re up we’ll
            do better.  Would you
            mind ordering ten prints 
            for me of my picture
            and  four <del hand="author" rend="line-through">three</del> of yours &amp;
            one of machine up side
            down. <unclear>[?]</unclear>  Have em [sic] send bill
            to me and let me know
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001108_0195" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            how much I owe you now.
            </p><p>
            There’s no doubt about
            Skipper being sent to us.
            Expect him any day now that
            he’s at R. G. R.
            </p><p>
            Interesting dope about the
            young V. S. Aers. in Aviation.
            The French ought to stop
            letting them in.  Lovell at 
            Buc is a fine chap, tho [sic].
            </p><p>
            I’m on guard to day and
            so am not flying.  Just
            letting flies in tent bother
            me.  De Laage and Kiffin
            have just gone out to
            act as guard for Prince
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001108_0194" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            who loaded down with 
            sky rockets is off after
            a Boche observation sausage.

            Page, editor of World’s
            Work wanted article on
            American Aviators so he wrote
            Eyre and suggested getting
            me to do it.  Eyre just 
            wants dope and experience
            stuff and says he’ll write
            it.  I felt sort of hurt 
            that Page didn’t write
            direct.  Told Eyre I wouldn’t 
            have it run under my 
            name unless I wrote it but
            he tells me its got to
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001108_0196" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            appear in personal, and
            unless I wanted to conform 
            to turn over job to Prince 
            Johnson or Cowden.  Well I
            need the 75 bones [sic] and
            so I’ll conform.
            </p><p>
            My little deal with
            the Sun has proved 
            lucrative but don’t tell
            old Grundy.  He might
            cut down on rates.  Hope
            to get enough to see me
            through on permission.
            </p><p>
            I’ll write Marcelle about
            not sending her address.  She’s
            at Hotel Ermitage, Evian les
            Baines, Hte. Savoie.

            The girl of shattered life
            has written to me but
            once since I left after
            my 48 hr. stay.  I am losing
            interest in the girls I 
            know, anyway, for some
            unknown reason.
            </p><p>
            You are sure right
            Paul about the boys in
            trenches not getting what
            they deserve.  They are fighting
            the whole war and bearing
            all the misery.  Every
            damn one of them ought
            to be made happy for life
            after the fights over.
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001108_0199" n="[p.6]"/>
            
            Sorry to hear the Legion
            caught it so badly.  I
            had been under the impression
            that our losses were slight.
            </p><p>
            Hall got another Boche.
            Great work eh [sic]!  Rumsey
            and Hill made sergeants
            and Prince adjudant [sic].
            Hill is good, and a nervy
            pilot.  I hope he smears
            several Boches &mdash; but
            God in Boston its a 
            hard job.
            </p><p>
            Balsley being moved 
            to Paris.  Arrives Thurs.
            or Fri. morning.

            Out of 11 machines in
            escadrille only four are
            in commission at present
            moment from various causes.
            We’ll all be ready tho [sic]
            tomorrow.  Prince damn
            near ran into me on landing
            and made a swerve with
            result he tipped over.  Lufbery
            had a terrible smash.  We
            thought him dead but he
            hadn’t a scratch.  Sick now
            from gasoline he swallowed.
            </p><p>
            Lieut. Chaput terribly
            wounded yesterday, but
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001108_0200" n="[p.8]"/>
            
            managed to get back.
            </p><p>
            Wrote a line or so on
            what American aviators thought
            of going back.  Made it hot.
            See Americans are going to be
            advised to leave Turkey instead
            of government sticking up for
            them.  Can you beat it?
            </p><p>
            Keep me posted, old
            top and keep your
            spirits up.  Don’t let the
            capard get you.
