            Well, well, and I found this in
            old Harper’s Weekly, a copy of which
            was sent out to us here.  I
            read La Vie Parisienne, Le Rire, etc.,
            and it does my heart good to see that
            American papers are taking somewhat 
            after the French, as testified to by
            the clipping.  I am really socked beyond
            measure.  The measure being so minute, you see.  
            </p><p>
            Ned Salisbury, our Chef de Section
            left yesterday for Paris to remain eight
            days.  I hope you meet him while he’s
            down there.  He’s an awfully fine chap.
            He has by the way stumbled into a most
            wonderful affaire d’amour.  If you remind me
            I’ll tell you about the interesting tale when
            I see you in September.  Has Eleanora <unclear>Glyum [sp?]</unclear>
            beaten forty ways from Sunday.  Some chaps
            are fearfully lucky, or unlucky, it
            has to be figured in terms of the
            long run.
            </p><p>
            I’m happy to day.  Ambulance No. 3 is
            fine.  This morning the wounded were
            brought out to me newly bandaged, a
            sheet on the stretcher and everything
            done in good shape.  Even the
            poor blesses seemed happy.
            </p><p>
            Yesterday.   # #  At this juncture I had to stop
            to make a long evacuation.  I’ve forgotten
            what I was going to say after the word yesterday.

            Oh, yes, I remember we came in for
            another warm time of it, and to day
            it has just stopped, having started
            at the noon hour.  Luck still with
            us.  From hits I think they were
            trying to get us.
            </p><p>
            Just heard from Paul.  He seems to
            think you’re a peach.  Can’t say as I
            dispute his taste.  I’m waiting to hear
            his plans before setting the date for
            my permission.  He’s to pass before a
            committee on August 6th and after that
            will do some planning.  If you have
            anything on foot aside from working
            along as you’re doing please let me know
            as I want to make my schedule accordingly.
            Paul says you’re working too hard and
            should take a rest.  I wish you would.
            You might go all to pieces.  It isn’t right
            that you should overtax yourself.  You
            have had no rest for nearly six months.
            If everyone worked the way you do we would
            have licked the Boches long ago.
            </p><p>
            Do keep well and let me know how
            you’re feeling.
            </p>
