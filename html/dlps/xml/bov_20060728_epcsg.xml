                <head>EDUCATIONAL POLICY COMMITTEE <lb/>
                STRATEGIC GOALS 2006-2007</head>
              
                    <p>
                        1. Develop a Strategic Plan to Enhance Graduate Education: Graduate 
                        education is a critical factor in the health and standing of the 
                        University. Graduate students play an important role as faculty and 
                        mentors to undergraduates. Moreover, the caliber and areas of study 
                        of graduate students can determine the current and future academic 
                        quality and reputation of the University. The Committee will 
                        develop a strategic plan to enhance graduate education through 
                        financial investment, strategic focus on critical academic areas, 
                        and improving University policies and programs. </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Update and Enhance the Technology Transfer Program: The 
                        Universitys technology transfer program is a small operation that 
                        is conducted through the Patent Foundation and Spinner 
                        Technologies. The basic framework for the program is a 1977 
                        agreement between the University and the Patent Foundation. The 
                        University needs a robust technology transfer program in order to 
                        (i) realize its research ambitions, (ii) leverage its expertise in 
                        areas such as the life sciences, and (iii) generate unrestricted 
                        revenue. The Committee will develop a strategic plan that will be 
                        based upon (i) a review of best practices of successful technology 
                        transfer programs, (ii) priorities aligned with or synergistic with 
                        the Universitys research expertise and strengths, and (iii) an 
                        appropriate business model. </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Educational Policy Committee Operating Charter: The Educational 
                        Policy Committee currently operates in an ad hoc fashion with 
                        recurring administrative responsibilities such as approving new 
                        degree programs and faculty salaries. There is a need to establish 
                        an operating charter for the Committee to ensure that the 
                        Committees operations maintain substantive continuity and are 
                        functionally aligned with setting academic policy as the University 
                        enters a period of growth and a highly competitive environment in 
                        higher education. The Committee will look at the best practices of 
                        peer and model institutions as well as industry experts and 
                        accreditation requirements.</p>
