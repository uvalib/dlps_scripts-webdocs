            <p>
            My dear little girl you actually did
            contemplate coming up or out here to
            help.  I wrote you as I did merely to
            find out if you would be willing.  Do 
            you think I’d let you even if the
            French would?  Of course not.  Why if they 
            allowed women here to nurse I never would
            have told you about it.  At the start
            there were three hospitals but now they
            have been closed. ^No.1 was closed the night they were shelled.  (They served only as a
            secondary poste de secours)  There is
            a small place left where we take only
            terrible cases and then only at night
            and I understand the men there have
            been cite for the risk they run.  I am
            awfully glad you were willing too [sic] serve,
            tho [sic] I felt all along you would.  I
            had to laugh where you said it would
            be different if your father and mother
            could live near you for that is
            about as hard to accomplish as the
            march to Berlin.  Why ^even the owner of
            the charming house where the chief
            and I have moved to isn’t allowed
            to come back for some important papers
            he left behind when he ran away.  Tant
            mieux for Salisbury and I have a most
            gorgeous suite, with a marvellous [sic]
            bath room, and a great estate on which 
            our windows look out.  The garden is
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0108" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            ravishing.  It is an exquisite ensemble
            of flowering shrubs and trees, little 
            lily covered, iris bordered lakes, and
            here and there are rough stone foundations
            whose tinkling waters tumble in glittering
            cascades between riots of vividly colored
            flowers and dense walls of variegated
            verdure.  When Salisbury and I are
            lounging in our sumptuously furnished
            Louis Quinze rooms I am reminded
            strongly of the pictures one sees of generals
            in 1870 besporting themselves in the
            splendor of a commandeered chateau.
            In addition we have an excellent
            trench exposure and can watch rifle
            firing at night.
            </p><p>
            Do tell me how one gets to your 
            new apartment with the Etoile as a 
            starting point.  You know I may be
            able to get a leave when Paul is
            married to attend the function and
            even if I’m there but for thirty six
            hours I want to see you.  Want to
            see you!  If you knew how very much
            I really do want to be with you
            again.
            </p><p>
            The Boche tried to get us the other
            day  but only managed to carry away the
            upper right hand corner of the caserne and
            block the street.  As a result, however, we
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0109" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            have had to park our cars in widely
            separated places.  Its an order of
            the Medecine Devisionaire (Thought that
            on the <unclear>sbatuer [sp?]</unclear> you told me Medecine
            didn’t mean doctor) who fears lest an
            obus will clean up our stock of
            cars at one fell swoop.  We’ve quite
            an imposing section now with twenty field
            ambulances and a large Hotchkiss.  We
            are also to have the Pierce - Arrow
            in a few days as it proved
            impractical on the bad roads around
            Dunkirk.  You remember that sporty
            looking ambulance that was around Paris
            for awhile don’t you?  It will look
            sort of out of place out here for awhile anyway.
            </p><p>
            I’ve made up my mind 
            that the average French officer is the
            finest sort of fellow in the world
            and I’m enchanted when with them.
            </p><p>
            By the way did I write you
            about the sensations I had when I was
            twenty five yards from a marmite ^when it hit and
            was fortunate enough to go thru [sic] the
            mess that followed without being hurt.
            I’ve forgotten if I wrote you about it.  I
            do not care to have any others explode
            that close.  Two were killed twenty yards
            from me.  One instantly, the other died
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0110" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            shortly afterwards.
            </p><p>
            We’re having glorious weather
            here now and my gardens never were
            prettier.  Seems such a pity  to let
            them go to waste.  The only trouble
            is the amount of flies.  They are
            everywhere, and as I write I
            have to keep slapping them away.
            I suppose its because of the unsanitary
            conditions a few hundred yards from
            us.
            </p><p>
            I want you to know how dearly
            I appreciate and how deeply grateful
            I am to you for writing.  It is
            awfully nice of you and I hope you’ll
            keep it up.
            </p><p>
            Please give my best regards to
            your mother and father.
            </p>
