                    Mecca as school has been closed for haying. She comments on a punishment Charlie
                    received and on several of the Union generals, and closes by telling Charlie
                    that the friendliness of a certain Mr. Richardson is repulsive to her. </p>

                    a darling letter came for me, and I<lb/> must be contented with that. But
                    you<lb/> will wish to know where I am and<lb/> why I am here, I am in Colebrook.
                    Ohio<lb/> on my way home. Would you believe<lb/> that <hi rend="underline">I</hi>
                    could get turned out of<lb/> school? Well I have a vacation for<lb/> three
                    weeks. during haying and the<lb/> district wished me to close school<lb/> during
                    the haying season, Mr Marlow<lb/> and lady (Mr. Leslie's son-in-law) was<lb/>
                    over the 4<hi rend="super">th</hi> and he (Mr Marlow)<lb/> volunteered to carry
                    Dora and I to<lb/> Mecca, what could we do but close<lb/> school. I did not wish
                    to have<lb/> a vacation as it will be so late<lb/>
                    <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0168"/> in the fall before my school
                    closes<lb/> but found it necessary.</p>
                <p>What a dear kind letter yours of<lb/> the 21<hi rend="super">st</hi> was. it did
                    me &ldquo;lots of good&rdquo;<lb/> I see that you are still going
                    south<lb/> farther, If you could only come north<lb/> west. a few hundred miles.
                    I should<lb/> be much better <unclear>indeed</unclear></p>
                <p>The punishment which you <sic corr="received">recieved</sic><lb/> from Gen. Tyler
                    did not seem to<lb/> affect you very much. I should have<lb/>
                        been <unclear>afraid</unclear> <add place="inline" hand="h1">to have
                    asked</add> if you had not <sic corr="received">recieved</sic><lb/> permission to
                    walk on the railroad<lb/> before punishing you, If he had<lb/> ordered you to be

                    will be done with Gen. Shields<lb/> The people here are losing all

                    <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0169"/> I was delighted with the <sic

                        >distruction</sic> with them<lb/> yet there is also a charm that we<lb/> can
                    not resist. What is more grand<lb/> and terrific than a thunder storm,<lb/> I do
                    so love them. I always feel better<lb/> after viewing a storm that caused<lb/>
                    such wild commotion in the heavens<lb/> It speaks in such strong language<lb/>
                    of the majestic power of God.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Dearest Charlie, I know not what<lb/> prompted me to ask that question<lb/>
                    <sic corr="referred">refered</sic> to in your last; <orig reg="unless"
                        >unle&longs;s</orig> it<lb/> was that irresistable longing to be<lb/>
                    ever near you. forgive me dearest for<lb/> expressing the thought for I did
                    wrong,<lb/> I can not as yet: no I <hi rend="underline">can not</hi> yet
                    become<lb/> yours, I know darling that you share<lb/> the tortures of this
                    absence with me<lb/> and that it is very very hard for<lb/>
                    <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0170"/> for you to remain so long in the<lb/>

                <p>I know that I have not <sic corr="received">recieved</sic> your<lb/> Photograph
                    yet. but I anticipated the<lb/> reason why. I have seen Mr Richardson<lb/>
                    several times since the &ldquo;Mile Society&rdquo; but<lb/> I never <orig

                    &ldquo;friendship&rdquo; more than by a slight bow,<lb/> Indeed I can
                    not do other wise. there is to me<lb/> some thing so repulsive about him. Among
                    the<lb/> Clar'ndon people he is termed a perfect<lb/> &ldquo;lady
                    killer&rdquo;(pardon the expression I write at just as it was given
                    me).<lb/> Dora will write you and give you some thing<lb/> to laugh over. half
                    an hour if she does not<lb/> put on her <unclear>&ldquo;sobr
