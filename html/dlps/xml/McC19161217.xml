            <salute>Dear, old Paul:</salute>

            <p>
            I cannot begin
            to tell you with what
            surprise and delight I
            received the gem of a 
            cigarette case to day.  To
            possess such a handsome
            thing is a joy in itself,
            but when it comes as
            a keepsake from you,
            and as a souvenir of
            your wedding, it gives
            it a value which, as far
            
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            as I am concerned, nothing
            can surpass.  I shall
            treasure it all my
            life and think of you,
            my best friend, when&mdash;
            ever I use it.  Really
            Paul I have never been
            quite so overwhelmed,
            and I thank you with
            all my heart.
            </p><p>
            I was glad to hear
            from “Skipper” some of 
            the details of your
            present life and to learn
            that you are very happy.
            </p><p>
            	
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            I’m afraid I shall
            not be able to go
            to Paris before you
            leave for the South,
            but I’m hoping good 
            luck will bring us
            together before many
            moons.
            </p><p>
            The weather has been
            so bad that we have 
            done no flying.  A lot
            of the pilots in this
            camp have fallen ill,
            
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            among them being Lieut.
            de Laage who is in a 
            bad fix.
            </p><p>
            If  Mrs. Weeks sailed
            before you had a chance
            to give her the copy I
            sent you, please send it
            back to me.  Am working
            ahead bit by bit and
            hope to finish soon.  After 
            that I’ll be better about
            writing.
            </p>
