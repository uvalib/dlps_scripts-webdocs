                        no matter. That book was made<lb/> by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the<lb/>
                        truth, mainly. There was things<lb/> which he stretched, but mainly he<lb/>
                        told the truth. That is nothing. I<lb/> never seen anybody but lied, one

                    <p>Now the way that the book winds<lb/> up, is this: Tom and me found the money
                        that the robbers hid in the cave,<lb/> and it made us rich. We got six
                        thousand dollars apiece&#x2014;all gold. It was an<lb/> awful sight of
                        money when it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher, he took it<lb/> and put it
                        out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece, all the year<lb/>
                        round&#x2014;more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow
                        Douglas, she<lb/> took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me;
                        but it was rough living<lb/> in the house all the time, considering how
                        dismal regular and decent the widow<lb/> was in all her ways; and so when I
                        couldn't stand it no longer, I lit out. I got<lb/> into my old rags, and my
                        sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But<lb/>
                        <pb n="18" entity="u000002472_0033"/> Tom Sawyer, he hunted me up and said
                        he was going to start a band of robbers,<lb/> and I might join if I would go
                        back to the widow and be respectable. So I went<lb/> back.</p>
                    <p>The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she
                        called<lb/> me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.
                        She put me<lb/> in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but
                        sweat and sweat, and<lb/> feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing
                        commenced again. The widow<lb/> rung a bell for supper, and you had to come
                        to time. When you got to the table<lb/> you couldn't go right to <reg
                            orig="eat-|ing">eating</reg>,<lb/> but you had to wait for<lb/> the
                        widow to tuck down her<lb/> head and grumble a little<lb/> over the
                        victuals, though<lb/> there warn't really anything<lb/> the matter with
                        them. That<lb/> is, nothing only everything<lb/> was cooked by itself. In
                        a<lb/> barrel of odds and ends it is<lb/> different; things get mixed<lb/>
                        up, and the juice kind of<lb/> swaps around, and the things<lb/> go
                        better.</p>

                    <p>After supper she got out<lb/> her book and learned me<lb/> about Moses and

                        more about him; because I don't take no stock in dead<lb/> people.</p>
                    <p>Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she<lb/>
                        wouldn't. She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must<lb/>
                        try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They<lb/>
                        <pb n="19" entity="u000002472_0034"/> get down on a thing when they don't
                        know nothing about it. Here she<lb/> was a bothering about Moses, which was

                        gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing<lb/> a thing

                        all right, because she done it herself.</p>
                    <p>Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had<lb/>
                        just come to live with her, and took<lb/> a set at me now, with a
                        spelling-book.<lb/> She worked me middling hard for about<lb/> an hour, and
                        then the widow made her<lb/> ease up. I couldn't stood it much longer.<lb/>
                        Then for an hour it was deadly dull,<lb/> and I was fidgety. Miss Watson
                        would<lb/> say, "Dont put your feet up there,<lb/> Huckleberry;" and "dont
                        scrunch up<lb/> like that, Huckleberry&#x2014;set up straight;"<lb/> and
                        pretty soon she would say, "Don't<lb/> gap and stretch like that,
                        Huckleberry&#x2014;<lb/> why don't you try to behave?" Then<lb/> she
                        told me all about the bad place,<lb/> and I said I wished I was there.
                        She<lb/> got mad, then, but I didn't mean no<lb/> harm. All I wanted was to
                        go <reg orig="some-|wheres">somewheres</reg>;<lb/> all I wanted was a
                        change, I<lb/> warn't particular. She said it was<lb/> wicked to say what I
                        said; said she<lb/> wouldn't say it for the whole world; <hi rend="italic"
                            >she</hi> was going to live so as to go to<lb/> the good place. Well, I
                        couldn't see no advantage in going where she<lb/> was going, so I made up my
                        mind I wouldn't try for it. But I never said<lb/> so, because it would only
                        make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the<lb/> good
                        place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around<lb/> all
                        day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn't think<lb/>
                        <pb n="20" entity="u000002472_0035"/> much of it. But I never said so. I
                        asked her if she reckoned Tom<lb/> Sawyer would go there, and, she said, not
                        by a considerable sight. I was<lb/> glad about that, because I wanted him
                        and me to be together.</p>
                    <p>Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.<lb/>
                        By-and-by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then
                        everybody<lb/> was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle
                        and put<lb/> it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and
                        tried to<lb/> think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use. I felt so
                        lonesome I<lb/> most wished I was dead. The stars was shining, and the
                        leaves rustled in<lb/> the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away
                        off, who-whooing<lb/> about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a
                        dog crying about<lb/> somebody that was going to die; and the wind was
                        trying to whisper <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg><lb/> to me and I
                        couldn't make out what it was, and so it made the cold<lb/> shivers run over
                        me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a<lb/> sound that a
                        ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that's on its<lb/> mind
                        and can't make itself understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave<lb/>
                        and has to go about that way every night grieving. I got so
                        down-hearted<lb/> and scared, I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a
                        spider went<lb/> crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in
                        the candle; and<lb/> before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn't
                        need anybody to tell<lb/> me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch
                        me some bad luck, so<lb/> I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me.
                        I got up and turned<lb/> around in my tracks three times and crossed my
                        breast every time; and<lb/> then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a
                        thread to keep witches<lb/> away. But I hadn't no confidence. You do that
                        when you've lost a<lb/> horse-shoe that you've found, instead of nailing it
                        up over the door, but I<lb/> hadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way to
                        keep off bad luck when<lb/> you'd killed a spider.</p>
                    <p>I set down again, a shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;<lb/>
                        for the house was all as still as death, now, and so the widow wouldn't<lb/>
                        know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town<lb/> go
                        boom&#x2014;boom&#x2014;boom&#x2014;twelve licks&#x2014;and
                        all still again&#x2014;stiller than<lb/> ever. Pretty soon I heard a
                        twig snap, down in the dark amongst the<lb/>
                        <pb n="21" entity="u000002472_0036"/> trees&#x2014;something was a
                        stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I could<lb/> just barely hear a
                            <hi rend="italic">"me-yow! me-yow!"</hi> down there. That was good! Says I,<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">"me-yow! me-yow!"</hi> as soft as I could, and then I put
                        out the light and<lb/> scrambled out of the window onto the shed. Then I
                        slipped down to<lb/> the ground and crawled in amongst the trees, and sure
                        enough there was<lb/> Tom Sawyer waiting for me.</p>

                        </hi> went tip-toeing along a path amongst<lb/> the trees back towards the

                        wouldn't scrape our heads.<lb/> When we was passing by the kitchen<lb/> I
                        fell over a root and made a noise.<lb/> We scrouched down and laid
                        still.<lb/> Miss Watson's big nigger, named<lb/> Jim, was setting in the

                        light behind him. He<lb/> got up and stretched his neck out<lb/> about a

                    <p>He listened some more; then he<lb/> come tip-toeing down and stood<lb/> right
                        between us; we could a touched<lb/> him, nearly. Well, likely it was <reg
                            orig="min-|utes">minutes</reg><lb/> and minutes that there warn't a<lb/>
                        sound, and we all there so close<lb/> together. There was a place on my<lb/>
                        ankle that got to itching; but I<lb/> dasn't scratch it; and then my ear
                        begun to itch; and next my back, right <reg orig="be-|tween"
                        >between</reg><lb/> my shoulders. Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch.
                        Well, I've<lb/> noticed that thing plenty of times since. If you are with
                        the quality, or at a<lb/> funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't
                        sleepy&#x2014;if you are anywheres<lb/>
                        <pb n="23" entity="u000002472_0038"/> where it won't do for you to scratch,
                        why you will itch all over in upwards of a<lb/> thousand places. Pretty soon
                        Jim says:</p>
                    <p>"Say&#x2014;who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf'n.
                        Well,<lb/> I knows what I's gwyne to do. I's gwyne to set down here and
                        listen tell I hears<lb/> it agin."</p>
                    <p>So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up<lb/>
                        against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one
                        of<lb/> mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into my
                        eyes. But<lb/> I dasn't scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I
                        got to itching<lb/> underneath. I didn't know how I was going to set still.
                        This miserableness<lb/> went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it
                        seemed a sight longer than that.<lb/> I was itching in eleven different
                        places now. I reckoned I couldn't stand it<lb/> more'n a minute longer, but
                        I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then<lb/> Jim begun to
                        breathe heavy; next he begun to snore&#x2014;and then I was pretty
                        soon<lb/> comfortable again.</p>
                    <p>Tom he made a sign to me&#x2014;kind of a little noise with his
                        mouth&#x2014;and we went<lb/> creeping away on our hands and knees. When
                        we was ten foot off, Tom <reg orig="whis-|pered">whispered</reg><lb/> to me
                        and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun; but I said no; he might<lb/> wake
                        and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I warn't in. Then Tom<lb/>
                        said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and
                        get<lb/> some more. I didn't want him to try. I said Jim might wake up and
                        come.<lb/> But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three
                        candles, and Tom<lb/> laid five cents on the table for pay. Then we got out,
                        and I was in a sweat to<lb/> get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must
                        crawl to where Jim was, on<lb/> his hands and knees, and play something on
                        him. I waited, and it seemed a good<lb/> while, everything was so still and
                        lonesome.</p>
                    <p>As soon as Tom was back, we cut along the path, around the garden fence,<lb/>
                        and by-and-by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the
                        house.<lb/> Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it on a
                        limb right over<lb/> him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake.
                        Afterwards Jim said the<lb/> witches bewitched him and put him in a trance,
                        and rode him all over the State,<lb/> and then set him under the trees again
                        and hung his hat on a limb to show who<lb/> done it. And next time Jim told
                        it he said they rode him down to New Orleans:<lb/>
                        <pb n="24" entity="u000002472_0039"/> and after that, every time he told it
                        he spread it more and more, till by-and-by<lb/> he said they rode him all
                        over the world, and tired him most to death, and his<lb/> back was all over
                        saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he<lb/>
                        wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come miles to hear
                        Jim<lb/> tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that
                        country.<lb/> Strange niggers would stand with their mouths<lb/> open and
                        look him all over, same as if he was<lb/> a wonder. Niggers is always
                        talking about<lb/> witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but<lb/>
                        whenever one was talking and letting on to<lb/> know all about such things,
                        Jim would happen<lb/> in and say, "Hm! What you know 'bout<lb/> witches?"
                        and that nigger was corked up and<lb/> had to take a back seat. Jim always
                        kept that<lb/> five-center piece around his neck with a string<lb/> and said
                        it was a charm the devil give to him<lb/> with his own hands and told him he
                        could cure<lb/> anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he<lb/> wanted
                        to, just by saying something to it; but<lb/> he never told what it was he
                        said to it. Niggers<lb/> would come from all around there and give Jim<lb/>
                        anything they had, just for a sight of that <reg orig="five-|center"
                            >fivecenter</reg><lb/> piece; but they wouldn't touch it, <reg
                            orig="be-|cause">because</reg><lb/> the devil had had his hands on it.
                        Jim<lb/> was most ruined, for a servant, because he got<lb/> so stuck up on
                        account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.</p>

                    <p>Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hill-top, we looked away<lb/>
                        down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where
                        there<lb/> was sick folks, may be; and the stars over us was sparkling ever
                        so fine; and<lb/> down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and
                        awful still and grand.<lb/> We went down the hill and found Jo Harper, and
                        Ben Rogers, and two or three<lb/> more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.
                        So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down<lb/> the river two mile and a half,
                        to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.</p>
                    <pb n="25" entity="u000002472_0040"/>
                    <p>We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the<lb/>
                        secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part
                        of<lb/> the bushes. Then we lit the candles and crawled in on our hands and
                        knees.<lb/> We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up.
                        Tom poked<lb/> about amongst the passages and pretty soon ducked under a
                        wall where you<lb/> wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole. We went along
                        a narrow place and<lb/> got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and
                        cold, and there we stopped.<lb/> Tom says:</p>
                    <figure id="f9" rend="inline" entity="u000002472_0040">
                        <head>

                    </figure>
                    <p>"Now we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.<lb/>
                        Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name
                        in<lb/> blood."</p>
                    <p>Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote<lb/>
                        the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the band, and
                        never<lb/> tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy
                        in the band,<lb/> whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his
                        family must do it, and he<lb/> mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he had
                        killed them and hacked a cross in<lb/>
                        <pb n="26" entity="u000002472_0041"/> their breasts, which was the sign of
                        the band. And nobody that didn't belong<lb/> to the band could use that
                        mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done<lb/> it again he must be
                        killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the<lb/> secrets, he
                        must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and<lb/> the
                        ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with
                        blood<lb/> and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it
                        and be forgot,<lb/> forever.</p>
                    <p>Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it
                        out<lb/> of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of
                        pirate books, and<lb/> robber books, and every gang that was high-toned had
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Some thought it would be good to kill the <hi rend="italic">families</hi> of
                        boys that told the<lb/> secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a
                        pencil and wrote it in. Then<lb/> Ben Rogers says:</p>
                    <p>"Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family&#x2014;what you going to do
                        'bout<lb/> him?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, hain't he got a father?" says Tom Sawyer.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him, these days. He
                        used<lb/> to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen
                        in these<lb/> parts for a year or more."</p>
                    <p>They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they
                        said<lb/> every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it
                        wouldn't be fair<lb/> and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of
                        anything to <reg orig="do&#x2014;every-|body"
                            >do&#x2014;everybody</reg><lb/> was stumped, and set still. I was
                        most ready to cry; but all at once I<lb/> thought of a way, and so I offered
                        them Miss Watson&#x2014;they could kill her.<lb/> Everybody said:</p>
                    <p>"Oh, she'll do, she'll do. That's all right. Huck can come in."</p>
                    <p>Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and
                        I<lb/> made my mark on the paper.</p>
                    <p>"Now," says Ben Rogers, "what's the line of business of this Gang?"</p>
                    <p>"Nothing only robbery and murder," Tom said.</p>
                    <p>"But who are we going to rob? houses&#x2014;or
                        cattle&#x2014;or&#x2014;"</p>
                    <p>"Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery, it's burglary,"
                        says<lb/> Tom Sawyer. "We ain't burglars. That ain't no sort of style. We
                        are <reg orig="high-|waymen">highwaymen</reg>.<lb/>
                        <pb n="27" entity="u000002472_0042"/> We stop stages and carriages on the
                        road, with masks on, and kill<lb/> the people and take their watches and
                        money."</p>
                    <p>"Must we always kill the people?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, certainly. It's best. Some authorities think different, but mostly
                        it's<lb/> considered best to kill them. Except some that you bring to the
                        cave here and<lb/> keep them till they're ransomed."</p>
                    <p>"Ransomed? What's that?"</p>
                    <p>"I don't know. But that's what they do. I've seen it in books; and so of<lb/>
                        course that's what we've got to do."</p>
                    <p>"But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?"</p>
                    <p>"Why blame it all, we've <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to do it. Don't I tell
                        you it's in the books?<lb/> Do you want to go to doing different from what's
                        in the books, and get things<lb/> all muddled up?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, that's all very fine to <hi rend="italic">say,</hi> Tom Sawyer, but how
                        in the nation are these<lb/> fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know
                        how to do it to them? that's<lb/> the thing <hi rend="italic">I</hi> want to
                        get at. Now what do you <hi rend="italic">reckon</hi> it is?"</p>
                    <p>"Well I don't know. But per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed,<lb/>
                        it means that we keep them till they're dead."</p>
                    <p>"Now, that's something <hi rend="italic">like.</hi> That'll answer. Why
                        couldn't you said that<lb/> before? We'll keep them till they're ransomed to
                        death&#x2014;and a bothersome lot<lb/> they'll be, too, eating up
                        everything and always trying to get loose."</p>
                    <p>"How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there's a guard<lb/>
                        over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?"</p>
                    <p>"A guard. Well, that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> good. So somebody's got to set
                        up all night and<lb/> never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think
                        that's foolishness. Why<lb/> can't a body take a club and ransom them as
                        soon as they get here?"</p>
                    <p>"Because it ain't in the books so&#x2014;that's why. Now Ben Rogers, do
                        you<lb/> want to do things regular, or don't you?&#x2014;that's the
                        idea. Don't you reckon<lb/> that the people that made the books knows what's
                        the correct thing to do?<lb/> Do you reckon <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can
                        learn 'em anything? Not by a good deal. No, sir,<lb/> we'll just go on and
                        ransom them in the regular way."</p>
                    <p>"All right. I don't mind; but I say it's a fool way, anyhow.
                        Say&#x2014;do we<lb/> kill the women, too?"</p>
                    <pb n="28" entity="u000002472_0043"/>
                    <p>"Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn't let on. Kill
                        the<lb/> women? No&#x2014;nobody ever saw anything in the books like
                        that. You fetch<lb/> them to the cave, and you're always as polite as pie to
                        them; and by-and-by they<lb/> fall in love with you and never want to go
                        home any more."</p>
                    <p>"Well, if that's the way, I'm agreed, but I don't take no stock in it.
                        Mighty<lb/> soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows
                        waiting to be<lb/> ransomed, that there won't be no place for the robbers.
                        But go ahead, I ain't<lb/> got nothing to say."</p>
                    <p>Little Tommy Barnes was asleep, now, and when they waked him up he was<lb/>
                        scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn't
                        want<lb/> to be a robber any more.</p>
                    <p>So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him<lb/>
                        mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. But Tom
                        give<lb/> him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and
                        meet next<lb/> week and rob somebody and kill some people.</p>
                    <p>Ben Rogers said he couldn't get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted<lb/>
                        to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it
                        on<lb/> Sunday, and that settled the thing. They agreed to get together and
                        fix a day as<lb/> soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first
                        captain and Jo<lb/> Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started
                        home.</p>
                    <p>I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was
                        breaking.<lb/> My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was
                        dog-tired.</p>

                        </hi> I got a good going-over in the morning,<lb/> from old Miss Watson, on
                        account of my<lb/> clothes; but the widow she didn't scold, but<lb/> only
                        cleaned off the grease and clay and<lb/> looked so sorry that I thought I

                        Watson<lb/> she took me in the closet and prayed, but<lb/> nothing come of
                        it. She told me to pray<lb/> every day, and whatever I asked for I
                        would<lb/> get it. But it warn't so. I tried it. Once<lb/> I got a
                        fish-line, but no hooks. It warn't<lb/> any good to me without hooks. I
                        tried for<lb/> the hooks three or four times, but somehow<lb/> I couldn't
                        make it work. By-and-by, one<lb/> day, I asked Miss Watson to try for me,
                        but<lb/> she said I was a fool. She never told me<lb/> why, and I couldn't
                        make it out no way.</p>

                    <p>I set down, one time, back in the woods, and had a long think about it.
                        I<lb/> says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don't
                        Deacon<lb/> Winn get back the money he lost on pork? Why can't the widow get
                        back<lb/> her silver snuff-box that was stole? Why can't Miss Watson fat up?
                        No, says<lb/> I to myself, there ain't nothing in it. I went and told the
                        widow about it,<lb/> and she said the thing a body could get by praying for
                        it was "spiritual gifts."<lb/> This was too many for me, but she told me
                        what she meant&#x2014;I must help<lb/> other people, and do everything I
                        could for other people, and look out for them<lb/> all the time, and never
                        think about myself. This was including Miss Watson,<lb/>
                        <pb n="30" entity="u000002472_0045"/> as I took it. I went out in the woods
                        and turned it over in my mind a long<lb/> time, but I couldn't see no
                        advantage about it&#x2014;except for the other people&#x2014;<lb/>
                        so at last I reckoned I wouldn't worry about it any more, but just let it
                        go.<lb/> Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about
                        Providence in a way<lb/> to make a body's mouth water; but maybe next day
                        Miss Watson would take<lb/> hold and knock it all down again. I judged I
                        could see that there was two<lb/> Providences, and a poor chap would stand
                        considerable show with the widow's<lb/> Providence, but if Miss Watson's got
                        him there warn't no help for him any more.<lb/> I thought it all out, and
                        reckoned I would belong to the widow's, if he wanted<lb/> me, though I
                        couldn't make out how he was agoing to be any better off then<lb/> than what
                        he was before, seeing I was so ignorant and so kind of low-down<lb/> and
                        ornery.</p>
                    <p>Pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable
                        for<lb/> me; I didn't want to see him no more. He used to always whale me
                        when he<lb/> was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take
                        to the woods<lb/> most of the time when he was around. Well, about this time
                        he was found in<lb/> the river drowned, about twelve mile above town, so
                        people said. They judged<lb/> it was him, anyway; said this drowned man was
                        just his size, and was ragged,<lb/> and had uncommon long
                        hair&#x2014;which was all like pap&#x2014;but they couldn't
                        make<lb/> nothing out of the face, because it had been in the water so long
                        it warn't much<lb/> like a face at all. They said he was floating on his
                        back in the water. They<lb/> took him and buried him on the bank. But I
                        warn't comfortable long, because<lb/> I happened to think of something. I
                        knowed mighty well that a drownded man<lb/> don't float on his back, but on
                        his face. So I knowed, then, that this warn't<lb/> pap, but a woman dressed
                        up in a man's clothes. So I was uncomfortable again.<lb/> I judged the old
                        man would turn up again by-and-by, though I wished he<lb/> wouldn't.</p>
                    <p>We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned.<lb/> All
                        the boys did. We hadn't robbed nobody, we hadn't killed any people,<lb/> but
                        only just pretended. We used to hop out of the woods and go <reg
                            orig="charg-|ing">charging</reg><lb/> down on hog-drovers and women in
                        carts taking garden stuff to market,<lb/> but we never hived any of them.
                        Tom Sawyer called the hogs "ingots,"<lb/> and he called the turnips and
                        stuff "julery" and we would go to the cave<lb/>
                        <pb n="31" entity="u000002472_0046"/> and pow-wow over what we had done and
                        how many people we had killed<lb/> and marked. But I couldn't see no profit
                        in it. One time Tom sent a boy<lb/> to run about town with a blazing stick,
                        which he called a slogan &lpar;which<lb/> was the sign for the Gang to
                        get together&rpar;, and then he said he had got<lb/> secret news by his
                        spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish<lb/> merchants and rich A-rabs
                        was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two<lb/> hundred elephants, and six
                        hundred camels, and over a thousand "sumter"<lb/> mules, all loaded down
                        with di'monds, and they didn't have only a guard of<lb/> four hundred
                        soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it,<lb/> and kill
                        the lot and scoop the things. He said we must slick up our<lb/> swords and
                        guns, and get<lb/> ready. He never could go<lb/> after even a turnip-cart
                        but<lb/> he must have the swords and<lb/> guns all scoured up for it;<lb/>
                        though they was only lath and<lb/> broom-sticks, and you might<lb/> scour at
                        them till you rotted<lb/> and then they warn't worth a<lb/> mouthful of
                        ashes more than<lb/> what they was before. I didn't<lb/> believe we could
                        lick such a<lb/> crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs,<lb/> but I wanted to see the
                        camels<lb/> and elephants, so I was on hand<lb/> next day, Saturday, in
                        the<lb/> ambuscade; and when we got<lb/> the word, we rushed out of<lb/> the
                        woods and down the hill.<lb/> But there warn't no Spaniards<lb/> and A-rabs,
                        and there warn't no<lb/> camels nor no elephants. It<lb/> warn't anything
                        but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at</p>

                    <p>that. We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we<lb/>
                        never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got<lb/> a
                        rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the<lb/>
                        teacher charged in and made us drop everything and cut. I didn't see no<lb/>
                        di'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. He said there was loads of them<lb/>
                        there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants<lb/>
                        and things. I said, why couldn't we see them, then? He said if I warn't<lb/>
                        so ignorant, but had read a book called "Don Quixote," I would know<lb/>
                        without asking. He said it was all done by enchantment. He said there<lb/>
                        was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on,
                        but<lb/> we had enemies which he called magicians, and they had turned the
                        whole<lb/> thing into an infant Sunday school, just out of spite. I said,
                        all right,<lb/> then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians. Tom
                        Sawyer said<lb/> I was a numskull.</p>
                    <p>"Why," says he, "a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they<lb/>
                        would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson. They<lb/>
                        are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church."</p>

                        They don't<lb/> think nothing of pulling a shot tower up by the roots, and

                    <p>"Who makes them tear around so?"</p>
                    <p>"Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. They belong to whoever<lb/> rubs the

                    <p>"Well," says I, "I think they are a pack of flatheads for not keeping<lb/>

                        would see if there was anything in it. I got an old tin lamp and an

                        like<lb/> an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn't
                        no use,<lb/> none of the genies come. So then I judged that all that stuff

                    <p>At first I hated the school, but by<lb/> and-by I got so I could stand

                        went to<lb/> school the easier it got to be. I was<lb/> getting sort of used
                        to the widow's<lb/> ways, too, and they warn't so raspy<lb/> on me. Living
                        in a house, and <reg orig="sleep-|ing">sleeping</reg><lb/> in a bed, pulled
                        on me pretty tight, mostly, but before the cold weather I<lb/> used to slide
                        out and sleep in the woods, sometimes, and so that was a rest to me.<lb/> I
                        liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the new ones, too, a
                        little bit.<lb/> The widow said I was coming along slow but sure, and doing
                        very satisfactory. She<lb/> said she warn't ashamed of me.</p>

                    <p>One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. I
                        reached<lb/> for some of it as quick as I could, to throw over my left
                        shoulder and keep off<lb/> the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me,
                        and crossed me off. She says,<lb/> "Take your hands away,
                        Huckleberry&#x2014;what a mess you are always making." The<lb/> widow
                        put in a good word for me, but that warn't going to keep off the bad
                        luck,<lb/> I knowed that well enough. I started out, after breakfast,
                        feeling worried and<lb/> shaky, and wondering where it was going to fall on
                        me, and what it was going<lb/> to be. There is ways to keep off some kinds
                        of bad luck, but this wasn't one of<lb/> them kind; so I never tried to do
                        anything, but just poked along low-spirited and<lb/> on the watch-out.</p>
                    <p>I went down the front garden and clumb over the stile, where you go
                        through<lb/> the high board fence. There was an inch of new snow on the
                        ground, and I seen<lb/> somebody's tracks. They had come up from the quarry
                        and stood around the<lb/> stile a while, and then went on around the garden
                        fence. It was funny they hadn't<lb/> come in, after standing around so. I
                        couldn't make it out. It was very curious,<lb/> somehow. I was going to
                        follow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks<lb/> first. I didn't
                        notice anything at first, but next I did. There was a cross in the<lb/> left
                        boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.</p>
                    <p>I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. I looked over my
                        shoulder<lb/> every now and then, but I didn't see nobody. I was at Judge
                        Thatcher's as quick<lb/> as I could get there. He said:</p>
                    <p>"Why, my boy, you are all out of breath. Did you come for your interest?"</p>
                    <p>"No sir," I says; "is there some for me?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in, last night. Over a hundred and fifty
                        dollars.<lb/> Quite a fortune for you. You better let me invest it along
                        with your six <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg>,<lb/> because if you
                        take it you'll spend it."</p>
                    <p>"No sir," I says, "I don't want to spend it. I don't want it at
                        all&#x2014;nor the<lb/> six thousand, nuther. I want you to take it; I
                        want to give it to you&#x2014;the six<lb/> thousand and all."</p>
                    <p>He looked surprised. He couldn't seem to make it out. He says:</p>
                    <p>"Why, what can you mean, my boy?"</p>
                    <p>I says, "Don't you ask me no questions about it, please. You'll take<lb/>
                        it&#x2014;won't you?"</p>
                    <pb n="36" entity="u000002472_0051"/>
                    <p>He says:</p>
                    <p>"Well I'm puzzled. Is something the matter ?"</p>
                    <p>"Please take it," says I, "and don't ask me nothing&#x2014;then I won't
                        have<lb/> to tell no lies."</p>
                    <p>He studied a while, and<lb/> then he says:</p>
                    <p>"Oho-o. I think I see.<lb/> You want to <hi rend="italic">sell</hi> all
                        your<lb/> property to me&#x2014;not give it.<lb/> That's the correct
                        idea."</p>
                    <p>Then he wrote something<lb/> on a paper and read it over,<lb/> and says:</p>
                    <p>"There&#x2014;you see it says<lb/> 'for a consideration.' That<lb/> means
                        I have bought it of<lb/> you and paid you for it.<lb/> Here's a dollar for

                    <p>Miss Watson's nigger,<lb/> Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which
                        had been took out of the<lb/> fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do
                        magic with it. He said there<lb/> was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed
                        everything. So I went to him that night<lb/> and told him pap was here
                        again, for I found his tracks in the snow. What<lb/> I wanted to know, was,
                        what he was going to do, and was he going to stay? Jim got<lb/> out his
                        hair-ball, and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped
                        it<lb/> on the floor. It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch.
                        Jim tried it<lb/> again, and then another time, and it acted just the same.
                        Jim got down on his<lb/> knees and put his ear against it and listened. But
                        it warn't no use; he said it<lb/> wouldn't talk. He said sometimes it
                        wouldn't talk without money. I told him I<lb/>
                        <pb n="37" entity="u000002472_0052"/> had an old slick counterfeit quarter
                        that warn't no good because the brass showed<lb/> through the silver a
                        little, and it wouldn't pass nohow, even if the brass didn't<lb/> show,
                        because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every
                        time.<lb/> &lpar;I reckoned I wouldn't say nothing about the dollar I
                        got from the judge.&rpar; I<lb/> I said it was pretty bad money, but
                        maybe the hair-ball would take it, because<lb/> maybe it wouldn't know the
                        difference. Jim smelt it, and bit it, and rubbed it,<lb/> and said he would
                        manage so the hair-ball would think it was good. He said he<lb/> would split
                        open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it<lb/>
                        there all night, and next morning you couldn't see no brass, and it wouldn't
                        feel<lb/> greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a minute,
                        let alone a<lb/> hair-ball. Well, I knowed a potato would do that, before,
                        but I had forgot it.</p>
                    <p>Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball and got down and listened again.<lb/>
                        This time he said the<lb/> hair-ball was all right.<lb/> He said it would
                        tell<lb/> my whole fortune if I<lb/> wanted it to. I says,<lb/> go on. So
                        the hair-ball<lb/> talked to Jim, and Jim<lb/> told it to me. He says:</p>

                    <p>I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the<lb/>

                        with<lb/> his hand and knocked it across the house. He says:</p>
                    <p>"It's so. You can do it. I had my doubts when you told me. Now looky<lb/>
                        here; you stop that putting on frills. I won't have it. I'll lay for you,

                    <p>He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he

                        When he<lb/> had got out on the shed, he put his head in again, and cussed
                        me for putting<lb/> on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I
                        reckoned he was gone, he<lb/> come back and put his head in again, and told
                        me to mind about that school,<lb/> because he was going to lay for me and
                        lick me if I didn't drop that.</p>
                    <p>Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher's and bullyragged<lb/>
                        him and tried to make him give up the money, but he couldn't, and then
                        he<lb/> swore he'd make the law force him.</p>
                    <p>The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away
                        from<lb/> him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge
                        that had just<lb/> come, and he didn't know the old man; so he said courts
                        mustn't interfere and<lb/> separate families if they could help it; said
                        he'd druther not take a child away<lb/> from its father. So Judge Thatcher
                        and the widow had to quit on the<lb/> business.</p>
                    <p>That pleased the old man till he couldn't rest. He said he'd cowhide me
                        till<lb/> I was black and blue if I didn't raise some money for him. I
                        borrowed three<lb/> dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got
                        drunk and went a-blowing<lb/> around and cussing and whooping and carrying
                        on; and he kept it up all<lb/> over town, with a tin pan, till most
                        midnight; then they jailed him, and<lb/> next day they had him before court,
                        and jailed him again for a week. But he<lb/> said <hi rend="italic">he</hi>
                        was satisfied; said he was boss of his son, and he'd make it warm for<lb/>

                    <p>When he got out the new judge said he was agoing to make a man of him.<lb/>
                        So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and
                        had<lb/> him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was
                        just old pie to<lb/> him, so to speak. And after supper he talked to him
                        about temperance and such<lb/> things till the old man cried, and said he'd
                        been a fool, and fooled away his life;<lb/> but now he was agoing to turn
                        over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be<lb/> ashamed of, and he
                        hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him.<lb/> The judge said
                        he could hug him for them words; so <hi rend="italic">he</hi> cried, and his
                        wife she<lb/> cried again; pap said he'd been a man that had always been
                        misunderstood before,<lb/> and the judge said he believed it. The old man
                        said that what a man wanted<lb/>
                        <pb n="43" entity="u000002472_0058"/> that was down, was sympathy; and the
                        judge said it was so; so they cried<lb/> again. And when it was bedtime, the
                        old man rose up and held out his<lb/> hand, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Look at it gentlemen, and ladies all; take ahold of it; shake it.
                        There's<lb/> a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain't so no more;
                        it's the hand<lb/> of a man that's started in on a new life, and 'll die
                        before he'll go back. You<lb/> mark them words&#x2014;don't forget I
                        said them. It's a clean hand now; shake<lb/> it&#x2014;don't be
                        afeard."</p>

                        pledge&#x2014;made his mark. The<lb/> judge said it was the holiest time
                        on record, or something like that. Then<lb/> they tucked the old man into a
                        beautiful room, which was the spare room, and<lb/> in the night sometime he
                        got powerful thirsty and clumb out onto the porch-roof<lb/> and slid down a

                    <p>It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking
                        and<lb/> fishing, and no books nor study. Two months or more run along, and
                        my<lb/> clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn't see how I'd ever
                        got to like it so well<lb/> at the widow's, where you had to wash, and eat
                        on a plate, and comb up, and go to<lb/> bed and get up regular, and be
                        forever bothering over a book and have old Miss<lb/> Watson pecking at you
                        all the time. I didn't want to go back no more. I had<lb/> stopped cussing,
                        because the widow didn't like it; but now I took to it again <reg
                            orig="be-|cause">because</reg><lb/>
                        <pb n="47" entity="u000002472_0062"/> pap hadn't no objections. It was
                        pretty good times up in the woods there,<lb/> take it all around.</p>
                    <p>But by-and-by pap got too handy with his hick'ry, and I couldn't stand it. I
                        was<lb/> all over welts. He got to going away so much, too, and locking me
                        in. Once he<lb/> locked me in and was gone three days. It was dreadful
                        lonesome. I judged he<lb/> had got drowned and I wasn't ever going to get
                        out any more. I was scared. I<lb/> made up my mind I would fix up some way
                        to leave there. I had tried to<lb/> get out of that cabin many a time, but I
                        couldn't find no way. There warn't a<lb/> window to it big enought for a dog
                        to get through. I couldn't get up the chimbly,<lb/> it was too narrow. The
                        door was thick solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty careful<lb/> not to leave a
                        knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had<lb/> hunted
                        the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was 'most all the
                        time<lb/> at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time. But
                        this time I found<lb/> something at last; I found an old rusty wood-saw
                        without any handle; it was<lb/> laid in between a rafter and the clapboards
                        of the roof. I greased it up and went<lb/> to work. There was an old
                        horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end<lb/> of the cabin
                        behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks<lb/> and
                        putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the blanket
                        and<lb/> went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out, big enough
                        to let me<lb/> through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting
                        towards the end of it<lb/> when I heard pap's gun in the woods. I got rid of
                        the signs of my work, and<lb/> dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and
                        pretty soon pap come in.</p>
                    <p>Pap warn't in a good humor&#x2014;so he was his natural self. He said he
                        was down<lb/> to town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he
                        reckoned he<lb/> would win his lawsuit and get the money, if they ever got
                        started on the trial;<lb/> but then there was ways to put it off a long
                        time, and Judge Thatcher knowed<lb/> how to do it. And he said people
                        allowed there'd be another trial to get me away<lb/> from him and give me to
                        the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would<lb/> win, this time.
                        This shook me up considerable, because I didn't want to go back to<lb/> the
                        widow's any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it.
                        Then<lb/> the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he
                        could think of,<lb/> and then cussed them all over again to make sure he
                        hadn't skipped any, and<lb/> after that he polished off with a kind of a
                        general cuss all round, including a <reg orig="con-|siderable"
                            >considerable</reg><lb/>
                        <pb n="48" entity="u000002472_0063"/> parcel of people which he didn't know
                        the names of, and so called them<lb/> what's-his-name, when he got to them,
                        and went right along with his cussing.</p>
                    <p>He said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would watch<lb/>
                        out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a
                        place<lb/> six or seven mile off, to stow me in, where they might hunt till
                        they dropped<lb/> and they couldn't find me. That made me pretty uneasy
                        again, but only for<lb/> a minute; I reckoned I wouldn't stay on hand till
                        he got that chance.</p>
                    <p>The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had<lb/> got.
                        There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,<lb/>
                        ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two<lb/>
                        newspapers for wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went<lb/>
                        back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all
                        over,<lb/> and I reckoned I would walk<lb/> off with the gun and some<lb/>
                        lines, and take to the woods<lb/> when I run away. I guessed<lb/> I wouldn't
                        stay in one place,<lb/> but just tramp right across the<lb/> country, mostly
                        night times,<lb/> and hunt and fish to keep alive,<lb/> and so get so far
                        away that<lb/> the old man nor the widow<lb/> couldn't ever find me any
                        more.<lb/> I judged I would saw out and<lb/> leave that night if pap
                        got<lb/> drunk enough, and I reckoned<lb/> he would. I got so full of
                        it<lb/> I didn't notice how long I<lb/> was staying, till the old man<lb/>
                        hollered and asked me whether<lb/> I was asleep or drownded.</p>

                    <p>I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark.<lb/> While
                        I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort<lb/>
                        <pb n="49" entity="u000002472_0064"/> of warmed up, and went to ripping
                        again. He had been drunk over in<lb/> town, and laid in the gutter all
                        night, and he was a sight to look at.<lb/> A body would a thought he was
                        Adam, he was just all mud. Whenever<lb/> his liquor begun to work, he most
                        always went for the govment. This<lb/> time he says:</p>
                    <p>"Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it's like.<lb/>
                        Here's the law a-standing ready to take a man's son away from
                        him&#x2014;a<lb/> man's own son, which he has had all the trouble and
                        all the anxiety and<lb/> ail the expense of raising. Yes, just as that man
                        has got that son raised<lb/> at last, and ready to go to work and begin to
                        do suthin' for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> and give<lb/> him a rest, the law
                        up and goes for him. And they call <hi rend="italic">that</hi> govment!<lb/>
                        That ain't all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and<lb/>
                        helps him to keep me out o' my property. Here's what the law does.<lb/> The
                        law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and upards, and jams him<lb/>
                        into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round in clothes<lb/>
                        that ain't fitten for a hog. They call that govment! A man can't get<lb/>
                        his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes I've a mighty notion to<lb/>
                        just leave the country for good and all. Yes, and I <hi rend="italic"
                            >told</hi> 'em so; I told old<lb/> Thatcher so to his face. Lots of 'em
                        heard me, and can tell what I said.<lb/> Says I, for two cents I'd leave the
                        blamed country and never come anear<lb/> it agin. Them's the very words. I
                        says, look at my hat&#x2014;if you call<lb/> it a hat&#x2014;but the
                        lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it's below<lb/> my chin, and
                        then it ain't rightly a hat at all, but more like my head<lb/> was shoved up
                        through a jint o' stove-pipe. Look at it, says I&#x2014;such a<lb/> hat
                        for me to wear&#x2014;one of the wealthiest men in this town, if I could
                        git<lb/> my rights.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here.<lb/> There
                        was a free nigger there, from Ohio; a mulatter, most as white as<lb/> a
                        white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the<lb/>
                        shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine
                        clothes<lb/> as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a
                        silver-headed<lb/> cane&#x2014;the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the
                        State. And what do you<lb/> think? they said he was a p'fessor in a college,
                        and could talk all kinds<lb/>
                        <pb n="50" entity="u000002472_0065"/> of languages, and knowed everything.
                        And that ain't the wust. They said<lb/> he could <hi rend="italic"
                            >vote,</hi> when he was at home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I,<lb/>
                        what is the country a-coming to? It was 'lection day, and I was just
                        about<lb/> to go and vote, myself, if I warn't too drunk to get there; but
                        when<lb/> they told me there was a State in this country where they'd let
                        that<lb/> nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I'll never vote agin. Them's the
                        very<lb/> words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all
                        me&#x2014;<lb/> I'll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see the
                        cool way of that<lb/> nigger&#x2014;why, he wouldn't a give me the road
                        if I hadn't shoved him out<lb/> o' the way. I says to the people, why ain't
                        this nigger put up at auction<lb/> and sold?&#x2014;that's what I want
                        to know. And what do you reckon they<lb/> said? Why, they said he couldn't
                        be sold till he'd been in the State six<lb/> months, and he hadn't been
                        there that long yet. There, now&#x2014;that's a<lb/> specimen. They call
                        that a govment that can't sell a free nigger till he's<lb/> been in the
                        State six months. Here's a govment that calls itself a govment,<lb/> and
                        lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet's got<lb/> to
                        set stock-still for six whole months before it can take ahold of a
                        prowling,<lb/> thieving, infernal, white-shirted free nigger,
                        and&#x2014;&#x2014;"</p>
                    <p>Pap was agoing on so, he never noticed where his old limber legs was<lb/>
                        taking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork,
                        and<lb/> barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest
                        kind of<lb/> language&#x2014;mostly hove at the nigger and the govment,
                        though he give the<lb/> tub some, too, all along, here and there. He hopped
                        around the cabin<lb/> considerable, first on one leg and then on the other,
                        holding first one shin<lb/> and then the other one, and at last he let out
                        with his left foot all of a<lb/> sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick.
                        But it warn't good judgment,<lb/> because that was the boot that had a
                        couple of his toes leaking out of the<lb/> front end of it; so now he raised
                        a howl that fairly made a body's hair<lb/> raise, and down he went in the
                        dirt, and rolled there, and held his toes;<lb/> and the cussing he done then
                        laid over anything he had ever done previous.<lb/> He said so his own self,
                        afterwards. He had heard old Sowberry Hagan<lb/> in his best days, and he
                        said it laid over him, too; but I reckon that was<lb/> sort of piling it on,
                        maybe.</p>
                    <pb n="51" entity="u000002472_0066"/>
                    <p>After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for<lb/>
                        two drunks and one delirium<lb/> tremens. That was always<lb/> his word. I
                        judged he would<lb/> be blind drunk in about an<lb/> hour, and then I would
                        steal<lb/> the key, or saw myself out,<lb/> one or 'tother. He drank,
                        and<lb/> drank, and tumbled down on<lb/> his blankets, by-and-by; but<lb/>
                        luck didn't run my way. He<lb/> didn't go sound asleep, but<lb/> was uneasy.
                        He groaned, and<lb/> moaned, and thrashed around<lb/> this way and that, for
                        a long<lb/> time. At last I got so sleepy<lb/> I couldn't keep my eyes
                        open,<lb/> all I could do, and so before<lb/> I knowed what I was about<lb/>
                        I was sound asleep, and the<lb/> candle burning.</p>

                        around every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was <reg

                        give a jump and scream, and say one<lb/> had bit him on the

                        and round the cabin, hollering "take him off! take him off!<lb/> he's biting
                        me on the neck!" I never see a man look so wild in the eyes.<lb/> Pretty
                        soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled<lb/> over
                        and over, wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and striking<lb/>
                        and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming, and saying there
                        was<lb/> devils ahold of him. He wore out, by-and-by, and laid still a
                        while,<lb/> moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound. I could hear<lb/>
                        <pb n="52" entity="u000002472_0067"/> the owls and the wolves, away off in
                        the woods, and it seemed terrible<lb/> still. He was laying over by the
                        corner. By-and-by he raised up, part<lb/> way, and listened, with his head
                        to one side. He says very low:</p>
                    <p>"Tramp&#x2014;tramp&#x2014;tramp; that's the dead;
                        tramp&#x2014;tramp&#x2014;tramp; they're<lb/> coming after me; but I
                        won't go&#x2014;Oh, they're here! don't touch me&#x2014;don't!<lb/>
                        hands off&#x2014;they're cold; let go&#x2014;Oh, let a poor devil
                        alone!"</p>
                    <p>Then he went down on all fours and crawled off begging them to let<lb/> him
                        alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under
                        the<lb/> old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I
                        could hear<lb/> him through the blanket.</p>
                    <p>By-and-by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and<lb/> he
                        see me and went for me. He chased me round and round the place,<lb/> with a
                        clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death and saying he would<lb/> kill me
                        and then I couldn't come for him no more. I begged, and told<lb/> him I was
                        only Huck, but he laughed <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a screechy laugh, and
                        roared<lb/> and cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short
                        and<lb/> dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket
                        between<lb/> my shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the
                        jacket<lb/> quick as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all
                        tired out,<lb/> and dropped down with his back against the door, and said he
                        would rest<lb/> a minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and
                        said he<lb/> would sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was
                        who.</p>
                    <p>So he dozed off, pretty soon. By-and-by I got the old split-bottom<lb/> chair
                        and clumb up, as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got<lb/> down
                        the gun. I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded,<lb/> and
                        then I laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set<lb/>
                        down behind it to wait for him to stir. And how slow and still the time<lb/>
                        did drag along.</p>

                    <p>I opened my eyes and looked<lb/> around, trying to make out where I<lb/> was.
                        It was after sun-up, and I had<lb/> been sound asleep. Pap was standing<lb/>
                        over me, looking sour&#x2014;and sick, too.<lb/> He says&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"What you doin' with this<lb/> gun?"</p>
                    <p>I judged he didn't know nothing<lb/> about what he had been doing, so I<lb/>
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"Somebody tried to get in, so I<lb/> was laying for him."</p>
                    <p>"Why didn't you roust me out?"<lb/> "Well I tried to, but I couldn't;<lb/> I
                        couldn't budge you."</p>

                    <p>"Well, all right. Don't stand there palavering all day, but out with<lb/> you
                        and see if there's a fish on the lines for breakfast. I'll be along in<lb/>
                        a minute."</p>
                    <p>He unlocked the door and I cleared out, up the river bank. I<lb/> noticed
                        some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a <reg
                            orig="sprink-|ling">sprinkling</reg><lb/> of bark; so I knowed the river
                        had begun to rise. I reckoned I<lb/> would have great times, now, if I was
                        over at the town. The June rise<lb/> used to be always luck for me; because
                        as soon as that rise begins, here<lb/> comes cord-wood floating down, and
                        pieces of log rafts&#x2014;sometimes a dozen<lb/>
                        <pb n="54" entity="u000002472_0069"/> logs together; so all you have to do
                        is to catch them and sell them to the<lb/> wood yards and the sawmill.</p>
                    <p>I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and 'tother one out
                        for<lb/> what the rise might fetch along. Well, all at once, here comes a
                        canoe; just a<lb/> beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding
                        high like a duck. I<lb/> shot head first off of the bank, like a frog,
                        clothes and all on, and struck out<lb/> for the canoe. I just expected
                        there'd be somebody laying down in it, because<lb/> people often done that
                        to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most<lb/> to it they'd
                        raise up and laugh at him. But it warn't so this time. It was a<lb/>
                        drift-canoe, sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. Thinks
                        I,<lb/> the old man will be glad when he sees this&#x2014;she's worth
                        ten dollars. But when<lb/> I got to shore pap wasn't in sight yet, and as I
                        was running her into a little<lb/> creek like a gully, all hung over with
                        vines and willows, I struck another idea;<lb/> I judged I'd hide her good,
                        and then, stead of taking to the woods when I run<lb/> off, I'd go down the
                        river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and<lb/> not have
                        such a rough time tramping on foot.</p>

                    <p>It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man
                        coming,<lb/> all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked
                        around a bunch of<lb/> willows, and there was the old man down the path
                        apiece just drawing a bead on<lb/> a bird with his gun. So he hadn't seen
                        anything.</p>
                    <p>When he got along, I was hard at it taking up a "trot" line. He abused me
                        a<lb/> little for being so slow, but I told him I fell in the river and that
                        was what made<lb/> me so long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and then he
                        would be asking<lb/> questions. We got five cat-fish off of the lines and
                        went home.</p>
                    <p>While we laid off, after breakfast, to sleep up, both of us being about
                        wore<lb/> out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap
                        and the widow<lb/> from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing
                        than trusting to luck to<lb/> get far enough off before they missed me; you
                        see, all kinds of things might<lb/> happen. Well, I didn't see no way for a
                        while, but by-and-by pap raised up a<lb/> minute, to drink another barrel of
                        water, and he says:</p>
                    <p>"Another time a man comes a-prowling round here, you roust me out, you<lb/>
                        hear? That man warn't here for no good. I'd a shot him. Next time, you<lb/>
                        roust me out, you hear?"</p>
                    <p>Then he dropped down and went to sleep again&#x2014;but what he had been
                        saying<lb/> give me the very idea I wanted. I says to myself, I can fix it
                        now so nobody<lb/> won't think of following me.</p>
                    <p>About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The river<lb/>
                        was coming up pretty fast, and lots of drift-wood going by on the rise.
                            By-<reg orig="and-|by">and-by</reg>,<lb/> along comes part of a log
                        raft&#x2014;nine logs fast together. We went out with<lb/> the skiff and
                        towed it ashore. Then we had dinner. Anybody but pap would a<lb/> waited and
                        seen the day through, so as to catch more stuff; but that warn't pap's<lb/>
                        style. Nine logs was enough for one time; he must shove right over to
                        town<lb/> and sell. So he locked me in and took the skiff and started off
                        towing the raft<lb/> about half-past three. I judged he wouldn't come back
                        that night. I waited<lb/> till I reckoned he had got a good start, then I
                        out with my saw and went to<lb/> work on that log again. Before he was
                        'tother side of the river I was out of the<lb/> hole; him and his raft was
                        just a speck on the water away off yonder.</p>
                    <p>I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and<lb/>
                        shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same with<lb/>
                        <pb n="56" entity="u000002472_0071"/> the side of bacon; then the whisky
                        jug; I took all the coffee and sugar there<lb/> was, and all the ammunition;
                        I took the wadding; I took the bucket and gourd,<lb/> I took a dipper and a
                        tin cup, and my old saw and two blankets, and the skillet<lb/> and the
                        coffee-pot. I took fish-lines and matches and other
                        things&#x2014;everything<lb/> that was worth a cent. I cleaned out the
                        place. I wanted an axe, but there<lb/> wasn't any, only the one out at the
                        wood pile, and I knowed why I was going to<lb/> leave that. I fetched out
                        the gun, and now I was done.</p>
                    <p>I had wore the ground a good deal, crawling out of the hole and dragging
                        out<lb/> so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside
                        by scattering<lb/> dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and
                        the sawdust. Then I<lb/> fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put
                        two rocks under it and one<lb/> against it to hold it there,&#x2014;for
                        it was bent up at that place, and didn't quite<lb/> touch ground. If you
                        stood four or five foot away and didn't know it was sawed,<lb/> you wouldn't
                        ever notice it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin and it<lb/>
                        warn't likely anybody would go fooling around there.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>It was all grass clear to the canoe; so I hadn't left a track. I followed<lb/>
                        <pb n="57" entity="u000002472_0072"/> around to see. I stood on the bank and
                        looked out over the river. All safe.<lb/> So I took the gun and went up a
                        piece into the woods and was hunting around<lb/> for some birds, when I see
                        a wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms<lb/> after they had got away
                        from the prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took<lb/> him into camp.</p>
                    <p>I took the axe and smashed in the door&#x2014;I beat it and hacked it
                        considerable,<lb/> a-doing it. I fetched the pig in and took him back nearly
                        to the table and<lb/> hacked into his throat with the ax, and laid him down
                        on the ground to bleed&#x2014;<lb/> I say ground, because it <hi
                            rend="italic">was</hi> ground&#x2014;hard packed, and no boards.
                        Well, next I<lb/> took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in
                        it,&#x2014;all I could drag&#x2014;and I started<lb/> it from the
                        pig and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the<lb/> river
                        and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see
                        that<lb/> something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer
                        was<lb/> there, I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business,
                        and throw in<lb/> the fancy touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom
                        Sawyer in such a<lb/> thing as that.</p>
                    <p>Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and bloodied the ax good, and stuck
                        it<lb/> on the back side, and slung the ax in the corner. Then I took up the
                        pig and held<lb/> him to my breast with my jacket &lpar;so he couldn't
                        drip&rpar; till I got a good piece <reg orig="be-|low">below</reg><lb/>
                        the house and then dumped him into the river. Now I thought of
                        something<lb/> else. So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of
                        the canoe and<lb/> fetched them to the house. I took the bag to where it
                        used to stand, and ripped<lb/> a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for
                        there warn't no knives and forks on<lb/> the place&#x2014;pap done
                        everything with his clasp-knife, about the cooking. Then<lb/> I carried the
                        sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows<lb/>
                        east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of
                        rushes&#x2014;<lb/> and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There
                        was a slough or a creek<lb/> leading out of it on the other side, that went
                        miles away, I don't know where,<lb/> but it didn't go to the river. The meal
                        sifted out and made a little track all the<lb/> way to the lake. I dropped
                        pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had<lb/> been done by
                        accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string,<lb/> so it
                        wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.</p>
                    <p>It was about dark, now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some<lb/>
                        <pb n="58" entity="u000002472_0073"/> willows that hung over the bank, and
                        waited for the moon to rise. I made fast<lb/> to a willow; then I took a
                        bite to eat, and by-and-by laid down in the canoe to<lb/> smoke a pipe and
                        lay out a plan. I says to myself, they'll follow the track of<lb/> that
                        sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me. And
                        they'll<lb/> follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the
                        creek that leads<lb/> out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took
                        the things. They won't<lb/> ever hunt the river for anything but my dead
                        carcass. They'll soon get tired of<lb/> that, and won't bother no more about
                        me. All right; I can stop anywhere I<lb/> want to. Jackson's Island is good
                        enough for me; I know that island pretty<lb/> well, and nobody ever comes
                        there. And then I can paddle over to town, nights,<lb/> and slink around and
                        pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the place.</p>
                    <p>I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed, I was asleep. When I<lb/>
                        woke up I didn't know where I was, for a minute. I set up and looked<lb/>
                        around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and
                        miles<lb/> across. The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs
                        that went a<lb/> slipping along, black and still, hundred of yards out from
                        shore. Everything was<lb/> dead quiet, and it looked late, and <hi
                            rend="italic">smelt</hi> late. You know what I mean&#x2014;I
                        don't<lb/> know the words to put it in.</p>
                    <p>I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start,
                        when<lb/> I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I
                        made it out. It<lb/> was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from
                        oars working in rowlocks<lb/> when it's a still night. I peeped out through
                        the willow branches, and there<lb/> it was&#x2014;a skiff, away across
                        the water. I couldn't tell how many was in it. It<lb/> kept a-coming, and
                        when it was abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in<lb/> it. Thinks
                        I, maybe it's pap, though I warn't expecting him. He dropped<lb/> below me,
                        with the current, and by-and-by he come a-swinging up shore in the<lb/> easy
                        water, and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and
                        touched<lb/> him. Well, it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> pap, sure
                        enough&#x2014;and sober, too, by the way he laid to his<lb/> oars.</p>
                    <p>I didn't lose no time. The next minute I was a-spinning down stream soft
                        but<lb/> quick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half, and
                        then struck<lb/> out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the
                        river, because pretty<lb/> soon I would be passing the ferry landing and
                        people might see me and hail<lb/>
                        <pb n="59" entity="u000002472_0074"/> me. I got out amongst the drift-wood
                        and then laid down in the bottom of the<lb/> canoe and let her float. I laid
                        there and had a good rest and a smoke out of my<lb/> pipe, looking away into
                        the sky, not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep<lb/> when you lay
                        down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.<lb/> And how
                        far a body can hear on the water such nights! I heard people talking at<lb/>
                        the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too, every word of it. One man
                        said<lb/> it was getting towards the long days and the short nights, now.
                        'Tother one said<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">this</hi> warn't one of the short ones, he
                        reckoned&#x2014;and then they laughed, and he said it<lb/> over again
                        and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told<lb/> him,
                        and laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk and said
                        let<lb/> him alone. The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his old
                        woman&#x2014;she would<lb/> think it was pretty good; but he said that
                        warn't nothing to some things he had<lb/> said in his time. I heard one man
                        say it was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped<lb/> daylight wouldn't wait
                        more than about a week longer. After that, the talk got<lb/> further and
                        further away, and I couldn't make out the words any more, but I could<lb/>
                        hear the mumble; and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways
                        off.</p>

                    <p>I was away below the ferry now. I rose up and there was Jackson's<lb/>
                        Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy-timbered and
                        standing<lb/> up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid,
                        like a steamboat<lb/> without any lights. There warn't any signs of the bar
                        at the head&#x2014;it was<lb/> all under water, now.</p>
                    <p>It didn't take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a ripping<lb/>
                        rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and
                        landed<lb/> on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into a
                        deep dent in<lb/> the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow
                        branches to get in;<lb/> and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe
                        from the outside.</p>
                    <p>I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island and looked<lb/> out
                        on the big river and the black driftwood, and away over to the town,<lb/>
                        three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. A
                        monstrous<lb/> big lumber raft was about a mile up stream, coming along
                        down, with a<lb/> lantern in the middle of it. I watched it come creeping
                        down, and when it<lb/> was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say,
                        "Stern oars, there!<lb/> heave her head to stabboard!" I heard that just as
                        plain as if the man was<lb/> by my side.</p>
                    <p>There was a little gray in the sky, now; so I stepped into the woods and<lb/>
                        laid down for a nap before breakfast.</p>

                    <p>I was powerful lazy and comfortable&#x2014;<lb/> didn't want to get up
                        and cook breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again,<lb/> when I thinks I hears
                        a deep sound of "boom!" away up the river. I<lb/> rouses up and rests on my
                        elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again.<lb/> I hopped up and went
                        and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see<lb/> a bunch of smoke
                        laying on the water a long ways up&#x2014;about abreast the<lb/> ferry.
                        And there was the ferry-boat full of people, floating along down. I<lb/>
                        knowed what was the matter, now. "Boom!" I see the white smoke<lb/>
                        <pb n="62" entity="u000002472_0077"/> squirt out of the ferry-boat's side.
                        You see, they was firing cannon over the<lb/> water, trying to make my
                        carcass come to the top.</p>
                    <p>I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,<lb/>
                        because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the <reg
                            orig="cannon-|smoke">cannonsmoke</reg><lb/> and listened to the boom.
                        The river was a mile wide, there, and<lb/> it always looks pretty on a
                        summer morning&#x2014;so I was having a good enough<lb/> time seeing
                        them hunt for my remainders, if I only had a bite to eat.<lb/> Well, then I
                        happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves<lb/> of bread
                        and float them off because they always go right to the drownded<lb/> carcass
                        and stop there. So says I, I'll keep a lookout, and if any of them's<lb/>
                        floating around after me, I'll give them a show. I changed to the
                        Illinois<lb/> edge of the island to see what luck I could have, and I warn't
                        disappointed.<lb/> A big double loaf come along, and I most got it, with a
                        long stick, but<lb/> my foot slipped and she floated out further. Of course
                        I was where the<lb/> current set in the closest to the shore&#x2014;I
                        knowed enough for that. But by-and-by<lb/> along comes another one, and this
                        time I won. I took out the plug and<lb/> shook out the little dab of
                        quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was "baker's<lb/>
                        bread"&#x2014;what the quality eat&#x2014;none of your low-down
                        corn-pone.</p>
                    <p>I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching<lb/>
                        the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And
                        then<lb/> something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson
                        or<lb/> somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone
                        and<lb/> done it. So there ain't no doubt but there is something in that
                        thing.<lb/> That is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or
                        the parson<lb/> prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work
                        for only just<lb/> the right kind.</p>
                    <p>I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke and went on watching. The<lb/>
                        ferry-boat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a
                        chance<lb/> to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would
                        come in<lb/> close, where the bread did. When she'd got pretty well along
                        down towards<lb/> me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the
                        bread, and<lb/> laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.
                        Where the<lb/> log forked I could peep through.</p>
                    <pb n="63" entity="u000002472_0078"/>
                    <p>By-and-by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could<lb/> a
                        run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat.<lb/> Pap,
                        and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom<lb/> Sawyer,
                        and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more. <reg
                            orig="Every-|body">Everybody</reg><lb/> was talking about the murder,
                        but the captain broke in and says:</p>

                        washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge. I hope
                        so,<lb/> anyway."</p>
                    <p>I didn't hope so. They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly
                        in<lb/> my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I could see

                        see<lb/> me. Then the captain sung<lb/> out:</p>

                        the<lb/> smoke, and I judged I was<lb/> gone. If they'd a had some<lb/>

                        once in a while as they went. I crossed over to<lb/> that side and watched
                        them. When they got abreast the head of the island they<lb/> quit shooting
                        and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the<lb/> town.</p>
                    <p>I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after me.<lb/>
                        I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick
                        woods.<lb/> I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things
                        under so the rain<lb/> couldn't get at them. I catched a cat-fish and
                        haggled him open with my saw,<lb/> and towards sundown I started<lb/> my
                        camp fire and had supper.<lb/> Then I set out a line to catch<lb/> some fish
                        for breakfast.</p>
                    <p>When it was dark I set by my<lb/> camp fire smoking, and feeling<lb/> pretty
                        satisfied; but by-and-by it<lb/> got sort of lonesome, and so I<lb/> went
                        and set on the bank and<lb/> listened to the currents washing<lb/> along,
                        and counted the stars and<lb/> drift-logs and rafts that come<lb/> down, and
                        then went to bed;<lb/> there ain't no better way to put<lb/> in time when
                        you are lonesome;<lb/> you can't stay so, you soon get<lb/> over it.</p>

                    <p>And so for three days and<lb/> nights. No difference&#x2014;just the<lb/>
                        same thing. But the next day<lb/> I went exploring around down<lb/> through
                        the island. I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I<lb/>
                        wanted to know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I<lb/>
                        found plenty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer-grapes, and<lb/>
                        <pb n="65" entity="u000002472_0080"/> green razberries; and the green
                        blackberries was just beginning to show.<lb/> They would all come handy
                        by-and-by, I judged.</p>
                    <p>Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't far
                        from<lb/> the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot
                        nothing; it was<lb/> for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh
                        home. About this time<lb/> I mighty near stepped on a good sized snake, and
                        it went sliding off through<lb/> the grass and flowers, and I after it,
                        trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along,<lb/> and all of a sudden I
                        bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was<lb/> still
                        smoking.</p>
                    <p>My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look further,<lb/>
                        but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tip-toes as fast as ever
                        I<lb/> could. Every now and then I stopped a second, amongst the thick
                        leaves, and<lb/> listened; but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear
                        nothing else. I slunk<lb/> along another piece further, then listened again;
                        and so on, and so on; if I<lb/> see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod
                        on a stick and broke it, it made me<lb/> feel like a person had cut one of
                        my breaths in two and I only got half, and the<lb/> short half, too.</p>
                    <p>When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand
                        in<lb/> my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around. So I
                        got all my<lb/> traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,
                        and I put out the fire<lb/> and scattered the ashes around to look like an
                        old last year's camp, and then<lb/> clumb a tree.</p>
                    <p>I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing, I
                        didn't<lb/> hear nothing&#x2014;I only <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> I
                        heard and seen as much as a thousand things.<lb/> Well, I couldn't stay up
                        there forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the<lb/> thick woods and
                        on the lookout all the time. All I could get to eat was berries<lb/> and
                        what was left over from breakfast.</p>
                    <p>By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good and<lb/>
                        dark, I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the
                        Illinois<lb/> bank&#x2014;about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the
                        woods and cooked a supper,<lb/> and I had about made up my mind I would stay
                        there all night, when I hear a<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk,</hi> and says to myself,
                        horses coming; and next I<lb/> hear people's voices. I got everything into
                        the canoe as quick as I could, and<lb/>
                        <pb n="66" entity="u000002472_0081"/> then went creeping through the woods
                        to see what I could find out. I hadn't<lb/> got far when I hear a man
                        say:</p>
                    <p>"We better camp here, if we can find a good place; the horses is about
                        beat<lb/> out. Let's look around."</p>
                    <p>I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the
                        old<lb/> place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.</p>
                    <p>I didn't sleep much. I couldn't, somehow, for thinking. And every time I<lb/>
                        waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn't do
                        me<lb/> no good. By-and-by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm
                        agoing to find<lb/> out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'll
                        find it out or bust. Well, I<lb/> felt better, right off.</p>
                    <p>So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then
                        let<lb/> the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was
                        shining, and<lb/> outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day. I
                        poked along well onto<lb/> an hour, everything still as rocks and sound
                        asleep. Well by this time I was<lb/> most down to the foot of the island. A
                        little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow,<lb/> and that was as good as
                        saying the night was about done. I give her a turn with<lb/> the paddle and
                        brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and<lb/> into the
                        edge of the woods. I set down there on a log and looked out through<lb/> the
                        leaves. I see the moon go off watch and the darkness begin to blanket
                        the<lb/> river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the
                        tree-tops, and knowed the<lb/> day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped
                        off towards where I had run<lb/> across that camp fire, stopping every
                        minute or two to listen. But I hadn't no<lb/> luck, somehow; I couldn't seem
                        to find the place. But by-and-by, sure enough,<lb/> I catched a glimpse of
                        fire, away through the trees. I went for it, cautious and<lb/> slow.
                        By-and-by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on
                        the<lb/> ground. It most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his
                        head, and<lb/> his head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump
                        of bushes, in<lb/> about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It
                        was getting gray<lb/> daylight, now. Pretty soon he gapped, and stretched
                        himself, and hove off<lb/> the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim! I bet
                        I was glad to see him. I<lb/> says:</p>
                    <p>"Hello, Jim!" and skipped out.</p>
                    <pb n="67" entity="u000002472_0082"/>
                    <p>He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his knees,<lb/>
                        and puts his hands together and says:</p>
                    <p>"Doan' hurt me&#x2014;don't! I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'. I
                        awluz<lb/> liked dead people, en done all I could for 'em. You go en git in

                    <p>Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead. I was ever so
                        glad<lb/> to see Jim. I warn't lonesome, now. I told him I warn't afraid of
                            <hi rend="italic">him</hi> telling<lb/> the people where I was. I talked
                        along, but he only set there and looked at me;<lb/> never said nothing. Then
                        I says:</p>

                    <p>"What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich

                    <p>"Strawberries and such truck," I says. "Is that what you live on?"</p>
                    <p>"I couldn' git nuffn else," he says.</p>

                    <p>"And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?"</p>
                    <p>"No, sah&#x2014;nuffn else."</p>
                    <p>"Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?'</p>
                    <p>"I reck'n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long you ben on de<lb/>

                    <p>"No! W'y what has you lived on? But you got a gun. Oh, yes, you got a<lb/>

                    <p>So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a
                        grassy<lb/> open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and
                        coffee, and coffee-pot<lb/> and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the
                        nigger was set back <reg orig="consider-|able">considerable</reg>,<lb/>
                        because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft. I catched a good
                        big<lb/> cat-fish, too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried
                        him.</p>
                    <p>When breakfast was ready, we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.<lb/>
                        Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then when
                        we<lb/> had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.</p>
                    <p>By-and-by Jim says:</p>
                    <p>"But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty, ef it
                        warn't<lb/> you?"</p>
                    <p>Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said Tom<lb/>
                        Sawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what I had. Then I says:</p>
                    <p>"How do you come to be here, Jim, and how'd you get here?"</p>
                    <p>He looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute. Then he<lb/>
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"Maybe I better not tell."</p>

                    <p>"Well, that's so. You've had to keep in the woods all the time, of<lb/>

                    <p>Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting.<lb/>
                        <pb n="71" entity="u000002472_0086"/> Jim said it was a sign it was going to
                        rain. He said it was a sign when young<lb/> chickens flew that way, and so
                        he reckoned it was the same way when young<lb/> birds done it. I was going
                        to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn't let me.<lb/> He said it was death.
                        He said his father laid mighty sick once, and some of<lb/> them catched a
                        bird, and his old granny said his father would die, and he<lb/> did.</p>
                    <p>And Jim said you musn't count the things you are going to cook for
                        dinner,<lb/> because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the
                        table-cloth<lb/> after sundown. And he said if a man owned a bee-hive, and
                        that man died,<lb/> the bees must be told about it before sun-up next
                        morning, or else the bees<lb/> would all weaken down and quit work and die.
                        Jim said bees wouldn't sting<lb/> idiots; but I didn't believe that, because
                        I had tried them lots of times<lb/> myself, and they wouldn't sting me.</p>
                    <p>I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them.<lb/> Jim
                        knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything.<lb/> I said it
                        looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked<lb/> him
                        if there warn't any good-luck signs. He says:</p>
                    <p>"Mighty few&#x2014;an' <hi rend="italic">dey</hi> ain' no use to a body.
                        What you want to<lb/> know when good luck's a-comin' for? want to keep it
                        off?" And he said:<lb/> "Ef you's got hairy arms en a hairy breas', it's a
                        sign dat you's agwyne<lb/> to be rich. Well, dey's some use in a sign like
                        dat, 'kase it's so fur<lb/> ahead. You see, maybe you's got to be po' a long

                    <p>"Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?"</p>
                    <p>"What's de use to ax dat question? don' you see I has?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, are you rich?"</p>
                    <p>"No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. Wunst I had<lb/> foteen

                    <p>"What did you speculate in, Jim?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, fust I tackled stock."</p>
                    <p>"What kind of stock?"</p>
                    <p>"Why, live stock. Cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in a cow.<lb/>
                        <pb n="72" entity="u000002472_0087"/> But I ain' gwyne to resk no mo' money

                    <p>"So you lost the ten dollars."</p>
                    <p>"No, I didn' lose it all. I on'y los' 'bout nine of it. I sole de hide
                        en<lb/> taller for a dollar en ten cents."</p>
                    <p>"You had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate any<lb/>
                        more?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes. You know dat one-laigged nigger dat b'longs to old Misto<lb/> Bradish?
                        well, he sot up a<lb/> bank, en say anybody dat put<lb/> in a dollar would

                        much. So I stuck out for mo'<lb/> dan fo' dollars, en I said 'f I<lb/> didn'

                        soon got to it, because the island<lb/> was only three miles long and a<lb/>
                        quarter of a mile wide.</p>
                    <p>This place was a tolerable long<lb/> steep hill or ridge, about forty<lb/>
                        foot high. We had a rough time<lb/> getting to the top, the sides was<lb/>
                        so steep and the bushes so thick.<lb/> We tramped and clumb around<lb/> all
                        over it, and by-and-by found<lb/> a good big cavern in the rock,<lb/> most
                        up to the top on the side<lb/> towards Illinois. The cavern was<lb/> as big
                        as two or three rooms<lb/> bunched together, and Jim could<lb/> stand up
                        straight in it. It was<lb/> cool in there. Jim was for putting<lb/> our
                        traps in there, right away,<lb/> but I said we didn't want to be<lb/>
                        climbing up and down there all the time.</p>

                    <p>Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the<lb/> traps
                        in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the<lb/>
                        island, and they would never find us without dogs. And besides, he said<lb/>
                        them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the
                        things<lb/> to get wet?</p>

                    <p>So we went back and got the canoe and paddled up abreast the cavern, and<lb/>
                        lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by to hide
                        the<lb/> canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off of the
                        lines and<lb/> set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.</p>
                    <p>The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one<lb/>
                        side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit and was flat and a good
                        place to<lb/> build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.</p>

                        a little ways looked dim and spider-webby;<lb/> and here would come a blast
                        of wind that would bend the trees down and turn<lb/> up the pale underside
                        of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would<lb/> follow along
                        and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild;<lb/>
                        <pb n="76" entity="u000002472_0091"/> and next, when it was just about the

                        bright<lb/> as glory and you'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging

                        could see before; dark<lb/> as sin again in a second, and now you'd hear the
                        thunder let go with an awful<lb/> crash and then go rumbling, grumbling,
                        tumbling down the sky towards the<lb/> under side of the world, like rolling
                        empty barrels down stairs, where it's long<lb/> stairs and they bounce a

                    <p>"Jim, this is nice," I says. "I wouldn't want to be nowhere else but
                        here.<lb/> Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread."</p>
                    <p>"Well, you wouldn't a ben here, 'f it hadn't a ben for Jim. You'd a ben<lb/>

                    <p>The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at last it
                        was<lb/> over the banks. The water was three or four foot deep on the island
                        in the low<lb/> places and on the Illinois bottom. On that side it was a
                        good many miles wide;<lb/> but on the Missouri side it was the same old
                        distance across&#x2014;a half a mile&#x2014;<lb/> because the
                        Missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs.</p>
                    <p>Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe. It was mighty cool<lb/>
                        and shady in the deep woods even if the sun was blazing outside. We
                        went<lb/> winding in and out amongst the trees; and sometimes the vines hung
                        so thick<lb/> we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every old
                        broken-down<lb/> tree, you could see rabbits, and snakes, and such things;
                        and when the island<lb/> had been overflowed a day or two, they got so tame,
                        on account of being hungry,<lb/> that you could paddle right up and put your
                        hand on them if you wanted to;<lb/> but not the snakes and
                        turtles&#x2014;they would slide off in the water. The ridge<lb/> our
                        cavern was in, was full of them. We could a had pets enough if we'd
                        wanted<lb/> them.</p>
                    <p>One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft&#x2014;nice pine
                        planks.<lb/> It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long,
                        and the top stood<lb/> above water six or seven inches, a solid level floor.
                        We could see saw-logs go<lb/> by in the daylight, sometimes, but we let them
                        go; we didn't show ourselves in<lb/> daylight.</p>
                    <p>Another night, when we was up at the head of the island, just before daylight,<lb/>
                        <pb n="77" entity="u000002472_0092"/> here comes a frame house down, on the
                        west side. She was a two-story, and<lb/> tilted over, considerable. We
                        paddled out and got aboard&#x2014;clumb in at an<lb/> up-stairs window.
                        But it was too dark to see yet, so we made the canoe fast<lb/> and set in
                        her to wait for daylight.</p>
                    <p>The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then we<lb/>
                        looked in at the window. We could make out a bed, and a table, and two
                        old<lb/> chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor; and there was
                        clothes<lb/> hanging against the wall. There was something laying on the
                        floor in the far<lb/> corner that looked like a man. So Jim says:</p>
                    <figure id="f36" rend="inline" entity="u000002472_0092">

                    <p>"Hello, you!"</p>
                    <p>But it didn't budge. So I hollered again, and then Jim says:</p>
                    <p>"De man ain't asleep&#x2014;he's dead. You hold still&#x2014;I'll go
                        en see."</p>
                    <p>He went and bent down and looked, and says:</p>
                    <p>"It's a dead man. Yes, indeedy; naked, too. He's ben shot in de back.<lb/> I
                        reck'n he's ben dead two er three days. Come in, Huck, but doan' look at
                        his<lb/> face&#x2014;it's too gashly."</p>
                    <pb n="78" entity="u000002472_0093"/>
                    <p>I didn't look at him at all. Jim throwed some old rags over him, but he<lb/>
                        needn't done it; I didn't want to see him. There was heaps of old
                        greasy<lb/> cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,
                        and a couple of<lb/> masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls
                        was the ignorantest kind<lb/> of words and pictures, made with charcoal.
                        There was two old dirty calico<lb/> dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some
                        women's under-clothes, hanging against<lb/> the wall, and some men's
                        clothing, too. We put the lot into the canoe; it might<lb/> come good. There
                        was a boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that<lb/> too. And
                        there was a bottle that had had milk in it; and it had a rag stopper<lb/>
                        for a baby to suck. We would a took the bottle, but it was broke. There
                        was<lb/> a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.
                        Theystood open,<lb/> but there warn't nothing left in them that was any
                        account. The way things was<lb/> scattered about, we reckoned the people
                        left in a hurry and warn't fixed so as to<lb/> carry off most of their
                        stuff.</p>
                    <p>We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher knife without any handle, and a <reg
                            orig="bran-|new">brannew</reg><lb/> Barlow knife worth two bits in any
                        store, and a lot of tallow candles, and a<lb/> tin candlestick, and a gourd,
                        and a tin cup, and a ratty old bed-quilt off the bed,<lb/> and a reticule
                        with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all<lb/> such
                        truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and a fish-line as thick as
                        my<lb/> little finger, with some monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of
                        buckskin, and a leather<lb/> dog-collar, and a horse-shoe, and some vials of
                        medicine that didn't have no label<lb/> on them; and just as we was leaving
                        I found a tolerable good curry-comb, and Jim<lb/> he found a ratty old
                        fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg. The straps was broke off of it,<lb/> but
                        barring that, it was a good enough leg, though it was too long for me and
                        not<lb/> long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find the other one, though we
                        hunted all<lb/> around.</p>
                    <p>And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was ready to
                        shove<lb/> off, we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was
                        pretty broad day; so I<lb/> made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with
                        the quilt, because if he set up,<lb/> people could tell he was a nigger a
                        good ways off. I paddled over to the Illinois<lb/> shore, and drifted down
                        most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water<lb/> under the bank,
                        and hadn't no accidents and didn't see nobody. We got home<lb/> all
                        safe.</p>

                        and ha'nt us; he said a man<lb/> that warn't buried was more likely to<lb/>

                        That<lb/> sounded pretty reasonable, so I didn't<lb/> say no more; but I

                        didn't want to talk about that. I says:</p>
                    <p>"Now you think it's bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the<lb/>

                    <p>It did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that talk. Well, after
                        dinner<lb/> Friday, we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of
                        the ridge, and got<lb/> out of tobacco. I went to the cavern to get some,
                        and found a rattlesnake in<lb/> there. I killed him, and curled him up on
                        the foot of Jim's blanket, ever so<lb/> natural, thinking there'd be some
                        fun when Jim found him there. Well, by<lb/> night I forgot all about the
                        snake, and when Jim flung himself down on the<lb/> blanket while I struck a
                        light,<lb/> the snake's mate was there,<lb/> and bit him.</p>

                    <p>He jumped up yelling, and<lb/> the first thing the light showed<lb/> was the
                        varmint curled up and<lb/> ready for another spring. I laid<lb/> him out in
                        a second with a<lb/> stick, and Jim grabbed pap's<lb/> whisky jug and begun
                        to pour<lb/> it down.</p>
                    <p>He was barefooted, and the<lb/> snake bit him right on the heel.<lb/> That
                        all comes of my being<lb/> such a fool as to not remember<lb/> that wherever
                        you leave a dead<lb/> snake its mate always comes<lb/> there and curls
                        around it. Jim<lb/> told me to chop off the snake's<lb/> head and throw it
                        away, and<lb/> then skin the body and roast a<lb/> piece of it. I done it,
                        and he<lb/> eat it and said it would help<lb/> cure him. He made me take off
                        the rattles and tie them around his wrist, too.<lb/> He said that that would
                        help. Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes<lb/>
                        <pb n="81" entity="u000002472_0096"/> clear away amongst the bushes; for I
                        warn't going to let Jim find out it was<lb/> all my fault, not if I could
                        help it.</p>
                    <p>Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his<lb/>
                        head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he
                        went to<lb/> sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and
                        so did his leg;<lb/> but by-and-by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged
                        he was all right; but<lb/> I'd druther been bit with a snake than pap's
                        whisky.</p>
                    <p>Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all gone
                        and<lb/> he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn't ever take aholt
                        of a<lb/> snake-skin again with my hands,<lb/> now that I see what had come
                        of<lb/> it. Jim said he reckoned I would<lb/> believe him next time. And
                        he<lb/> said that handling a snake-skin was<lb/> such awful bad luck that
                        maybe<lb/> we hadn't got to the end of it yet.<lb/> He said he druther see
                        the new<lb/> moon over his left shoulder as much<lb/> as a thousand times
                        than take up a<lb/> snake-skin in his hand. Well, I<lb/> was getting to feel
                        that way myself,<lb/> though I've always reckoned that<lb/> looking at the
                        new moon over your<lb/> left shoulder is one of the carelessest<lb/> and
                        foolishest things a body can do.<lb/> Old Hank Bunker done it once, and<lb/>
                        bragged about it; and in less than<lb/> two years he got drunk and fell
                        off<lb/> of the shot tower and spread himself<lb/> out so that he was just a
                        kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him<lb/> edgeways between two

                    <p>Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks
                        again;<lb/> and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big
                        hooks with a skinned<lb/> rabbit and set it and catch a cat-fish that was as
                        big as a man, being six foot two<lb/> inches long, and weighed over two
                        hundred pounds. We couldn't handle him,<lb/> of course; he would a flung us
                        into Illinois. We just set there and watched him<lb/> rip and tear around
                        till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach,<lb/> and a round
                        ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet,<lb/> and
                        there was a spool in it. Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to coat
                        it<lb/> over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever
                        catched in the<lb/> Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn't ever seen a
                        bigger one. He would a<lb/> been worth a good deal over at the village. They
                        peddle out such a fish as that<lb/> by the pound in the market house there;
                        everybody buys some of him; his<lb/> meat's as white as snow and makes a
                        good fry.</p>

                    <p>Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a<lb/>
                        stirring up, some way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and
                        find out<lb/> what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I must
                        go in the dark<lb/>
                        <pb n="83" entity="u000002472_0098"/> and look sharp. Then he studied it
                        over and said, couldn't I put on some of<lb/> them old things and dress up
                        like a girl? That was a good notion, too. So we<lb/> shortened up one of the
                        calico gowns and I turned up my trowser-legs to my<lb/> kness and got into
                        it. Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair<lb/> fit. I put
                        on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to<lb/>
                        look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe. Jim
                        said<lb/> nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practiced
                        around all day<lb/> to get the hang of the things, and by-and-by I could do
                        pretty well in them, only<lb/> Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he
                        said I must quit pulling up my gown<lb/> to get at my britches pocket. I
                        took notice, and done better.</p>
                    <p>I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.</p>
                    <p>I started across to the town from a little below the ferry landing, and
                        the<lb/> drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. I
                        tied up and<lb/> started along the bank. There was a light burning in a
                        little shanty that hadn't<lb/> been lived in for a long time, and I wondered
                        who had took up quarters there. I<lb/> slipped up and peeped in at the
                        window. There was a woman about forty year<lb/> old in there, knitting by a
                        candle that was on a pine table. I didn't know her<lb/> face; she was a
                        stranger, for you couldn't start a face in that town that I didn't<lb/>
                        know. Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid
                        I<lb/> had come; people might know my voice and find me out. But if this
                        woman<lb/> had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I
                        wanted to know;<lb/> so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I
                        wouldn't forget I was a girl.</p>

                        was done<lb/> by a runaway nigger named Jim."</p>
                    <p>"Why <hi rend="italic">he</hi>&#x2014;"</p>
                    <p>I stopped. I reckoned I better keep still. She run on, and never noticed

                    <p>"The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed. So there's a <reg

                        hundred dollars. You see, he come to town the morning after the<lb/> murder,
                        and told about it, and was out with 'em on the ferry-boat hunt, and<lb/>
                        right away after he up and left. Before night they wanted to lynch him, but
                        he<lb/> was gone, you see. Well, next day they found out the nigger was
                        gone; they<lb/> found out he hadn't ben seen sence ten o'clock the night the
                        murder was done.<lb/> So then they put it on him, you see, and while they
                        was full of it, next day back<lb/>
                        <pb n="86" entity="u000002472_0101"/> comes old Finn and went boo-hooing to

                        with. The judge give him some, and that evening<lb/> he got drunk and was

                        them. Well, he hain't come back sence,<lb/> and they ain't looking for him
                        back till this thing blows over a little, for people<lb/> thinks now that he
                        killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done<lb/> it,
                        and then he'd get Huck's money without having to bother a long time with
                        a<lb/> lawsuit. People do say he warn't any too good to do it. Oh, he's sly,
                        I reckon.<lb/> If he don't come back for a year, he'll be all right. You
                        can't prove anything on<lb/> him, you know; everything will be quieted down
                        then, and he'll walk into Huck's<lb/> money as easy as nothing."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, I reckon so, 'm. I don't see nothing in the way of it. Has
                        everybody<lb/> quit thinking the nigger done it?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, no, not everybody. A good many thinks he done it. But they'll get<lb/>
                        the nigger pretty soon, now, and maybe they can scare it out of him."</p>
                    <p>"Why, are they after him yet?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, you're innocent, ain't you! Does three hundred dollars lay round<lb/>
                        every day for people to pick up? Some folks thinks the nigger ain't far
                        from<lb/> here. I'm one of them&#x2014;but I hain't talked it around. A
                        few days ago I was<lb/> talking with an old couple that lives next door in
                        the log shanty, and they happened<lb/> to say hardly anybody ever goes to
                        that island over yonder that they call Jackson's<lb/> Island. Don't anybody
                        live there? says I. No, nobody, says they. I didn't say<lb/> any more, but I
                        done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I'd seen smoke<lb/> over
                        there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says to
                            <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg>,<lb/> like as not that nigger's hiding
                        over there; anyway, says I, it's worth the<lb/> trouble to give the place a
                        hunt. I hain't seen any smoke sence, so I reckon<lb/> maybe he's gone, if it
                        was him; but husband's going over to see&#x2014;him and another<lb/>
                        man. He was gone up the river; but he got back to-day and I told him as
                        soon<lb/> as he got here two hours ago."</p>
                    <p>I had got so uneasy I couldn't set still. I had to do something with my<lb/>
                        hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it.
                        My<lb/> hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. When the woman
                        stopped<lb/> talking, I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious,
                        and smiling a<lb/>
                        <pb n="87" entity="u000002472_0102"/> little. I put down the needle and
                        thread and let on to be interested&#x2014;and I was,<lb/>
                        too&#x2014;and says:</p>
                    <p>"Three hundred dollars is a power of money. I wish my mother could get<lb/>
                        it. Is your husband going<lb/> over there to-night?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, yes. He went up<lb/> town with the man I was<lb/> telling you of, to get
                        a boat<lb/> and see if they could borrow<lb/> another gun. They'll go
                        over<lb/> after midnight."</p>
                    <p>"Couldn't they see better<lb/> if they was to wait till <reg orig="day-|time"
                            >daytime</reg>?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes. And couldn't the<lb/> nigger see better, too? After<lb/> midnight he'll
                        likely be asleep,<lb/> and they can slip around<lb/> through the woods and
                        hunt<lb/> up his camp fire all the better<lb/> for the dark, if he's got

                        look up; seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered,
                        and<lb/> was afeared maybe I was looking it, too. I wished the woman would
                        say <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg><lb/> more; the longer she set
                        still, the uneasier I was. But now she says:</p>
                    <p>"Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, yes'm, I did. Sarah Mary Williams. Sarah's my first name. Some<lb/>
                        calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary."</p>
                    <pb n="88" entity="u000002472_0103"/>
                    <p>"Oh, that's the way of it?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes'm."</p>
                    <p>I was feeling better, then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway. I<lb/>
                        couldn't look up yet.</p>
                    <p>Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor<lb/>
                        they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the
                        place,<lb/> and so forth, and so on, and then I got easy again. She was
                        right about<lb/> the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the
                        corner every<lb/> little while. She said she had to have things handy to
                        throw at them when<lb/> she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace.
                        She showed me a bar<lb/> of lead, twisted up into a knot, and said she was a
                        good shot with it<lb/> generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago,
                        and didn't know<lb/> whether she could throw true, now. But she watched for
                        a chance, and<lb/> directly she banged away at a rat, but she missed him
                        wide, and said "Ouch!"<lb/> it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for
                        the next one. I wanted<lb/> to be getting away before the old man got back,
                        but of course I didn't let on.<lb/> I got the thing, and the first rat that
                        showed his nose I let drive, and if he'd<lb/> a stayed where he was he'd a
                        been a tolerable sick rat. She said that that was <reg orig="first-|rate"
                            >firstrate</reg>,<lb/> and she reckoned I would hive the next one. She
                        went and got the lump<lb/> of lead and fetched it back and brought along a
                        hank of yarn, which she wanted<lb/> me to help her with. I held up my two
                        hands and she put the hank over them<lb/> and went on talking about her and
                        her husband's matters. But she broke off<lb/> to say:</p>
                    <p>"Keep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your lap, handy."</p>
                    <p>So she dropped the lump into my lap, just at that moment, and I clapped
                        my<lb/> legs together on it and she went on talking. But only about a
                        minute. Then<lb/> she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,
                        but very pleasant, and<lb/> says:</p>
                    <p>"Come, now&#x2014;what's your real name?"</p>
                    <p>"Wh-what, mum?"</p>
                    <p>"What's your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?&#x2014;or what is
                        it?"</p>
                    <p>I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn't know hardly what to do. But I<lb/>
                        says:</p>
                    <pb n="89" entity="u000002472_0104"/>
                    <p>"Please to don't poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. If I'm in the
                        way,<lb/> here, I'll&#x2014;"</p>
                    <p>"No, you won't. Set down and stay where you are. I ain't going to hurt<lb/>
                        you, and I ain't going to tell on you, nuther. You just tell me your secret,
                        and<lb/> trust me. I'll keep it; and what's more, I'll help you. So'll my
                        old man, if you<lb/> want him to. You see, you're a runaway
                        'prentice&#x2014;that's all. It ain't <reg orig="any-|thing"
                            >anything</reg>.<lb/> There ain't any harm in it. You've been treated
                        bad, and you made up<lb/> your mind to cut. Bless you, child, I wouldn't
                        tell on you. Tell me all about<lb/> it, now&#x2014;that's a good
                        boy."</p>
                    <p>So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer, and I would
                        just<lb/> make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she mustn't go
                        back on her<lb/> promise. Then I told her my father and mother was dead, and
                        the law had<lb/> bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty
                        mile back from the<lb/> river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it
                        no longer; he went away to<lb/> be gone a couple of days, and so I took my
                        chance and stole some of his <reg orig="daugh-|ter's">daughter's</reg><lb/>
                        old clothes, and cleared out, and I had been three nights coming the
                        thirty<lb/> miles; I traveled nights, and hid day-times and slept, and the
                        bag of bread and<lb/> meat I carried from home lasted me all the way and I
                        had a plenty. I said I<lb/> believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of
                        me, and so that was why I<lb/> struck out for this town of Goshen."</p>
                    <p>"Goshen, child? This ain't Goshen. This is St. Petersburg. Goshen's ten<lb/>
                        mile further up the river. Who told you this was Goshen?"</p>
                    <p>"Why, a man I met at day-break this morning, just as I was going to turn<lb/>
                        into the woods for my regular sleep. He told me when the roads forked I
                        must<lb/> take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen."</p>
                    <p>"He was drunk I reckon. He told you just exactly wrong."</p>
                    <p>"Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain't no matter now. I got to
                        be<lb/> moving along. I'll fetch Goshen before day-light."</p>
                    <p>"Hold on a minute. I'll put you up a snack to eat. You might want it."</p>
                    <p>So she put me up a snack, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Say&#x2014;when a cow's laying down, which end of her gets up first?
                        Answer<lb/> up prompt, now&#x2014;don't stop to study over it. Which end
                        gets up first?"</p>
                    <p>"The hind end, mum."</p>

                    <p>"Well, then, a horse?"</p>
                    <p>"The for'rard end, mum."</p>
                    <p>Which side of a tree does the most moss grow on?"</p>
                    <p>"North side."</p>
                    <p>"If fifteen cows is browsing on<lb/> a hillside, how many of them eats<lb/>

                        you,<lb/> child, when you set out to thread<lb/> a needle, don't hold the

                        poke the thread at it&#x2014;that's the way a woman most always<lb/>
                        does; but a man always does 'tother way. And when you throw at a rat or<lb/>
                        anything, hitch yourself up a tip-toe, and fetch your hand up over your head
                        as<lb/> awkard as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw
                        stiff-armed<lb/> from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to
                        turn on&#x2014;like a girl; not<lb/> from the wrist and elbow, with your
                        arm out to one side, like a boy. And mind<lb/> you, when a girl tries to
                        catch anything in her lap, she throws her knees apart:<lb/>
                        <pb n="91" entity="u000002472_0106"/> she don't clap them together, the way
                        you did when you catched the lump of<lb/> lead. Why, I spotted you for a boy
                        when you was threading the needle; and I<lb/> contrived the other things
                        just to make certain. Now trot along to your uncle,<lb/> Sarah Mary Williams
                        George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble you<lb/> send word to
                        Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what I can to get you<lb/> out
                        of it. Keep the river road, all the way, and next time you tramp, take
                        shoes<lb/> and socks with you. The river road's a rocky one, and your feet
                        'll be in a<lb/> condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon."</p>

                    <p>I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks
                        and<lb/> slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house. I
                        jumped in<lb/> and was off in a hurry. I went up stream far enough to make
                        the head of the<lb/> island, and then started across. I took off the
                        sun-bonnet, for I didn't want no<lb/> blinders on, then. When I was about
                        the middle, I hear the clock begin to<lb/> strike; so I stops and listens;
                        the sound come faint over the water, but clear&#x2014;<lb/> eleven. When
                        I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though I<lb/>
                        <pb n="92" entity="u000002472_0107"/> was most winded, but I shoved right
                        into the timber where my old camp used<lb/> to be, and started a good fire
                        there on a high-and-dry spot.</p>
                    <p>Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place a mile and a half<lb/>
                        below, as hard as I could go. I landed, and slopped through the timber
                        and<lb/> up the ridge and into the cavern. There Jim laid, sound asleep on
                        the ground.<lb/> I roused him out and says:</p>
                    <p>"Git up and hump yourself, Jim! There ain't a minute to lose. They're<lb/>
                        after us!"</p>
                    <p>Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he
                        worked<lb/> for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared. By
                        that time<lb/> everything we had in the world was on our raft and she was
                        ready to be shoved<lb/> out from the willow cove where she was hid. We put
                        out the camp fire at<lb/> the cavern the first thing, and didn't show a
                        candle outside after that.</p>
                    <p>I took the canoe out from shore a little piece and took a look, but if
                        there<lb/> was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and shadows ain't
                        good to see by.<lb/> Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the
                        shade, past the foot<lb/> of the island dead still, never saying a word.</p>

                        We laid there all day and watched the rafts and<lb/> steamboats spin down
                        the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the<lb/> big river in the
                        middle. I told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with<lb/> that woman;
                        and Jim said she was a smart one, and if she was to start after us<lb/>
                        herself <hi rend="italic">she</hi> wouldn't set down and watch a camp
                        fire&#x2014;no, sir, she'd fetch a<lb/> dog. Well, then, I said, why
                        couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog? Jim<lb/> said he bet she did
                        think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he<lb/> believed
                        they must a gone up town to get a dog and so they lost all that time,
                        or<lb/> else we wouldn't be here on a tow-head sixteen or seventeen mile
                        below the village<lb/> &#x2014;no, indeedy, we would be in that same old
                        town again. So I said I didn't care<lb/> what was the reason they didn't get
                        us, as long as they didn't.</p>
                    <p>When it was beginning to come on dark, we poked our heads out of the <reg
                            orig="cot-|tonwood">cottonwood</reg><lb/> thicket and looked up, and
                        down, and across; nothing in sight; so Jim<lb/> took up some of the top
                        planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under<lb/> in blazing
                        weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim made a floor for<lb/> the
                        wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft, so now
                        the<lb/> blankets and all the traps was out of the reach of steamboat waves.
                        Right in the<lb/> middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or
                        six inches deep with<lb/> a frame around it for to hold it to its place;
                        this was to build a fire on in sloppy<lb/> weather or chilly; the wigwam
                        would keep it from being seen. We made an <reg orig="ex-|tra"
                        >extra</reg><lb/> steering oar, too, because one of the others might get
                        broke, on a snag or<lb/> something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang
                        the old lantern on; <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg><lb/> we must always
                        light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down<lb/> stream, to
                        keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have to light it for <reg
                            orig="up-|stream">upstream</reg><lb/> boats unless we see we was in what
                        they call a "crossing;" for the river<lb/> was pretty high yet, very low
                        banks being still a little under water; so up-bound<lb/> boats didn't always
                        run the channel, but hunted easy water.</p>
                    <p>This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current
                        that<lb/> was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish, and talked,
                        and we took a<lb/> swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of
                        solemn, drifting down<lb/> the big still river, laying on our backs looking
                        up at the stars, and we didn't<lb/> ever feel like talking loud, and it
                        warn't often that we laughed, only a little<lb/>
                        <pb n="95" entity="u000002472_0110"/> kind of a low chuckle. We had mighty
                        good weather, as a general thing, and <reg orig="noth-|ing"
                        >nothing</reg><lb/> ever happened to us at all, that night, nor the next,
                        nor the next.</p>
                    <p>Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, <reg
                            orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg><lb/> but just a shiny bed of lights, not
                        a house could you see. The fifth night<lb/> we passed St. Louis, and it was
                        like the whole world lit up. In St. Petersburg<lb/> they used to say there
                        was twenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis, but I<lb/> never believed
                        it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two o'clock that still<lb/>
                        night. There warn't a sound there; everybody was asleep.</p>
                    <p>Every night, now, I used to slip ashore, towards ten o'clock, at some
                        little<lb/> village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or
                        other stuff to eat;<lb/> and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't
                        roosting comfortable, and took him<lb/> along. Pap always said, take a<lb/>
                        chicken when you get a chance,<lb/> because if you don't want him<lb/>
                        yourself you can easy find <reg orig="some-|body">somebody</reg><lb/> that
                        does, and a good deed<lb/> ain't ever forgot. I never see<lb/> pap when he
                        didn't want the<lb/> chicken himself, but that is what<lb/> he used to say,
                        anyway.</p>

                    <p>Mornings, before daylight, I<lb/> slipped into corn fields and <reg
                            orig="bor-|rowed">borrowed</reg><lb/> a watermelon, or a <reg
                            orig="mush-|melon">mushmelon</reg>,<lb/> or a punkin, or some<lb/> new
                        corn, or things of that kind.<lb/> Pap always said it warn't no<lb/> harm to
                        borrow things, if you<lb/> was meaning to pay them back,<lb/> sometime; but
                        the widow said<lb/> it warn't anything but a soft<lb/> name for stealing,
                        and no decent<lb/> body would do it. Jim said he reckoned the widow was
                        partly right and pap<lb/> was partly right; so the best way would be for us
                        to pick out two or three<lb/>
                        <pb n="96" entity="u000002472_0111"/> things from the list and say we
                        wouldn't borrow them any more&#x2014;then he reckoned<lb/> it wouldn't
                        be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it over all one night,<lb/>
                        drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds whether to drop
                        the<lb/> watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons, or what. But
                        towards <reg orig="day-|light">daylight</reg><lb/> we got it all settled
                        satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and<lb/> p'simmons. We warn't
                        feeling just right, before that, but it was all comfortable<lb/> now. I was
                        glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good,<lb/> and
                        the p'simmons wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.</p>
                    <p>We shot a water-fowl, now and then, that got up too early in the morning
                        or<lb/> didn't go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all around, we
                        lived pretty<lb/> high.</p>
                    <p>The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with
                        a<lb/> power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid
                        sheet. We<lb/> stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.
                        When the lightning<lb/> glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,
                        and high rocky bluffs on both<lb/> sides. By-and-by says I, "Hel-<hi
                            rend="italic">lo,</hi> Jim, looky yonder!" It was a steamboat that<lb/>
                        had killed herself on a rock. We was drifting straight down for her. The
                        lightning<lb/> showed her very distinct. She was leaning over, with part of
                        her upper deck<lb/> above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy
                        clean and clear, and a<lb/> chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat
                        hanging on the back of it when the<lb/> flashes come.</p>
                    <p>Well, it being away in the night, and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,
                        I<lb/> felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck
                        laying<lb/> there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. I
                        wanted to<lb/> get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what
                        there was there. So<lb/> I says:</p>
                    <p>"Le's land on her, Jim."</p>
                    <p>But Jim was dead against it, at first. He says:</p>
                    <p>"I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack. We's doin' blame' well, en
                        we<lb/> better let blame' well alone, as de good book says. Like as not
                        dey's a watchman<lb/> on dat wrack.'</p>
                    <p>"Watchman your grandmother," I says; "there ain't nothing to watch but<lb/>
                        the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody's going to resk his<lb/>
                        <pb n="97" entity="u000002472_0112"/> life for a texas and a pilot-house
                        such a night as this, when it's likely to break up<lb/> and wash off down
                        the river any minute?" Jim couldn't say nothing to that,<lb/> so he didn't
                        try. "And besides," I says, "we might borrow something worth<lb/> having,
                        out of the captain's stateroom. Scegars, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> bet
                        you&#x2014;and cost five cents<lb/> apiece, solid cash. Steamboat
                        captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a<lb/> month, and <hi
                            rend="italic">they</hi> don't care a cent what a thing costs, you know,
                        long as they<lb/> want it. Stick a candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim,
                        till we give her a<lb/> rummaging. Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by
                        this thing? Not<lb/> for pie, he wouldn't. He'd call it an
                        adventure&#x2014;that's what he'd call it;<lb/> and he'd land on that
                        wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn't he throw<lb/> style into
                        it?&#x2014;wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing? Why, you'd think
                        it<lb/> was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come. I wish Tom Sawyer<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">was</hi> here."</p>
                    <p>Jim he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn't talk any more<lb/>
                        than we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning showed us
                        the<lb/> wreck again, just in time, and we fetched the starboard derrick,
                        and made<lb/> fast there.</p>
                    <p>The deck was high out, here. We went sneaking down the slope of it to<lb/>
                        labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our
                        feet, and<lb/> spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so
                        dark we couldn't see<lb/> no sign of them. Pretty soon we struck the forward
                        end of the skylight, and<lb/> clumb onto it; and the next step fetched us in
                        front of the captain's door, which<lb/> was open, and by Jimminy, away down
                        through the texas-hall we see a light!<lb/> and all in the same second we
                        seem to hear low voices in yonder!</p>
                    <p>Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come<lb/>
                        along. I says, all right; and was going to start for the raft; but just then
                        I<lb/> heard a voice wail out and say:</p>
                    <p>"Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!"</p>
                    <p>Another voice said, pretty loud:</p>
                    <p>"It's a lie, Jim Turner. You've acted this way before. You always want<lb/>
                        more'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too, because
                        you've<lb/> swore't if you didn't you'd tell. But this time you've said it
                        jest one time too<lb/> many. You're the meanest, treacherousest hound in
                        this country."</p>
                    <pb n="98" entity="u000002472_0113"/>
                    <p>By this time Jim was gone for the raft. I was just a-biling with
                        curiosity;<lb/> and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now, and
                        so I won't either;<lb/> I'm agoing to see what's going on here. So I dropped
                        on my hands and knees,<lb/> in the little passage, and crept aft in the
                        dark, till there warn't but about one<lb/> stateroom betwixt me and the
                        cross-hall of the texas. Then, in there I see a man<lb/> stretched on the
                        floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him,<lb/> and one of
                        them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.<lb/>
                        This one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor and
                        saying&#x2014;</p>

                        long's<lb/> I live!" says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.</p>
                    <p>Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail,
                        and<lb/> started towards where I was, there in the dark, and motioned Bill
                        to come. I<lb/> crawfished as fast as I could, about two yards, but the boat
                        slanted so that I<lb/> couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting
                        run over and catched I<lb/> crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. The
                        man come a-pawing along in<lb/> the dark, and when Packard got to my
                        stateroom, he says:</p>
                    <p>"Here&#x2014;come in here."</p>
                    <p>And in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in, I was up in
                        the<lb/> upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there,
                        with their<lb/> hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn't see
                        them, but I could<lb/> tell where they was, by the whisky they'd been
                        having. I was glad I didn't<lb/> drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much
                        difference, anyway, because most of<lb/> the time they couldn't a treed me
                        because I didn't breathe. I was too scared. And<lb/> besides, a body <hi
                            rend="italic">couldn't</hi> breathe, and hear such talk. They talked low
                        and earnest.<lb/> Bill wanted to kill Turner. He says:</p>
                    <p>"He's said he'll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our shares to him<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, it wouldn't make no difference after the row,
                        and the way we've served him.<lb/> Shore's you're born, he'll turn State's
                        evidence; now you hear <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. I'm for <reg

                    <p>"So'm I," says Packard, very quiet.</p>
                    <p>"Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't. Well, then, that's all
                        right.<lb/> Les' go and do it."</p>
                    <p>"Hold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit. You listen to me. Shooting's<lb/>
                        good, but there's quieter ways if the thing's <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to
                        be done. But what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> say, is<lb/> this; it ain't good
                        sense to go court'n around after a halter, if you can git at<lb/>
                        <pb n="100" entity="u000002472_0115"/> what you're up to in some way that's
                        jist as good and at the same time don't bring<lb/> you into no resks. Ain't
                        that so?"</p>
                    <p>"You bet it is. But how you goin' to manage it this time?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, my idea is this: we'll rustle around and gether up whatever pickins
                        we've<lb/> overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide the
                        truck. Then<lb/> we'll wait. Now I say it ain't agoin' to be more 'n two
                        hours befo' this wrack<lb/> breaks up and washes off down the river. See?
                        He'll be drownded, and won't<lb/> have nobody to blame for it but his own
                        self. I reckon that's a considerble sight<lb/> better'n killin' of him. I'm
                        unfavorable to killin'a man as long as you can git<lb/> around it; it ain't
                        good sense, it ain't good morals. Ain't I right?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes&#x2014;I reck'n you are.<lb/> But s'pose she <hi rend="italic"
                            >don't</hi> break<lb/> up and wash off?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, we can wait the<lb/> two hours, anyway, and see,<lb/> can't we?"</p>
                    <p>"All right, then; come<lb/> along."</p>
                    <p>So they started, and I lit<lb/> out, all in a cold sweat, and<lb/> scrambled
                        forward. It was<lb/> dark as pitch there; but I<lb/> said in a kind of a
                        coarse<lb/> whisper, "Jim!" and he<lb/> answered up, right at my<lb/> elbow,
                        with a sort of a moan,<lb/> and I says:</p>

                        to be sentimentering. We'd <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to<lb/> find that
                        boat, now&#x2014;had to have it for<lb/> ourselves. So we went a quaking

                        too&#x2014;seemed a week<lb/> before we got to the stern. No sign
                        of<lb/> a boat. Jim said he didn't believe he<lb/> could go any
                        further&#x2014;so scared he<lb/> hadn't hardly any strength left, he
                        said.<lb/> But I said come on, if we get left on this<lb/> wreck, we are in
                        a fix, sure. So on we<lb/> prowled, again. We struck for the<lb/> stern of
                        the texas, and found it, and<lb/> then scrabbled along forwards on the<lb/>
                        skylight, hanging on from shutter to<lb/> shutter, for the edge of the
                        skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close<lb/> to the cross-hall
                        door, there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely see<lb/> her. I
                        felt ever so thankful. In another second I would a been aboard of her;<lb/>
                        but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his head out, only about
                        a<lb/> couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in
                        again,<lb/> and says:</p>

                    <p>"Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!"</p>
                    <p>He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself, and set<lb/>
                        <pb n="103" entity="u000002472_0118"/> down. It was Packard. Then Bill <hi
                            rend="italic">he</hi> come out and got in. Packard says, in a<lb/> low
                        voice:</p>
                    <p>"All ready&#x2014;shove off!"</p>
                    <p>I couldn't hardly hang onto the shutters, I was so weak. But Bill says:</p>
                    <p>"Hold on&#x2014;'d you go through him?"</p>
                    <p>"No. Didn't you?"</p>
                    <p>"No. So he's got his share o' the cash, yet."</p>
                    <p>"Well, then, come along&#x2014;no use to take truck and leave money."</p>
                    <p>"Say&#x2014;won't he suspicion what we're up to?"</p>
                    <p>"Maybe he won't. But we got to have it anyway. Come along."</p>
                    <p>So they got out and went in.</p>
                    <p>The door slammed to, because it was on the careened side; and in a half<lb/>
                        second I was in the boat, and Jim come a tumbling after me. I out with
                        my<lb/> knife and cut the rope, and away we went!</p>
                    <p>We didn't touch an oar, and we didn' speak nor whisper, nor hardly even<lb/>
                        breathe. We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the <reg
                            orig="paddle-|box">paddlebox</reg>,<lb/> and past the stern; then in a
                        second or two more we was a hundred yards<lb/> below the wreck, and the
                        darkness soaked her up, every last sign of her, and<lb/> we was safe, and
                        knowed it.</p>
                    <p>When we was three or four hundred yards down stream, we see the lantern<lb/>
                        show like a little spark at the texas door, for a second, and we knowed by
                        that<lb/> that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to
                        understand that they<lb/> was in just as much trouble, now, as Jim Turner
                        was.</p>
                    <p>Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft. Now was the
                        first<lb/> time that I begun to worry about the men&#x2014;I reckon I
                        hadn't had time to before.<lb/> I begun to think how dreadful it was, even
                        for murderers, to be in such a fix. I<lb/> says to myself, there ain't no
                        telling but I might come to be a murderer myself,<lb/> yet, and then how
                        would <hi rend="italic">I</hi> like it? So says I to Jim:</p>
                    <p>"The first light we see, we'll land a hundred yards below it or above it, in
                        a<lb/> place where it's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and then
                        I'll go and<lb/> fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for that
                        gang and get them<lb/> out of their scrape, so they can be hung when their
                        time comes."</p>
                    <p>But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again, and this<lb/>
                        <pb n="104" entity="u000002472_0119"/> time worse than ever. The rain poured
                        down, and never a light showed; <reg orig="every-|body">everybody</reg><lb/>
                        in bed, I reckon. We boomed along down the river, watching for lights
                        and<lb/> watching for our raft. After a long time the rain let up, but the
                        clouds staid,<lb/> and the lightning kept whimpering, and by-and-by a flash
                        showed us a black<lb/> thing ahead, floating, and we made for it.</p>

                        a<lb/> light, now, away down to the right, on shore. So I said I would go
                        for it. The skiff<lb/> was half full of plunder which that gang had stole,
                        there on the wreck. We hustled<lb/> it onto the raft in a pile, and I told
                        Jim to float along down, and show a light<lb/> when he judged he had gone
                        about two mile, and keep it burning till I come;<lb/> then I manned my oars
                        and shoved for the light. As I got down towards it, three<lb/> or four more
                        showed&#x2014;up on a hillside. It was a village. I closed in above

                        it was a lantern<lb/> hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferry-boat.
                        I skimmed around for the<lb/> watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept;

                    <p>"Yes," he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like. "I'm the captain and

                    <p>"Well, they didn't go there a-purpose."</p>
                    <p>"I bet they didn't! Why, great goodness, there ain't no chance for 'em if<lb/>

                    <p>"Easy enough. Miss Hooker was a-visiting, up there to the

                    <p>"Yes, Booth's Landing&#x2014;go on."</p>
                    <p>"She was a-visiting, there at Booth's Landing, and just in the edge of
                        the<lb/> evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry,
                        to stay all<lb/> night at her friend's house, Miss What-you-may-call-her, I
                        disremember her<lb/> name, and they lost their steering-oar, and swung
                        around and went a-floating<lb/> down, stern-first, about two mile, and
                        saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferry<lb/> man and the nigger woman and
                        the horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she<lb/> made a grab and got aboard
                        the wreck. Well, about an hour after dark, we<lb/> come along down in our
                        trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn't notice the<lb/> wreck till we was

                    <p>"My George! It's the beatenest thing I ever struck. And <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>"Well, we hollered and took on, but it's so wide there, we couldn't make<lb/>
                        nobody hear. So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help
                        somehow.<lb/> I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it,
                        and Miss Hooker<lb/> she said if I didn't strike help sooner, come here and
                        hunt up her uncle, and he'd<lb/> fix the thing. I made the land about a mile
                        below, and been fooling along ever<lb/> since, trying to get people to do
                        something, but they said, "What, in such a night<lb/> and such a current?
                        there ain't no sense in it; go for the steam-ferry.' Now if<lb/> you'll go,

                    <p>"By Jackson, I'd <hi rend="italic">like</hi> to, and blame it I don't know

                    <p>"Why <hi rend="italic">that's</hi> all right. Miss Hooker she told me, <hi

                        and about a quarter<lb/> of a mile out you'll come to the tavern; tell 'em

                        <pb n="107" entity="u000002472_0122"/> want to know the news. Tell him I'll
                        have his niece all safe before he can<lb/> get to town. Hump yourself, now;
                        I'm agoing up around the corner here, to<lb/> roust out my engineer."</p>
                    <p>I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back<lb/>
                        and got into my skiff and bailed her out and then pulled up shore in<lb/>
                        the easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among some<lb/>
                        woodboats; for I couldn't rest easy till I could see the ferry-boat start.
                        But<lb/> take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of
                        taking all<lb/> this trouble for that gang, for not many would a done it. I
                        wished the<lb/> widow knowed about it. I judged she would be proud of me for
                        helping<lb/> these rapscallions, because rapscallions and dead beats is the
                        kind the widow<lb/> and good people takes the most interest in.</p>

                        her. She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn't much chance<lb/>
                        for anybody being alive in her. I pulled all around her and hollered a
                        little,<lb/> but there wasn't any answer; all dead still. I felt a little
                        bit heavy-hearted<lb/> about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they

                    <p>Then here comes the ferry-boat; so I shoved for the middle of the river<lb/>
                        on a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach,
                        I<lb/> laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the

                        uncle<lb/> Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferry-boat
                        give it up<lb/> and went for shore, and I laid into my work and went

                        twenty yards. I jumped into the<lb/> canoe and run back to the stern and
                        grabbed the paddle and set her back a<lb/> stroke. But she didn't come. I
                        was in such a hurry I hadn't untied her.<lb/> I got up and tried to untie
                        her, but I was so excited my hands shook so I<lb/> couldn't hardly do

                    <p>As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right<lb/>
                        <pb n="116" entity="u000002472_0131"/> down the tow-head. That was all right
                        as far as it went, but the tow-head<lb/> warn't sixty yards long, and the
                        minute I flew by the foot of it I shot out<lb/> into the solid white fog,
                        and hadn't no more idea which way I was going<lb/> than a dead man.</p>
                    <p>Thinks I, it won't do to paddle; first I know I'll run into the bank or
                        a<lb/> tow-head or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it's
                        mighty fidgety<lb/> business to have to hold your hands still at such a
                        time. I whooped and<lb/> listened. Away down there, somewheres, I hears a
                        small whoop, and up<lb/> comes my spirits. I went tearing after it,
                        listening sharp to hear it again.<lb/> The next time it come, I see I warn't
                        heading for it but heading away to the right<lb/> of it. And the next time,
                        I was heading away to the left of it&#x2014;and not gaining<lb/> on it
                        much, either, for I was flying around, this way and that and 'tother, but
                        it<lb/> was going straight ahead all the time.</p>
                    <p>I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the
                        time,<lb/> but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops
                        that was making<lb/> the trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and directly
                        I hears the whoop<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">behind</hi> me. I was tangled good, now. That was somebody
                        else's whoop, or<lb/> else I was turned around.</p>
                    <p>I throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoop again; it was behind me<lb/>
                        yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its place,
                        and I<lb/> kept answering, till by-and-by it was in front of me again and I
                        knowed the <reg orig="cur-|rent">current</reg><lb/> had swung the canoe's
                        head down stream and I was all right, if that was Jim<lb/> and not some
                        other raftsman hollering. I couldn't tell nothing about voices in a<lb/>
                        fog, for nothing don't look natural nor sound natural in a fog.</p>
                    <p>The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a booming down on a<lb/>
                        cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed me
                        off<lb/> to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared,
                        the current was<lb/> tearing by them so swift.</p>
                    <p>In another second or two it was solid white and still again. I set
                        perfectly<lb/> still, then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I
                        didn't draw a breath<lb/> while it thumped a hundred.</p>
                    <p>I just give up, then. I knowed what the matter was. That cut bank was<lb/> an
                        island, and Jim had gone down 'tother side of it. It warn't no tow-head, that<lb/>
                        <pb n="117" entity="u000002472_0132"/> you could float by in ten minutes. It
                        had the big timber of a regular island;<lb/> it might be five or six mile
                        long and more than a half a mile wide.</p>
                    <p>I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I
                        was<lb/> floating along, of course, four or five mile an hour; but you don't
                        ever think of<lb/> that. No, you <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> like you are
                        laying dead still on the water; and if a little<lb/> glimpse of a snag slips
                        by, you don't think to yourself how fast <hi rend="italic">you're</hi>
                        going, but<lb/> you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag's tearing
                        along. If you<lb/> think it ain't dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way,
                        by yourself, in the<lb/> night, you try it once&#x2014;you'll see.</p>

                        it, and directly I<lb/> judged I'd got into a nest of tow-heads, for I had
                        little dim glimpses of them on<lb/> both sides of me, sometimes just a
                        narrow channel between; and some that I<lb/> couldn't see, I knowed was
                        there, because I'd hear the wash of the current against<lb/> the old dead
                        brush and trash that hung over the banks. Well, I warn't long<lb/> losing
                        the whoops, down amongst the tow-heads; and I only tried to chase them<lb/>
                        <pb n="118" entity="u000002472_0133"/> a little while, anyway, because it
                        was worse than chasing a Jack-o-lantern. You<lb/> never knowed a sound dodge

                    <p>I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively, four or five times, to
                        keep<lb/> from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the
                        raft must be <reg orig="but-|ting">butting</reg><lb/> into the bank every
                        now and then, or else it would get further ahead and<lb/> clear out of
                        hearing&#x2014;it was floating a little faster than what I was.</p>
                    <p>Well, I seemed to be in the open river again, by-and-by, but I couldn't
                        hear<lb/> no sign of a whoop nowheres. I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a
                        snag, maybe,<lb/> and it was all up with him. I was good and tired, so I
                        laid down in the canoe<lb/> and said I wouldn't bother no more. I didn't
                        want to go to sleep, of course; but<lb/> I was so sleepy I couldn't help it;
                        so I thought I would take just one little<lb/> cat-nap.</p>

                    <p>But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars
                        was<lb/> shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a big
                        bend stern<lb/> first. First I didn't know where I was; I thought I was
                        dreaming; and when<lb/> things begun to come back to me, they seemed to come
                        up dim out of last<lb/> week.</p>
                    <pb n="119" entity="u000002472_0134"/>
                    <p>It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest kind
                        of<lb/> timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see, by
                        the stars. I<lb/> looked away down stream, and seen a black speck on the
                        water. I took out after<lb/> it; but when I got to it it warn't nothing but
                        a couple of saw-logs made fast<lb/> together. Then I see another speck, and
                        chased that; then another, and this<lb/> time I was right. It was the
                        raft.</p>
                    <p>When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his
                        knees,<lb/> asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering oar. The
                        other oar was<lb/> smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and
                        branches and dirt. So<lb/> she'd had a rough time.</p>
                    <p>I made fast and laid down under Jim's nose on the raft, and begun to
                        gap,<lb/> and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Hello, Jim, have I been asleep? Why didn't you stir me up?"</p>
                    <p>"Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? En you ain' dead&#x2014;you ain'

                    <p>"Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?"</p>

                    <p>"No, I didn't. What tow-head? I hain't seen no tow-head."</p>

                    <p>"Well, this is too many for me, Jim. I hain't seen no fog, nor no
                        islands,<lb/> nor no troubles, nor nothing. I been setting here talking with
                        you all night till<lb/> you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I
                        reckon I done the same. You<lb/> couldn't a got drunk in that time, so of
                        course you've been dreaming."</p>
                    <p>"Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn't any of it
                        happen."</p>
                    <p>"But Huck, it's all jis' as plain to me as&#x2014;"</p>
                    <p>"It don't make no difference how plain it is, there ain't nothing in it.
                        I<lb/> know, because I've been here all the time."</p>
                    <p>Jim didn't say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying over
                        it.<lb/> Then he says:</p>
                    <p>"Well, den, I reck'n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain't
                        de<lb/> powerfullest dream I ever see. En I hain't ever had no dream b'fo'
                        dat's tired<lb/> me like dis one."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, well, that's all right, because a dream does tire a body like
                        everything,<lb/> sometimes. But this one was a staving dream&#x2014;tell
                        me all about it, Jim."</p>
                    <p>So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as
                        it<lb/> happened, only he painted it up considerable. Then he said he must
                        start in<lb/> and "'terpret" it, because it was sent for a warning. He said
                        the first tow-head<lb/> stood for a man that would try to do us some good,
                        but the current was another<lb/> man that would get us away from him. The
                        whoops was warnings that would<lb/> come to us every now and then, and if we
                        didn't try hard to make out to <reg orig="under-|stand"
                        >understand</reg><lb/> them they'd just take us into bad luck, 'stead of
                        keeping us out of it.<lb/> The lot of tow-heads was troubles we was going to
                        get into with quarrelsome<lb/>
                        <pb n="121" entity="u000002472_0136"/> people and all kinds of mean folks,
                        but if we minded our business and didn't<lb/> talk back and aggravate them,
                        we would pull through and get out of the fog and<lb/> into the big clear
                        river, which was the free States, and wouldn't have no more<lb/>
                        trouble.</p>
                    <p>It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got onto the raft, but it was<lb/>
                        clearing up again, now.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, well, that's all interpreted well enough, as far as it goes, Jim," I
                        says;<lb/> "but what does <hi rend="italic">these</hi> things stand
                        for?"</p>
                    <p>It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft, and the smashed oar. You
                        could<lb/> see them first rate, now.</p>
                    <p>Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash
                        again.<lb/> He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he
                        couldn't seem to shake<lb/> it loose and get the facts back into its place
                        again, right away. But when he<lb/> did get the thing straightened around,
                        he looked at me steady, without ever<lb/> smiling, and says:</p>
                    <p>"What do dey stan' for? I's gwyne to tell you. When I got all wore out<lb/>
                        wid work, en wid de callin' for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz mos'
                        broke<lb/> bekase you wuz los', en I didn' k'yer no mo' what become er me en

                        de tears come en I<lb/> could a got down on my knees en kiss' yo' foot I's
                        so thankful. En all you wuz<lb/> thinkin 'bout wuz how you could make a fool
                        uv ole Jim wid a lie. Dat truck<lb/> dah is <hi rend="italic">trash;</hi> en
                        trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren's<lb/> en makes
                        'em ashamed."</p>
                    <p>Then he got up slow, and walked to the wigwam, and went in there,
                        without<lb/> saying anything but that. But that was enough. It made me feel
                        so mean I<lb/> could almost kissed <hi rend="italic">his</hi> foot to get
                        him to take it back.</p>
                    <p>It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble<lb/>
                        myself to a nigger&#x2014;but I done it, and I warn't ever sorry for it
                        afterwards,<lb/> neither. I didn't do him no more mean tricks, and I
                        wouldn't done that one if<lb/> I'd a knowed it would make him feel that
                        way.</p>

                    <p>We went drifting down into a big<lb/> bend, and the night clouded up and<lb/>
                        got hot. The river was very wide, and<lb/> was walled with solid timber on
                        both<lb/> sides; you couldn't see a break in it<lb/> hardly ever, or a
                        light. We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would<lb/> know it
                        when we got to it. I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say<lb/>
                        there warn't but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to
                        have<lb/> them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? Jim
                        said if the<lb/> two big rivers joined together there, that would show. But
                        I said maybe we<lb/> might think we was passing the foot of an island and
                        coming into the same old<lb/> river again. That disturbed Jim&#x2014;and
                        me too. So the question was, what to<lb/> do? I said, paddle ashore the
                        first time a light showed, and tell them pap was<lb/> behind, coming along
                        with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business,<lb/>
                        <pb n="123" entity="u000002472_0138"/> and wanted to know how far it was to
                        Cairo. Jim thought it was a good idea,<lb/> so we took a smoke on it and
                        waited.</p>
                    <p>There warn't nothing to do, now, but to look out sharp for the town, and
                        not<lb/> pass it without seeing it. He said he'd be mighty sure to see it,
                        because he'd be<lb/> a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it
                        he'd be in the slave country<lb/> again and no more show for freedom. Every
                        little while he jumps up and says:</p>
                    <p>"Dah she is!"</p>
                    <p>But it warn't. It was Jack-o-lanterns, or lightning-bugs; so he set down<lb/>
                        again, and went to watching, same as before. Jim said it made him all
                        over<lb/> trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can tell
                        you it made me<lb/> all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because
                        I begun to get it through<lb/> my head that he <hi rend="italic">was</hi>
                        most free&#x2014;and who was to blame for it? Why, <hi rend="italic"

                        way. It got to troubling<lb/> me so I couldn't rest; I couldn't stay still
                        in one place. It hadn't ever come<lb/> home to me before, what this thing
                        was that I was doing. But now it did; and<lb/> it staid with me, and
                        scorched me more and more. I tried to make out to<lb/> myself that <hi
                            rend="italic">I</hi> warn't to blame, because <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
                        didn't run Jim off from his rightful<lb/> owner; but it warn't no use,
                        conscience up and says, every time, "But you<lb/> knowed he was running for
                        his freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and told<lb/> somebody." That
                        was so&#x2014;I couldn't get around that, noway. That was where<lb/> it
                        pinched. Conscience says to me, "What had poor Miss Watson done to you,<lb/>
                        that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say
                        one<lb/> single word? What did that poor old woman do to you, that you could
                        treat<lb/> her so mean? Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to
                        learn you<lb/> your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she
                        knowed how. <hi rend="italic">That's</hi><lb/> what she done."</p>
                    <p>I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. I<lb/>
                        fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was
                        fidgeting<lb/> up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still. Every
                        time he danced<lb/> around and says, "Dah's Cairo!" it went through me like
                        a shot, and I thought<lb/> if it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> Cairo I reckoned
                        I would die of miserableness.</p>
                    <p>Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was
                        saying<lb/> how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he
                        would go to<lb/>
                        <pb n="124" entity="u000002472_0139"/> saving up money and never spend a
                        single cent, and when he got enough he<lb/> would buy his wife, which was
                        owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson<lb/> lived; and then they would
                        both work to buy the two children, and if their<lb/> master wouldn't sell
                        them, they'd get an Ab'litionist to go and steal them.</p>
                    <p>It most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn't ever dared to talk such
                        talk<lb/> in his life before. Just see what a difference it made in him the
                        minute he judged<lb/> he was about free. It was according to the old saying,
                        "give a nigger an inch and<lb/> he'll take an ell." Thinks I, this is what
                        comes of my not thinking. Here was this<lb/> nigger which I had as good as
                        helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed<lb/> and saying he would
                        steal his children&#x2014;children that belonged to a man I didn't<lb/>
                        even know; a man that hadn't ever done me no harm.</p>
                    <p>I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. My<lb/>
                        conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to
                        it, "Let<lb/> up on me&#x2014;it ain't too late, yet&#x2014;I'll
                        paddle ashore at the first light, and tell." I<lb/> felt easy, and happy,
                        and light as a feather, right off. All my troubles was gone.<lb/> I went to
                        looking out sharp for a light, and sort of singing to myself. By-<reg
                            orig="and-|by">andby</reg><lb/> one showed. Jim sings out:</p>
                    <p>"We's safe, Huck, we's safe! Jump up and crack yo' heels, dat's de good<lb/>
                        ole Cairo at las', I jis knows it!"</p>
                    <p>I says:</p>
                    <p>"I'll take the canoe and go see, Jim. It mightn't be, you know."</p>
                    <p>He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom
                        for<lb/> me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"Pooty soon I'll be a-shout'n for joy, en I'll say, it's all on accounts o'
                        Huck;<lb/> I's a free man, en I couldn't ever ben free ef it hadn' ben for
                        Huck; Huck done<lb/> it. Jim won't ever forgit you, Huck; you's de bes'
                        fren' Jim's ever had; en<lb/> you's de <hi rend="italic">only</hi> fren' ole
                        Jim's got now."</p>
                    <p>I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says this,
                        it<lb/> seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. I went along slow
                        then, and I<lb/> warn't right down certain whether I was glad I started or
                        whether I warn't. When<lb/> I was fifty yards off, Jim says:</p>
                    <p>"Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on'y white genlman dat ever kep' his<lb/>
                        promise to ole Jim."</p>
                    <pb n="125" entity="u000002472_0140"/>
                    <p>Well, I just felt sick. But I says, I <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to do
                        it&#x2014;I can't get <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of it. Right<lb/> then,
                        along comes a skiff with two men in it, with guns, and they stopped and
                        I<lb/> stopped. One of them says:</p>
                    <p>"What's that, yonder?"</p>
                    <p>"A piece of a raft," I says.</p>
                    <p>"Do you belong on it?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
                    <p>"Any men on it?"</p>
                    <p>"Only one, sir."</p>
                    <p>"Well, there's five niggers run off to-night, up yonder above the head
                        of<lb/> the bend. Is your man white or black?"</p>
                    <p>I didn't answer up prompt. I tried to, but the words wouldn't come.<lb/> I
                        tried, for a second or two, to brace up and out with it, but I warn't
                        man<lb/> enough&#x2014;hadn't the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was
                        weakening; so I just give up<lb/> trying, and up and says&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"He's white."</p>
                    <p>"I reckon we'll go and see for ourselves."</p>
                    <p>"I wish you would," says I, "because it's pap that's there, and maybe
                        you'd<lb/> help me tow the raft ashore where the light is. He's
                        sick&#x2014;and so is mam and<lb/> Mary Ann."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, the devil! we're in a hurry, boy. But I s'pose we've got to.
                        Come&#x2014;<lb/> buckle to your paddle, and let's get along."</p>
                    <p>I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. When we had made a<lb/>
                        stroke or two, I says:</p>
                    <p>"Pap'll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. Everybody goes
                        away<lb/> when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can't do it
                        by myself."</p>
                    <p>"Well, that's infernal mean. Odd, too. Say, boy, what's the matter with<lb/>
                        your father?"</p>
                    <p>"It's the&#x2014;a&#x2014;the&#x2014;well, it ain't anything,
                        much."</p>
                    <p>They stopped pulling. It warn't but a mighty little ways to the raft,
                        now.<lb/> One says:</p>
                    <p>"Boy, that's a lie. What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the matter with your pap?
                        Answer up square,<lb/> now, and it'll be the better for you."</p>

                        right and ain't no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is<lb/> just the same?
                        I was stuck. I couldn't answer that. So I reckoned I wouldn't<lb/> bother no

                        time.</p>
                    <p>I went into the wigwam; Jim warn't there. I looked all around; he<lb/> warn't
                        anywhere. I says:</p>
                    <p>"Jim!"</p>
                    <p>"Here I is, Huck. Is dey out o' sight yit? Don't talk loud."</p>
                    <p>He was in the river, under the stern oar, with just his nose out. I told
                        him<lb/> they was out of sight, so he come aboard. He says:</p>
                    <p>"I was a-listenin' to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne

                        for dat, honey."</p>
                    <p>Then we talked about the money. It was a pretty good raise, twenty
                        dollars<lb/> apiece. Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now,
                        and the<lb/> money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free
                        States. He said twenty<lb/> mile more warn't far for the raft to go, but he
                        wished we was already there.</p>
                    <p>Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding<lb/>
                        the raft good. Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and getting
                        all<lb/> ready to quit rafting.</p>
                    <p>That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down<lb/>
                        in a left-hand bend.</p>
                    <p>I went off in the canoe, to ask about it. Pretty soon I found a man out
                        in<lb/> the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. I ranged up and
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"Mister, is that town Cairo?"</p>
                    <p>"Cairo? no. You must be a blame' fool."</p>
                    <pb n="129" entity="u000002472_0144"/>
                    <p>"What town is it, mister?"</p>
                    <p>"If you want to know, go and find out. If you stay here botherin' around<lb/>
                        me for about a half a minute longer, you'll get something you won't
                        want."</p>
                    <p>I paddled to the raft. Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never
                        mind,<lb/> Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.</p>
                    <p>We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but
                        it<lb/> was high ground, so I didn't go. No high ground about Cairo, Jim
                        said. I had<lb/> forgot it. We laid up for the day, on a tow-head tolerable
                        close to the left-hand<lb/> bank. I begun to suspicion something. So did
                        Jim. I says:</p>
                    <p>"Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night."</p>
                    <p>He says:</p>
                    <p>"Doan' less' talk about it, Huck. Po' niggers can't have no luck. I
                        awluz<lb/> 'spected dat rattle-snake skin warn't done wid it's work."</p>
                    <p>"I wish I'd never seen that snake-skin, Jim&#x2014;I do wish I'd never
                        laid eyes<lb/> on it."</p>
                    <p>"It ain't yo' fault, Huck; you didn' know. Don't you blame yo'self<lb/> 'bout
                        it."</p>
                    <p>When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water in shore, sure<lb/>
                        enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy! So it was all up with
                        Cairo.</p>
                    <p>We talked it all over. It wouldn't do to take to the shore; we couldn't
                        take<lb/> the raft up the stream, of course. There warn't no way but to wait
                        for dark,<lb/> and start back in the canoe and take the chances. So we slept
                        all day amongst<lb/> the cotton-wood thicket, so as to be fresh for the
                        work, and when we went back<lb/> to the raft about dark the canoe was
                        gone!</p>
                    <p>We didn't say a word for a good while. There warn't anything to say. We<lb/>
                        both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattle-snake skin;
                        so<lb/> what was the use to talk about it? It would only look like we was
                        finding fault,<lb/> and that would be bound to fetch more bad
                        luck&#x2014;and keep on fetching it, too,<lb/> till we knowed enough to
                        keep still.</p>
                    <p>By-and-by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn't no
                        way<lb/> but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy
                        a canoe to go<lb/> back in. We warn't going to borrow it when there warn't
                        anybody around, the<lb/> way pap would do, for that might set people after
                        us.</p>
                    <pb n="130" entity="u000002472_0145"/>
                    <p>So we shoved out, after dark, on the raft.</p>
                    <p>Anybody that don't believe yet, that it's foolishness to handle a
                        snake-skin,<lb/> after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it
                        now, if they read on and<lb/> see what more it done for us.</p>
                    <p>The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. But we didn't
                        see<lb/> no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and more.
                        Well, the<lb/> night got gray, and ruther thick, which is the next meanest
                        thing to fog. You<lb/> can't tell the shape of the river, and you can't see
                        no distance. It got to be very<lb/> late and still, and then along comes a
                        steamboat up the river. We lit the <reg orig="lan-|tern">lantern</reg>,<lb/>
                        and judged she would see it. Up-stream boats didn't generly come close
                        to<lb/> us; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under
                        the reefs; but<lb/> nights like this they bull right up the channel against
                        the whole river.</p>
                    <p>We could hear her pounding along, but we didn't see her good till she
                        was<lb/> close. She aimed right for us. Often they do that and try to see
                        how close they<lb/> can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off
                        a sweep, and then the<lb/> pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks
                        he's mighty smart. Well, here<lb/> she comes, and we said she was going to
                        try to shave us; but she didn't seem to<lb/> be sheering off a bit. She was
                        a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too,<lb/> looking like a black
                        cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a<lb/> sudden she bulged
                        out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors<lb/> shining
                        like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right<lb/>
                        over us. There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the
                        engines, a<lb/> pow-wow of cussing, and whistling of steam&#x2014;and as
                        Jim went overboard on one<lb/> side and I on the other, she come smashing
                        straight through the raft.</p>
                    <p>I dived&#x2014;and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot
                        wheel had got<lb/> to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. I
                        could always stay<lb/> under water a minute; this time I reckon I staid
                        under water a minute and a<lb/> half. Then I bounced for the top in a hurry,
                        for I was nearly busting. I popped<lb/> out to my arm-pits and blowed the
                        water out of my nose, and puffed a bit. Of<lb/> course there was a booming
                        current; and of course that boat started her engines<lb/> again ten seconds
                        after she stopped them, for they never cared much for <reg orig="rafts-|men"
                            >raftsmen</reg>;<lb/> so now she was churning along up the river, out of
                        sight in the thick<lb/> weather, though I could hear her.</p>
                    <pb n="131" entity="u000002472_0146"/>
                    <p>I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer; so
                        I<lb/> grabbed a plank that touched me while I was "treading water," and
                        struck out<lb/> for shore, shoving it ahead of me. But I made out to see
                        that the drift of the<lb/> current was towards the left-hand shore, which
                        meant that I was in a crossing;<lb/> so I changed off and went that way.</p>
                    <p>It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good
                        long<lb/> time in getting over. I made a safe landing, and clum up the bank.
                        I couldn't<lb/> see but a little ways, but I went poking along over rough
                        ground for a quarter of<lb/> a mile or more, and then I run across a big
                        old-fashioned double log house before<lb/> I noticed it. I was going to rush
                        by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out<lb/> and went to howling and
                        barking at me, and I knowed better than to move<lb/> another peg.</p>

                    <p>I heard the people stirring around in the house, now, and see a light.
                        The<lb/> man sung out:</p>
                    <pb n="133" entity="u000002472_0148"/>
                    <p>"Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool&#x2014;ain't you got any

                    <p>"All ready."</p>
                    <p>"Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?"</p>
                    <p>"No, sir&#x2014;I never heard of them."</p>
                    <p>"Well, that may be so, and it mayn't. Now, all ready. Step forward,<lb/>
                        George Jackson. And mind, don't you hurry&#x2014;come mighty slow. If
                        there's<lb/> anybody with you, let him keep back&#x2014;if he shows
                        himself he'll be shot. Come<lb/> along, now. Come slow; push the door open,
                        yourself&#x2014;just enough to squeeze<lb/> in, d' you hear?"</p>
                    <p>I didn't hurry, I couldn't if I'd a wanted to. I took one slow step at a
                        time,<lb/> and there warn't a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart.
                        The dogs were<lb/> as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind
                        me. When I got to the<lb/> three log door-steps, I heard them unlocking and
                        unbarring and unbolting. I<lb/> put my hand on the door and pushed it a
                        little and a little more, till somebody<lb/> said, "There, that's
                        enough&#x2014;put your head in." I done it, but I judged they<lb/> would
                        take it off.</p>
                    <p>The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and me
                        at<lb/> them, for about a quarter of a minute. Three big men with guns
                        pointed at me,<lb/> which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray and
                        about sixty, the other two<lb/> thirty or more&#x2014;all of them fine
                        and handsome&#x2014;and the sweetest old gray-headed<lb/> lady, and back
                        of her two young women which I couldn't see right well. The<lb/> old
                        gentleman says:</p>
                    <p>"There&#x2014;I reckon it's all right. Come in."</p>
                    <p>As soon as I was in, the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it
                        and<lb/> bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and
                        they all went<lb/> in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor,
                        and got together in a<lb/> corner that was out of range of the front
                        windows&#x2014;there warn't none on the<lb/> side. They held the candle,
                        and took a good look at me, and all said, "Why <hi rend="italic"
                        >he</hi><lb/> ain't a Shepherdson&#x2014;no, there ain't any Shepherdson
                        about him." Then the<lb/> old man said he hoped I wouldn't mind being
                        searched for arms, because he<lb/> didn't mean no harm by it&#x2014;it
                        was only to make sure. So he didn't pry<lb/>
                        <pb n="134" entity="u000002472_0149"/> into my pockets, but only felt
                        outside with his hands, and said it was all right.<lb/> He told me to make
                        myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the<lb/> old lady
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"Why bless you, Saul, the poor thing's as wet as he can be; and don't<lb/>
                        you reckon it may be he's hungry?"</p>
                    <p>"True for you, Rachel&#x2014;I forgot."</p>
                    <p>So the old lady says:</p>
                    <p>"Betsy" &lpar;this was a nigger woman&rpar;, "you fly around and get
                        him something<lb/> to eat, as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you
                        girls go and wake up<lb/> Buck and tell him&#x2014; Oh, here he is
                        himself. Buck, take this little stranger and<lb/> get the wet clothes off
                        from him and dress him up in some of yours that's dry."</p>
                    <p>Buck looked about as old as me&#x2014;<lb/> thirteen or fourteen or along
                        there,<lb/> though he was a little bigger than me.<lb/> He hadn't on
                        anything but a shirt,<lb/> and he was very frowsy-headed. He<lb/> come in
                        gaping and digging one fist<lb/> into his eyes, and he was dragging a<lb/>
                        gun along with the other one. He<lb/> says:</p>

                    <p>They said, no, 'twas a false alarm.</p>
                    <p>"Well," he says, "if they'd a ben<lb/> some, I reckon I'd a got one."</p>
                    <p>They all laughed, and Bob says:</p>
                    <p>"Why, Buck, they might have<lb/> scalped us all, you've been so slow in<lb/>
                        coming."</p>
                    <p>"Well, nobody come after me, and<lb/> it ain't right. I'm always kep'
                        down;<lb/> I don't get no show."</p>
                    <p>"Never mind, Buck, my boy," says the old man, "you'll have show enough,<lb/>
                        <pb n="135" entity="u000002472_0150"/> all in good time, don't you fret
                        about that. Go 'long with you now, and do<lb/> as your mother told you."</p>
                    <p>When we got up stairs to his room, he got me a coarse shirt and a <reg

                        them on. While I was at it he asked me what<lb/> my name was, but before I
                        could tell him, he started to telling me about a blue<lb/> jay and a young
                        rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday, and he<lb/> asked
                        me where Moses was when the candle went out. I said I didn't know; I<lb/>
                        hadn't heard about it before, no way.</p>
                    <p>"Well, guess," he says.</p>
                    <p>"How'm I going to guess," says I, "when I never heard tell about it<lb/>
                        before?"</p>
                    <p>"But you can guess, can't you? It's just as easy."</p>
                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">Which</hi> candle?" I says.</p>
                    <p>"Why, any candle," he says.</p>
                    <p>"I don't know where he was," says I; "where was he?"</p>
                    <p>"Why he was in the <hi rend="italic">dark!</hi> That's where he was!"</p>
                    <p>"Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?"</p>
                    <p>"Why, blame it, it's a riddle, don't you see? Say, how long are you going
                        to<lb/> stay here? You got to stay always. We can just have booming
                        times&#x2014;they<lb/> don't have no school now. Do you own a dog? I've
                        got a dog&#x2014;and he'll go in<lb/> the river and bring out chips that
                        you throw in. Do you like to comb up,<lb/> Sundays, and all that kind of
                        foolishness? You bet I don't, but ma she makes<lb/> me. Confound these ole
                        britches, I reckon I'd better put 'em on, but I'd ruther<lb/> not, it's so
                        warm. Are you all ready? All right&#x2014;come along, old hoss."</p>
                    <p>Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and butter-milk&#x2014;that is
                        what they<lb/> had for me down there, and there ain't nothing better that
                        ever I've come across<lb/> yet. Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob
                        pipes, except the nigger<lb/> woman, which was gone, and the two young
                        women. They all smoked and<lb/> talked, and I eat and talked. The young
                        women had quilts around them,<lb/> and their hair down their backs. They all
                        asked me questions, and I told<lb/> them how pap and me and all the family
                        was living on a little farm down at<lb/> the bottom of Arkansaw, and my
                        sister Mary Ann run off and got married and<lb/> never was heard of no more,
                        and Bill went to hunt them and he warn't heard of<lb/>
                        <pb n="136" entity="u000002472_0151"/> no more, and Tom and Mort died, and
                        then there warn't nobody but just me and<lb/> pap left, and he was just
                        trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles;<lb/> so when he died I
                        took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us,<lb/> and
                        started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how
                        I<lb/> come to be here. So they said I could have a home there as long as I
                        wanted it.<lb/> Then it was most daylight, and everybody went to bed, and I
                        went to bed with<lb/> Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all,
                        I had forgot what my<lb/> name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to
                        think, and when Buck<lb/> waked up, I says:</p>
                    <p>"Can you spell, Buck?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes," he says.</p>
                    <p>"I bet you can't spell my name," says I.</p>
                    <p>"I bet you what you dare I can," says he.</p>
                    <p>"All right," says I, "go ahead."</p>
                    <p>"G-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n&#x2014;there now," he says.</p>
                    <p>"Well," says I, "you done it, but I didn't think you could. It ain't no<lb/>
                        slouch of a name to spell&#x2014;right off without studying."</p>
                    <p>I set it down, private, because somebody might want <hi rend="italic">me</hi>
                        to spell it, next, and<lb/> so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it
                        off like I was used to it.</p>
                    <p>It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too. I hadn't seen
                        no<lb/> house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much
                        style. It didn't<lb/> have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one
                        with a buckskin string,<lb/> but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in
                        a town. There warn't no bed<lb/> in the parlor, not a sign of a bed; but
                        heaps of parlors in towns has beds in<lb/> them. There was a big fireplace
                        that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks<lb/> was kept clean and red
                        by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with<lb/> another brick;
                        sometimes they washed them over with red water-paint that they<lb/> call
                        Spanish-brown, same as they do in town. They had big brass dog-irons
                        that<lb/> could hold up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the
                        mantel-piece,<lb/> with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of
                        the glass front, and a<lb/> round place in the middle of it for the sun, and
                        you could see the pendulum<lb/> swing behind it. It was beautiful to hear
                        that clock tick; and sometimes when<lb/> one of these peddlers had been
                        along and scoured her up and got her in good<lb/>
                        <pb n="137" entity="u000002472_0152"/> shape, she would start in and strike
                        a hundred and fifty before she got <reg orig="tuck-|ered"
                        >tuckered</reg><lb/> out. They wouldn't took any money for her.</p>
                    <p>Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made out
                        of<lb/> something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the parrots
                        was a cat<lb/> made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and when
                        you pressed down<lb/> on them they squeaked, but didn't open their mouths
                        nor look different nor<lb/> interested. They squeaked through underneath.
                        There was a couple of big<lb/> wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those
                        things. On a table in the middle<lb/> of the room was a kind of a lovely
                        crockery basket that had apples and oranges<lb/> and peaches and grapes
                        piled up in it which was much redder and yellower and<lb/> prettier than
                        real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where pieces<lb/>
                        had got chipped off and showed the white chalk or whatever it was,
                        underneath.</p>
                    <p>This table had a cover made out of beautiful oil-cloth, with a red and
                        blue<lb/> spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. It
                        come all the way<lb/> from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books
                        too, piled up perfectly<lb/> exact, on each corner of the table. One was a
                        big family Bible, full of pictures.<lb/> One was "Pilgrim's Progress," about
                        a man that left his family it didn't say why.<lb/> I read considerable in it
                        now and then. The statements was interesting, but<lb/> tough. Another was
                        "Friendship's Offering," full of beautiful stuff and poetry;<lb/> but I
                        didn't read the poetry. Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another<lb/>
                        was Dr. Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a
                        body<lb/> was sick or dead. There was a Hymn Book, and a lot of other books.
                        And<lb/> there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound,
                        too&#x2014;not bagged down in<lb/> the middle and busted, like an old
                        basket.</p>
                    <p>They had pictures hung on the walls&#x2014;mainly Washingtons and
                        Lafayettes,<lb/> and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called "Signing
                        the Declaration." There<lb/> was some that they called crayons, which one of
                        the daughters which was dead<lb/> made her own self when she was only
                        fifteen years old. They was different from<lb/> any pictures I ever see
                        before; blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a<lb/> woman in a slim
                        black dress, belted small under the arm-pits, with bulges like a<lb/>
                        cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet
                        with<lb/> a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape,
                        and very wee<lb/> black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive
                        on a tombstone on her<lb/>
                        <pb n="138" entity="u000002472_0153"/> right elbow, under a weeping willow,
                        and her other hand hanging down her side<lb/> holding a white handkerchief
                        and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said<lb/> "Shall I Never See
                        Thee More Alas." Another one was a young lady with her<lb/> hair all combed
                        up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of<lb/> a
                        comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a
                        dead<lb/> bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and
                        underneath the<lb/> picture it said "I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup
                        More Alas." There was<lb/> one where a young lady was at a window looking up
                        at the moon, and tears<lb/> running down her cheeks; and she had an open
                        letter in one hand with black<lb/> sealing-wax showing on one edge of<lb/>
                        it, and she was mashing a locket<lb/> with a chain to it against her
                        mouth,<lb/> and underneath the picture it said<lb/> "And Art Thou Gone Yes
                        Thou<lb/> Art Gone Alas." These was all<lb/> nice pictures, I reckon, but I
                        didn't<lb/> somehow seem to take to them, <reg orig="be-|cause"
                            >because</reg><lb/> if ever I was down a little,<lb/> they always give
                        me the fan-tods.<lb/> Everybody was sorry she died, <reg orig="be-|cause"
                            >because</reg><lb/> she had laid out a lot more of<lb/> these pictures
                        to do, and a body<lb/> could see by what she had done what<lb/> they had
                        lost. But I reckoned,<lb/> that with her disposition, she was<lb/> having a
                        better time in the <reg orig="grave-|yard">graveyard</reg>.<lb/> She was at
                        work on what<lb/> they said was her greatest picture<lb/> when she took
                        sick, and every day<lb/> and every night it was her prayer to<lb/> be
                        allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance. It was
                        a<lb/> picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail
                        of a bridge<lb/> all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and
                        looking up to the</p>

                        across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more
                        reaching<lb/> up towards the moon&#x2014;and the idea was, to see which
                        pair would look best and<lb/> then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I
                        was saying, she died before she<lb/> got her mind made up, and now they kept
                        this picture over the head of the<lb/> bed in her room, and every time her
                        birthday come they hung flowers on it.<lb/> Other times it was hid with a
                        little curtain. The young woman in the picture<lb/> had a kind of a nice
                        sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look<lb/> too spidery,
                        seemed to me.</p>
                    <p>This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste<lb/>

                        <p>If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was
                            fourteen,<lb/> there ain't no telling what she could a done by-and-by.
                            Buck said she<lb/> could rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn't ever
                            have to stop to think.<lb/> He said she would slap down a line, and if
                            she couldn't find anything to<lb/> rhyme with it she would just scratch
                            it out and slap down another one,<lb/> and go ahead. She warn't
                            particular, she could write about anything you<lb/> choose to give her
                            to write about, just so it was sadful. Every time a man<lb/> died, or a
                            woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand with her<lb/>
                            "tribute" before he was cold. She called them tributes. The
                            neighbors<lb/> said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the
                            undertaker&#x2014;the <reg orig="under-|taker">undertaker</reg><lb/>
                            never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and then she hung fire on
                            a<lb/> rhyme for the dead person's name, which was Whistler. She warn't
                            ever<lb/> the same, after that; she never complained, but she kind of
                            pined away<lb/> and did not live long. Poor thing, many's the time I
                            made myself go up<lb/> to the little room that used to be hers and get
                            out her poor old <reg orig="scrap-|book">scrapbook</reg><lb/> and read
                            in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I<lb/> had soured on
                            her a little. I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and<lb/>
                            warn't going to let anything come between us. Poor Emmeline made
                            poetry<lb/> about all the dead people when she was alive, and it didn't
                            seem right that<lb/> there warn't nobody to make some about her, now she
                            was gone; so I tried<lb/> to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I
                            couldn't seem to make it go,<lb/> somehow. They kept Emmeline's room
                            trim and nice and all the things fixed<lb/> in it just the way she liked
                            to have them when she was alive, and nobody<lb/> ever slept there. The
                            old lady took care of the room herself, though there<lb/> was plenty of
                            niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible<lb/> there,
                            mostly.</p>
                        <p>Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains
                            on<lb/> the windows: white, with pictures painted on them, of castles
                            with vines all<lb/> down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink.
                            There was a little old<lb/> piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I
                            reckon, and nothing was ever so lovely as<lb/> to hear the young ladies
                            sing, "The Last Link is Broken" and play "The Battle<lb/> of Prague" on
                            it. The walls of all the rooms was plastered, and most had<lb/> carpets
                            on the floors, and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside.</p>
                        <pb n="142" entity="u000002472_0157"/>
                        <p>It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was
                            roofed<lb/> and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the
                            middle of the<lb/> day, and it was a cool, comfortable place. Nothing
                            couldn't be better. And<lb/> warn't the cooking good, and just bushels
                            of it too!</p>

                        himself. Col. Grangerford was<lb/> very tall and very slim, and had a<lb/>
                        darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of<lb/> red in it anywheres; he was <reg
                            orig="clean-|shaved">cleanshaved</reg><lb/> every morning, all over
                        his<lb/> thin face, and he had the thinnest<lb/> kind of lips, and the
                        thinnest kind of<lb/> nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the
                        blackest kind of eyes,<lb/> sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was
                        looking out of caverns at you,<lb/> as you may say. His forehead was high,
                        and his hair was black and straight,<lb/> and hung to his shoulders. His
                        hands was long and thin, and every day of<lb/> his life he put on a clean
                        shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of<lb/> linen so white it
                        hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue<lb/> tail-coat
                        with brass buttons on it. He carried a mahogany cane with a silver<lb/>
                        <pb n="144" entity="u000002472_0159"/> head to it. There warn't no
                        frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't<lb/> ever loud. He was as
                        kind as he could be&#x2014;you could feel that, you know, and<lb/> so
                        you had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but
                        when<lb/> he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning
                        begun to flicker<lb/> out from under his eyebrows you wanted to climb a tree
                        first, and find out what<lb/> the matter was afterwards. He didn't ever have
                        to tell anybody to mind their<lb/> manners&#x2014;everybody was always
                        good mannered where he was. Everybody<lb/> loved to have him around, too; he
                        was sunshine most always&#x2014;I mean he made<lb/> it seem like good
                        weather. When he turned into a cloud-bank it was awful<lb/> dark for a half
                        a minute and that was enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong<lb/> again for
                        a week.</p>
                    <p>When him and the old lady come down in the morning, all the family got
                        up<lb/> out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn't set down
                        again till they<lb/> had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard
                        where the decanters<lb/> was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to
                        him, and he held it in his<lb/> hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was
                        mixed, and then they bowed and said<lb/> "Our duty to you, sir, and madam;"
                        and <hi rend="italic">they</hi> bowed the least bit in the world<lb/> and
                        said thank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a<lb/>
                        spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in
                        the<lb/> bottom of their tumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank
                        to the old<lb/> people too.</p>
                    <p>Bob was the oldest, and Tom next. Tall, beautiful men with very broad<lb/>
                        shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. They
                        dressed<lb/> in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and
                        wore broad<lb/> Panama hats.</p>
                    <p>Then there was Miss Charlotte, she was twenty-five, and tall and proud
                        and<lb/> grand, but as good as she could be, when she warn't stirred up; but
                        when she<lb/> was, she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,
                        like her father.<lb/> She was beautiful.</p>
                    <p>So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. She was
                        gentle<lb/> and sweet, like a dove, and she was only twenty</p>
                    <p>Each person had their own nigger to wait on them&#x2014;Buck, too. My nigger<lb/>
                        <pb n="145" entity="u000002472_0160"/> had a monstrous easy time, because I
                        warn't used to having anybody do anything<lb/> for me, but Buck's was on the
                        jump most of the time.</p>
                    <p>This was all there was of the family, now; but there used to be
                        more&#x2014;three<lb/> sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that
                        died.</p>
                    <p>The old gentleman owned a lot of farms, and over a hundred niggers.<lb/>
                        Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or
                        fifteen<lb/> mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such
                        junketings round about and<lb/> on the river, and dances and picnics in the
                        woods, day-times, and balls at the<lb/> house, nights. These people was<lb/>
                        mostly kin-folks of the family.<lb/> The men brought their guns<lb/> with
                        them. It was a handsome<lb/> lot of quality, I tell you.</p>
                    <p>There was another clan of<lb/> aristocracy around there&#x2014;five<lb/>
                        or six families&#x2014;mostly of the<lb/> name of Shepherdson. They<lb/>
                        was as high-toned, and well<lb/> born, and rich and grand, as the<lb/> tribe
                        of Grangerfords. The<lb/> Shepherdsons and the <reg orig="Granger-|fords"
                            >Grangerfords</reg><lb/> used the same steamboat<lb/> landing, which was
                        about two<lb/> mile above our house; so <reg orig="some-|times"
                            >sometimes</reg><lb/> when I went up there<lb/> with a lot of our folks
                        I used to<lb/> see a lot of the Shepherdsons<lb/> there, on their fine
                        horses.</p>

                        Buck says:</p>
                    <p>"Quick! Jump for the woods!"</p>

                        horse easy and looking like a soldier. He had his gun across his pommel.
                        I<lb/> had seen him before. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I heard Buck's
                        gun<lb/> go off at my ear, and Harney's hat tumbled off from his head. He
                        grabbed<lb/> his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid. But we
                        didn't<lb/> wait. We started through the woods on a run. The woods warn't
                        thick, so<lb/> I looked over my shoulder, to dodge the bullet, and twice I

                        come&#x2014;to get his hat, I<lb/> reckon, but I couldn't see. We never
                        stopped running till we got home. The<lb/> old gentleman's eyes blazed a
                        minute&#x2014;'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged&#x2014;then<lb/> his
                        face sort of smoothed down, and he<lb/> says, kind of gentle:</p>
                    <p>"I don't like that shooting from <reg orig="be-|hind">behind</reg><lb/> a

                    <p>"Yes&#x2014;right smart chance of funerals. But they don't always kill.
                        Pa's<lb/> got a few buck-shot in him; but he don't mind it 'cuz he don't

                    <p>"Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, we got one and they got one. 'Bout three months ago, my cousin<lb/>
                        Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods, on t'other side of the
                        river. <pb n="148" entity="u000002472_0163"/> and didn't have no weapon with
                        him, which was blame' foolishness, and in a <reg orig="lone-|some"
                            >lonesome</reg><lb/> place he hears a horse a-coming behind him, and
                        sees old Baldy <reg orig="Shepherd-|son">Shepherdson</reg><lb/> a-linkin'
                        after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a-flying in the<lb/>
                        wind; and 'stead of jumping off and taking to the brush, Bud 'lowed he
                        could<lb/> outrun him; so they had it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more,
                        the old man<lb/> a-gaining all the time; so at last Bud seen it warn't any
                        use, so he stopped and<lb/> faced around so as to have the bullet holes in
                        front, you know, and the old man<lb/> he rode up and shot him down. But he
                        didn't git much chance to enjoy his<lb/> luck, for inside of a week our
                        folks laid <hi rend="italic">him</hi> out."</p>
                    <p>"I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck."</p>
                    <p>"I reckon he <hi rend="italic">warn't</hi> a coward. Not by a blame' sight.
                        There ain't a coward<lb/> amongst them Shepherdsons&#x2014;not a one.
                        And there ain't no cowards amongst<lb/> the Grangerfords, either. Why, that
                        old man kep' up his end in a fight one day,<lb/> for a half an hour, against
                        three Grangerfords, and come out winner. They was<lb/> all a-horseback; he
                        lit off of his horse and got behind a little wood-pile, and kep'<lb/> his
                        horse before him to stop the bullets; but the Grangerfords staid on
                        their<lb/> horses and capered around the old man, and peppered away at him,
                        and he<lb/> peppered away at them. Him and his horse both went home pretty
                        leaky and<lb/> crippled, but the Grangerfords had to be <hi rend="italic"
                            >fetched</hi> home&#x2014;and one of 'em was<lb/> dead, and another
                        died the next day. No, sir, if a body's out hunting for<lb/> cowards, he
                        don't want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz<lb/> they
                        don't breed any of that <hi rend="italic">kind.</hi>"</p>
                    <p>Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody
                        a-horseback.<lb/> The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept them
                        between their knees<lb/> or stood them handy against the wall. The
                        Shepherdsons done the same. It<lb/> was pretty ornery
                        preaching&#x2014;all about brotherly love, and such-like
                        tiresomeness;<lb/> but everybody said it was a good sermon, and they all
                        talked it over going<lb/> home, and had such a powerful lot to say about
                        faith, and good works, and free<lb/> grace, and preforeordestination, and I
                        don't know what all, that it did seem to<lb/> me to be one of the roughest
                        Sundays I had run across yet.</p>
                    <p>About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their
                        chairs<lb/> and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. Buck and
                        a dog was<lb/>
                        <pb n="149" entity="u000002472_0164"/> stretched out on the grass in the
                        sun, sound asleep. I went up to our room, and<lb/> judged I would take a nap
                        myself. I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in<lb/> her door, which was
                        next to ours, and she took me in her room and shut the<lb/> door very soft,
                        and asked me if I liked her, and I said I did; and she asked me<lb/> if I
                        would do something for her and not tell anybody, and I said I would.
                        Then<lb/> she said she'd forgot her Testament, and left it in the seat at
                        church, between<lb/> two other books and would I slip out quiet and go there
                        and fetch it to her,<lb/> and not say nothing to nobody. I said I would. So
                        I slid out and slipped off<lb/> up the road, and there warn't anybody at the
                        church, except maybe a hog or<lb/> two, for there warn't any lock on the
                        door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor<lb/> in summer-time because it's
                        cool.<lb/> If you notice, most folks don't go to ;<lb/> church only when
                        they've got to;<lb/> but a hog is different.</p>

                        anybody. She was mighty red in<lb/>

                        astonished, but when I got my breath I asked her what the<lb/> paper was
                        about, and she asked me if I had read it, and I said no, and she asked<lb/>
                        me if I could read writing, and I told her "no, only coarse-hand," and then
                        she<lb/> said the paper warn't anything but a book-mark to keep her place,
                        and I might<lb/> go and play now.</p>
                    <p>I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon
                        I<lb/> noticed that my nigger was following along behind. When we was out of
                        sight<lb/> of the house, he looked back and around a second, and then comes
                        a-running,<lb/> and says:</p>
                    <p>"Mars Jawge, if you'll come down into de swamp, I'll show you a whole<lb/>

                    <p>Thinks I, that's mighty curious; he said that yesterday. He oughter know<lb/>
                        a body don't love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for them.
                        What<lb/> is he up to anyway? So I says&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"All right, trot ahead."</p>
                    <p>I followed a half a mile, then he struck out over the swamp and waded<lb/>
                        ankle deep as much as another half mile. We come to a little flat piece of
                        land<lb/> which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines, and
                        he says&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"You shove right in dah, jist a few steps, Mars Jawge, dah's whah dey is.

                    <p>Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid<lb/>
                        him. I poked into the place a-ways, and come to a little open patch as big
                        as a<lb/> bedroom, all hung around with vines, and found a man laying there
                        asleep&#x2014;and<lb/> by jings it was my old Jim!</p>
                    <p>I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him
                        to<lb/> see me again, but it warn't. He nearly cried, he was so glad, but he
                        warn't<lb/> surprised. Said he swum along behind me, that night, and heard
                        me yell every<lb/> time, but dasn't answer, because he didn't want nobody to
                        pick <hi rend="italic">him</hi> up, and take<lb/> him into slavery again.
                        Says he&#x2014;</p>

                        en<lb/> we's got a new lot o' stuff, too, in de place o' what 'uz los'."</p>
                    <p>"Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim&#x2014;did you catch
                        her?"</p>
                    <p>"How I gwyne to ketch her, en I out in de woods? No, some er de niggers<lb/>
                        foun' her ketched on a snag, along heah in de ben', en dey hid her in a

                    <p>"Yes, he is. He ain't ever told me you was here; told me to come, and he'd<lb/>

                    <p>I don't want to talk much about the next day. I reckon I'll cut it
                        pretty<lb/> short. I waked up about dawn, and was agoing to turn over and go
                        to sleep<lb/> again, when I noticed how still it was&#x2014;didn't seem
                        to be anybody stirring.<lb/> That warn't usual. Next I noticed that Buck was
                        up and gone. Well, I gets<lb/> up, a-wondering, and goes down
                        stairs&#x2014;nobody around; everything as still as<lb/> a mouse. Just
                        the same outside; thinks I, what does it mean? Down by the<lb/> wood-pile I
                        comes across my Jack, and says:</p>
                    <p>"What's it all about?"</p>
                    <p>Says he:</p>
                    <p>"Don't you know, Mars Jawge?"</p>
                    <p>"No," says I, "I don't."</p>
                    <p>"Well, den, Miss Sophia's run off! 'deed she has. She run off in de

                        reck'n dey's gwyne to be mighty rough<lb/> times."</p>
                    <p>"Buck went off 'thout waking me up."</p>
                    <p>"Well I reck'n he <hi rend="italic">did!</hi> Dey warn't gwyne to mix you up
                        in it. Mars<lb/> Buck he loaded up his gun en 'lowed he's gwyne to fetch

                        en you bet you he'll fetch one<lb/> ef he gits a chanst."</p>
                    <p>I took up the river road as hard as I could put. By-and-by I begin to
                        hear<lb/> guns a good ways off. When I come in sight of the log store and
                        the wood-pile<lb/> where the steamboats lands, I worked along under the
                        trees and brush till I got<lb/> to a good place, and then I clumb up into
                        the forks of a cotton-wood that was out<lb/> of reach, and watched. There
                        was a wood-rank four foot high, a little ways in<lb/>
                        <pb n="153" entity="u000002472_0168"/> front of the tree, and first I was
                        going to hide behind that; but maybe it was<lb/> luckier I didn't.</p>
                    <p>There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open<lb/>
                        place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at a
                        couple of<lb/> young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the
                        steamboat landing&#x2014;<lb/> but they couldn't come it. Every time one
                        of them showed himself on the river<lb/> side of the wood-pile he got shot
                        at. The two boys was squatting back to back<lb/> behind the pile, so they
                        could watch both ways.</p>
                    <figure id="f73" rend="inline" entity="u000002472_0168">

                        </head>
                    </figure>
                    <p>By-and-by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. They started<lb/>
                        riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady bead
                        over<lb/> the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. All the
                        men jumped<lb/> off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to
                        carry him to the store;<lb/> and that minute the two boys started on the
                        run. They got half-way to the tree<lb/> I was in before the men noticed.
                        Then the men see them, and jumped on their<lb/> horses and took out after
                        them. They gained on the boys, but it didn't do no<lb/> good, the boys had
                        too good a start; they got to the wood-pile that was in front<lb/>
                        <pb n="154" entity="u000002472_0169"/> of my tree, and slipped in behind it,
                        and so they had the bulge on the men again.<lb/> One of the boys was Buck,
                        and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen<lb/> years old.</p>
                    <p>The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. As soon as they was<lb/>
                        out of sight, I sung out to Buck and told him. He didn't know what to make
                        of<lb/> my voice coming out of the tree, at first. He was awful surprised.
                        He told me<lb/> to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in
                        sight again; said<lb/> they was up to some devilment or
                        other&#x2014;wouldn't be gone long. I wished I was<lb/> out of that
                        tree, but I dasn't come down. Buck begun to cry and rip, and 'lowed<lb/>
                        that him and his cousin Joe &lpar;that was the other young
                        chap&rpar; would make up for<lb/> this day, yet. He said his father and
                        his two brothers was killed, and two or<lb/> three of the enemy. Said the
                        Shepherdsons laid for them, in ambush. Buck<lb/> said his father and
                        brothers ought to waited for their relations&#x2014;the
                        Shepherdsons<lb/> was too strong for them. I asked him what was become of
                        young Harney and<lb/> Miss Sophia. He said they'd got across the river and
                        was safe. I was glad of<lb/> that; but the way Buck did take on because he
                        didn't manage to kill Harney<lb/> that day he shot at him&#x2014;I
                        hain't ever heard anything like it.</p>
                    <p>All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns&#x2014;the men
                        had<lb/> slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without
                        their horses!<lb/> The boys jumped for the river&#x2014;both of them
                        hurt&#x2014;and as they swum down the<lb/> current the men run along the
                        bank shooting at them and singing out, "Kill<lb/> them, kill them!" It made
                        me so sick I most fell out of the tree. I ain't agoing<lb/> to tell <hi
                            rend="italic">all</hi> that happened&#x2014;it would make me sick
                        again if I was to do that. I<lb/> wished I hadn't ever come ashore that
                        night, to see such things. I ain't ever<lb/> going to get shut of
                        them&#x2014;lots of times I dream about them.</p>
                    <p>I staid in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.
                        Sometimes<lb/> I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little
                        gangs of men gallop<lb/> past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the
                        trouble was still agoing on. I<lb/> was mighty down-hearted; so I made up my
                        mind I wouldn't ever go ancar<lb/> that house again, because I reckoned I
                        was to blame, somehow. I judged that<lb/> that piece of paper meant that
                        Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at<lb/> half-past two and run off;
                        and I judged I ought to told her father about that<lb/>
                        <pb n="155" entity="u000002472_0170"/> paper and the curious way she acted,
                        and then maybe he would a locked her up<lb/> and this awful mess wouldn't
                        ever happened.</p>
                    <p>When I got down out of the tree, I crept along down the river bank a<lb/>
                        piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and
                        tugged<lb/> at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces,
                        and got away as<lb/> quick as I could. I cried a little when I was covering
                        up Buck's face, for he<lb/> was mighty good to me.</p>
                    <p>It was just dark, now. I never went near the house, but struck through
                        the<lb/> woods and made for the swamp. Jim warn't on his island, so I
                        tramped off in<lb/> a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows,
                        red-hot to jump aboard<lb/> and get out of that awful country&#x2014;the
                        raft was gone! My souls, but I was<lb/> scared! I couldn't get my breath for
                        most a minute. Then I raised a yell. A<lb/> voice not twenty-five foot from
                        me, says&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"Good lan'! is dat you, honey? Doan' make no noise."</p>
                    <p>It was Jim's voice&#x2014;nothing ever sounded so good before. I run
                        along the<lb/> bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged
                        me, he was so<lb/> glad to see me. He says&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"Laws bless you, chile, I 'uz right down sho' you's dead agin. Jack's
                        been<lb/> heah, he say he reck'n you's ben shot, kase you didn' come home no
                        mo'; so<lb/> I's jes' dis minute a startin' de raf' down towards de mouf er
                        de crick, so's to be<lb/> all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack
                        comes agin en tells me for certain<lb/> you <hi rend="italic">is</hi> dead.
                        Lawsy, I's mighty glad to git you back agin, honey."</p>
                    <p>I says&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"All right&#x2014;that's mighty good; they won't find me, and they'll
                        think I've<lb/> been killed, and floated down the river&#x2014;there's
                        something up there that'll help<lb/> them to think so&#x2014;so don't
                        you lose no time, Jim, but just shove off for the big<lb/> water as fast as
                        ever you can."</p>
                    <p>I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the
                        middle<lb/> of the Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal lantern, and
                        judged that we was<lb/> free and safe once more. I hadn't had a bite to eat
                        since yesterday; so Jim he got<lb/> out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk,
                        and pork and cabbage, and greens&#x2014;<lb/> there ain't nothing in the
                        world so good, when it's cooked right&#x2014;and whilst I eat<lb/>
                        <pb n="156" entity="u000002472_0171"/> my supper we talked, and had a good
                        time. I was powerful glad to get away<lb/> from the feuds, and so was Jim to
                        get away from the swamp. We said there<lb/> warn't no home like a raft,
                        after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and<lb/> smothery, but a raft
                        don't. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on<lb/> a raft.</p>

                        and<lb/> laid up and hid day-times; soon as<lb/> night was most gone, we
                        stopped<lb/> navigating and tied up&#x2014;nearly <reg orig="al-|ways"

                        Then we set out the<lb/> lines. Next we slid into the river<lb/> and had a
                        swim, so as to freshen up<lb/> and cool off; then we set down on<lb/> the
                        sandy bottom where the water<lb/> was about knee deep, and watched the
                        daylight come. Not a sound, anywheres<lb/> &#x2014;perfectly
                        still&#x2014;just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes
                        the<lb/> bull-frogs a-cluttering, maybe. The first thing to see, looking
                        away over the<lb/> water, was a kind of dull line&#x2014;that was the
                        woods on t'other side&#x2014;you couldn't<lb/> make nothing else out;
                        then a pale place in the sky; then more paleness,<lb/> spreading around;
                        then the river softened up, away off, and warn't black<lb/> any more, but
                        gray; you could see little dark spots drifting along, ever so far<lb/>

                        screaking; or jumbled up voices, it was so still,<lb/> and sounds come so
                        far; and by-and-by you could see a streak on the water<lb/> which you know
                        by the look of the streak that there's a snag there in a swift<lb/> current
                        which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see<lb/> the
                        mist curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and
                        you<lb/> make out a log cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on
                        t'other side<lb/> of the river, being a wood-yard, likely, and piled by them
                        cheats so you can<lb/> throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice
                        breeze springs up, and comes<lb/> fanning you from over there, so cool and
                        fresh, and sweet to smell, on account of<lb/> the woods and the flowers; but
                        sometimes not that way, because they've left<lb/> dead fish laying around,
                        gars, and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next<lb/> you've got the
                        full day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the song-birds<lb/> just
                        going it!</p>
                    <p>A little smoke couldn't be noticed, now, so we would take some fish off of
                        the<lb/> lines, and cook up a hot breakfast. And afterwards we would watch
                        the <reg orig="lone-|someness">lonesomeness</reg><lb/> of the river, and
                        kind of lazy along, and by-and-by lazy off to sleep.<lb/> Wake up,
                        by-and-by, and look to see what done it, and maybe see a steamboat,<lb/>
                        coughing along up stream, so far off towards the other side you couldn't
                        tell<lb/> nothing about her only whether she was stern-wheel or side-wheel;
                        then for about<lb/> an hour there wouldn't be nothing to hear nor nothing to
                        see&#x2014;just solid <reg orig="lonesome-|ness"
                        >lonesomeness</reg>.<lb/> Next you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder,
                        and maybe a galoot on it<lb/> chopping, because they're most always doing it
                        on a raft; you'd see the ax flash, and<lb/> come down&#x2014;you don't
                        hear nothing; you see that ax go up again, and by the time<lb/> it's above
                        the man's head, then you hear the <hi rend="italic"
                        >k'chunk!</hi>&#x2014;it had took all that time<lb/> to come over the
                        water. So we would put in the day, lazying around, listening<lb/> to the
                        stillness. Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that
                        went<lb/> by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them.
                        A scow or a<lb/> raft went by so close we could hear them talking and
                        cussing and laughing&#x2014;<lb/> heard them plain; but we couldn't see
                        no sign of them; it made you feel crawly,<lb/> it was like spirits carrying
                        on that way in the air. Jim said he believed it was<lb/> spirits; but I
                        says:</p>
                    <pb n="159" entity="u000002472_0174"/>
                    <p>"No, spirits wouldn't say, 'dern the dern fog.'"</p>
                    <p>Soon as it was night, out we shoved; when we got her out to about the<lb/>
                        middle, we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted
                        her<lb/> to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water and
                        talked about<lb/> all kinds of things&#x2014;we was always naked, day
                        and night, whenever the<lb/> mosquitoes would let us&#x2014;the new
                        clothes Buck's folks made for me was<lb/> too good to be comfortable, and
                        besides I didn't go much on clothes, <reg orig="no-|how">nohow</reg>.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest<lb/>
                        time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe
                        a<lb/> spark&#x2014;which was a candle in a cabin window&#x2014;and
                        sometimes on the water<lb/> you could see a spark or two&#x2014;on a
                        raft or a scow, you know; and maybe<lb/> you could hear a fiddle or a song
                        coming over from one of them crafts. It's<lb/> lovely to live on a raft. We
                        had the sky, up there, all speckled with stars,<lb/> and we used to lay on
                        our backs and look up at them, and discuss about<lb/> whether they was made,
                        or only just happened&#x2014;Jim he allowed they was made,<lb/> but I
                        allowed they happened; I judged it would have took too long to <hi
                            rend="italic">make</hi><lb/> so many. Jim said the moon could a <hi
                            rend="italic">laid</hi> them; well, that looked kind of<lb/> reasonable,
                        so I didn't say nothing against it, because I've seen a frog lay<lb/> most
                        as many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that<lb/>
                        fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and
                        was<lb/> hove out of the nest.</p>
                    <p>Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the<lb/>
                        dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out<lb/>
                        of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful
                        pretty;<lb/> then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and
                        her pow-wow<lb/> shut off and leave the river still again; and by-and-by her
                        waves would get to<lb/> us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the
                        raft a bit, and after that you<lb/> wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't
                        tell how long, except maybe frogs<lb/> or something.</p>
                    <p>After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or<lb/>
                        three hours the shores was black&#x2014;no more sparks in the cabin
                        windows. These<lb/>
                        <pb n="160" entity="u000002472_0175"/> sparks was our clock&#x2014;the
                        first one that showed again meant morning was coming,<lb/> so we hunted a
                        place to hide and tie up, right away.</p>
                    <p>One morning about day-break, I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to<lb/>
                        the main shore&#x2014;it was only two hundred yards&#x2014;and
                        paddled about a mile up<lb/> a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I
                        couldn't get some berries. Just<lb/> as I was passing a place where a kind
                        of a cow-path crossed the crick, here comes<lb/> a couple of men tearing up
                        the path as tight as they could foot it, I thought<lb/> I was a goner, for

                        there in a<lb/> hurry, but they was pretty<lb/> close to me then, and
                        sung<lb/> out and begged me to save<lb/> their lives&#x2014;said they
                        hadn't<lb/> been doing nothing, and was<lb/> being chased for
                        it&#x2014;said there<lb/> was men and dogs a-coming.<lb/> They wanted to
                        jump right<lb/> in, but I says&#x2014;</p>

                    <p>They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our tow-head,

                        <pb n="161" entity="u000002472_0176"/> seemed to stop and fool around a

                        safe.</p>
                    <p>One of these fellows was about seventy, or upwards, and had a bald head<lb/>
                        and very gray whiskers. He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and a

                        into his boot tops,<lb/> and home-knit galluses&#x2014;no, he only had

                        carpet-bags.</p>
                    <p>The other fellow was about thirty and dressed about as ornery. After <reg

                    <p>Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but
                        he<lb/> said it warn't much use, he couldn't be much comforted; said if we

                        tell us how. He said we ought to bow, when we<lb/> spoke to him, and say
                        "Your Grace," or "My Lord," or "Your Lordship"&#x2014;<lb/> and he
                        wouldn't mind it if we called him plain "Bridgewater," which he said<lb/>
                        was a title, anyway, and not a name; and one of us ought to wait on him
                        at<lb/> dinner, and do any little thing for him he wanted done.</p>
                    <p>Well, that was all easy, so we done it. All through dinner Jim stood<lb/>
                        around and waited on him, and says, "Will yo' Grace have some o' dis,
                        or<lb/> some o' dat?" and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing
                        to<lb/> him.</p>
                    <p>But the old man got pretty silent, by-and-by&#x2014;didn't have much to

                        going on around<lb/> that duke. He seemed to have something on his mind. So,
                        along in the <reg orig="after-|noon">afternoon</reg>,<lb/> he says:</p>
                    <p>"Looky here, Bilgewater," he says, "I'm nation sorry for you, but you

                    <p>"No, you ain't the only person that's had a secret of his birth." And by<lb/>

                    <p>"Bilgewater, kin I trust you?" says the old man, still sort of sobbing.</p>
                    <p>"To the bitter death!" He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it,<lb/>
                        and says, "The secret of your being: speak!"</p>
                    <p>"Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!"</p>
                    <p>You bet you Jim and me stared, this time. Then the duke says</p>

                        it warn't no use, nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him
                        any<lb/> good; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a
                        while if<lb/> people treated him according to his rights, and got down on
                        one knee to speak to<lb/> him, and always called him "Your Majesty," and
                        waited on him first at meals,<lb/> and didn't set down in his presence till
                        he asked them. So Jim and me set to<lb/> majestying him, and doing this and

                        down. This done him heaps of good, and so he got<lb/> cheerful and
                        comfortable. But the duke kind of soured on him, and didn't look a<lb/> bit
                        satisfied with the way things was going; still, the king acted real
                        friendly<lb/> towards him, and said the duke's great-grandfather and all the
                        other Dukes of<lb/> Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by <hi

                        <pb n="166" entity="u000002472_0181"/> the palace considerable; but the duke
                        staid huffy a good while, till by-and-by<lb/> the king says:</p>
                    <p>"Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time, on this h-yer
                        raft,<lb/> Bilgewater, and so what's the use o' your bein' sour? It'll only
                        make things<lb/> oncomfortable. It ain't my fault I warn't born a duke, it
                        ain't your fault you<lb/> warn't born a king&#x2014;so what's the use to
                        worry? Make the best o' things the<lb/> way you find 'em, says
                        I&#x2014;that's my motto. This ain't no bad thing that we've<lb/> struck
                        here&#x2014;plenty grub and an easy life&#x2014;come, give us your
                        hand, Duke, and<lb/> less all be friends."</p>
                    <p>The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. It took away
                        all<lb/> the uncomfortableness, and we felt mighty good over it, because it
                        would a been<lb/> a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the
                        raft; for what you want,<lb/> above all things, on a raft, is for everybody
                        to be satisfied, and feel right and<lb/> kind towards the others.</p>
                    <p>It didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn't no
                        kings<lb/> nor dukes, at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds. But I
                        never said<lb/> nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it's the best way;
                        then you don't have<lb/> no quarrels, and don't get into no trouble. If they
                        wanted us to call them kings<lb/> and dukes, I hadn't no objections, 'long
                        as it would keep peace in the family;<lb/> and it warn't no use to tell Jim,
                        so I didn't tell him. If I never learnt nothing<lb/> else out of pap, I
                        learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people<lb/> is to let
                        them have their own way.</p>

                        and our nigger, Jim.<lb/> That warn't enough to take us fourteen hundred
                        mile, deck passage nor no other<lb/> way. Well, when the river rose, pa had
                        a streak of luck one day; he ketched<lb/> this piece of a raft; so we
                        reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it. Pa's luck<lb/> didn't hold out; a

                        all went overboard and dove under the wheel; Jim and me come up, all<lb/>
                        right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four years old, so they never come up<lb/>
                        <pb n="168" entity="u000002472_0183"/> no more. Well, for the next day or
                        two we had considerable trouble, because<lb/> people was always coming out
                        in skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me,<lb/> saying they believed he
                        was a runaway nigger. We don't run day-times no more,<lb/> now; nights they
                        don't bother us."</p>
                    <p>The duke says&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the day-time if we

                        tick&#x2014;better than Jim's, which was a corn-shuck tick; there's<lb/>

                        and<lb/> when you roll over, the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over
                        in a pile of<lb/> dead leaves; it makes such a rustling that you wake up.
                        Well, the duke allowed<lb/> he would take my bed; but the king allowed he
                        wouldn't. He says&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that
                        a<lb/> corn-shuck bed warn't just fitten for me to sleep on. Your Grace'll
                        take the<lb/> shuck bed yourself."</p>
                    <p>Jim and me was in a sweat again, for a minute, being afraid there was
                        going<lb/> to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when
                        the duke<lb/> says&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of<lb/>
                        oppression. Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I
                        submit;<lb/> 'tis my fate. I am alone in the world&#x2014;let me suffer;
                        I can bear it."</p>
                    <p>We got away as soon as it was good and dark. The king told us to stand
                        well<lb/> out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we
                        got a long ways<lb/> below the town. We come in sight of the little bunch of
                        lights by-and-by&#x2014;that<lb/> was the town, you know&#x2014;and
                        slid by, about a half a mile out, all right. When<lb/> we was three-quarters
                        of a mile below, we hoisted up our signal lantern; and<lb/>
                        <pb n="169" entity="u000002472_0184"/> about ten o'clock it come on to rain
                        and blow and thunder and lighten like <reg orig="every-|thing"
                            >everything</reg>;<lb/> so the king told us to both stay on watch till
                        the weather got better;<lb/> then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam
                        and turned in for the night. It<lb/> was my watch below, till twelve, but I
                        wouldn't a turned in, anyway, if I'd had a<lb/> bed; because a body don't
                        see such a storm as that every day in the week, not by<lb/> a long sight. My
                        souls, how the wind did scream along! And every second or<lb/> two there'd
                        come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and<lb/>
                        you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees
                        thrashing<lb/> around in the wind; then comes a <hi rend="italic"
                            >h-wack!</hi>&#x2014;bum! bum! bumble-umble-<reg
                            orig="um-|bum-bum-bum-bum&#x2014;and"
                            >umbum-bum-bum-bum&#x2014;and</reg><lb/> the thunder would go
                        rumbling and grumbling away,<lb/> and quit&#x2014;and then <hi
                            rend="italic">rip</hi> comes another flash and another sockdolager. The
                        waves<lb/> most washed me off the raft, sometimes, but I hadn't any clothes
                        on, and didn't<lb/> mind. We didn't have no trouble about snags; the
                        lightning was glaring<lb/> and flittering around so constant that we could
                        see them plenty soon enough to<lb/> throw her head this way or that and miss
                        them.</p>
                    <p>I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time, so
                        Jim<lb/> he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always
                        mighty good,<lb/> that way, Jim was. I crawled into the wigwam, but the king
                        and the duke had<lb/> their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show for
                        me; so I laid outside&#x2014;I<lb/> didn't mind the rain, because it was
                        warm, and the waves warn't running so<lb/> high, now. About two they come up
                        again, though, and Jim was going to call<lb/> me, but he changed his mind
                        because he reckoned they warn't high enough yet<lb/> to do any harm; but he
                        was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden<lb/> along comes a
                        regular ripper, and washed me overboard. It most killed Jim<lb/> a-laughing.
                        He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.</p>
                    <p>I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by-and-by
                        the<lb/> storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that
                        showed, I rousted<lb/> him out and we slid the raft into hiding-quarters for
                        the day.</p>
                    <p>The king got out an old ratty deck of cards, after breakfast, and him and
                        the<lb/> duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game. Then they got
                        tired of it, and<lb/> allowed they would "lay out a campaign," as they
                        called it. The duke went<lb/> down into his carpet-bag and fetched up a lot
                        of little printed bills, and read<lb/>
                        <pb n="170" entity="u000002472_0185"/> them out loud. One bill said "The
                        celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban of<lb/> Paris," would "lecture on the
                        Science of Phrenology" at such and such a place,<lb/> on the blank day of
                        blank, at ten cents admission, and "furnish charts of <reg
                            orig="charac-|ter">character</reg><lb/> at twenty-five cents apiece."
                        The duke said that was <hi rend="italic">him.</hi> In another bill he<lb/>
                        was the "world renowned Shaksperean tragedian, Garrick the Younger, of
                        Drury<lb/> Lane, London." In other bills he had a lot of other names and
                        done other<lb/> wonderful things, like finding water and gold with a
                        "divining rod," "<reg orig="dissipat-|ing">dissipating</reg><lb/>
                        witch-spells," and so on. By-and-by he says&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"But the histrionic muse is the darling. Have you ever trod the boards,<lb/>
                        Royalty?"</p>
                    <p>"No," says the king.</p>
                    <p>"You shall, then, before<lb/> you're three days older, Fallen<lb/> Grandeur,"
                        says the duke. "The<lb/> first good town we come to, we'll<lb/> hire a hall
                        and do the sword-fight<lb/> in Richard III. and the balcony<lb/> scene in
                        Romeo and Juliet. How<lb/> does that strike you?"</p>

                    <p>So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was, and who Juliet was, and<lb/>
                        said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.</p>

                        the parts."</p>
                    <p>He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was
                        meedyevil<lb/> armor for Richard III. and t'other chap, and a long white
                        cotton night-shirt<lb/> and a ruffled night-cap to match. The king was
                        satisfied; so the duke got out<lb/> his book and read the parts over in the
                        most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing<lb/> around and acting at the same
                        time, to show how it had got to be done; then<lb/> he give the book to the
                        king and told him to get his part by heart.</p>
                    <p>There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and<lb/>
                        after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to
                        run<lb/> in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he
                        would<lb/> go down to the town and fix that thing. The king allowed he would
                        go<lb/> too, and see if he couldn't strike something. We was out of coffee,
                        so Jim<lb/> said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.</p>
                    <p>When we got there, there warn't nobody stirring; streets empty, and<lb/>
                        perfectly dead and still, like Sunday. We found a sick nigger sunning <reg
                            orig="him-|self">himself</reg><lb/> in a back yard, and he said
                        everybody that warn't too young or too sick<lb/> or too old, was gone to
                        camp-meeting, about two mile back in the woods.<lb/> The king got the
                        directions, and allowed he'd go and work that camp-meeting<lb/> for all it
                        was worth, and I might go, too.</p>
                    <p>The duke said what he was after was a printing office. We found it; a
                        little<lb/> bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop&#x2014;carpenters
                        and printers all gone to<lb/> the meeting, and no doors locked. It was a
                        dirty, littered-up place, and had<lb/> ink marks, and handbills with
                        pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them,<lb/> all over the walls. The
                        duke shed his coat and said he was all right, now. So<lb/> me and the king
                        lit out for the camp-meeting.</p>
                    <p>We got there in about a half an hour, fairly dripping, for it was a most awful<lb/>
                        <pb n="172" entity="u000002472_0187"/> hot day. There was as much as a
                        thousand people there, from twenty mile<lb/> around. The woods was full of
                        teams and wagons, hitched everywheres, feeding<lb/> out of the wagon troughs
                        and stomping to keep off the flies. There was sheds<lb/> made out of poles
                        and roofed over with branches, where they had lemonade and<lb/> gingerbread
                        to sell, and piles of watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.</p>
                    <p>The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was<lb/>
                        bigger and held crowds of people. The benches was made out of outside slabs
                        of<lb/> logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for
                        legs. They<lb/> didn't have no backs. The<lb/> preachers had high
                        platforms<lb/> to stand on, at one end of the<lb/> sheds. The women had on

                        gingham<lb/> ones, and a few of the young<lb/> ones had on calico. Some of
                        the<lb/> young men was barefooted, and<lb/> some of the children didn't
                        have<lb/> on any clothes but just a <reg orig="tow-|linen"
                        >towlinen</reg><lb/> shirt. Some of the old<lb/> women was knitting, and
                        some<lb/> of the young folks was courting<lb/> on the sly.</p>

                    <p>The first shed we come to,<lb/> the preacher was lining out a<lb/> hymn. He
                        lined out two lines,<lb/> everybody sung it, and it was<lb/> kind of grand
                        to hear it, there<lb/> was so many of them and they<lb/> done it in such a

                        and so on. The people woke up more and more, and sung louder and
                        louder;<lb/> and towards the end, some begun to groan, and some begun to
                        shout. Then the<lb/>
                        <pb n="173" entity="u000002472_0188"/> preacher begun to preach; and begun
                        in earnest, too; and went weaving first to<lb/> one side of the platform and
                        then the other, and then a leaning down over the<lb/> front of it, with his
                        arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his words<lb/> out with
                        all his might; and every now and then he would hold up his Bible and<lb/>
                        spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and that, shouting,
                        "It's the<lb/> brazen serpent in the wilderness! Look upon it and live!" And
                        people would<lb/> shout out, "Glory!&#x2014;A-a-<hi rend="italic"
                            >men!"</hi> And so he went on, and the people groaning<lb/> and crying
                        and saying amen:</p>
                    <p>"Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! <hi rend="italic"

                        and shouted, and flung themselves<lb/> down on the straw, just crazy and
                        wild.</p>
                    <p>Well, the first I knowed, the king got agoing; and you could hear him
                        over<lb/> everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform and
                        the preacher<lb/> he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. He
                        told them he was a<lb/> pirate&#x2014;been a pirate for thirty years,
                        out in the Indian Ocean, and his crew<lb/> was thinned out considerable,
                        last spring, in a fight, and he was home now, to<lb/> take out some fresh
                        men, and thanks to goodness he'd been robbed last night,<lb/> and put ashore
                        off of a steamboat without a cent, and he was glad of it, it was<lb/> the
                        blessedest thing that ever happened to him, because he was a changed
                        man<lb/> now, and happy for the first time in his life; and poor as he was,
                        he was<lb/> going to start right off and work his way back to the Indian
                        Ocean and put<lb/> in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into
                        the true path; for he<lb/> could do it better than anybody else, being
                        acquainted with all the pirate crews<lb/>
                        <pb n="174" entity="u000002472_0189"/> in that ocean; and though it would
                        take him a long time to get there, without<lb/> money, he would get there
                        anyway, and every time he convinced a pirate he<lb/> would say to him,
                        "Don't you thank me, don't you give me no credit, it all<lb/> belongs to
                        them dear people in<lb/> Pokeville camp-meeting, natural<lb/> brothers and
                        benefactors of the race<lb/> &#x2014;and that dear preacher there,
                        the<lb/> truest friend a pirate ever had!"</p>
                    <p>And then he busted into tears,<lb/> and so did everybody. Then <reg
                            orig="some-|body">somebody</reg><lb/> sings out, "Take up a <reg
                            orig="collec-|tion">collection</reg><lb/> for him, take up a
                        collection!"<lb/> Well, a half a dozen made a jump<lb/> to do it, but
                        somebody sings out,<lb/> "Let <hi rend="italic">him</hi> pass the hat
                        around!"<lb/> Then everybody said it, the preacher<lb/> too.</p>

                    <p>So the king went all through<lb/> the crowd with his hat, swabbing<lb/> his
                        eyes, and blessing the people<lb/> and praising them and thanking<lb/> them
                        for being so good to the<lb/> poor pirates away off there; and every little
                        while the prettiest kind of girls,<lb/> with the tears running down their
                        cheeks, would up and ask him would he let<lb/> them kiss him, for to
                        remember him by; and he always done it; and some of<lb/> them he hugged and
                        kissed as many as five or six times&#x2014;and he was invited to<lb/>
                        stay a week; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses, and said
                        they'd<lb/> think it was an honor; but he said as this was the last day of
                        the camp-meeting<lb/> he couldn't do no good, and besides he was in a sweat
                        to get to the Indian Ocean<lb/> right off and go to work on the pirates.</p>
                    <p>When we got back to the raft and he come to count up, he found he had <reg

                        seventy-five cents. And then he had fetched<lb/>
                        <pb n="175" entity="u000002472_0190"/> away a three-gallon jug of whisky,
                        too, that he found under a wagon when we<lb/> was starting home through the
                        woods. The king said, take it all around, it laid<lb/> over any day he'd
                        ever put in in the missionarying line. He said it warn't no use<lb/>
                        talking, heathens don't amount to shucks, alongside of pirates, to work a

                    <p>The duke was thinking <hi rend="italic">he'd</hi> been doing pretty well,
                        till the king come to<lb/> show up, but after that he didn't think so so
                        much. He had set up and printed<lb/> off two little jobs for farmers, in
                        that printing office&#x2014;horse bills&#x2014;and took the<lb/>
                        money, four dollars. And he had got in ten dollars worth of advertisements
                        for<lb/> the paper, which he said he would put in for four dollars if they
                        would pay in<lb/> advance&#x2014;so they done it. The<lb/> price of the
                        paper was two <reg orig="dol-|lars">dollars</reg><lb/> a year, but he took
                        in three<lb/> subscriptions for half a dollar<lb/> apiece on condition of
                        them<lb/> paying him in advance; they<lb/> were going to pay in
                        cord-wood<lb/> and onions, as usual, but he<lb/> said he had just bought the
                            <reg orig="con-|cern">concern</reg><lb/> and knocked down the<lb/> price
                        as low as he could afford it,<lb/> and was going to run it for<lb/> cash. He
                        set up a little piece<lb/> of poetry, which he made, <reg orig="him-|self"
                            >himself</reg>,<lb/> out of his own head&#x2014;three<lb/>
                        verses&#x2014;kind of sweet and <reg orig="sad-|dish&#x2014;the"
                            >saddish&#x2014;the</reg><lb/> name of it was,<lb/> "Yes, crush,
                        cold world, this<lb/> breaking heart"&#x2014;and he left<lb/> that all
                        set up and ready to<lb/> print in the paper and didn't charge nothing for
                        it. Well, he took in nine<lb/> dollars and a half, and said he'd done a
                        pretty square day's work for it.</p>

                    <p>Then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged
                        for,<lb/> because it was for us. It had a picture of a runaway nigger, with
                        a bundle on<lb/> a stick, over his shoulder, and "$200 reward" under it. The
                        reading was all<lb/> about Jim, and just described him to a dot. It said he
                        run away from St.<lb/> Jacques' plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,
                        last winter, and likely went<lb/> north, and whoever would catch him and
                        send him back, he could have the<lb/> reward and expenses.</p>
                    <p>"Now," says the duke, "after to-night we can run in the daytime if we<lb/>
                        want to. Whenever we see anybody coming, we can tie Jim hand and foot<lb/>
                        with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we
                        captured<lb/> him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat,
                        so we got this<lb/> little raft on credit from our friends and are going
                        down to get the reward.<lb/> Handcuffs and chains would look still better on
                        Jim, but it wouldn't go well<lb/> with the story of us being so poor. Too
                        much like jewelry. Ropes are the <reg orig="cor-|rect">correct</reg><lb/>
                        thing&#x2014;we must preserve the unities, as we say on the boards."</p>
                    <p>We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn't be no trouble
                        about<lb/> running daytimes. We judged we could make miles enough that night
                        to get<lb/> out of the reach of the pow-wow we reckoned the duke's work in
                        the printing office<lb/> was going to make in that little
                        town&#x2014;then we could boom right along, if we<lb/> wanted to.</p>
                    <p>We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten o'clock;
                        then<lb/> we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn't hoist our
                        lantern till we<lb/> was clear out of sight of it.</p>
                    <p>When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he
                        says&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"Huck, does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo' kings on dis<lb/>
                        trip?"</p>
                    <p>"No," I says, "I reckon not."</p>
                    <p>"Well," says he, "dat's all right, den. I doan' mine one er two kings,
                        but<lb/> dat's enough. Dis one's powerful drunk, en de duke ain' much
                        better."</p>
                    <p>I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear
                        what<lb/> it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and
                        had so much<lb/> trouble, he'd forgot it.</p>

                        britches, and<lb/> let his legs dangle in the water, so as<lb/> to be
                        comfortable, and lit his pipe, and<lb/> went to getting his Romeo and

                        begun to<lb/> practice it together. The duke had to<lb/> learn him over and
                        over again, how to<lb/> say every speech; and he made him sigh, and put his
                        hand on his heart, and<lb/> after while he said he done it pretty well;

                    <p>Well, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he
                        could<lb/> do it first rate. It seemed like he was just born for it; and
                        when he had his<lb/> hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the
                        way he would rip and tear<lb/> and rair up behind when he was getting it

                    <p>The first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; and
                        after<lb/> that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a
                        most uncommon<lb/> lively place, for there warn't nothing but sword-fighting
                        and rehearsing&#x2014;as the<lb/> duke called it&#x2014;going on all
                        the time. One morning, when we was pretty well<lb/> down the State of
                        Arkansaw, we come in sight of a little one-horse town in a big<lb/> bend; so
                        we tied up about three-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a<lb/>
                        crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us
                        but Jim<lb/> took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any
                        chance in that place<lb/> for our show.</p>
                    <p>We struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that <reg
                            orig="after-|noon">afternoon</reg>,<lb/> and the country people was
                        already beginning to come in, in all kinds of<lb/> old shackly wagons, and
                        on horses. The circus would leave before night, so our<lb/> show would have
                        a pretty good chance. The duke he hired the court house, and<lb/> we went
                        around and stuck up our bills. They read like this: <q> Shaksperean Revival

                    <p>Then we went loafing around the town. The stores and houses was most all
                        old<lb/> shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn't ever been painted; they
                        was set up<lb/> three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out
                        of reach of the water<lb/> when the river was overflowed. The houses had
                        little gardens around them, but<lb/> they didn't seem to raise hardly
                        anything in them but jimpson weeds, and <reg orig="sun-|flowers"
                            >sunflowers</reg>,<lb/> and ash-piles, and old curled-up boots and
                        shoes, and pieces of bottles,<lb/> and rags, and played-out tin-ware. The
                        fences was made of different kinds of<lb/> boards, nailed on at different
                        times; and they leaned every which-way, and had<lb/> gates that didn't
                        generly have but one hinge&#x2014;a leather one. Some of the fences<lb/>
                        had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in<lb/>
                        Clumbus's time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and
                        people<lb/> driving them out.</p>
                    <p>All the stores was along one street. They had white-domestic awnings in<lb/>
                        front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts.<lb/>
                        There was empty dry-goods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting<lb/>
                        on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and <reg
                            orig="chaw-|ing">chawing</reg><lb/> tobacco, and gaping and yawning and
                        stretching&#x2014;a mighty ornery lot.<lb/> They generly had on yellow
                        straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but<lb/> didn't wear no coats nor
                        waistcoats; they called one another Bill, and Buck,<lb/>
                        <pb n="182" entity="u000002472_0197"/> and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and
                        talked lazy and drawly, and used <reg orig="con-|siderable"
                            >considerable</reg><lb/> many cuss-words. There was as many as one
                        loafer leaning up<lb/> against every awning-post, and he most always had his
                        hands in his britches<lb/> pockets, except when he fetched<lb/> them out to
                        lend a chaw of <reg orig="to-|bacco">tobacco</reg><lb/> or scratch. What a
                        body<lb/> was hearing amongst them, all<lb/> the time was&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"Gimme a chaw 'v tobacker,<lb/> Hank."</p>
                    <p>"Cain't&#x2014;I hain't got but one<lb/> chaw left. Ask Bill."</p>
                    <p>Maybe Bill he gives him a<lb/> chaw; maybe he lies and says<lb/> he ain't got
                        none. Some of<lb/> them kinds of loafers never has<lb/> a cent in the world,
                        nor a chaw<lb/> of tobacco of their own. They<lb/> get all their chawing by

                        gnaw with their teeth<lb/> and tug at the plug with their hands till they
                        get it in two&#x2014;then sometimes the<lb/> one that owns the tobacco
                        looks mournful at it when it's handed back, and<lb/> says,

                        where folks had to walk<lb/> around her, and she'd stretch out, and shut her

                        there was a<lb/> dog-fight. There couldn't anything wake them up all over,
                        and make them<lb/> happy all over, like a dog-fight&#x2014;unless it

                        yet, but it<lb/> was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide
                        as a house caves<lb/> in at a time. Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a

                        into the river in one summer.<lb/> Such a town as that has to be always

                        him, and<lb/> sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he'd attend to them
                        and lay them out in<lb/> their regular turns, but he couldn't wait now,
                        because he'd come to town to kill<lb/> old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto
                        was, "meat first, and spoon vittles to top<lb/> off on."</p>
                    <p>He see me, and rode up and says&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"Whar'd you come f'm, boy? You prepared to die?"</p>
                    <p>Then he rode on. I was scared; but a man says&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"He don't mean nothing; he's always a carryin' on like that, when he's<lb/>
                        drunk. He's the best-naturedest old fool in Arkansaw&#x2014;never hurt
                        nobody,<lb/> drunk nor sober."</p>
                    <p>Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town and bent his head down so
                        he<lb/> could see under the curtain of the awning, and yells&#x2014;</p>
                    <pb n="185" entity="u000002472_0200"/>
                    <p>"Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you've swindled.<lb/>
                        You're the houn' I'm after, and I'm a gwyne to have you, too!"</p>
                    <p>And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue
                        to,<lb/> and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and
                        going on.<lb/> By-and-by a proud-looking man about fifty-five&#x2014;and
                        he was a heap the best<lb/> dressed man in that town, too&#x2014;steps
                        out of the store, and the crowd drops back<lb/> on each side to let him
                        come. He says to Boggs, mighty ca'm and slow&#x2014;he says:</p>
                    <p>"I'm tired of this; but I'll endure it till one o'clock. Till one o'clock,
                        mind&#x2014;<lb/> no longer. If you open your mouth against me only
                        once, after that time, you<lb/> can't travel so far but I will find
                        you."</p>

                    <p>Then he turns and goes in. The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody
                        stirred,<lb/> and there warn't no more laughing. Boggs rode off
                        blackguarding Sherburn<lb/> as loud as he could yell, all down the street;
                        and pretty soon back he comes and<lb/> stops before the store, still keeping
                        it up. Some men crowded around him<lb/> and tried to get him to shut up, but
                        he wouldn't; they told him it would be one<lb/> o'clock in about fifteen
                        minutes, and so he <hi rend="italic">must</hi> go home&#x2014;he must go
                        right<lb/> away. But it didn't do no good. He cussed away, with all his
                        might, and<lb/>
                        <pb n="186" entity="u000002472_0201"/> throwed his hat down in the mud and
                        rode over it, and pretty soon away he went<lb/> a-raging down the street
                        again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that<lb/> could get a chance
                        at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they<lb/> could lock
                        him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use&#x2014;up the street
                        he<lb/> would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing. By-and-by
                        somebody says&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"Go for his daughter!&#x2014;quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he'll
                        listen to<lb/> her. If anybody can persuade him, she can."</p>
                    <p>So somebody started on a run. I walked down street a ways, and stopped.<lb/>
                        In about five or ten minutes, here comes Boggs again&#x2014;but not on
                        his horse. He<lb/> was a-reeling across the street towards me, bareheaded,
                        with a friend on both<lb/> sides of him aholt of his arms and hurrying him
                        along. He was quiet, and<lb/> looked uneasy; and he warn't hanging back any,
                        but was doing some of the<lb/> hurrying himself. Somebody sings
                        out&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"Boggs!"</p>
                    <p>I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel Sherburn.
                        He<lb/> was standing perfectly still, in the street, and had a pistol raised
                        in his right<lb/> hand&#x2014;not aiming it, but holding it out with the
                        barrel tilted up towards the sky.<lb/> The same second I see a young girl
                        coming on the run, and two men with her.<lb/> Boggs and the men turned
                        round, to see who called him, and when they<lb/> see the pistol the men
                        jumped to one side, and the pistol barrel come<lb/> down slow and steady to
                        a level&#x2014;both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up<lb/> both of his
                        hands, and says, "O Lord, don't shoot!" Bang! goes the<lb/> first shot, and
                        he staggers back clawing at the air&#x2014;bang! goes the second
                        one,<lb/> and he tumbles backwards onto the ground, heavy and solid, with
                        his arms<lb/> spread out. That young girl screamed out, and comes rushing,
                        and down<lb/> she throws herself on her father, crying, and saying, "Oh,
                        he's killed him,<lb/> he's killed him!" The crowd closed up around them, and
                        shouldered and<lb/> jammed one another, with their necks stretched, trying
                        to see, and people on<lb/> the inside trying to shove them back, and
                        shouting, "Back, back! give him air,<lb/> give him air!"</p>
                    <p>Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol onto the ground, and turned around
                        on<lb/> his heels and walked off.</p>
                    <pb n="187" entity="u000002472_0202"/>
                    <p>They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around, just the
                        same,<lb/> and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good place
                        at the window,<lb/> where I was close to him and could see in. They laid him
                        on the floor, and put one<lb/> large Bible under his head, and opened
                        another one and spread it on his breast&#x2014;<lb/> but they tore open
                        his shirt<lb/> first, and I seen where one of<lb/> the bullets went in. He
                        made<lb/> about a dozen long gasps, his<lb/> breast lifting the Bible up
                        when<lb/> he drawed in his breath, and<lb/> letting it down again when
                        he<lb/> breathed it out&#x2014;and after that<lb/> he laid still; he was
                        dead.<lb/> Then they pulled his daughter<lb/> away from him, screaming
                        and<lb/> crying, and took her off. She<lb/> was about sixteen, and very<lb/>
                        sweet and gentle-looking, but<lb/> awful pale and scared.</p>

                    <p>Well, pretty soon the whole<lb/> town was there, squirming and<lb/> scrouging
                        and pushing and<lb/> shoving to get at the window<lb/> and have a look, but
                        people<lb/> that had the places wouldn't<lb/> give them up, and folks
                        behind<lb/> them was saying all the time, "Say, now, you've looked enough,

                    <p>There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe there
                        was<lb/> going to be trouble. The streets was full, and everybody was
                        excited. <reg orig="Every-|body">Everybody</reg><lb/> that seen the shooting
                        was telling how it happened, and there was a big<lb/>
                        <pb n="188" entity="u000002472_0203"/> crowd packed around each one of these
                        fellows, stretching their necks and<lb/> listening. One long lanky man, with
                        long hair and a big white fur stove-pipe<lb/> hat on the back of his head,
                        and a crooked-handled cane, marked out the places<lb/> on the ground where
                        Boggs stood, and where Sherburn stood, and the people<lb/> following him
                        around from one place to t'other and watching everything he done,<lb/> and
                        bobbing their heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and<lb/>
                        resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the
                        ground<lb/> with his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where
                        Sherburn had<lb/> stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his
                        eyes, and sung out,<lb/> "Boggs!" and then fetched his cane down slow to a
                        level, and says "Bang!"<lb/> staggered backwards, says "Bang!" again, and
                        fell down flat on his back. The<lb/> people that had seen the thing said he
                        done it perfect; said it was just exactly<lb/> the way it all happened. Then
                        as much as a dozen people got out their bottles<lb/> and treated him.</p>
                    <p>Well, by-and-by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched. In about a<lb/>
                        minute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and<lb/>
                        snatching down every clothes-line they come to, to do the hanging with.</p>

                    <p>Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch, with a<lb/>

                    <p>Sherburn never said a word&#x2014;just stood there, looking down. The

                    <p>Then he says, slow and scornful:</p>

                    <p>"Do I know you? I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the<lb/>

                        off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking <reg

                        wanted to, but I didn't want to.</p>
                    <p>I went to the circus, and loafed around the back side till the watchman
                        went<lb/> by, and then dived in under the tent. I had my twenty-dollar gold
                        piece and<lb/> some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because
                        there ain't no telling<lb/>
                        <pb n="192" entity="u000002472_0207"/> how soon you are going to need it,

                        careful. I ain't opposed to spending money on circuses,<lb/> when there
                        ain't no other way, but there ain't no use in <hi rend="italic">wasting</hi>
                        it on them.</p>
                    <p>It was a real bully circus. It was the splendidest sight that ever was,
                        when<lb/> they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side
                        by side, the<lb/> men just in their drawers and under-shirts, and no shoes
                        nor stirrups, and resting<lb/> their hands on their thighs, easy and
                        comfortable&#x2014;there must a' been twenty of<lb/> them&#x2014;and
                        every lady with a lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and<lb/>
                        looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes
                        that<lb/> cost millions of dollars, and just littered with diamonds. It was
                        a powerful fine<lb/> sight; I never see anything so lovely. And then one by
                        one they got up and<lb/> stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle
                        and wavy and graceful, the<lb/> men looking ever so tall and airy and
                        straight, with their heads bobbing and<lb/> skimming along, away up there
                        under the tent-roof, and every lady's rose-leafy<lb/> dress flapping soft
                        and silky around her hips, and she looking like the most <reg
                            orig="love-|liest">loveliest</reg><lb/> parasol.</p>
                    <p>And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one foot
                        stuck<lb/> out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and
                        more, and the<lb/> ring-master going round and round the centre-pole,
                        cracking his whip and<lb/> shouting "hi!&#x2014;hi!" and the clown
                        cracking jokes behind him; and by-<reg orig="and-|by">and-by</reg><lb/> all
                        hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her knuckles on her hips
                        and<lb/> every gentleman folded his arms, and then how the horses did lean
                        over and<lb/> hump themselves! And so, one after the other they all skipped
                        off into the ring,<lb/> and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and then
                        scampered out, and everybody<lb/> clapped their hands and went just about
                        wild.</p>
                    <p>Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and
                        all<lb/> the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people. The
                        ring-master<lb/> couldn't ever say a word to him but he was back at him
                        quick as a wink with the<lb/> funniest things a body ever said; and how he
                        ever <hi rend="italic">could</hi> think of so many of<lb/> them, and so
                        sudden and so pat, was what I couldn't noway understand. Why,<lb/> I
                        couldn't a thought of them in a year. And by-and-by a drunk man tried
                        to<lb/> get into the ring&#x2014;said he wanted to ride; said he could
                        ride as well as anybody<lb/>
                        <pb n="193" entity="u000002472_0208"/> that ever was. They argued and tried
                        to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen,<lb/> and the whole show come to a
                        standstill. Then the people begun to holler at<lb/> him and make fun of him,
                        and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and<lb/> tear; so that stirred up
                        the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of<lb/> the benches and
                        swarm towards the ring, saying, "Knock him down! throw<lb/> him out!" and
                        one or two women begun to scream. So, then, the ring-master<lb/> he made a
                        little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance, and<lb/>
                        if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble, he would let
                        him<lb/> ride, if he thought he could stay on the horse. So everybody
                        laughed and said all<lb/> right, and the man got on.<lb/> The minute he was
                        on, the<lb/> horse begun to rip and tear<lb/> and jump and cavort
                        around,<lb/> with two circus men hanging<lb/> onto his bridle trying to
                        hold<lb/> him, and the drunk man<lb/> hanging onto his neck, and<lb/> his
                        heels flying in the air every<lb/> jump, and the whole crowd<lb/> of people
                        standing up <reg orig="shout-|ing">shouting</reg><lb/> and laughing till the
                        tears<lb/> rolled down. And at last,<lb/> sure enough, all the circus<lb/>
                        men could do, the horse broke<lb/> loose, and away he went like<lb/> the
                        very nation, round and<lb/> round the ring, with that sot<lb/> laying down
                        on him and <reg orig="hang-|ing">hanging</reg><lb/> to his neck, with first
                        one<lb/> leg hanging most to the ground<lb/> on one side, and then t'other
                        one on t'other side, and the people just crazy. It<lb/> warn't funny to me,
                        though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. But</p>

                    <p>pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this
                        way<lb/> and that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle
                        and stood!<lb/> and the horse agoing like a house afire too. He just stood
                        up there, a-sailing<lb/> around as easy and comfortable as if he warn't ever
                        drunk in his life&#x2014;and then<lb/> he begun to pull off his clothes
                        and sling them. He shed them so thick they<lb/> kind of clogged up the air,
                        and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And then,<lb/> there he was, slim
                        and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you<lb/> ever saw, and
                        he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly
                        hum&#x2014;<lb/> and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced
                        off to the dressing-room,<lb/> and everybody just a-howling with pleasure
                        and astonishment.</p>
                    <p>Then the ring-master he see how he had been fooled, and he <hi rend="italic"
                            >was</hi> the sickest<lb/> ring-master you ever see, I reckon. Why, it

                        head, and never let on to nobody. Well, I<lb/> felt sheepish enough, to be

                        there may be bullier<lb/> circuses than what that one was, but I never
                        struck them yet. Anyways it was<lb/> plenty good enough for <hi

                            <hi rend="italic">my</hi><lb/> custom, every time.</p>
                    <p>Well, that night we had <hi rend="italic">our</hi> show; but there warn't
                        only about twelve<lb/> people there; just enough to pay expenses. And they
                        laughed all the time, and<lb/> that made the duke mad; and everybody left,
                        anyway, before the show was over,<lb/> but one boy which was asleep. So the
                        duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads<lb/> couldn't come up to Shakspeare; what

                        than low comedy, he reckoned. He said he could<lb/> size their style. So
                        next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping-paper and<lb/> some black

                    <p>Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says
                        the<lb/> great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts
                        of pressing<lb/> London engagements, where the seats is all sold aready for
                        it in Drury Lane;<lb/> and then he makes them another bow, and says if he
                        has succeeded in pleasing<lb/> them and instructing them, he will be deeply
                        obleeged if they will mention it to<lb/> their friends and get them to come
                        and see it.</p>
                    <p>Twenty people sings out:</p>
                    <p>"What, is it over? Is that <hi rend="italic">all?"</hi></p>
                    <p>The duke says yes. Then there was a fine time. Everybody sings out
                        "sold,"<lb/> and rose up mad, and was agoing for that stage and them
                        tragedians. But a big<lb/> fine-looking man jumps up on a bench, and
                        shouts:</p>
                    <p>"Hold on! Just a word, gentlemen." They stopped to listen. "We are<lb/>
                        sold&#x2014;mighty badly sold. But we don't want to be the
                        laughing-stock of this<lb/> whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of
                        this thing as long as we live.<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">No.</hi> What we want, is to go out of here quiet, and
                        talk this show up, and sell<lb/> the <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> of the
                        town! Then we'll all be in the same boat. Ain't that sensible?"<lb/>
                        &lpar;"You bet it is!&#x2014;the jedge is right!" everybody sings
                        out.&rpar; "All right, then<lb/> &#x2014;not a word about any sell.
                        Go along home, and advise everybody to come and<lb/> see the tragedy."</p>
                    <p>Next day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how splendid
                        that<lb/> show was. House was jammed again, that night, and we sold this
                        crowd the<lb/> same way. When me and the king and the duke got home to the
                        raft, we all had<lb/> a supper; and by-and-by, about midnight, they made Jim
                        and me back her out<lb/> and float her down the middle of the river and
                        fetch her in and hide her about<lb/> two mile below town.</p>
                    <p>The third night the house was crammed again&#x2014;and they warn't
                        new-comers,<lb/> this time, but people that was at the show the other two
                        nights. I stood by<lb/> the duke at the door, and I see that every man that
                        went in had his pockets<lb/> bulging, or something muffled up under his
                        coat&#x2014;and I see it warn't no <reg orig="per-|fumery"
                            >perfumery</reg><lb/> neither, not by a long sight. I smelt sickly eggs
                        by the barrel, and<lb/>
                        <pb n="198" entity="u000002472_0213"/> rotten cabbages, and such things; and
                        if I know the signs of a dead cat being<lb/> around, and I bet I do, there
                        was sixty-four of them went in. I shoved in<lb/> there for a minute, but it
                        was too<lb/> various for me, I couldn't stand it.<lb/> Well, when the place
                        couldn't hold no<lb/> more people, the duke he give a fellow<lb/> a quarter
                        and told him to tend door for<lb/> him a minute, and then he started<lb/>
                        around for the stage door, I after him;<lb/> but the minute we turned the
                        corner<lb/> and was in the dark, he says:</p>
                    <p>"Walk fast, now, till you get away<lb/> from the houses, and then shin for
                        the<lb/> raft like the dickens was after you!"</p>
                    <p>I done it, and he done the same. We<lb/> struck the raft at the same time,
                        and in<lb/> less than two seconds we was gliding<lb/> down stream, all dark
                        and still, and<lb/> edging towards the middle of the river,<lb/> nobody
                        saying a word. I reckoned the<lb/> poor king was in for a gaudy time of<lb/>
                        it with the audience; but nothing of<lb/> the sort; pretty soon he crawls
                        out from under the wigwam, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Well, how'd the old thing pan out this time, Duke?"</p>

                        before.</p>
                    <p>By-and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:</p>
                    <p>"Don't it 'sprise you, de way dem kings carries on, Huck?"</p>
                    <p>"No," I says, "it don't."</p>
                    <p>"Why don't it, Huck?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, it don't, because it's in the breed. I reckon they're all alike."</p>
                    <p>"But, Huck, dese kings o'ourn is regular rapscallions; dat's jist what

                    <p>"Well, that's what I'm a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as fur

                    <p>"Is dat so?"</p>
                    <p>"You read about them once&#x2014;you'll see. Look at Henry the
                        Eight;<lb/> this'n's a Sunday-School Superintendent to <hi rend="italic"
                            >him.</hi> And look at Charles Second,<lb/> and Louis Fourteen, and

                        and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that<lb/> used to rip
                        around so in old times and raise Cain. My, you ought to seen old<lb/> Henry
                        the Eight when he was in bloom. He <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a blossom. He
                        used to marry<lb/> a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning.
                        And he would do it<lb/> just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs.
                        'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he<lb/> says. They fetch her up. Next morning, 'Chop
                        off her head!' And they<lb/> chop it off. 'Fetch up Jane Shore,' he says;
                        and up she comes. Next morning<lb/> 'Chop off her head'&#x2014;and they
                        chop it off. 'Ring up Fair Rosamun.' Fair<lb/> Rosamun answers the bell.
                        Next morning, 'Chop off her head.' And he made<lb/> every one of them tell
                        him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had<lb/> hogged a
                        thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book,<lb/>
                        and called it Domesday Book&#x2014;which was a good name and stated the
                        case.<lb/> You don't know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of
                        ourn is one<lb/> of the cleanest I've struck in history. Well, Henry he
                        takes a notion he wants<lb/> to get up some trouble with this country. How
                        does he go at it&#x2014;give notice? <pb n="200" entity="u000002472_0210"/> &#x2014;give the country a show? No. All
                        of a sudden he heaves all the tea in<lb/> Boston Harbor overboard, and
                        whacks out a declaration of independence, and<lb/> dares them to come on.
                        That was<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">his</hi> style&#x2014;he never give anybody a<lb/>
                        chance. He had suspicions of his<lb/> father, the Duke of Wellington.<lb/>
                        Well, what did he do?&#x2014;ask him to<lb/> show up?
                        No&#x2014;drownded him in<lb/> a butt of mamsey, like a cat. Spose<lb/>
                        people left money laying around<lb/> where he was&#x2014;what did he
                        do?<lb/> He collared it. Spose he contracted<lb/> to do a thing; and you
                        paid him,<lb/> and didn't set down there and see<lb/> that he done
                        it&#x2014;what did he do?<lb/> He always done the other thing.<lb/>
                        Spose he opened his mouth&#x2014;what<lb/> then? If he didn't shut it
                        up<lb/> powerful quick, he'd lose a lie, every<lb/> time. That's the kind of
                        a bug<lb/> Henry was; and if we'd a had him<lb/> along 'stead of our kings,
                        he'd a<lb/> fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done. I don't say that
                        ourn is lambs,<lb/> because they ain't, when you come right down to the cold
                        facts; but they ain't<lb/> nothing to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> old ram,
                        anyway. All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to<lb/> make allowances.
                        Take them all around, they're a mighty ornery lot. It's the<lb/> way they're

                    <p>What was the use to tell Jim these warn't real kings and dukes? It
                        wouldn't<lb/> a done no good; and besides, it was just as I said; you
                        couldn't tell them from<lb/> the real kind.</p>
                    <p>I went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn. He often
                        done<lb/> that. When I waked up, just at day-break, he was setting there
                        with his head<lb/> down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself.
                        I didn't take notice,<lb/> nor let on. I knowed what it was about. He was
                        thinking about his wife and<lb/> his children, away up yonder, and he was
                        low and homesick; because he hadn't<lb/> ever been away from home before in
                        his life; and I do believe he cared just as<lb/> much for his people as
                        white folks does for their'n. It don't seem natural, but I<lb/> reckon it's
                        so. He was often moaning and mourning that way, nights, when he<lb/> judged
                        I was asleep, and saying, "Po' little 'Lizabeth! po' little Johnny! its<lb/>
                        mighty hard; I spec' I ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo', no mo'!" He was
                        a<lb/> mighty good nigger, Jim was.</p>
                    <p>But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young

                        </hi> day, towards night, we laid up under<lb/> a little willow tow-head out
                        in the<lb/> middle, where there was a village on<lb/> each side of the
                        river, and the duke<lb/> and the king begun to lay out a<lb/> plan for
                        working them towns. Jim<lb/> he spoke to the duke, and said he<lb/> hoped it
                        wouldn't take but a few<lb/> hours, because it got mighty heavy<lb/> and
                        tiresome to him when he had<lb/> to lay all day in the wigwam tied<lb/> with
                        the rope. You see, when we<lb/> left him all alone we had to tie him,<lb/>
                        because if anybody happened on him<lb/> all by himself and not tied, it
                        wouldn't<lb/> look much like he was a runaway<lb/> nigger, you know. So the
                        duke said<lb/> it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> kind of hard to have to lay
                        roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to<lb/> get around it.</p>

                    <p>He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He dressed<lb/>
                        Jim up in King Lear's outfit&#x2014;it was a long curtain-calico gown,
                        and a white<lb/> horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his
                        theatre-paint and painted<lb/> Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all
                        over a dead dull solid blue, like a<lb/> man that's been drownded nine days.
                        Blamed if he warn't the horriblest looking<lb/> outrage I ever see. Then the
                        duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so&#x2014;</p>
                    <pb n="204" entity="u000002472_0219"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Sick Arab&#x2014;but harmless when not out of his
                            head.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five foot
                        in<lb/> front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was a sight
                        better than<lb/> laying tied a couple of years every day and trembling all
                        over every time there<lb/> was a sound. The duke told him to make himself
                        free and easy, and if <reg orig="any-|body">anybody</reg><lb/> ever come
                        meddling around, he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on<lb/> a little,
                        and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would<lb/>
                        light out and leave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you<lb/>
                        take the average man, and he wouldn't wait for him to howl. Why, he
                        didn't<lb/> only look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than
                        that.</p>
                    <p>These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was
                        so<lb/> much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe
                        the news<lb/> might a worked along down by this time. They couldn't hit no
                        project that<lb/> suited, exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd
                        lay off and work his<lb/> brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put
                        up something on the Arkansaw<lb/> village; and the king he allowed he would
                        drop over to t'other village, without any<lb/> plan, but just trust in
                        Providence to lead him the profitable way&#x2014;meaning the<lb/> devil,
                        I reckon. We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and
                        now<lb/> the king put his'n on, and he told me to put mine on. I done it, of
                        course. The<lb/> king's duds was all black, and he did look real swell and
                        starchy. I never knowed<lb/> how clothes could change a body before. Why,
                        before, he looked like the<lb/> orneriest old rip that ever was; but now,
                        when he'd take off his new white beaver<lb/> and make a bow and do a smile,
                        he looked that grand and good and pious that<lb/> you'd say he had walked
                        right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus<lb/> himself. Jim cleaned
                        up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready. There<lb/> was a big steamboat
                        laying at the shore away up under the point, about three<lb/> mile above
                        town&#x2014;been there a couple of hours, taking on freight. Says
                        the<lb/> king:</p>
                    <p>"Seein' how I'm dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.
                        Louis<lb/> or Cincinnati, or some other big place. Go for the steamboat,
                        Huckleberry;<lb/> we'll come down to the village on her."</p>
                    <p>I didn't have to be ordered twice, to go and take a steamboat ride. I fetched<lb/>
                        <pb n="205" entity="u000002472_0220"/> the shore a half a mile above the
                        village, and then went scooting along the bluff<lb/> bank in the easy water.
                        Pretty soon we come to a nice innocent-looking young<lb/> country jake
                        setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face, for it was<lb/>
                        powerful warm weather; and he had a couple of big carpet-bags by him.</p>
                    <p>"Run her nose in shore," says the king. I done it. "Wher' you bound for,<lb/>
                        young man?"</p>
                    <p>"For the steamboat; going to Orleans."</p>
                    <p>"Git aboard," says the king. "Hold on a minute, my servant 'll he'p you<lb/>
                        with them bags. Jump out and he'p the gentleman,
                        Adolphus"&#x2014;meaning<lb/> me, I see.</p>

                    <p>I done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap was<lb/>
                        mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such
                        weather.<lb/> He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him
                        he'd come<lb/> down the river and landed at the other village this morning,
                        and now he was<lb/> going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up

                    <p>"When I first see you, I says to myself, 'It's Mr. Wilks, sure, and he
                        come<lb/> mighty near getting here in time.' But then I says again, 'No, I
                        reckon it<lb/> ain't him, or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river.' You
                            <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> him, are<lb/> you?"</p>

                        missed anything by it&#x2014;which I hope he hasn't."</p>
                    <p>"Well, he don't miss any property by it, because he'll get that all
                        right;<lb/> but he's missed seeing his brother Peter die&#x2014;which he
                        mayn't mind, nobody<lb/> can tell as to that&#x2014;but his brother

                        before he died; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks;<lb/>
                        hadn't seen him since they was boys together&#x2014;and hadn't ever seen
                        his<lb/> brother William at all&#x2014;that's the deef and dumb
                        one&#x2014;William ain't more<lb/> than thirty or thirty-five. Peter and
                        George was the only ones that come out<lb/> here; George was the married
                        brother; him and his wife both died last year.<lb/> Harvey and William's the
                        only ones that's left now; and, as I was saying, they<lb/> haven't got here
                        in time."</p>
                    <p>"Did anybody send 'em word?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter<lb/>
                        said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this
                        time.<lb/> You see, he was pretty old, and George's g'yirls was too young to
                        be much<lb/> company for him, except Mary Jane the red-headed one; and so he
                        was<lb/> kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn't seem to
                        care much<lb/> to live. He most desperately wanted to see
                        Harvey&#x2014;and William too, for that<lb/> matter&#x2014;because
                        he was one of them kind that can't bear to make a will. He<lb/> left a
                        letter behind for Harvey, and said he'd told in it where his money was<lb/>
                        hid, and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so George's
                        g'yirls<lb/> would be all right&#x2014;for George didn't leave nothing.
                        And that letter was all<lb/> they could get him to put a pen to."</p>
                    <p>"Why do you reckon Harvey don't come? Wher' does he live?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, he lives in England&#x2014;Sheffield&#x2014;preaches
                        there&#x2014;hasn't ever been in this<lb/>

                        time&#x2014;and besides he mightn't a got the<lb/> letter at all, you

                        You<lb/> going to Orleans, you say?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, but that ain't only a part of it. I'm going in a ship, next
                        Wednesday,<lb/> for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives."</p>

                        going<lb/> to let them come to no harm. There's Hobson, the Babtis'
                        preacher; and<lb/> Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,
                        and Levi Bell,<lb/> the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the

                    <p>Well, the old man he went on asking questions till he just fairly
                        emptied<lb/> that young fellow. Blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody
                        and everything<lb/> in that blessed town, and all about all the Wilkses; and
                        about Peter's business&#x2014;<lb/> which was a tanner; and about

                        Harvey's&#x2014;which was a dissentering minister; and so on, and so on.
                        Then he<lb/> says:</p>
                    <p>"What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?"</p>
                    <p>"Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stop
                        there.<lb/> When they're deep they won't stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat
                        will, but this<lb/> is a St. Louis one."</p>
                    <p>"Was Peter Wilks well off?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it's reckoned he
                        left<lb/> three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers."</p>
                    <p>"When did you say he died?"</p>
                    <p>"I didn't say, but it was last night."</p>
                    <p>"Funeral to-morrow, likely?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, 'bout the middle of the day."</p>
                    <p>"Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time or another.

                    <p>"Yes, sir, it's the best way. Ma used to always say that."</p>
                    <p>When we struck the boat, she was about done loading, and pretty soon she<lb/>
                        got off. The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost my
                        ride,<lb/> after all. When the boat was gone, the king made me paddle up
                        another mile<lb/> to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new<lb/>
                        carpet-bags. And if he's gone over to t'other side, go over there and git
                        him.<lb/> And tell him to git himself up regardless. Shove along, now."</p>
                    <p>I see what <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was up to; but I never said nothing, of
                        course. When I got<lb/> back with the duke, we hid the canoe and then they
                        set down on a log, and the<lb/> king told him everything, just like the
                        young fellow had said it&#x2014;every last word<lb/>
                        <pb n="209" entity="u000002472_0224"/> of it. And all the time he was a
                        doing it, he tried to talk like an Englishman;<lb/> and he done it pretty
                        well too, for a slouch. I can't imitate him, and so I ain't<lb/> agoing to
                        try to; but he really done it pretty good. Then he says:</p>
                    <p>"How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?"</p>
                    <p>The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef and
                        dumb<lb/> person on the histrionic boards. So then they waited for a
                        steamboat.</p>
                    <p>About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,
                        but<lb/> they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there
                        was a big one,<lb/> and they hailed her. She sent out her yawl, and we went
                        aboard, and she was<lb/> from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted
                        to go four or five mile,<lb/> they was booming mad, and give us<lb/> a
                        cussing, and said they wouldn't<lb/> land us. But the king was ca'm.<lb/> He
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"If gentlemen kin afford to pay<lb/> a dollar a mile apiece, to be took<lb/>
                        on and put off in a yawl, a <reg orig="steam-|boat">steamboat</reg><lb/> kin
                        afford to carry 'em, can't<lb/> it?"</p>
                    <p>So they softened down and said<lb/> it was all right; and when we<lb/> got to
                        the village, they yawled us<lb/> ashore. About two dozen men<lb/> flocked
                        down, when they see the<lb/> yawl a coming; and when the king<lb/>
                        says&#x2014;</p>

                    <p>Then the king he hunched the duke, private&#x2014;I see him do

                        walked slow and solemn over there, everybody dropping back to give them<lb/>

                        put their arms<lb/> around each other's necks, and hung<lb/> their chins

                        went up to the girls, without saying a word, and kissed<lb/> them, solemn,

                        towards the sky, with the tears running down, and then busted out<lb/> and
                        went off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next woman a show. I never<lb/>

                        sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy
                        tears,<lb/> and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother's
                        heart, because<lb/> out of their mouths they can't, words being too weak and
                        cold, and all that kind<lb/> of rot and slush, till it was just sickening;
                        and then he blubbers out a pious<lb/> goody-goody Amen, and turns himself

                    <p>And the minute the words was out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd<lb/>
                        struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their might, and

                    <p>Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his

                        with the ashes of the <reg orig="dis-|eased">diseased</reg>;<lb/> and says
                        if his poor brother laying yonder could speak, he knows who he<lb/> would
                        name, for they was names that was very dear to him, and mentioned often<lb/>
                        in his letters; and so he will name the same, to-wit, as follows,
                        vizz:&#x2014;Rev. Mr.<lb/> Hobson, and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben
                        Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,<lb/> and Levi Bell, and Dr. Robinson, and
                        their wives, and the widow Bartley.</p>
                    <p>Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town, a-hunting<lb/>
                        together; that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t'other
                        world,<lb/> and the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bell was away up
                        to Louisville<lb/> on some business. But the rest was on hand, and so they
                        all come and shook<lb/> hands with the king and thanked him and talked to
                        him; and then they shook<lb/> hands with the duke, and didn't say nothing
                        but just kept a-smiling and bob_<lb/> bing their heads like a passel of
                        sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his<lb/> hands and said
                        "Goo-goo&#x2014;goo-goo-goo," all the time, like a baby that can't
                        talk.</p>
                    <p>So the king he blatted along, and managed to inquire about pretty much<lb/>
                        everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts of little
                        things<lb/> that happened one time or another in the town, or to George's
                        family, or to<lb/> Peter; and he always let on that Peter wrote him the
                        things, but that was a lie,<lb/>
                        <pb n="214" entity="u000002472_0229"/> he got every blessed one of them out
                        of that young flathead that we canoed up to<lb/> the steamboat.</p>
                    <p>Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the
                        king<lb/> he read it out loud and cried over it. It give the dwelling-house
                        and three<lb/> thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard
                        &lpar;which was doing a<lb/> good business&rpar;, along with some
                        other houses and land &lpar;worth about seven<lb/> thousand&rpar;,
                        and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey and William, and told<lb/>
                        where the six thousand cash was hid, down cellar. So these two frauds said
                        they'd<lb/> go and fetch it up, and have everything square and above-board;
                        and told me to<lb/> come with a candle. We shut the cellar door behind us,
                        and when they found<lb/> the bag they spilt it out on the floor, and it was

                        My, the way the king's eyes did shine! He slaps the duke on the<lb/>

                    <p>The duke allowed it did. They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them<lb/>
                        through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the
                        king<lb/> says:</p>
                    <p>"It ain't no use talkin'; bein' brothers to a rich dead man, and <reg

                        'em all, and ther' ain't no better way."</p>
                    <p>Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on trust;
                        but<lb/> no, they must count it. So they counts it, and it comes out four
                        hundred and<lb/> fifteen dollars short. Says the king:</p>
                    <p>"Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen<lb/>
                        dollars?"</p>
                    <p>They worried over that a while, and ransacked all around for it. Then
                        the<lb/> duke says:</p>
                    <p>"Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake&#x2014;I
                        reckon<lb/> that's the way of it. The best way's to let it go, and keep

                        and leather-headed a while, then all<lb/> of a sudden he seems to catch

                        for joy,<lb/> and hugs him about fifteen times<lb/> before he lets up. Then
                        the king<lb/> says, "I knowed it; I reckon <hi rend="italic">that</hi><lb/>
                        'll convince anybody the way <hi rend="italic">he</hi> feels<lb/> about it.

                        everybody crowded up with the tears in their<lb/> eyes, and most shook the

                    <p>Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again,

                        long a big<lb/> iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside, and
                        stood a listening and<lb/> looking, and not saying anything; and nobody
                        saying anything to him either,<lb/> because the king was talking and they
                        was all busy listening. The king was <reg orig="say-|ing&#x2014;in"
                            >saying&#x2014;in</reg><lb/> the middle of something he'd started in

                        funeral orgiess h'd be public."</p>
                    <p>And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and
                        every<lb/> little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the
                        duke he couldn't stand<lb/> it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of
                        paper, "<hi rend="italic">obsequies,</hi> you old fool," and<lb/> folds it
                        up and goes to goo-gooing and reaching it over people's heads to him.<lb/>
                        The king he reads it, and puts it in his pocket, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Poor William, afflicted as he is, his <hi rend="italic">heart's</hi> aluz

                    <p>Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca'm, and goes to dropping in his<lb/>
                        funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before. And when
                        he<lb/> done it the third time, he says:</p>
                    <p>"I say orgies, not because it's the common term, because it
                        ain't&#x2014;obsequies<lb/> bein' the common term&#x2014;but because
                        orgies is the right term. Obsequies ain't<lb/> used in England no more,
                        now&#x2014;it's gone out. We say orgies now, in England.<lb/> Orgies is
                        better, because it means the thing you're after, more exact. It's a

                    <p>He was the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> I ever struck. Well, the iron-jawed
                        man he laughed right<lb/> in his face. Everybody was shocked. Everybody

                        says:</p>

                    <p>"All right, doctor," says the king, kinder mocking him, "we'll try and

                        he said they warn't. The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them
                        was<lb/> a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor. There was
                        an old hair<lb/> trunk in one corner, and a guitar box in another, and all

                        she did give Hare-lip<lb/> hark from the tomb!</p>
                    <p>Says I to myself, And this is <hi rend="italic">another</hi> one that I'm
                        letting him rob her of her<lb/> money!</p>
                    <p>Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely
                        again&#x2014;<lb/> which was her way&#x2014;but when she got done
                        there warn't hardly anything left o'<lb/> poor Hare-lip. So she
                        hollered.</p>
                    <p>"All right, then," says the other girls, "you just ask his pardon."</p>
                    <p>She done it, too. And she done it beautiful. She done it so beautiful it
                        was<lb/> good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so she
                        could do it<lb/> again.</p>
                    <p>I says to myself, this is <hi rend="italic">another</hi> one that I'm letting
                        him rob her of her<lb/> money. And when she got through, they all jest laid
                        theirselves out to make me<lb/> feel at home and know I was amongst friends.
                        I felt so ornery and low down<lb/> and mean, that I says to myself, My
                        mind's made up; I'll hive that money for<lb/> them or bust.</p>
                    <p>So then I lit out&#x2014;for bed, I said, meaning some time or another.
                        When I<lb/> got by myself, I went to thinking the thing over. I says to
                        myself, shall I go<lb/>
                        <pb n="226" entity="u000002472_0241"/> to that doctor, private, and blow on
                        these frauds? No&#x2014;that won't do. He<lb/> might tell who told him;
                        then the king and the duke would make it warm for<lb/> me. Shall I go,
                        private, and tell Mary Jane? No&#x2014;I dasn't do it. Her face<lb/>
                        would give them a hint, sure; they've got the money, and they'd slide right
                        out<lb/> and get away with it. If she was to fetch in help, I'd get mixed up
                        in the<lb/> business, before it was done with, I judge. No, there ain't no
                        good way but one.</p>
                    <p>I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that
                        they<lb/> won't suspicion that I done it. They've got a good thing, here;
                        and they ain't<lb/> agoing to leave till they've played this family and this
                        town for all they're worth,<lb/> so I'll find a chance time enough. I'll
                        steal it, and hide it; and by-and-by, when<lb/> I'm away down the river,
                        I'll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it's hid.<lb/> But I better
                        hive it to-night, if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as<lb/>
                        much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here, yet.</p>

                    <p>So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms. Up stairs the hall was dark, but<lb/>
                        <pb n="227" entity="u000002472_0242"/> I found the duke's room, and started
                        to paw around it with my hands; but I<lb/> recollected it wouldn't be much
                        like the king to let anybody else take care of<lb/> that money but his own
                        self; so then I went to his room and begun to paw<lb/> around there. But I
                        see I couldn't do nothing without a candle, and I dasn't<lb/> light one, of
                        course. So I judged I'd got to do the other thing&#x2014;lay for
                        them,<lb/> and eavesdrop. About that time, I hears their footsteps coming,
                        and was going<lb/> to skip under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn't
                        where I thought it would<lb/> be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary
                        Jane's frocks, so I jumped in<lb/> behind that and snuggled in amongst the
                        gowns, and stood there perfectly<lb/> still.</p>
                    <p>They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to<lb/>
                        get down and look under the bed. Then I was glad I hadn't found the bed<lb/>
                        when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide under<lb/>
                        the bed when you are up to anything private. They sets down, then, and
                        the<lb/> king says:</p>
                    <p>"Well, what is it? and cut it middlin' short, because it's better for us to
                        be<lb/> down there a whoopin'-up the mournin', than up here givin' 'em a
                        chance to talk<lb/> us over."</p>
                    <p>"Well, this is it, Capet. I ain't easy; I ain't comfortable. That doctor<lb/>
                        lays on my mind. I wanted to know your plans. I've got a notion, and I
                        think<lb/> it's a sound one."</p>
                    <p>"What is it, duke?"</p>
                    <p>"That we better glide out of this, before three in the morning, and clip
                        it<lb/> down the river with what we've got. Specially, seeing we got it so
                            easy&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">given</hi><lb/> back to us, flung at
                        our heads, as you may say, when of course we allowed to have<lb/> to steal
                        it back. I'm for knocking off and lighting out."</p>
                    <p>That made me feel pretty bad. About an hour or two ago, it would a been
                        a<lb/> little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed. The
                        king rips<lb/> out and says:</p>
                    <p>"What! And not sell out the rest o' the property? March off like a <reg
                            orig="pas-|sel">passel</reg><lb/> o' fools and leave eight or nine
                        thous'n' dollars' worth o' property layin' around<lb/> jest sufferin' to be
                        scooped in?&#x2014;and all good salable stuff, too."</p>
                    <pb n="228" entity="u000002472_0243"/>
                    <p>The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn't
                        want<lb/> to go no deeper&#x2014;didn't want to rob a lot of orphans of
                            <hi rend="italic">everything</hi> they had.</p>
                    <p>"Why, how you talk!" says the king. "We shan't rob 'em of nothing at<lb/> all
                        but jest this money. The people that <hi rend="italic">buys</hi> the
                        property is the suff'rers;<lb/> because as soon's it's found out 'at we

                        slid&#x2014;the sale won't be valid, and it'll all go back to the
                        estate. These-yer<lb/> orphans 'll git their house back agin, and that's
                        enough for <hi rend="italic">them;</hi> they're young<lb/> and spry, and k'n
                        easy earn a livin'. <hi rend="italic">They</hi> ain't agoing to suffer. Why,
                        jest<lb/> think&#x2014;there's thous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nigh
                        so well off. Bless you, <hi rend="italic">they</hi><lb/> ain't got noth'n to
                        complain of."</p>
                    <p>Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all
                        right,<lb/> but said he believed it was blame foolishness to stay, and that
                        doctor hanging<lb/> over them. But the king says:</p>
                    <p>"Cuss the doctor! What do we k'yer for <hi rend="italic">him?</hi> Hain't we
                        got all the fools<lb/> in town on our side? and ain't that a big enough
                        majority in any town?"</p>
                    <p>So they got ready to go down stairs again. The duke says:</p>
                    <p>"I don't think we put that money in a good place."</p>
                    <p>That cheered me up. I'd begun to think I warn't going to get a hint of
                        no<lb/> kind to help me. The king says:</p>
                    <p>"Why?"</p>
                    <p>"Because Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from this out; and first you know<lb/>
                        the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up
                        and<lb/> put 'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and
                        not borrow<lb/> some of it?"</p>
                    <p>"Your head's level, agin, duke," says the king; and he come a fumbling
                        under<lb/> the curtain two or three foot from where I was. I stuck tight to
                        the wall, and<lb/> kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what
                        them fellows would say<lb/> to me if they catched me; and I tried to think
                        what I'd better do if they did<lb/> catch me. But the king he got the bag
                        before I could think more than about<lb/> a half a thought, and he never
                        suspicioned I was around. They took and<lb/> shoved the bag through a rip in
                        the straw tick that was under the feather bed,<lb/> and crammed it in a foot
                        or two amongst the straw and said it was all right, now,<lb/>
                        <pb n="229" entity="u000002472_0244"/> because a nigger only makes up the
                        feather bed, and don't turn over the straw<lb/> tick only about twice a
                        year,<lb/> and so it warn't in no danger<lb/> of getting stole, now.</p>
                    <p>But I knowed better. I<lb/> had it out of there before<lb/> they was half-way
                        down<lb/> stairs. I groped along up to<lb/> my cubby, and hid it there<lb/>
                        till I could get a chance to<lb/> do better. I judged I better<lb/> hide it
                        outside of the house<lb/> somewheres, because if they<lb/> missed it they
                        would give<lb/> the house a good ransacking.<lb/> I knowed that very
                        well.<lb/> Then I turned in, with my<lb/> clothes all on; but I
                        couldn't<lb/> a gone to sleep, if I'd a<lb/> wanted to, I was in such a<lb/>
                        sweat to get through with the business. By-and-by I heard the king and
                        the<lb/> duke come up; so I rolled off of my pallet and laid with my chin at
                        the top of<lb/> my ladder and waited to see if anything was going to happen.
                        But nothing<lb/> did.</p>

                        warn't a sound anywheres. I peeped<lb/> through a crack of the

                            >watching</reg><lb/> the corpse all sound asleep on<lb/> their chairs.
                        The door was open<lb/> into the parlor, where the corpse<lb/> was laying,
                        and there was a candle<lb/> in both rooms. I passed along, and<lb/> the

                        locked,<lb/> and the key wasn't there. Just<lb/> then I heard somebody
                        coming down<lb/> the stairs, back behind me. I run in the parlor, and took a
                        swift look around,<lb/> and the only place I see to hide the bag was in the
                        coffin. The lid was shoved<lb/> along about a foot, showing the dead man's

                        tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just<lb/> down beyond where his hands
                        was crossed, which made me creep, they was<lb/> so cold, and then I run back
                        across the room and in behind the door.</p>

                        such<lb/> business as that, I says to myself.</p>
                    <p>When I got down stairs in the morning, the parlor was shut up, and the<lb/>
                        watchers was gone. There warn't nobody around but the family and the
                        widow<lb/> Bartley and our tribe. I watched their faces to see if anything
                        had been <reg orig="happen-|ing">happening</reg>,<lb/> but I couldn't
                        tell.</p>
                    <p>Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come, with his man, and
                        they<lb/> set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs,
                        and then set all<lb/> our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the
                        neighbors till the hall and the<lb/> parlor and the dining-room was full. I
                        see the coffin lid was the way it was<lb/> before, but I dasn't go to look
                        in under it, with folks around.</p>
                    <p>Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats
                        in<lb/> the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the
                        people filed<lb/> around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead
                        man's face a minute,<lb/> and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very
                        still and solemn, only the girls<lb/> and the beats holding handkerchiefs to
                        their eyes and keeping their heads bent,<lb/>
                        <pb n="232" entity="u000002472_0247"/> and sobbing a little. There warn't no
                        other sound but the scraping of the feet<lb/> on the floor, and blowing
                        noses&#x2014;because people always blows them more at a<lb/> funeral
                        than they do at other places except church.</p>
                    <p>When the place was packed full, the undertaker he slid around in his
                        black<lb/> gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the<lb/> last
                        touches, and getting people and things all <reg orig="ship-|shape"
                            >shipshape</reg><lb/> and comfortable, and making no more sound<lb/>
                        than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people<lb/> around, he squeezed in late
                        ones, he opened up<lb/> passage-ways, and done it all with nods, and
                        signs<lb/> with his hands. Then he took his place over against<lb/> the
                        wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest<lb/> man I ever see; and
                        there warn't no more smile to<lb/> him than there is to a ham.</p>

                        was ready, a young woman set<lb/> down and worked it, and it was pretty
                        skreeky and<lb/> colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and<lb/> Peter
                        was the only one that had a good thing, <reg orig="ac-|cording"
                            >according</reg><lb/> to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson<lb/> opened

                        right along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and
                        wait&#x2014;you<lb/> couldn't hear yourself think. It was right down
                        awkward, and nobody didn't<lb/> seem to know what to do. But pretty soon
                        they see that long-legged undertaker<lb/> make a sign to the preacher as
                        much as to say, "Don't you worry&#x2014;just depend<lb/> on me." Then he
                        stooped down and begun to glide along the wall, just his<lb/> shoulders
                        showing over the people's heads. So he glided along, and the pow-wow<lb/>
                        and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at last, when
                        he<lb/> had gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar.
                        Then, in<lb/>

                        and then rose up, and shaded his mouth<lb/> with his hands, and stretched
                        his neck out towards the preacher, over the people's<lb/> heads, and says,

                    <p>Well, the funeral sermon<lb/> was very good, but pison<lb/> long and
                        tiresome; and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual<lb/>
                        rubbage, and at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak
                        up<lb/> on the coffin with his screw-driver. I was in a sweat then, and
                        watched him<lb/> pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid
                        along, as soft as<lb/> mush, and screwed it down tight and fast. So there I
                        was! I didn't know<lb/> whether the money was in there, or not. So, says I,
                        spose somebody has hogged<lb/> that bag on the sly?&#x2014;now how do
                            <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know whether to write to Mary Jane or not?<lb/>
                        'Spose she dug him up and didn't find nothing&#x2014;what would she
                        think of me?<lb/> Blame it, I says, I might get hunted up and jailed; I'd
                        better lay low and keep<lb/> dark, and not write at all; the thing's awful
                        mixed, now; trying to better it, I've<lb/>
                        <pb n="234" entity="u000002472_0249"/> worsened it a hundred times, and I
                        wish to goodness I'd just let it alone, dad<lb/> fetch the whole
                        business!</p>
                    <p>They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces<lb/>
                        again&#x2014;I couldn't help it, and I couldn't rest easy. But nothing
                        come of it; the<lb/> faces didn't tell me nothing.</p>
                    <p>The king he visited around, in the evening, and sweetened every body up,
                        and<lb/> made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his
                        congregation over<lb/> in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must
                        hurry and settle up the<lb/> estate right away, and leave for home. He was
                        very sorry he was so pushed,<lb/> and so was everybody; they wished he could
                        stay longer, but they said they could<lb/> see it couldn't be done. And he
                        said of course him and William would take the<lb/> girls home with them; and
                        that pleased everybody too, because then the girls<lb/> would be well fixed,
                        and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls,<lb/>
                        too&#x2014;tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in
                        the world; and told<lb/> him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they
                        would be ready. Them poor things<lb/> was that glad and happy it made my
                        heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied<lb/> to so, but I didn't see
                        no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune.</p>
                    <p>Well, blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers and all
                        the<lb/> property for auction straight off&#x2014;sale two days after
                        the funeral; but anybody<lb/> could buy private beforehand if they wanted
                        to.</p>
                    <p>So the next day after the funeral, along about noontime, the girls' joy got
                        the<lb/> first jolt; a couple of nigger traders come along, and the king
                        sold them the<lb/> niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called
                        it, and away they went,<lb/> the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their
                        mother down the river to<lb/> Orleans. I thought them poor girls and them
                        niggers would break their hearts<lb/> for grief; they cried around each
                        other, and took on so it most made me down<lb/> sick to see it. The girls
                        said they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family<lb/> separated or sold
                        away from the town. I can't ever get it out of my memory,<lb/> the sight of
                        them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's<lb/> necks
                        and crying; and I reckon I couldn't a stood it all but would a had to
                        bust<lb/> out and tell on our gang if I hadn't knowed the sale warn't no
                        account and the<lb/> niggers would be back home in a week or two.</p>
                    <pb n="235" entity="u000002472_0250"/>
                    <p>The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out <reg
                            orig="flat-|footed">flatfooted</reg><lb/> and said it was scandalous to
                        separate the mother and the children that<lb/> way. It injured the

                        all the duke could say or do,<lb/> and I tell you the duke was<lb/> powerful
                        uneasy.</p>

                        trouble. The king says:</p>

                    <p>"Is something gone wrong?"</p>
                    <p>The king whirls on me and rips out:</p>
                    <p>"None o' your business! You keep your head shet, and mind y'r own<lb/>
                        affairs&#x2014;if you got any. Long as you're in this town, don't you

                    <p>As they was starting down the ladder, the duke he chuckles again, and<lb/>
                        says:</p>

                    <p>The king snarls around on him and says,</p>
                    <p>"I was trying to do for the best, in sellin' 'm cut so quick. If the profits

                    <p>The king sassed back, as much as was safe for him, and then swapped

                        it&#x2014;getting<lb/> ready to go to England. But she<lb/> had stopped

                    <p>So she done it. And it was the<lb/> niggers&#x2014;I just expected it.
                        She said the beautiful trip to England was most<lb/> about spoiled for her;

                    <p>"Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain't <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> going to see

                    <p>Laws it was out before I could think!&#x2014;and before I could budge,
                        she throws<lb/> her arms around my neck, and told me to say it <hi

                    <p>I see I had spoke too sudden, and said too much, and was in a close place.
                        I<lb/> asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very
                        impatient<lb/> and excited, and handsome, but looking kind of happy and
                        eased-up, like<lb/> a person that's had a tooth pulled out. So I went to
                        studying it out.<lb/> I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells
                        the truth when he<lb/> is in a tight place, is taking considerable many
                        resks, though I ain't had no<lb/> experience, and can't say for certain; but
                        it looks so to me, anyway; and yet<lb/> here's a case where I'm blest if it
                        don't look to me like the truth is better,<lb/> and actuly <hi rend="italic"
                            >safer,</hi> than a lie. I must lay it by in my mind, and think it
                        over<lb/> some time or other, it's so kind of strange and unregular. I never
                        see nothing<lb/> like it. Well, I says to myself at last, I'm agoing to
                        chance it; I'll up and tell<lb/> the truth this time, though it does seem
                        most like setting down on a kag of<lb/> powder and touching it off just to
                        see where you'll go to. Then I says:</p>
                    <p>"Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways, where you<lb/>
                        could go and stay three or four days?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes&#x2014;Mr. Lothrop's. Why?"</p>
                    <p>"Never mind why, yet. If I'll tell you how I know the niggers will see
                        each<lb/> other again&#x2014;inside of two weeks&#x2014;here in this
                        house&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">prove</hi> how I know it<lb/>
                        &#x2014;will you go to Mr. Lothrop's and stay four days?"</p>
                    <p>"Four days!" she says; "I'll stay a year!"</p>
                    <p>"All right," I says, "I don't want nothing more out of <hi rend="italic"
                            >you</hi> than just your<lb/> word&#x2014;I druther have it than
                        another man's kiss-the-Bible." She smiled, and<lb/> reddened up very sweet,
                        and I says, "If you don't mind it, I'll shut the door&#x2014;<lb/> and
                        bolt it."</p>
                    <p>Then I come back and set down again, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Don't you holler. Just set still, and take it like a man. I got to tell
                        the<lb/> truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it's a bad
                        kind, and going to<lb/> be hard to take, but there ain't no help for it.
                        These uncles of yourn ain't no<lb/>

                        the worst of it&#x2014;you can stand the rest middling easy."</p>
                    <p>It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal
                        water<lb/> now, so I went right along, her eyes a blazing higher and higher
                        all the time,<lb/> and told her every blame thing, from where we first
                        struck that young fool going<lb/> up to the steamboat, clear through to
                        where she flung herself onto the king's<lb/> breast at the front door and he
                        kissed her sixteen or seventeen times&#x2014;and then<lb/> up she jumps,
                        with her face afire like sunset, and says:</p>
                    <p>"The brute! Come&#x2014;don't waste a minute&#x2014;<lb/> not a <hi

                        get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave.
                        But<lb/> I didn't want to run the raft in day-time, without anybody aboard
                        to answer<lb/>

                    <p>"Well, that'll answer. Now you go along out there, and lay low till nine

                        again&#x2014;tell them you've<lb/> thought of something. If you get here

                    <p>"Good," she says, "I'll do it."</p>

                        you<lb/> how to find them. Gimme a pencil and<lb/> a piece of paper.

                    <p>I judged we had got everything fixed about right, now. So I says:</p>
                    <p>"Just let the auction go right along, and don't worry. Nobody don't have<lb/>
                        to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction, on
                        accounts of<lb/> the short notice, and they ain't going out of this till
                        they get that money&#x2014;and<lb/> the way we've fixed it the sale
                        ain't going to count, and they ain't going to <hi rend="italic">get</hi>
                        no<lb/> money. It's just like the way it was with the niggers&#x2014;it
                        warn't no sale, and the<lb/> niggers will be back before long. Why, they
                        can't collect the money for the<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">niggers,</hi> yet&#x2014;they're in the worst kind of
                        a fix, Miss Mary."</p>
                    <p>"Well," she says, "I'll run down to breakfast now, and then I'll start<lb/>
                        straight for Mr. Lothrop's."</p>
                    <p>"'Deed, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> ain't the ticket, Miss Mary Jane," I
                        says, "by no manner of<lb/> means; go <hi rend="italic">before</hi>
                        breakfast."</p>
                    <p>"Why?"</p>
                    <p>"What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, I never thought&#x2014;and come to think, I don't know. What was
                        it?"</p>
                    <p>"Why, it's because you ain't one of these leather-face people. I don't
                        want<lb/> no better book that what your face is. A body can set down and
                        read it off like<lb/> coarse print. Do you reckon you can go and face your
                        uncles, when they come<lb/> to kiss you good-morning, and
                        never&#x2014;&#x2014;"</p>
                    <p>"There, there, don't! Yes, I'li go before breakfast&#x2014;I'll be glad
                        to. And<lb/> leave my sisters with them?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes&#x2014;never mind about them. They've got to stand it yet a while.
                        They<lb/> might suspicion something if all of you was to go. I don't want
                        you to see them,<lb/> nor your sisters, nor nobody in this
                        town&#x2014;if a neighbor was to ask how is your<lb/> uncles this
                        morning, your face would tell something. No, you go right along, Miss<lb/>
                        Mary Jane, and I'll fix it with all of them. I'll tell Miss Susan to give
                        your love<lb/> to your uncles and say you've went away for a few hours for
                        to get a little rest and<lb/> change, or to see a friend, and you'll be back
                        to-night or early in the morning."</p>
                    <p>"Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won't have my love given to
                        them."</p>
                    <p>"Well, then, it sha'n't be." It was well enough to tell <hi rend="italic"
                            >her</hi> so&#x2014;no harm in it. 
                        <pb n="244" entity="u000002472_0254"/> It was only a little thing to do, and no
                        trouble; and it's the little things that<lb/> smoothers people's roads the
                        most, down here below; it would make Mary Jane<lb/> comfortable, and it
                        wouldn't cost nothing. Then I says: "There's one more<lb/>
                        thing&#x2014;that bag of money."</p>
                    <p>"Well, they've got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think <hi
                            rend="italic">how</hi> they<lb/> got it."</p>
                    <p>"No, you're out, there. They hain't got it."</p>
                    <p>"Why, who's got it?"</p>
                    <p>"I wish I knowed, but I don't. I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> it, because I
                        stole it from them: and<lb/> I stole it to give to you; and I know where I
                        hid it, but I'm afraid it ain't<lb/> there no more. I'm awful sorry, Miss
                        Mary Jane, I'm just as sorry as I can be;<lb/> but I done the best I could;
                        I did, honest. I come nigh getting caught, and I<lb/> had to shove it into
                        the first place I come to, and run&#x2014;and it warn't a good<lb/>
                        place."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, stop blaming yourself&#x2014;it's too bad to do it, and I won't
                        allow it&#x2014;you<lb/> couldn't help it; it wasn't you fault. Where
                        did you hide it?"</p>
                    <p>I didn't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I
                        couldn't<lb/> seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that
                        corpse laying in<lb/> the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. So
                        for a minute I didn't say<lb/> nothing&#x2014;then I says:</p>

                    <p>"I'd ruther not <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> you where I put it, Miss Mary

                        piece of paper, and you can read it<lb/> along the road to Mr. Lothrop's, if
                        you want to. Do you reckon that'll do?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, yes."</p>
                    <pb n="245" entity="u000002472_0260"/>
                    <p>So I wrote: "I put it in the coffin. It was in there when you was crying<lb/>
                        there, away in the night. I was behind the door, and I was mighty sorry
                        for<lb/> you, Miss Mary Jane."</p>
                    <p>It made my eyes water a little, to remember her crying there all by
                        herself<lb/> in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own
                        roof, shaming<lb/> her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it
                        to her, I see the water<lb/> come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by
                        the hand, hard, and says:</p>
                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">Good</hi>-bye&#x2014;I'm going to do everything just

                        forget you, and I'll think of you a many<lb/> and a many a time, and I'll
                            <hi rend="italic">pray</hi> for you, too!"&#x2014;and she was
                        gone.</p>
                    <p>Pray for me! I reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was more<lb/>
                        nearer her size. But I bet she done it, just the same&#x2014;she was
                        just that kind.<lb/> She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the

                        to her, I judge. You may say what you want to, but in my opinion she<lb/>
                        had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in my opinion she was just
                        full of<lb/> sand. It sounds like flattery, but it ain't no flattery. And
                        when it comes to<lb/> beauty&#x2014;and goodness too&#x2014;she lays
                        over them all. I hain't ever seen her since<lb/> that time that I see her go
                        out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen her since,<lb/> but I reckon I've
                        thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her<lb/> saying she
                        would pray for me; and if ever I'd a thought it would do any good<lb/> for
                        me to pray for <hi rend="italic">her,</hi> blamed if I wouldn't a done it or

                    <p>Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see<lb/>
                        her go. When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:</p>
                    <p>"What's the name of them people over on t'other side of the river that

                    <p>They says:</p>
                    <p>"There's several; but it's the Proctors, mainly."</p>
                    <p>"That's the name," I says; "I most forgot it. Well, Miss Mary Jane she<lb/>
                        told me to tell you she's gone over there in a dreadful hurry&#x2014;one

                    <p>"It ain't no name for it. They set up with her all night, Miss Mary Jane<lb/>

                    <p>I couldn't think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:</p>

                        That old gentleman that had<lb/> just come looked all puzzled to death.
                        Pretty soon he begun to speak, and<lb/> I see, straight off, he pronounced

                        though the king's <hi rend="italic">was</hi> pretty good, for an imitation.
                        I can't give the old gent's<lb/> words, nor I can't imitate him; but he

                        misfortunes, he's broke his arm, and our baggage got put off at a<lb/> town
                        above here, last night in the night by a mistake. I am Peter Wilks's<lb/>

                        in a day or two, when I get the<lb/> baggage, I can prove it. But, up till
                        then, I won't say nothing more, but go to<lb/> the hotel and wait."</p>
                    <p>So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and

                        maybe half a dozen. One of these was that doctor; another one was a
                        sharp<lb/> looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind

                        inside<lb/> o' the straw tick o' my bed, not wishin' to bank it for the few
                        days we'd be here,<lb/> and considerin' the bed a safe place, we not bein'
                        used to niggers, and suppos'n'<lb/> 'em honest, like servants in England.
                        The niggers stole it the very next mornin'<lb/> after I had went down
                        stairs; and when I sold 'em, I hadn't missed the money<lb/> yit, so they got
                        clean away with it. My servant here k'n tell you 'bout it <reg
                            orig="gentle-|men">gentlemen</reg>."</p>
                    <p>The doctor and several said "Shucks!" and I see nobody didn't altogether <reg
                            orig="be-|lieve">believe</reg><lb/> him. One man asked me if I see the
                        niggers steal it. I said no, but I see<lb/> them sneaking out of the room
                        and hustling away, and I never thought nothing,<lb/> only I reckoned they
                        was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to<lb/> get away
                        before he made trouble with them. That was all they asked me. Then<lb/> the
                        doctor whirls on me and says:</p>
                    <p>"Are <hi rend="italic">you</hi> English too?"</p>
                    <p>I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, "Stuff!"</p>
                    <p>Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had it,
                        up<lb/> and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about
                        supper, nor<lb/> ever seemed to think about it&#x2014;and so they kept
                        it up, and kept it up; and it<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the worst mixed-up thing you ever see. They made
                        the king tell his yarn,<lb/> and they made the old gentleman tell his'n; and
                        anybody but a lot of prejudiced<lb/>
                        <pb n="254" entity="u000002472_0269"/> chuckleheads would a <hi
                            rend="italic">seen</hi> that the old gentleman was spinning truth and
                        t'other<lb/> one lies. And by-and-by they had me up to tell what I knowed.
                        The king he<lb/> give me a left-handed look out of the corner of his eye,
                        and so I knowed enough<lb/> to talk on the right side. I begun to tell about
                        Sheffield, and how we lived there,<lb/> and all about the English Wilkses,
                        and so on; but I didn't get pretty fur till the<lb/> doctor begun to laugh;
                        and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:</p>
                    <p>"Set down, my boy, I wouldn't strain myself, if I was you. I reckon you<lb/>
                        ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is
                        practice.<lb/> You do it pretty awkward."</p>
                    <p>I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,<lb/>
                        anyway.</p>
                    <p>The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:</p>
                    <p>"If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell&#x2014;&#x2014;"</p>
                    <p>The king broke in and reached out his hand, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often
                        about?"</p>
                    <p>The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked
                        pleased,<lb/> and they talked right along a while, and then got to one side
                        and talked low;<lb/> and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:</p>
                    <p>"That'll fix it. I'll take the order and send it, along with your
                        brother's,<lb/> and then they'll know it's all right."</p>
                    <p>So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted
                        his<lb/> head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off
                        something; and then<lb/> they give the pen to the duke&#x2014;and then
                        for the first time, the duke looked sick.<lb/> But he took the pen and
                        wrote. So then the lawyer turns to the new old <reg orig="gentle-|man"
                            >gentleman</reg><lb/> and says:</p>
                    <p>"You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names."</p>
                    <p>The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it. The lawyer looked<lb/>
                        powerful astonished, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Well, it beats <hi rend="italic">me</hi>"&#x2014;and snaked a lot of old
                        letters out of his pocket, and<lb/> examined them, and then examined the old
                        man's writing, and then <hi rend="italic">them</hi> again;<lb/> and then
                        says: "These old letters is from Harvey Wilks; and here's <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">Well!</hi>" says the lawyer, "this<lb/>

                    <p>The lawyer done it, and says:</p>

                        own time, if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have<lb/> Mary Jane at my
                        back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here<lb/> was
                        nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them <reg
                            orig="tatoo-|marks">tatoomarks</reg>.<lb/> If they didn't find
                        them&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think
                        about<lb/> nothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful
                        time to give the<lb/> crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the
                        wrist&#x2014;Hines&#x2014;and a body<lb/> might as well try to give
                        Goliar the slip. He dragged me right along, he was so<lb/> excited; and I
                        had to run to keep up.</p>
                    <p>When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it
                        like<lb/> an overflow. And when they got to the grave, they found they had
                        about a<lb/> hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't
                        thought to<lb/> fetch a lantern. But they sailed into digging, anyway, by
                        the flicker of the<lb/> lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house a
                        half a mile off, to borrow one.</p>
                    <p>So they dug and dug, like everything; and it got awful dark, and the
                        rain<lb/> started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning
                        come brisker<lb/> and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never
                        took no notice of<lb/> it, they was so full of this business; and one minute
                        you could see everything and<lb/> every face in that big crowd, and the
                        shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave,<lb/> and the next second the
                        dark wiped it all out, and you couldn't see nothing at all.</p>
                    <p>At last they got out the coffin, and begun to unscrew the lid, and then<lb/>
                        such another crowding, and shouldering, and shoving as there was, to
                        scrouge<lb/> in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way,
                        it was awful.<lb/> Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful, pulling and tugging so,
                        and I reckon he clean<lb/> forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and
                        panting.</p>
                    <p>All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and
                            <reg orig="some-|body">somebody</reg><lb/> sings out:</p>
                    <p>"By the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on his breast!"</p>
                    <p>Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give
                        a<lb/> big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out
                        and shinned<lb/> for the road in the dark, there ain't nobody can tell.</p>
                    <pb n="259" entity="u000002472_0274"/>
                    <p>I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew&#x2014;leastways I had it
                        all to myself<lb/> except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and
                        the buzzing of the rain,<lb/> and the thrashing of the wind, and the
                        splitting of the thunder; and sure as you<lb/> are born I did clip it
                        along!</p>
                    <p>When I struck the town, I see there warn't nobody out in the storm, so I<lb/>
                        never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the main
                        one;<lb/> and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set
                        it. No light<lb/> there; the house all dark&#x2014;which made me feel
                        sorry and disappointed, I didn't<lb/> know why. But at last, just as I was
                        sailing by, <hi rend="italic">flash</hi> comes the light in Mary<lb/> Jane's
                        window! and my heart swelled up sudden, like to bust; and the same<lb/>
                        second the house and all was behind me in the dark, and wasn't ever going to
                        be<lb/> before me no more in this world. She <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the
                        best girl I ever see, and had the<lb/> most sand.</p>
                    <p>The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the <reg
                            orig="tow-|head">towhead</reg>,<lb/> I begun to look sharp for a boat to
                        borrow; and the first time the lightning<lb/> showed me one that wasn't
                        chained, I snatched it and shoved. It was a canoe,<lb/> and warn't fastened
                        with nothing but a rope. The towhead was a rattling big<lb/> distance off,
                        away out there in the middle of the river, but I didn't lose no time;<lb/>
                        and when I struck the raft at last, I was so fagged I would a just laid
                        down<lb/> to blow and gasp if I could afforded it. But I didn't. As I sprung
                        aboard<lb/> I sung out:</p>
                    <p>"Out with you Jim, and set her loose! Glory be to goodness, we're shut<lb/>
                        of them!"</p>
                    <p>Jim lit out, and was a coming for me with both arms spread, he was so<lb/>
                        full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning, my heart shot up in
                        my<lb/> mouth, and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King
                        Lear<lb/> and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and
                        lights out<lb/> of me. But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and
                        bless me, and<lb/> so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the
                        king and the duke,<lb/> but I says:</p>
                    <p>"Not now&#x2014;have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast! Cut loose
                        and let<lb/> her slide!"</p>
                    <pb n="260" entity="u000002472_0275"/>
                    <p>So, in two seconds, away we went, a sliding down the river, and it <hi
                            rend="italic">did</hi> seem<lb/> so good to be free again and<lb/> all
                        by ourselves on the big<lb/> river and nobody to bother<lb/> us. I had to
                        skip around a<lb/> bit, and jump up and crack<lb/> my heels a few times, I
                        couldn't<lb/> help it; but about the third<lb/> crack, I noticed a sound
                        that I<lb/> knowed mighty well&#x2014;and held<lb/> my breath and
                        listened and<lb/> waited&#x2014;and sure enough, when<lb/> the next
                        flash busted out over<lb/> the water, here they come!&#x2014;<lb/> and
                        just a laying to their oars<lb/> and making their skiff hum!<lb/> It was the
                        king and the duke.</p>
                    <p>So I wilted right down onto<lb/> the planks, then, and give up;<lb/> and it
                        was all I could do to<lb/> keep from crying.</p>

                        and he was sorry to see<lb/> a boy in such a dangerous fix; and<lb/> when
                        they was all took by surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for

                        couldn't do nothing, and I<lb/> didn't want to be hung if I could get away.
                        So I never stopped running till I<lb/> found the canoe; and when I got here
                        I told Jim to hurry, or they'd catch me<lb/> and hang me yet, and said I was

                    <p>Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, "Oh,
                        yes,<lb/> it's <hi rend="italic">mighty</hi> likely!" and shook me up again,
                        and said he reckoned he'd drownd<lb/> me. But the duke says:</p>

                    <p>So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in

                    <p>"You better a blame sight give <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi> a good

                        kindness; for if the<lb/> excited fools hadn't let go all holts and made
                        that rush to get a look, we'd a slept in<lb/> our cravats

                        too&#x2014;longer than <hi rend="italic">we'd</hi> need 'em."</p>
                    <p>They was still a minute&#x2014;thinking&#x2014;then the king says,

                    <p>That made me squirm!</p>
                    <p>"Yes," says the duke, kinder slow, and deliberate, and sarcastic, "<hi

                    <p>After about a half a minute, the king drawls out:</p>

                    <p>The king kind of ruffles up, and says:</p>

                    <p>The duke says, pretty brisk:</p>

                    <p>"Shucks!" says the king, very sarcastic; "but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't

                    <p>The duke bristles right up, now, and says:</p>

                    <p>The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:</p>

                    <p>The king begun to gurgle, and then he gasps out:</p>

                    <p>I was very glad to hear him say that, it made me feel much more easier

                        says:</p>
                    <p>"If you ever deny it again, I'll drown you. It's <hi rend="italic">well</hi>
                        for you to set there and<lb/> blubber like a baby&#x2014;it's fitten for

                        never say a word<lb/> for 'em. It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was
                        soft enough to <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> that<lb/> rubbage. Cuss you, I
                        can see, now, why you was so anxious to make up the<lb/>

                    <p>The king says, timid, and still a snuffling:</p>
                    <p>"Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffersit, it warn't<lb/>
                        me."</p>
                    <p>"Dry up! I don't want to hear no more <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of you!"
                        says the duke. "And<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">now</hi> you see what you <hi rend="italic">got</hi> by
                        it. They've got all their own money back, and all<lb/> of <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>So the king sneaked into the wigwam, and took to his bottle for comfort;
                        and<lb/> before long the duke tackled <hi rend="italic">his</hi> bottle; and
                        so in about a half an hour they was<lb/> as thick as thieves again, and the

                        <pb n="265" entity="u000002472_0280"/> went off a snoring in each other's

                        money-bag again. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of<lb/> course when
                        they got to snoring, we had a long gabble, and I told Jim <reg

                    <p>First they done a lecture on<lb/> temperance; but they didn't make<lb/>
                        enough for them both to get<lb/> drunk on. Then in another village<lb/> they
                        started a dancing school; but they didn't know no more how to dance
                        than<lb/> a kangaroo does; so the first prance they made, the general public
                        jumped in<lb/> and pranced them out of town. Another time they tried a go at
                        yellocution;<lb/> but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up
                        and give them a solid good<lb/> cussing and made them skip out. They tackled
                        missionarying, and <reg orig="mesmerizer-|ing">mesmerizering</reg>,<lb/> and
                        doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a little of everything; but they<lb/>
                        couldn't seem to have no luck. So at last they got just about dead broke, and<lb/>
                        <pb n="267" entity="u000002472_0282"/> laid around the raft, as she floated
                        along, thinking, and thinking, and never<lb/> saying nothing, by the half a
                        day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.</p>
                    <p>And at last they took a change, and begun to lay their heads together in
                        the<lb/> wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time.
                        Jim and<lb/> me got uneasy. We didn't like the look of it. We judged they
                        was studying<lb/> up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. We turned it
                        over and over, and at<lb/> last we made up our minds they was going to break
                        into somebody's house or<lb/> store, or was going into the counterfeit-money
                        business, or something. So then<lb/> we was pretty scared, and made up an
                        agreement that we wouldn't have nothing<lb/> in the world to do with such
                        actions, and if we ever got the least show we would<lb/> give them the cold
                        shake, and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one<lb/> morning we
                        hid the raft in a good safe place about two mile below a little bit of<lb/>
                        a shabby village, named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore, and told us
                        all<lb/> to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if
                        anybody had got<lb/> any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet.
                        &lpar;"House to rob, you <hi rend="italic">mean,</hi>" says I to<lb/>
                        myself; "and when you get through robbing it you'll come back here and <reg
                            orig="won-|der">wonder</reg><lb/> what's become of me and Jim and the
                        raft&#x2014;and you'll have to take it out in<lb/> wondering."&rpar;
                        And he said if he warn't back by midday, the duke and me would<lb/> know it
                        was all right, and we was to come along.</p>
                    <p>So we staid where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and<lb/>
                        was in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we couldn't
                        seem<lb/> to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.
                        Something was<lb/> a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday come and
                        no king; we could<lb/> have a change, anyway&#x2014;and maybe a chance
                        for <hi rend="italic">the</hi> change, on top of it. So<lb/> me and the duke
                        went up to the village, and hunted around there for the king,<lb/> and
                        by-and-by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery, very
                        tight,<lb/> and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport, and he a
                        cussing and threatening<lb/> with all his might, and so tight he couldn't
                        walk, and couldn't do nothing to<lb/> them. The duke he begun to abuse him
                        for an old fool, and the king begun to<lb/> sass back; and the minute they
                        was fairly at it, I lit out, and shook the reefs out<lb/> of my hind legs,
                        and spun down the river road like a deer&#x2014;for I see our
                        chance;<lb/> and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before they
                        ever see me and<lb/>
                        <pb n="268" entity="u000002472_0283"/> Jim again. I got down there all out
                        of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung<lb/> out&#x2014;</p>
                    <p>"Set her loose, Jim, we're all right, now!"</p>
                    <p>But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim was<lb/>
                        gone! I set up a shout&#x2014;and then another&#x2014;and then
                        another one; and run this<lb/> way and that in the woods, whooping and
                        screeching; but it warn't no use&#x2014;old<lb/> Jim was gone. Then I
                        set down and cried; I couldn't help it. But I couldn't<lb/> set still long.
                        Pretty soon I went out on the road, trying to think what I better<lb/> do,
                        and I run across a boy walking, and asked him if he'd seen a strange
                        nigger,<lb/> dressed so and so, and he says:</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"Wherebouts?" says I.</p>
                    <p>"Down to Silas Phelps's place, two mile below here. He's a runaway
                        nigger,<lb/> and they've got him. Was you looking for him?"</p>
                    <p>"You bet I ain't! I run across him in the woods about an hour or two
                        ago,<lb/> and he said if I hollered he'd cut my livers out&#x2014;and
                        told me to lay down and<lb/> stay where I was; and I done it. Been there
                        ever since; afeard to come out."</p>
                    <p>"Well," he says, "you needn't be afeard no more, becuz they've got him.<lb/>
                        He run off f'm down South, som'ers."</p>
                    <p>"It's a good job they got him."</p>
                    <p>"Well, I <hi rend="italic">reckon!</hi> There's two hunderd dollars reward on
                        him. It's like<lb/> picking up money out'n the road."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, it is&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> could a had it if I'd
                        been big enough; I see him <hi rend="italic">first.</hi><lb/> Who nailed

                    <p>"It was an old fellow&#x2014;a stranger&#x2014;and he sold out his
                        chance in him for<lb/> forty dollars, becuz he's got to go up the river and
                        can't wait. Think o'that,<lb/> now! You bet <hi rend="italic">I'd</hi> wait,

                    <p>"That's me, every time," says I. "But maybe his chance ain't worth no<lb/>
                        more than that, if he'll sell it so cheap. Maybe there's something ain't

                    <p>"But it <hi rend="italic">is,</hi> though&#x2014;straight as a string. I

                        head<lb/> sore, but I couldn't see no way<lb/> out of the trouble. After

                        everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger, and they'd make<lb/> Jim
                        feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and disgraced. And then think of<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> It would get all around, that Huck Finn helped a
                        nigger to get his<lb/> freedom; and if I was to ever see anybody from that
                        town again, I'd be ready to<lb/>
                        <pb n="270" entity="u000002472_0285"/> get down and lick his boots for
                        shame. That's just the way: a person does a<lb/> low-down thing, and then he
                        don't want to take no consequences of it. Thinks<lb/> as long as he can hide
                        it, it ain't no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The<lb/> more I studied
                        about this, the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the<lb/> more
                        wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when it
                        hit<lb/> me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence
                        slapping me in<lb/> the face and letting me know my wickedness was being
                        watched all the time from<lb/> up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a
                        poor old woman's nigger that hadn't<lb/> ever done me no harm, and now was
                        showing me there's One that's always on the<lb/> lookout, and ain't agoing
                        to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur<lb/> and no
                        further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared. Well, I tried the<lb/>
                        best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself, by saying I was
                        brung up<lb/> wicked, and so I warn't so much to blame; but something inside
                        of me kept <reg orig="say-|ing">saying</reg>,<lb/> "There was the Sunday
                        school, you could a gone to it; and if you'd a done<lb/> it they'd a learnt
                        you, there, that people that acts as I'd been acting about that<lb/> nigger
                        goes to everlasting fire."</p>
                    <p>It made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray; and see if I<lb/>
                        couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was, and be better. So I
                        kneeled<lb/> down. But the words wouldn't come. Why wouldn't they? It warn't
                        no use<lb/> to try and hide it from Him. Nor from <hi rend="italic">me,</hi>
                        neither. I knowed very well why<lb/> they wouldn't come. It was because my
                        heart warn't right; it was because I<lb/> warn't square; is was because I
                        was playing double. I was letting <hi rend="italic">on</hi> to give up<lb/>
                        sin, but away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all. I
                        was<lb/> trying to make my mouth <hi rend="italic">say</hi> I would do the
                        right thing and the clean thing,<lb/> and go and write to that nigger's
                        owner and tell where he was; but deep down<lb/> in me I knowed it was a
                        lie&#x2014;and He knowed it. You can't pray a lie&#x2014;I
                        found<lb/> that out.</p>
                    <p>So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to do.
                        At<lb/> last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the
                        letter&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> see if I can<lb/> pray.
                        Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as light as a feather, right
                        straight<lb/> off, and my troubles all gone. So I got a piece of paper and a
                        pencil, all glad<lb/> and excited, and set down and wrote: </p>
                    <pb n="271" entity="u000002472_0286"/>
                    <p>Miss Watson your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville
                        and Mr.<lb/> Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if
                        you send. <hi rend="small-caps">Huck Finn.</hi></p>
                    <p>I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so
                        in<lb/> my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn't do it straight
                        off, but<lb/> laid the paper down and set<lb/> there
                        thinking&#x2014;thinking how<lb/> good it was all this happened<lb/> so,
                        and how near I come to<lb/> being lost and going to hell.<lb/> And went on
                        thinking. And<lb/> got to thinking over our trip<lb/> down the river; and I
                        see<lb/> Jim before me, all the time,<lb/> in the day, and in the <reg
                            orig="night-|time">nighttime</reg>,<lb/> sometimes moonlight,<lb/>
                        sometimes storms, and we a<lb/> floating along, talking, and<lb/> singing,
                        and laughing. But<lb/> somehow I couldn't seem to<lb/> strike no places to
                        harden me<lb/> against him, but only the<lb/> other kind. I'd see him<lb/>
                        standing my watch on top of<lb/> his'n, stead of calling me, so I could go
                        on sleeping; and see him how glad he<lb/> was when I come back out of the
                        fog; and when I come to him again in the<lb/> swamp, up there where the feud
                        was; and such-like times; and would always<lb/> call me honey, and pet me,
                        and do everything he could think of for me, and how<lb/> good he always was;
                        and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men<lb/> we had
                        small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best
                        friend<lb/> old Jim ever had in the world, and the <hi rend="italic"
                            >only</hi> one he's got now; and then I<lb/> happened to look around,
                        and see that paper.</p>
                    <figure id="f130" rend="inline" entity="u000002472_0286">

                    <p>It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a<lb/>
                        trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and
                        I<lb/> knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then
                        says to<lb/> myself:</p>
                    <p>"All right, then, I'll <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to hell"&#x2014;and tore
                        it up.</p>
                    <p>It was awful thoughts, and awful words, but they was said. And I let
                        them<lb/> stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the
                        whole<lb/> thing out of my head; and said I would take up wickedness again,
                        which was<lb/> in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't. And
                        for a starter, I<lb/> would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;
                        and if I could think up<lb/> anything worse, I would do that, too; because
                        as long as I was in, and in for<lb/> good, I might as well go the whole
                        hog.</p>
                    <p>Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over
                        considerable<lb/> many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that
                        suited me. So then I<lb/> took the bearings of a woody island that was down
                        the river a piece, and as soon<lb/> as it was fairly dark I crept out with
                        my raft and went for it, and hid it there,<lb/> and then turned in. I slept
                        the night through, and got up before it was light,<lb/> and had my
                        breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and<lb/> one
                        thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.<lb/>
                        I landed below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in
                        the<lb/> woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks
                        into her and<lb/> sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her,
                        about a quarter of a<lb/> mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the
                        bank.</p>
                    <p>Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on
                        it,<lb/> "Phelps's Sawmill," and when I come to the farm-houses, two or
                        three hundred<lb/> yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't
                        see nobody around, though<lb/> it was good daylight, now. But I didn't mind,
                        because I didn't want to see<lb/> nobody just yet&#x2014;I only wanted
                        to get the lay of the land. According to my<lb/> plan, I was going to turn
                        up there from the village, not from below. So I just<lb/> took a look, and
                        shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see,<lb/> when I
                        got there, was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal <reg
                            orig="None-|such&#x2014;three-night"
                            >Nonesuch&#x2014;three-night</reg><lb/> performance&#x2014;like
                        that other time. <hi rend="italic">They</hi> had the cheek,<lb/>
                        <pb n="273" entity="u000002472_0288"/> them frauds! I was right on him,
                        before I could shirk. He looked astonished,<lb/> and says:</p>
                    <p>"Hel-<hi rend="italic">lo!</hi> Where'd <hi rend="italic">you</hi> come
                        from?" Then he says, kind of glad and eager,<lb/> "Where's the
                        raft?&#x2014;got her in a good place?"</p>
                    <p>I says:</p>
                    <p>"Why, that's just what I was agoing to ask your grace."</p>
                    <p>Then he didn't look so joyful&#x2014;and says:</p>
                    <p>"What was your idea for asking <hi rend="italic">me?</hi>" he says.</p>
                    <p>"Well," I says, "when I see the king in that doggery yesterday, I says to
                            <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg>,<lb/> we can't get him home for hours,
                        till he's soberer; so I went a loafing<lb/> around town to put in the time,
                        and wait. A man up and offered me ten cents<lb/> to help him pull a skiff
                        over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went<lb/> along; but when
                        we was dragging him to the boat, and the man left me aholt of<lb/> the rope
                        and went behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me, and<lb/>
                        jerked loose and run, and we after him. We didn't have no dog, and so we
                        had<lb/> to chase him all over the country till we tired him out. We never
                        got him till<lb/> dark, then we fetched him over, and I started down for the
                        raft. When I got<lb/> there and see it was gone, I says to myself, 'they've
                        got into trouble and had to<lb/> leave; and they've took my nigger, which is
                        the only nigger I've got in the world,<lb/> and now I'm in a strange
                        country, and ain't got no property no more, nor <reg orig="noth-|ing"
                            >nothing</reg>,<lb/> and no way to make my living;' so I set down and
                        cried. I slept in the<lb/> woods all night. But what <hi rend="italic"
                            >did</hi> become of the raft then?&#x2014;and Jim, poor Jim!"</p>

                        when we found him in the doggery the<lb/> loafers had matched half dollars
                        with him and got every cent but what he'd spent<lb/> for whisky; and when I
                        got him home late last night and found the raft gone,<lb/> we said, 'That

                    <p>"I wouldn't shake my <hi rend="italic">nigger,</hi> would I?&#x2014;the

                    <p>"I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow.
                        I<lb/> got to turn out and find my nigger."</p>
                    <pb n="275" entity="u000002472_0290"/>
                    <p>He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on
                        his<lb/> arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. At last he says:</p>
                    <p>"I'll tell you something. We got to be here three days. If you'll
                        promise<lb/> you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell you
                        where to find him."</p>
                    <p>So I promised, and he says:</p>
                    <p>"A farmer by the name of Silas Ph&#x2014;&#x2014;" and then he
                        stopped. You see he<lb/> started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped,
                        that way, and begun to study<lb/> and think again, I reckoned he was
                        changing his mind. And so he was. He<lb/> wouldn't trust me; he wanted to
                        make sure of having me out of the way the<lb/> whole three days. So pretty
                        soon he says: "The man that bought him is named<lb/> Abram
                        Foster&#x2014;Abram G. Foster&#x2014;and he lives forty mile back
                        here in the<lb/> country, on the road to Lafayette."</p>

                    <p>"All right," I says, "I can walk it in three days. And I'll start this

                    <p>"No you won't, you'll start <hi rend="italic">now;</hi> and don't you lose

                    <p>That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. I wanted
                        to<lb/> be left free to work my plans.</p>
                    <p>"So clear out," he says; "and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want
                        to.<lb/> Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim <hi rend="italic">is</hi>

                    <p>So I left, and struck for the back country. I didn't look around, but I<lb/>
                        kinder felt like he was watching me. But I knowed I could tire him out at
                        that.<lb/> I went straight out in the country as much as a mile, before I
                        stopped; then I<lb/> doubled back through the woods towards Phelps's. I
                        reckoned I better start in<lb/> on my plan straight off, without fooling
                        around, because I wanted to stop Jim's<lb/> mouth till these fellows could
                        get away. I didn't want no trouble with their<lb/> kind. I'd seen all I
                        wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of<lb/> them.</p>

                    <p>I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and started
                        for<lb/> the kitchen. When I got a little ways, I heard the dim hum of a

                    <p>I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting to

                    <p>When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went
                        for<lb/> me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still. And
                        such another<lb/> pow-wow as they made! In a quarter of a minute I was a

                        dogs&#x2014;circle of fifteen of them packed<lb/> together around me,

                    <p>A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her

                        wagging their tails around<lb/> me and making friends with me. There ain't
                        no harm in a hound, nohow.</p>
                    <p>And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger
                        boys,<lb/> without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung onto
                        their mother's<lb/> gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the

                        over; and she couldn't<lb/> seem to hug and shake enough,<lb/> and kept
                        saying, "You don't<lb/> look as much like your mother<lb/> as I reckoned you

                    <p>I said I had got it on the boat. So then she started for the house, leading

                        set me down<lb/> in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on a little

                    <p>I didn't rightly know what to say, because I didn't know whether the

                        instinct; and<lb/> my instinct said she would be coming up&#x2014;from
                        down towards Orleans. That<lb/> did'nt help me much, though; for I didn't
                        know the names of bars down that way.<lb/> I see I'd got to invent a bar, or

                        Now I struck an idea, and fetched it out:</p>

                    <p>"Well, it's lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt. Two years ago<lb/>

                        in the hope<lb/> of a glorious resurrection. They say he was a sight to look

                    <p>"Who'd you give the baggage to?"</p>
                    <p>"Nobody."</p>
                    <p>"Why, child, it'll be stole!"</p>
                    <p>"Not where <hi rend="italic">I</hi> hid it I reckon it won't," I says.</p>
                    <p>"How'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat?"</p>
                    <pb n="281" entity="u000002472_0296"/>
                    <p>It was kinder thin ice, but I says:</p>
                    <p>"The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something
                        to<lb/> eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the
                        officers' lunch, and<lb/> give me all I wanted."</p>
                    <p>I was getting so uneasy I couldn't listen good. I had my mind on the<lb/>
                        children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side, and pump them
                        a<lb/> little, and find out who I was. But I couldn't get no show, Mrs.
                        Phelps kept it<lb/> up and run on so. Pretty soon she made the cold chills
                        streak all down my back,<lb/> because she says:</p>
                    <p>"But here we're a running on this way, and you hain't told me a word<lb/>
                        about Sis, nor any of them. Now I'll rest my works a little, and you start
                        up<lb/> yourn; just tell me <hi rend="italic"
                        >everything</hi>&#x2014;tell me all about'm all&#x2014;every one of
                        'm; and<lb/> how they are, and what they're doing, and what they told you to
                        tell me; and<lb/> every last thing you can think of."</p>
                    <p>Well, I see I was up a stump&#x2014;and up it good. Providence had stood
                        by me this<lb/> fur, all right, but I was hard and tight aground, now. I see
                        it warn't a bit of use<lb/> to try to go ahead&#x2014;I'd <hi
                            rend="italic">got</hi> to throw up my hand. So I says to myself,
                        here's<lb/> another place where I got to resk the truth. I opened my mouth
                        to begin; but<lb/> she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed, and
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"Here he comes! stick your head down lower&#x2014;there, that'll do; you
                        can't be<lb/> seen, now. Don't you let on you're here. I'll play a joke on
                        him. Children,<lb/> don't you say a word."</p>
                    <p>I see I was in a fix, now. But it warn't no use to worry; there warn't
                        nothing<lb/> to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand from
                        under when the<lb/> lightning struck.</p>
                    <p>I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in, then
                        the<lb/> bed hid him. Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him and says:</p>
                    <p>"Has he come?"</p>
                    <p>"No," says her husband.</p>
                    <p>"Good-<hi rend="italic">ness</hi> gracious!" she says, "what in the world <hi
                            rend="italic">can</hi> have become of him?"</p>
                    <p>"I can't imagine," says the old gentleman; "and I must say, it makes me<lb/>
                        dreadful uneasy."</p>
                    <pb n="282" entity="u000002472_0297"/>
                    <p>"Uneasy!" she says, "I'm ready to go distracted! He <hi rend="italic"
                            >must</hi> a come; and<lb/> you've missed him along the road. I <hi

                            >tells</hi> me so."</p>
                    <p>"Why Sally, I <hi rend="italic">couldn't</hi> miss him along the

                    <p>"But oh, dear, dear, what <hi rend="italic">will</hi> Sis say! He must a

                    <p>"Oh, don't distress me any more'n I'm already distressed. I don't know<lb/>
                        what in the world to make of it. I'm at my wit's end, and I don't mind <reg

                        scared. But there's no hope that he's come; for<lb/> he <hi rend="italic"
                            >couldn't</hi> come and me miss him. Sally, it's
                        terrible&#x2014;just terrible&#x2014;something's<lb/> happened to
                        the boat, sure!"</p>
                    <p>"Why, Silas! Look yonder!&#x2014;up the road!&#x2014;ain't that
                        somebody coming?"</p>
                    <p>He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs. Phelps
                        the<lb/> chance she wanted. She stooped down quick, at the foot of the bed,
                        and give me<lb/> a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the
                        window, there she<lb/> stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire,
                        and I standing pretty meek<lb/> and sweaty alongside. The old gentleman
                        stared, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Why, who's that?"</p>
                    <p>"Who do you reckon 't is?"</p>
                    <p>"I haint no idea. Who <hi rend="italic">is</hi> it?"</p>
                    <p>"It's <hi rend="italic">Tom Sawyer!"</hi></p>
                    <p>By jings, I most slumped though the floor. But there warn't no time to
                        swap<lb/> knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on
                        shaking;<lb/> and all the time, how the woman did dance around and laugh and
                        cry; and then<lb/> how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary,
                        and the rest of the<lb/> tribe.</p>
                    <p>But if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; for it was like
                        being<lb/> born again, I was so glad to find out who I was. Well, they froze
                        to me for two<lb/> hours; and at last when my chin was so tired it couldn't
                        hardly go, any more, I<lb/> had told them more about my family&#x2014;I
                        mean the Sawyer family&#x2014;than ever<lb/> happened to any six Sawyer
                        families. And I explained all about how we blowed<lb/> out a cylinder-head
                        at the mouth of White River and it took us three days to fix<lb/> it. Which
                        was all right, and worked first rate; because <hi rend="italic">they</hi>
                        didn't know but<lb/>
                        <pb n="283" entity="u000002472_0298"/> what it would take three days to fix
                        it. If I'd a called it a bolt-head it would<lb/> a done just as well.</p>
                    <p>Now I was feeling pretty <reg orig="com-|fortable">comfortable</reg><lb/> all
                        down one side, and<lb/> pretty uncomfortable all up<lb/> the other. Being
                        Tom Sawyer<lb/> was easy and comfortable; and<lb/> it stayed easy and
                        comfortable<lb/> till by-and-by I hear a steamboat<lb/> coughing along down
                        the river&#x2014;<lb/> then I says to myself, spose Tom<lb/> Sawyer come
                        down on that boat?<lb/> &#x2014;and spose he steps in here, any<lb/>
                        minute, and sings out my name<lb/> before I can throw him a wink<lb/> to
                        keep quiet? Well, I couldn't<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">have</hi> it that way&#x2014;it wouldn't do<lb/> at
                        all. I must go up the road<lb/> and waylay him. So I told the<lb/> folks I
                        reckoned I would go up<lb/> to the town and fetch down my<lb/> baggage. The
                        old gentleman was for going along with me, but I said no, I could<lb/> drive
                        the horse myself, and I druther he wouldn't take no trouble about me.</p>

                    <p>"Well&#x2014;I&#x2014;I&#x2014;well, that ought to settle it, of

                        let him alone a minute, and don't disturb him. So he<lb/> thought and
                        thought, and pretty soon he says:</p>

                    <p>I says:</p>

                    <p>His eye lit up, and he says:</p>

                    <p>Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. It was the most

                    <p>Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his way,<lb/>

                        of<lb/> being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too quick for
                        that length<lb/> of a trip. The old gentleman was at the door, and he

                        horse now; I<lb/> wouldn't, honest; and yet I'd a sold her for fifteen
                        before, and thought 'twas<lb/> all she was worth."</p>
                    <p>That's all he said. He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see. But
                        it<lb/> warn't surprising; because he warn't only just a farmer, he was a
                        preacher, too,<lb/> and had a little one-horse log church down back of the
                        plantation, which he<lb/> built it himself at his own expense, for a church
                        and school-house, and never<lb/> charged nothing for his preaching, and it
                        was worth it, too. There was plenty<lb/> other farmer-preachers like that,
                        and done the same way, down South.</p>
                    <p>In about half an hour Tom's wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt<lb/>
                        Sally she see it through the window because it was only about fifty yards,
                        and<lb/> says:</p>
                    <p>"Why, there's somebody come! I wonder who 'tis? Why, I do believe it's<lb/> a
                        stranger. Jimmy" &lpar;that's one of the children&rpar;, "run and
                        tell Lize to put on<lb/> another plate for dinner."</p>
                    <p>Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger
                        don't<lb/> come <hi rend="italic">every</hi> year, and so he lays over the
                        yaller fever, for interest, when he does<lb/> come. Tom was over the stile
                        and starting for the house; the wagon was <reg orig="spin-|ning"
                            >spinning</reg><lb/> up the road for the village, and we was all bunched
                        in the front door. Tom<lb/> had his store clothes on, and an
                        audience&#x2014;and that was always nuts for Tom<lb/> Sawyer. In them
                        circumstances it warn't no trouble to him to throw in an<lb/> amount of
                        style that was suitable. He warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard<lb/>
                        like a sheep; no, he come ca'm and important, like the ram. When he got<lb/>
                        afront of us, he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the
                        lid of a<lb/> box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn't want to
                        disturb them, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?"</p>
                    <pb n="287" entity="u000002472_0302"/>
                    <p>"No, my boy," says the old gentleman, "I'm sorry to say 't your driver
                        has<lb/> deceived you; Nichols's place is down a matter of three mile more.
                        Come in,<lb/> come in."</p>
                    <p>Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, "Too
                        late&#x2014;he's out of<lb/> sight."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, he's gone, my son, and you<lb/> must come in and eat your dinner<lb/>
                        with us; and then we'll hitch up and<lb/> take you down to Nichols's."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, I <hi rend="italic">can't</hi> make you so much<lb/> trouble; I couldn't
                        think of it. I'll<lb/> walk&#x2014;I don't mind the distance."</p>
                    <p>"But we won't <hi rend="italic">let</hi> you walk&#x2014;it<lb/> wouldn't

                    <p>"Oh, <hi rend="italic">do,</hi>" says Aunt Sally; "it<lb/> ain't a bit of

                        wiped it off with the back of her hand, and says:</p>

                    <p>"You're s'rp&#x2014;Why, what do you reckon <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am?

                    <p>He looked kind of humble, and says:</p>

                        it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it. "What

                    <p>"Well, I don't know. Only, they&#x2014;they&#x2014;told me you

                        They said you would, and I thought you would. But&#x2014;" He stopped
                        and looked<lb/> around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly

                        "Didn't <hi rend="italic">you</hi> think she'd like me to<lb/> kiss her,

                    <p>Then he looks on around, the same way, to me&#x2014;and says:</p>

                    <p>"My land!" she says, breaking in and jumping for him, "you impudent<lb/>
                        young rascal, to fool a body so&#x2014;" and was going to hug him, but
                        he fended her<lb/> off, and says:</p>
                    <p>"No, not till you've asked me, first."</p>
                    <p>So she didn't lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed
                        him,<lb/> over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and
                        he took what<lb/> was left. And after they got a little quiet again, she
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise. We warn't looking for <hi

                        about anybody coming but him."</p>
                    <p>"It's because it warn't <hi rend="italic">intended</hi> for any of us to come
                        but Tom," he says;<lb/> "but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she

                        me and Tom thought it would be a first-rate surprise for him<lb/> to come
                        here to the house first, and for me to by-and-by tag along and drop in<lb/>
                        and let on to be a stranger. But it was a mistake, Aunt Sally. This ain't
                        no<lb/> healthy place for a stranger to come."</p>
                    <p>"No&#x2014;not impudent whelps, Sid. You ought to had your jaws boxed; I

                        jokes to have you here. Well, to<lb/> think of that performance! I don't
                        deny it, I was most putrified with <reg orig="astonish-|ment"

                    <p>We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the<lb/>
                        kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven
                        families&#x2014;and all<lb/> hot, too; none of your flabby tough meat
                        that's laid in a cupboard in a damp<lb/> cellar all night and tastes like a
                        hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning. Uncle<lb/> Silas he asked a pretty
                        long blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn't<lb/> cool it a
                        bit, neither, the way I've seen them kind of interruptions do, lots of
                        times.</p>
                    <p>There was a considerable good deal of talk, all the afternoon, and me and
                        Tom<lb/> was on the lookout all the time, but it warn't no use, they didn't
                        happen to say<lb/>
                        <pb n="290" entity="u000002472_0305"/> nothing about any runaway nigger, and
                        we was afraid to try to work up to it.<lb/> But at supper, at night, one of
                        the little boys says:</p>
                    <p>"Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?"</p>
                    <p>"No," says the old man, "I reckon there ain't going to be any; and you<lb/>
                        couldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and me
                        all<lb/> about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the
                        people; so I reckon<lb/> they've drove the owdacious loafers out of town

                    <p>We see we was too late&#x2014;couldn't do no good. We asked some
                        stragglers<lb/> about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking
                        very innocent; and<lb/> laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in

                    <p>What a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer's head, I

                    <p>"My plan is this," I says. "We can easy find out if it's Jim in there.
                        Then<lb/> get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the
                        island. Then<lb/> the first dark night that comes, steal the key out of the

                        on the raft, with Jim, hiding <reg orig="day-|times">daytimes</reg><lb/> and
                        running nights, the way me and Jim used to do before. Wouldn't that<lb/>

                        wouldn't make<lb/> no more talk than breaking into a soap factory."</p>
                    <p>I never said nothing, because I warn't expecting nothing different; but
                        I<lb/> knowed mighty well that whenever he got <hi rend="italic">his</hi>
                        plan ready it wouldn't have none of<lb/> them objections to it.</p>
                    <p>And it didn't. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was
                        worth<lb/> fifteen of mine, for style, and would make Jim just as free a man
                        as mine would,<lb/> and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied,
                        and said we would waltz<lb/> in on it. I needn't tell what it was, here,
                        because I knowed it wouldn't stay the<lb/> way it was. I knowed he would be
                        changing it around, every which way, as we<lb/>
                        <pb n="295" entity="u000002472_0310"/> went along, and heaving in new
                        bullinesses wherever he got a chance. And that<lb/> is what he done.</p>
                    <p>Well, one thing was dead sure; and that was, that Tom Sawyer was in
                        earnest<lb/> and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.
                        That was the thing<lb/> that was too many for me. Here was a boy that was
                        respectable, and well brung<lb/> up; and had a character to lose; and folks
                        at home that had characters; and he<lb/> was bright and not leather-headed;
                        and knowing and not ignorant; and not<lb/> mean, but kind; and yet here he
                        was, without any more pride, or rightness, or<lb/> feeling, than to stoop to
                        this business, and make himself a shame, and his family<lb/> a shame, before
                        everybody. I <hi rend="italic">couldn't</hi> understand it, no way at all.
                        It was <reg orig="out-|rageous">outrageous</reg>,<lb/> and I knowed I ought
                        to just up and tell him so; and so be his true<lb/> friend, and let him quit
                        the thing right where he was, and save himself. And I<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">did</hi> start to tell him; but he shut me up, and
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"Don't you reckon I know what I'm about? Don't I generly know what I'm<lb/>
                        about?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"Didn't I <hi rend="italic">say</hi> I was going to help steal the
                        nigger?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">"Well</hi> then."</p>
                    <p>That's all he said, and that's all I said. It warn't no use to say any
                        more;<lb/> because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it. But <hi
                            rend="italic">I</hi> couldn't<lb/> make out how he was willing to go
                        into this thing; so I just let it go, and<lb/> never bothered no more about
                        it. If he was bound to have it so, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> couldn't<lb/>
                        help it.</p>
                    <p>When we got home, the house was all dark and still; so we went on down
                        to<lb/> the hut by the ash hopper, for to examine it. We went through the
                        yard, so as<lb/> to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and didn't
                        make no more<lb/> noise than country dogs is always doing when anything
                        comes by in the night.<lb/> When we got to the cabin, we took a look at the
                        front and the two sides; and on<lb/> the side I warn't acquainted
                        with&#x2014;which was the north side&#x2014;we found a square<lb/>
                        window-hole, up tolerable high, with just one stout board nailed across it.
                        I<lb/> says:</p>
                    <pb n="296" entity="u000002472_0311"/>
                    <p>"Here's the ticket. This hole's big enough for Jim to get through, if we<lb/>
                        wrench off the board."</p>
                    <p>Tom says:</p>
                    <p>"It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing hooky.
                        I<lb/> should <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> we can find a way that's a little
                        more complicated than <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> Huck<lb/> Finn."</p>
                    <p>"Well then," I says,<lb/> "how'll it do to saw him out,<lb/> the way I done
                        before I was<lb/> murdered, that time?"</p>
                    <p>"That's more <hi rend="italic">like,"</hi> he<lb/> says. "It's real
                        mysterious, and<lb/> troublesome, and good," he<lb/> says; "but I bet we can
                        find<lb/> a way that's twice as long.<lb/> There ain't no hurry; le's
                        keep<lb/> on looking around."</p>

                    <p>Betwixt the hut and the<lb/> fence, on the back side, was a<lb/> lean-to,
                        that joined the hut at<lb/> the eaves, and was made out of<lb/> plank. It
                        was as long as the<lb/> hut, but narrow&#x2014;only about<lb/> six foot
                        wide. The door to it<lb/> was at the south end, and was<lb/> padlocked. Tom
                        he went to<lb/> the soap kettle, and searched<lb/> around and fetched back
                        the iron thing they lift the lid with; so he took it and<lb/> prized out one
                        of the staples. The chain fell down, and we opened the door<lb/> and went
                        in, and shut it, and struck a match, and see the shed was only built
                        against<lb/> the cabin and hadn't no connection with it; and there warn't no
                        floor to the shed,<lb/> nor nothing in it but some old rusty played-out
                        hoes, and spades, and picks, and<lb/>
                        <pb n="297" entity="u000002472_0312"/> a crippled plow. The match went out,
                        and so did we, and shoved in the staple<lb/> again, and the door was locked
                        as good as ever. Tom was joyful. He says:</p>
                    <p>"Now we're all right. We'll <hi rend="italic">dig</hi> him out. It'll take
                        about a week!"</p>
                    <p>Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door&#x2014;you
                        only have to<lb/> pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the

                        must climb up the<lb/> lightning-rod. But after he got up half-way about
                        three times, and missed fire<lb/> and fell every time, and the last time
                        most busted his brains out, he thought he'd<lb/> got to give it up; but
                        after he was rested, he allowed he would give her one more<lb/> turn for
                        luck, and this time he made the trip.</p>
                    <p>In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins
                        to<lb/> pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed
                        Jim&#x2014;if it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> Jim that<lb/> was being fed.
                        The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for<lb/> the
                        fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat
                        and<lb/> things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the
                        house.</p>
                    <p>This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all
                        tied<lb/> up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches off. He
                        said the<lb/> witches was pestering him awful, these nights, and making him
                        see all kinds of<lb/> strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words
                        and noises, and he didn't <reg orig="be-|lieve">believe</reg><lb/> he was
                        ever witched so long, before, in his life. He got so worked up, and<lb/> got
                        to running on so about his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been
                        agoing<lb/> to do. So Tom says:</p>
                    <p>"What's the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?"</p>
                    <p>The nigger kind of smiled around graduly over his face, like when you
                        heave<lb/> a brickbat in a mud puddle, and he says:</p>
                    <p>"Yes, Mars Sid, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> dog. Cur'us dog, too. Does you want

                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>I hunched Tom, and whispers:</p>
                    <p>"You going, right here in the day-break? <hi rend="italic">That</hi> warn't
                        the plan."</p>
                    <p>"No, it warn't&#x2014;but it's the plan <hi rend="italic">now."</hi></p>
                    <p>So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much. When we got in,<lb/>
                        <pb n="298" entity="u000002472_0313"/> we couldn't hardly see anything, it
                        was so dark; but Jim was there, sure enough,<lb/> and could see us; and he
                        sings out:</p>
                    <p>"Why, <hi rend="italic">Huck!</hi> En good <hi rend="italic">lan'!</hi> ain'
                        dat Misto Tom?"</p>
                    <p>I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
                        didn't know nothing to<lb/> do; and if I had, I couldn't a done it; because
                        that nigger busted in and says:</p>
                    <p>"Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?"</p>
                    <p>We could see pretty well, now. Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and<lb/>
                        kind of wondering, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Does <hi rend="italic">who</hi> know us?"</p>
                    <p>"Why, dish-yer runaway nigger."</p>
                    <p>"I don't reckon he does; but what put that into your head?"</p>
                    <p>"What <hi rend="italic">put</hi> it dar? Didn' he jis' dis minute sing out
                        like he knowed you?"</p>
                    <p>Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:</p>
                    <p>"Well, that's mighty curious. <hi rend="italic">Who</hi> sung out? <hi
                            rend="italic">When</hi> did he sing out? <hi rend="italic"
                        >What</hi><lb/> did he sing out?" And turns to me, perfectly c'am, and says,
                        "Did <hi rend="italic">you</hi> hear<lb/> anybody sing out?"</p>
                    <p>Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:</p>
                    <p>"No; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> ain't heard nobody say nothing."</p>
                    <p>Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before;
                        and<lb/> says:</p>
                    <p>"Did you sing out?"</p>
                    <p>"No, sah," says Jim; <hi rend="italic">"I</hi> hain't said nothing, sah."</p>
                    <p>"Not a word?"</p>
                    <p>"No, sah, I hain't said a word."</p>
                    <p>"Did you ever see us before?"</p>
                    <p>"No, sah; not as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> knows on."</p>
                    <p>So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and
                        says,<lb/> kind of severe:</p>
                    <p>"What do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway? What made you<lb/> think
                        somebody sung out?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, it's de dad-blame' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do. Dey's<lb/>

                        Silas he'll scole me; 'kase he say dey<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> no witches. I jis' wish to goodness he was heah

                    <p>Tom give him a dime, and<lb/> said we wouldn't tell <reg orig="no-|body"
                            >nobody</reg>;<lb/> and told him to buy<lb/> some more thread to tie up

                    <p>"I wonder if Uncle Silas<lb/> is going to hang this nigger.<lb/> If I was to

                        whilst<lb/> the nigger stepped to the<lb/> door to look at the dime and<lb/>
                        bite it to see if it was good,<lb/> he whispers to Jim, and says:</p>

                        just as sure as you're<lb/> born. Now, the way I look at it, a hickry-bark
                        ladder don't cost nothing, and<lb/> don't waste nothing, and is just as good
                        to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw<lb/> tick, as any rag ladder you
                        can start; and as for Jim, he ain't had no experience,<lb/> and so <hi

                        heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark<lb/> ladder? Why, it's
                        perfectly ridiculous."</p>
                    <p>"Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you'll take my
                        advice,<lb/> you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothes-line."</p>
                    <p>He said that would do. And that give him another idea, and he says:</p>
                    <p>"Borrow a shirt, too."</p>
                    <p>"What do we want of a shirt, Tom?"</p>
                    <p>"Want it for Jim to keep a journal on."</p>

                    <p>He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing. So we<lb/>
                        cleared out for the house.</p>
                    <p>Along during that morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of
                        the<lb/> clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we
                        went down and<lb/> got the fox-fire, and put that in too. I called it
                        borrowing, because that was<lb/> what pap always called it; but Tom said it
                        warn't borrowing, it was stealing.<lb/> He said we was representing
                        prisoners; and prisoners don't care how they get a<lb/> thing so they get
                        it, and nobody don't blame them for it, either. It ain't no<lb/>
                        <pb n="305" entity="u000002472_0320"/> crime in a prisoner to steal the
                        thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it's<lb/> his right; and so, as
                        long as<lb/> we was representing a <reg orig="pris-|oner"
                        >prisoner</reg>,<lb/> we had a perfect right<lb/> to steal anything on
                        this<lb/> place we had the least use<lb/> for, to get ourselves out of<lb/>
                        prison with. He said if we<lb/> warn't prisoners it would be<lb/> a very
                        different thing, and<lb/> nobody but a mean ornery<lb/> person would steal
                        when he<lb/> warn't a prisoner. So we<lb/> allowed we would steal <reg
                            orig="every-|thing">everything</reg><lb/> there was that come<lb/>
                        handy. And yet he made a<lb/> mighty fuss, one day, after<lb/> that, when I
                        stole a <reg orig="water-|melon">watermelon</reg><lb/> out of the nigger
                        patch<lb/> and eat it; and he made me<lb/> go and give the niggers a<lb/>
                        dime, without telling them<lb/> what it was for. Tom said<lb/> that what he
                        meant was, we<lb/> could steal anything we <hi rend="italic">needed.</hi>
                        Well, I says, I needed the watermelon. But<lb/> he said I didn't need it to
                        get out of prison with, there's where the difference<lb/> was. He said if
                        I'd a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill<lb/> the
                        seneskal with, it would a been all right. So I let it go at that, though
                        I<lb/> couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner, if I got to
                        set down and<lb/> chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that, every
                        time I see a chance to hog<lb/> a watermelon.</p>

                    <p>He turns on me looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Huck Finn, did you <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> hear of a prisoner having
                        picks and shovels, and all<lb/> the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to

                        they wouldn't furnish 'em to a<lb/> king."</p>
                    <p>"Well, then," I says, "if we don't want the picks and shovels, what do
                        we<lb/> want?"</p>
                    <p>"A couple of case-knives."</p>
                    <p>"To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"Confound it, it's foolish, Tom."</p>
                    <p>"It don't make no difference how foolish it is, it's the <hi rend="italic"

                        We cleared everything out of the way,<lb/> about four or five foot along the

                        would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry;

                        "your head gets leveler and leveler all the<lb/> time, Tom Sawyer," I says.
                        "Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and as for<lb/> me, I don't care
                        shucks for the morality of it, nohow. When I start in to steal<lb/> a

                    <p>"Well," he says, "there's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like

                    <p>He had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down, and<lb/>

                    <p>"Gimme a <hi rend="italic">case-knife."</hi></p>
                    <p>I didn't know just what to do&#x2014;but then I thought. I scratched around<lb/>
                        <pb n="311" entity="u000002472_0326"/> amongst the old tools, and got a
                        pick-ax and give it to him, and he took it and<lb/> went to work, and never
                        said a word.</p>
                    <p>He was always just that particular. Full of principle</p>
                    <p>So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about, and<lb/>
                        made the fur fly. We stuck to it<lb/> about a half an hour, which was
                        as<lb/> long as we could stand up; but we<lb/> had a good deal of a hole to
                        show<lb/> for it. When I got up stairs, I<lb/> looked out at the window and
                        see<lb/> Tom doing his level best with the<lb/> lightning-rod, but he
                        couldn't come<lb/> it, his hands was so sore. At last<lb/> he says:</p>
                    <p>"It ain't no use, it can't be<lb/> done. What you reckon I better<lb/> do?
                        Can't you think up no way?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes," I says, "but I reckon<lb/> it ain't regular. Come up the<lb/> stairs,

                    <p>So he done it.</p>

                    <p>Next day Tom stole a pewter<lb/> spoon and a brass candlestick in the<lb/>
                        house, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I
                        hung<lb/> around the nigger cabins, and laid for a chance, and stole three
                        tin plates. Tom<lb/> said it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever
                        see the plates that Jim<lb/> throwed out, because they'd fall in the
                        dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the<lb/> window-hole&#x2014;then we
                        could tote them back and he could use them over again.<lb/> So Tom was
                        satisfied. Then he says:</p>
                    <p>"Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim."</p>
                    <p>"Take them in through the hole," I says, "when we get it done."</p>
                    <pb n="312" entity="u000002472_0327"/>
                    <p>He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard
                        of<lb/> such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. By-and-by he
                        said he had<lb/> ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no need to
                        decide on any of<lb/> them yet. Said we'd got to post Jim first.</p>
                    <p>That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took one
                        of<lb/> the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard Jim
                        snoring;<lb/> so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him. Then we whirled
                        in with the pick<lb/> and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the job
                        was done. We crept in<lb/> under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and pawed
                        around and found the candle and<lb/> lit it, and stood over Jim a while, and
                        found him looking hearty and healthy, and<lb/> then we woke him up gentle
                        and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most<lb/> cried; and called us
                        honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for<lb/> having us
                        hunt up a cold chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with, right away,<lb/>
                        and clearing out without losing any time. But Tom he showed him how <reg
                            orig="un-|regular">unregular</reg><lb/> it would be, and set down and
                        told him all about our plans, and how we<lb/> could alter them in a minute
                        any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least<lb/> afraid, because we
                        would see he got away, <hi rend="italic">sure.</hi> So Jim he said it was
                        all right,<lb/> and we set there and talked over old times a while, and then
                        Tom asked a lot of<lb/> questions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in
                        every day or two to pray<lb/> with him, and Aunt Sally come in to see if he
                        was comfortable and had plenty to<lb/> eat, and both of them was kind as
                        they could be, Tom says:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">"Now</hi> I know how to fix it. We'll send you some things
                        by them."</p>
                    <p>I said, "Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackass ideas
                        I<lb/> ever struck;" but he never paid no attention to me; went right on. It
                        was his<lb/> way when he'd got his plans set.</p>
                    <p>So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie, and other
                        large<lb/> things, by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the
                        lookout, and not<lb/> be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and
                        we would put small things<lb/> in uncle's coat pockets and he must steal
                        them out; and we would tie things to<lb/> aunt's apron strings or put them
                        in her apron pocket, if we got a chance; and<lb/> told him what they would
                        be and what they was for. And told him how to keep<lb/> a journal on the
                        shirt with his blood, and all that. He told him everything.<lb/>
                        <pb n="313" entity="u000002472_0328"/> Jim he couldn't see no sense in the
                        most of it, but he allowed we was white folks<lb/> and knowed better than
                        him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just<lb/> as Tom
                        said.</p>
                    <p>Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good<lb/>
                        sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to bed,
                        with<lb/> hands that looked like they'd been chawed. Tom was in high
                        spirits. He said<lb/> it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the
                        most intellectural; and said if<lb/> he only could see his way to it we
                        would keep it up all the rest of our lives<lb/> and leave Jim to our
                        children to get out; for he believed Jim would come<lb/> to like it better
                        and better the more he got used to it. He said that in that<lb/> way it
                        could be strung out to as much as eighty year, and would be the best<lb/>
                        time on record. And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a
                        hand<lb/> in it.</p>
                    <p>In the morning we went out to the wood-pile and chopped up the brass <reg
                            orig="candle-|stick">candlestick</reg><lb/> into handy sizes, and Tom
                        put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket.<lb/> Then we went to the nigger
                        cabins, and while I got Nat's notice off, Tom shoved<lb/> a piece of
                        candlestick into the middle of a corn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and<lb/>
                        we went along with Nat to see how it would work, and it just worked
                        noble;<lb/> when Jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out; and there
                        warn't ever <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg><lb/> could a worked
                        better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what<lb/> it was only
                        just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into<lb/>
                        bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed
                        his<lb/> fork into it in three or four places, first.</p>
                    <p>And whilst we was a standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a
                        couple<lb/> of the hounds bulging in, from under Jim's bed; and they kept on
                        piling in till<lb/> there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room
                        in there to get your<lb/> breath. By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to
                        door. The nigger Nat he<lb/> only just hollered "witches!" once, and keeled
                        over onto the floor amongst the<lb/> dogs, and begun to groan like he was
                        dying. Tom jerked the door open and<lb/> flung out a slab of Jim's meat, and
                        the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he<lb/> was out himself and back
                        again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the<lb/> other door too.
                        Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting<lb/>
                        <pb n="314" entity="u000002472_0329"/> him, and asking him if he'd been
                        imagining he saw something again. He raised<lb/> up, and blinked his eyes
                        around, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Mars Sid, you'll say I's a fool, but if I didn't b'lieve I see most a

                        merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never<lb/> said
                        nothing, and went out. Tom see him do it, and remembered about the<lb/>
                        spoon, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Well, it ain't no use to send things by <hi rend="italic">him</hi> no more,

                        steps on<lb/> the stairs, and blowed out our light, and hid; and here comes
                        the old man, with<lb/> a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in
                        t'other, looking as absent-minded<lb/> as year before last. He went a

                        to them all. Then he stood about five minutes, picking<lb/>
                        <pb n="320" entity="u000002472_0335"/> tallow-drip off of his candle and
                        thinking. Then he turns off slow and dreamy<lb/> towards the stairs,
                        saying:</p>
                    <p>"Well, for the life of me I can't remember when I done it. I could show<lb/>

                    <p>And so he went on a mumbling up stairs, and then we left. He was a
                        mighty<lb/> nice old man. And always is.</p>
                    <p>Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said
                        we'd<lb/> got to have it; so he took a think. When he had ciphered it out,
                        he told me how<lb/> we was to do; then we went and waited around the

                        counting the spoons and laying them<lb/> out to one side, and I slid one of
                        them up my sleeve, and Tom says:</p>
                    <p>"Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons, <hi rend="italic"
                        >yet."</hi></p>
                    <p>She says:</p>
                    <p>"Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me. I know better, I counted 'm<lb/>
                        myself."</p>
                    <p>"Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can't
                        make but nine."</p>
                    <p>She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to
                        count&#x2014;anybody<lb/> would.</p>
                    <p>"I declare to gracious ther' <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> but nine!" she
                        says. "Why, what in the<lb/> world&#x2014;plague <hi rend="italic"
                            >take</hi> the things, I'll count 'm again."</p>
                    <p>So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's <hi rend="italic">ten,</hi> now!" and
                        she looked huffy and<lb/> bothered both. But Tom says:</p>
                    <p>"Why, Aunty, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't think there's ten."</p>
                    <p>"You numskull, didn't you see me <hi rend="italic">count</hi> 'm?"</p>
                    <p>"I know, but&#x2014;&#x2014;"</p>
                    <p>"Well, I'll count 'm <hi rend="italic">again."</hi></p>
                    <p>So I smouched one, and they come out nine same as the other time. Well,<lb/>
                        she <hi rend="italic">was</hi> in a tearing way&#x2014;just a trembling
                        all over, she was so mad. But she<lb/> counted and counted, till she got
                        that addled she'd start to count-in the <hi rend="italic">basket</hi><lb/>
                        for a spoon, sometimes; and so, three times they come out right, and three times<lb/>
                        <pb n="321" entity="u000002472_0336"/> they come out wrong. Then she grabbed
                        up the basket and slammed it across the<lb/> house and knocked the cat
                        galley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have<lb/> some peace, and if
                        we come bothering<lb/> around her again betwixt that and<lb/> dinner, she'd
                        skin us. So we had the<lb/> odd spoon; and dropped it in her<lb/> apron
                        pocket whilst she was a giving us<lb/> our sailing-orders, and Jim got it
                        all<lb/> right, along with her shingle-nail, <reg orig="be-|fore"
                            >before</reg><lb/> noon. We was very well <reg orig="satis-|fied"
                            >satisfied</reg><lb/> with this business, and Tom <reg orig="al-|lowed"
                            >allowed</reg><lb/> it was worth twice the trouble<lb/> it took, because
                        he said <hi rend="italic">now</hi> she<lb/> couldn't ever count them spoons
                        twice<lb/> alike again to save her life; and<lb/> wouldn't believe she'd
                        counted them<lb/> right, if she <hi rend="italic">did;</hi> and said that
                        after<lb/> she'd about counted her head off, for<lb/> the next three days,
                        he judged she'd<lb/> give it up and offer to kill anybody<lb/> that wanted
                        her to ever count them any more.</p>

                    <p>So we put the sheet back on the line, that night, and stole one out of
                        her<lb/> closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again, for a
                        couple of days,<lb/> till she didn't know how many sheets she had, any more,
                        and said she didn't<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">care,</hi> and warn't agoing to bullyrag the rest of her
                        soul out about it, and wouldn't<lb/> count them again not to save her life,
                        she druther die first.</p>
                    <p>So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and
                        the<lb/> candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up
                        counting; and as<lb/> to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it would
                        blow over by-and-by.</p>
                    <p>But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We fixed
                        it<lb/> up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it done
                        at last, and<lb/> very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we had
                        to use up three <reg orig="wash-|pans">washpans</reg><lb/>
                        <pb n="322" entity="u000002472_0337"/> full of flour, before we got through,
                        and we got burnt pretty much all<lb/> over, in places, and eyes put out with
                        the smoke; because, you see, we didn't<lb/> want nothing but a crust, and we
                        couldn't prop it up right, and she would<lb/> always cave in. But of course
                        we thought of the right way at last; which was<lb/> to cook the ladder, too,
                        in the pie. So then we laid in with Jim, the second night,<lb/> and tore up
                        the sheet all in little strings, and twisted them together, and long<lb/>
                        before daylight we had a lovely rope, that you could a hung a person
                        with.<lb/> We let on it took nine months to make it.</p>
                    <p>And in the forenoon we took it down to<lb/> the woods, but it wouldn't go in
                        the pie.<lb/> Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there<lb/> was rope
                        enough for forty pies, if we'd a<lb/> wanted them, and plenty left over for
                        soup,<lb/> or sausage, or anything you choose. We<lb/> could a had a whole

                        turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the<lb/> person
                        that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along,

                    <p>"We ain't got no time to bother over that," he says, "we got to dig in

                    <p>"Well, anyway," I says, "what's <hi rend="italic">some</hi> of it? What's a

                    <p>That was just his way. If it didn't suit him to explain a thing to you,

                    <p>Tom's voice trembled, whilst he was reading them, and he most broke
                        down.<lb/> When he got done, he couldn't no way make up his mind which one
                        for Jim to<lb/> scrabble onto the wall, they was all so good; but at last he
                        allowed he would let<lb/> him scrabble them all on. Jim said it would take
                        him a year to scrabble such a<lb/> lot of truck onto the logs with a nail,
                        and he didn't know how to make letters,<lb/> besides; but Tom said he would
                        block them out for him, and then he wouldn't<lb/> have nothing to do but
                        just follow the lines. Then pretty soon he says:</p>
                    <p>"Come to think, the logs ain't agoing to do; they don't have log walls in
                        a<lb/> dungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock. We'll fetch a
                        rock."</p>
                    <p>Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him such
                        a<lb/> pison long time to dig them into a rock, he wouldn't ever get out.
                        But Tom said<lb/> he would let me help him do it. Then he took a look to see
                        how me and Jim<lb/> was getting along with the pens. It was most pesky
                        tedious hard work and slow,<lb/> and didn't give my hands no show to get
                        well of the sores, and we didn't seem to<lb/> make no headway, hardly. So
                        Tom says:</p>
                    <p>"I know how to fix it. We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and<lb/>
                        mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.
                        There's a<lb/> gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we'll smouch it,
                        and carve the things<lb/> on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it,
                        too."</p>
                    <p>It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a grindstone<lb/>
                        nuther; but we allowed we'd tackle it. It warn't quite midnight, yet, so
                        we<lb/> cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work. We smouched the
                        grindstone,<lb/> and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation
                        tough job. Sometimes, do<lb/> what we could, we couldn't keep her from
                        falling over, and she come mighty<lb/>
                        <pb n="327" entity="u000002472_0342"/> near mashing us, every time. Tom said
                        she was going to get one of us, sure,<lb/> before we got through. We got her
                        half way; and then we was plumb played<lb/> out, and most drownded with
                        sweat. We see it warn't no use, we got to go and<lb/> fetch Jim. So he
                        raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and<lb/> wrapt it
                        round and round his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and<lb/> down
                        there, and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along
                        like<lb/> nothing; and Tom superintended. He could out-superintend any boy I
                        ever see.<lb/> He knowed how to do everything.</p>

                        through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough. Then Tom<lb/>
                        marked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them,
                        with<lb/> the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the
                        lean-to for a<lb/>

                        the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it.<lb/> Then we helped him
                        fix his chain back on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed <reg

                    <p>Tom thought a minute or two, and says:</p>

                    <p>"Why, a rattlesnake."</p>
                    <p>"De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to<lb/>

                        tobacker in his coffee;" and found<lb/> so much fault with it, and with<lb/>
                        the work and bother of raising<lb/> the mullen, and jews-harping the<lb/>
                        rats, and petting and flattering<lb/> up the snakes and spiders and<lb/>
                        things, on top of all the other<lb/> work he had to do on pens, and<lb/>
                        inscriptions, and journals, and things, which made it more trouble and worry
                        and<lb/> responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook,
                        that Tom most<lb/>
                        <pb n="332" entity="u000002472_0347"/> lost all patience with him; and said
                        he was just loadened down with more<lb/> gaudier chances than a prisoner
                        ever had in the world to make a name for <reg orig="him-|self"
                        >himself</reg>,<lb/> and yet he didn't know enough to appreciate them, and
                        they was just about<lb/> wasted on him. So Jim he was sorry, and said he
                        wouldn't behave so no more,<lb/> and then me and Tom shoved for bed.</p>

                        unstopped the best rat<lb/> hole, and in about an hour we had fifteen<lb/>
                        of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we<lb/> took it and put it in a safe
                        place under<lb/> Aunt Sally's bed. But while we was gone<lb/> for spiders,
                        little Thomas Franklin <reg orig="Ben-|jamin">Benjamin</reg><lb/> Jefferson
                        Elexander Phelps found<lb/> it there, and opened the door of it to see<lb/>
                        if the rats would come out, and they did;<lb/> and Aunt Sally she come in,
                        and when we<lb/> got back she was a standing on top of the<lb/> bed raising
                        Cain, and the rats was doing<lb/> what they could to keep off the dull
                        times<lb/> for her. So she took and dusted us both<lb/> with the hickry, and
                        we was as much as<lb/> two hours catching another fifteen or <reg

                    <p>We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and <reg
                            orig="cater-|pillars">caterpillars</reg>,<lb/> and one thing or another;
                        and we like-to got a hornet's nest, but we<lb/> didn't. The family was at
                        home. We didn't give it right up, but staid with<lb/> them as long as we
                        could; because we allowed we'd tire them out or they'd<lb/>
                        <pb n="334" entity="u000002472_0349"/> got to tire us out, and they done it.
                        Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on<lb/> the places, and was pretty near
                        all right again, but couldn't set down convenient.<lb/> And so we went for
                        the snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and <reg
                            orig="house-|snakes">housesnakes</reg>,<lb/> and put them in a bag, and
                        put it in our room, and by that time it was<lb/> supper time, and a rattling
                        good honest day's work; and hungry?&#x2014;oh, no, I<lb/> reckon not!
                        And there warn't a blessed snake up there, when we went
                        back&#x2014;we<lb/> didn't half tie the sack, and they worked out,
                        somehow, and left. But it didn't<lb/> matter much, because they was still on
                        the premises somewheres. So we judged<lb/> we could get some of them again.
                        No, there warn't no real scarcity of snakes<lb/> about the house for a
                        considerble spell. You'd see them dripping from the<lb/> rafters and places,
                        every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate,<lb/> or down the
                        back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn't want them.<lb/>
                        Well, they was handsome, and striped, and there warn't no harm in a million
                        of<lb/> them; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally, she despised
                        snakes, be the<lb/> breed what they might, and she couldn't stand them no
                        way you could fix it; and<lb/> every time one of them flopped down on her,
                        it didn't make no difference what<lb/> she was doing, she would just lay
                        that work down and light out. I never see<lb/> such a woman. And you could
                        hear her whoop to Jericho. You couldn't get<lb/> her to take aholt of one of
                        them with the tongs. And if she turned over<lb/> and found one in bed, she
                        would scramble out and lift a howl that you would<lb/> think the house was
                        afire. She disturbed the old man so, that he said he<lb/> could most wish
                        there hadn't ever been no snakes created. Why, after every last<lb/> snake
                        had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week, Aunt Sally<lb/>
                        warn't over it yet; she warn't near over it; when she was setting thinking
                        about<lb/> something, you could touch her on the back of her neck with a
                        feather and she<lb/> would jump right out of her stockings. It was very
                        curious. But Tom said all<lb/> women was just so. He said they was made that
                        way; for some reason or<lb/> other.</p>
                    <p>We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way; and she <reg
                            orig="al-|lowed">allowed</reg><lb/> these lickings warn't nothing to
                        what she would do if we ever loaded up the<lb/> place again with them. I
                        didn't mind the lickings, because they didn't amount<lb/> to nothing; but I
                        minded the trouble we had, to lay in another lot. But we got<lb/>
                        <pb n="335" entity="u000002472_0350"/> them laid in, and all the other
                        things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as<lb/> Jim's was when
                        they'd all swarm out for music and go for him. Jim didn't like<lb/> the
                        spiders, and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him and
                        make<lb/> it mighty warm for him. And he said that between the rats, and the
                        snakes, and<lb/> the grindstone, there warn't no room in bed for him,
                        skasely; and when there<lb/> was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively,
                        and it was always lively, he said, <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg><lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">they</hi> never all slept at one time, but took turn
                        about, so when the snakes<lb/> was asleep the rats was on deck, and when the

                        under him, in his way, and t'other gang <reg orig="hav-|ing"
                        >having</reg><lb/> a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place,
                        the spiders would<lb/> take a chance at him as he crossed over. He said if
                        he ever got out, this time, he<lb/> wouldn't ever be a prisoner again, not
                        for a salary.</p>

                    <p>Well, by the end of three weeks, everything was in pretty good shape.
                        The<lb/> shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every<lb/> time a rat bit
                        Jim he would get up and<lb/> write a little in his journal whilst the
                        ink<lb/> was fresh; the pens was made, the <reg orig="in-|scriptions"
                            >inscriptions</reg><lb/> and so on was all carved on<lb/> the
                        grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in<lb/> two, and we had et up the sawdust,
                        and it<lb/> give us a most amazing stomach-ache.<lb/> We reckoned we was all
                        going to die, but<lb/> didn't. It was the most undigestible<lb/> sawdust I
                        ever see; and Tom said the<lb/> same. But as I was saying, we'd got all<lb/>
                        the work done, now, at last; and we was<lb/> all pretty much fagged out,
                        too, but<lb/> mainly Jim. The old man had wrote a<lb/> couple of times to
                        the plantation below<lb/> Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger, but
                        hadn't got no answer, because<lb/> there warn't no such plantation; so he
                        allowed he would advertise Jim in the St.<lb/> Louis and New Orleans papers;
                        and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones, it<lb/>
                        <pb n="336" entity="u000002472_0351"/> give me the cold shivers, and I see
                        we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said,<lb/> now for the nonnamous
                        letters.</p>
                    <p>"What's them?" I says.</p>
                    <p>"Warnings to the people that something is up. Sometimes it's done one<lb/>
                        way, sometimes another. But there's always somebody spying around, that
                        gives<lb/> notice to the governor of the castle. When Louis XVI. was going
                        to light out of<lb/> the Tooleries, a servant girl done it. It's a very good
                        way, and so is the <reg orig="non-|namous">nonnamous</reg><lb/> letters.
                        We'll use them both. And it's usual for the prisoner's mother<lb/> to change
                        clothes with him, and she stays in, and he slides out in her clothes.<lb/>
                        We'll do that too."</p>
                    <p>"But looky here, Tom, what do we want to <hi rend="italic">warn</hi> anybody
                        for, that <reg orig="some-|thing's">something's</reg><lb/> up? Let them find

                    <p>"Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them. It's the way they've acted<lb/>
                        from the very start&#x2014;left us to do <hi rend="italic"

                            >mulletheaded</reg><lb/> they don't take notice of nothing at all. So if

                        nor nothing to interfere with us, and so after all our<lb/> hard work and
                        trouble this escape 'll go off perfectly flat: won't amount to <reg

                        What you going to do about the servant-girl?"</p>

                    <p>"Why, Tom, that'll make trouble next morning; because of course she <reg

                    <p>"I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the

                    <p>"All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Beware. Trouble is brewing. Keep a sharp lookout.</hi>
                        <hi rend="small-caps">Unknown Friend.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Next night we stuck a picture which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and<lb/>
                        crossbones, on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin, on the<lb/>
                        <pb n="338" entity="u000002472_0353"/> back door. I never see a family in
                        such a sweat. They couldn't a been worse<lb/> scared if the place had a been
                        full of ghosts laying for them behind everything<lb/> and under the beds and
                        shivering through the air. If a door banged, Aunt Sally<lb/> she jumped, and
                        said "ouch!" if anything fell, she jumped and said "ouch!"<lb/> if you
                        happened to touch her, when she warn't noticing, she done the same; she<lb/>
                        couldn't face noway and be satisfied, because she allowed there was
                        something<lb/> behind her every time&#x2014;so she was always a whirling
                        around, sudden, and saying<lb/> "ouch," and before she'd get two-thirds
                        around, she'd whirl back again, and<lb/> say it again; and she was afraid to
                        go to bed, but she dasn't set up. So the<lb/> thing was working very well,
                        Tom said; he said he never see a thing work more<lb/> satisfactory. He said
                        it showed it was done right.</p>
                    <p>So he said, now for the grand bulge! So the very next morning at the<lb/>
                        streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we
                        better<lb/> do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going
                        to have a nigger<lb/> on watch at both doors all night. Tom he went down the
                        lightning-rod to spy<lb/> around; and the nigger at the back door was
                        asleep, and he stuck it in the back<lb/> of his neck and come back. This
                        letter said:</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">Don't betray me, I wish to be your friend. There is a
                            desprate gang of cutthroats from over<lb/> in the Ingean Territory going
                            to steal your runaway nigger to-night, and they have been trying to<lb/>
                            scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them. I am one
                            of the gang, but have<lb/> got religgion and wish to quit it and lead a

                            sneak down from northards, along the fence, at midnight exact, with a

                            a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any danger;<lb/> but stead of that,

                            Don't<lb/> do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do they

                    <p>So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as a<lb/>
                        person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of corn-pone
                        with it<lb/> on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs, very
                        stealthy, and got up to<lb/> the main floor all right, but here comes Aunt
                        Sally with a candle, and I clapped<lb/> the truck in my hat, and clapped my
                        hat on my head, and the next second she<lb/> see me; and she says:</p>
                    <p>"You been down cellar?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes'm."</p>

                    <p>"Noth'n."</p>

                    <p>"Well, then, what possessed you to go down there, this time of night?"</p>

                    <p>"You don't <hi rend="italic">know?</hi> Don't answer me that way, Tom, I want

                    <p>"I hain't been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I<lb/>

                    <p>I reckoned she'd let me go, now, and as a generl thing she would; but I<lb/>
                        spose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat
                        about<lb/> every little thing that warn't yard-stick straight; so she says,
                        very decided:</p>
                    <p>"You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come. You<lb/>
                        been up to something you no business to, and I lay I'll find out what it is before<lb/>

                    <p>So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.
                        My,<lb/> but there was a crowd there! Fifteen farmers, and every one of them
                        had a gun.<lb/> I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down.
                        They was setting<lb/> around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice,
                        and all of them fidgety and<lb/> uneasy, but trying to look like they
                        warn't; but I knowed they was, because they<lb/>
                        <pb n="341" entity="u000002472_0356"/> was always taking off their hats, and

                        and fumbling with their buttons. I warn't easy myself,<lb/> but I didn't
                        take my hat off, all the same.</p>
                    <p>I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if<lb/>
                        she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we'd overdone this
                        thing,<lb/> and what a thundering hornet's nest we'd got ourselves into, so
                        we could stop<lb/> fooling around, straight off, and clear out with Jim
                        before these rips got out of<lb/> patience and come for us.</p>

                    <p>"Hurry! <hi rend="italic">hurry!</hi>" I says. "Where's Jim?"</p>
                    <p>"Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him. He's<lb/>

                    <p>So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on us
                        whilst<lb/> we was hustling to get under the bed. But we got under all

                        he would listen for the steps to<lb/> get further, and when he nudged us
                        Jim<lb/> must glide out first, and him last. So<lb/> he set his ear to the

                        scraping around, out there, all the time;<lb/> and at last he nudged us, and
                        we slid out,<lb/> and stooped down, not breathing, and<lb/> not making the
                        least noise, and slipped<lb/> stealthy towards the fence, in Injun
                        file,<lb/> and got to it, all right, and me and Jim<lb/> over it; but Tom's
                        britches catched<lb/> fast on a splinter on the top rail, and<lb/> then he
                        hear the steps coming, so he<lb/> had to pull loose, which snapped the<lb/>
                        splinter and made a noise; and as he<lb/> dropped in our tracks and
                        started,<lb/> somebody sings out:</p>

                    <p>"Who's that? Answer, or I'll shoot!"</p>
                    <p>But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then there<lb/>
                        was a rush, and a <hi rend="italic">bang, bang, bang!</hi> and the bullets
                        fairly whizzed around us!<lb/> We heard them sing out:</p>
                    <p>"Here they are! They've broke for the river! after 'em, boys! And turn<lb/>
                        loose the dogs!"</p>
                    <p>So here they come, full tilt. We could hear them, because they wore boots,<lb/>
                        <pb n="344" entity="u000002472_0359"/> and yelled, but we didn't wear no
                        boots, and didn't yell. We was in the path to<lb/> the mill; and when they
                        got pretty close onto us, we dodged into the bush and let<lb/> them go by,
                        and then dropped in behind them. They'd had all the dogs shut up,<lb/> so
                        they wouldn't scare off the robbers; but by this time somebody had let
                        them<lb/> loose, and here they come, making pow-wow enough for a million;
                        but they was<lb/> our dogs; so we stopped in our tracks till they catched
                        up; and when they see it<lb/> warn't nobody but us, and no excitement to
                        offer them, they only just said howdy,<lb/> and tore right ahead towards the
                        shouting and clattering; and then we up steam<lb/> again and whizzed along
                        after them till we was nearly to the mill, and then struck<lb/> up through
                        the bush to where my canoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled for<lb/> dear
                        life towards the middle of the river, but didn't make no more noise
                        than<lb/> we was obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and comfortable, for
                        the island<lb/> where my raft was; and we could hear them yelling and
                        barking at each other all<lb/> up and down the bank, till we was so far away
                        the sounds got dim and died out.<lb/> And when we stepped onto the raft, I
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"<hi rend="italic">Now,</hi> old Jim, you're a free man <hi rend="italic"

                    <p>We was all as glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all,
                        because<lb/> he had a bullet in the calf of his leg.</p>
                    <p>When me and Jim heard that, we didn't feel so brash as what we did
                        before.<lb/> It was hurting him considerble, and bleeding; so we laid him in
                        the wigwam<lb/> and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him, but
                        he says:</p>
                    <p>"Gimme the rags, I can do it myself. Don't stop, now; don't fool around<lb/>
                        here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set

                    <pb n="345" entity="u000002472_0360"/>
                    <p>But me and Jim was consulting&#x2014;and thinking. And after we'd thought
                        a<lb/> minute, I says:</p>
                    <p>"Say it, Jim."</p>
                    <p>So he says:</p>
                    <p>"Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. Ef it wuz <hi rend="italic"

                        >doctor;</hi><lb/> not if it's forty year!"</p>
                    <p>I knowed he was white inside,<lb/> and I reckoned he'd say what he did<lb/>
                        say&#x2014;so it was all right, now, and I<lb/> told Tom I was agoing
                        for a doctor.<lb/> He raised considerable row about it,<lb/> but me and Jim
                        stuck to it and<lb/> wouldn't budge; so he was for <reg orig="crawl-|ing"
                            >crawling</reg><lb/> out and setting the raft loose<lb/> himself; but we
                        wouldn't let him.<lb/> Then he give us a piece of his mind<lb/>
                        &#x2014;but it didn't do no good.</p>
                    <p>So when he see me getting the<lb/> canoe ready, he says:</p>

                    <p>"Well, then, if you're bound to<lb/> go, I'll tell you the way to do,
                        when<lb/> you get to the village. Shut the<lb/> door, and blindfold the
                        doctor tight<lb/> and fast, and make him swear to be<lb/> silent as the
                        grave, and put a purse<lb/> full of gold in his hand, and then<lb/> take and
                        lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres, in the dark, and<lb/>
                        then fetch him here in the canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands.
                            <pb n="346" entity="u000002472_0361"/> and search him and take his chalk
                        away from him, and don't give it back to<lb/> him till you get him back to
                        the village, or else he will chalk this raft so<lb/> he can find it again.
                        It's the way they all do."</p>
                    <p>So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he
                        see<lb/> the doctor coming, till he was gone again.</p>

                        brother was over on Spanish Island<lb/> hunting, yesterday afternoon,
                        and<lb/> camped on a piece of a raft we found,<lb/> and about midnight he
                        must a kicked<lb/> his gun in his dreams, for it went off<lb/> and shot him
                        in the leg, and we<lb/> wanted him to go over there and<lb/> fix it and not
                        say nothing about it,<lb/> nor let anybody know, because we<lb/> wanted to
                        come home this evening,<lb/> and surprise the folks.</p>
                    <p>"Who is your folks?" he says.</p>
                    <p>"The Phelpses, down yonder."</p>
                    <p>"Oh," he says. And after a minute, he says: "How'd you say he got<lb/>
                        shot?"</p>

                    <p>"Singular dream," he says.</p>
                    <p>So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started. But
                        when<lb/> he see the canoe, he didn't like the look of her&#x2014;said
                        she was big enough for one,<lb/> but didn't look pretty safe for two. I
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us, easy
                        enough."</p>

                    <p>"Why, me and Sid, and&#x2014;and&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">the

                    <p>"Oh," he says.</p>
                    <p>But he put his foot on the gunnel, and rocked her; and shook his head, and
                        said<lb/> he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one. But they was all
                        locked and chained;<lb/> so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait till
                        he come back, or I could hunt<lb/> around further, or maybe I better go down

                        if I wanted to. But I said I didn't; so I told him just how to find the<lb/>
                        raft, and then he started.</p>
                    <p>I struck an idea, pretty soon. I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix
                        that<lb/> leg just in three shakes of a<lb/> sheep's tail, as the saying
                        is?<lb/> spos'n it takes him three or<lb/> four days? What are we going<lb/>
                        to do?&#x2014;lay around there till<lb/> he lets the cat out of the<lb/>
                        bag? No, sir, I know what <hi rend="italic">I'll</hi><lb/> do. I'll wait,
                        and when he comes<lb/> back, if he says he's got to go<lb/> any more, I'll
                        get down there,<lb/> too, if I swim; and we'll take<lb/> and tie him, and
                        keep him, and<lb/> shove out down the river; and<lb/> when Tom's done with
                        him,<lb/> we'll give him what it's worth,<lb/> or all we got, and then let
                        him<lb/> get shore.</p>

                        some time or other, and warn't back yet. Well, thinks I, that looks<lb/>

                    <p>"She needn't," I says, "because we was all right. We followed the men
                        and<lb/> the dogs, but they out-run us, and we lost them; but we thought we
                        heard them<lb/> on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them, and
                        crossed over but<lb/> couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along
                        up-shore till we got kind of<lb/> tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe

                        paddled over here to hear the news, and<lb/> Sid's at the post-office to see

                        us, and then we're going home."</p>
                    <p>So then we went to the post-office to get "Sid"; but just as I suspicioned,
                        he<lb/> warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of the office, and

                    <p>Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that

                        So I done it. But<lb/> I dasn't go fur, or she'd a sent for me. And when it
                        was late in the day, the<lb/> people all went, and then I come in and told
                        her the noise and shooting waked<lb/> up me and "Sid," and the door was
                        locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we<lb/> went down the
                        lightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn't<lb/> never
                        want to try <hi rend="italic">that</hi> no more. And then I went on and told
                        her all what I<lb/> told Uncle Silas before; and then she said she'd forgive
                        us, and maybe it was all<lb/> right enough anyway, and about what a body
                        might expect of boys, for all boys was a<lb/> pretty harum-scarum lot, as
                        fur as she could see; and so, as long as no harm<lb/> hadn't come of it, she
                        judged she better put in her time being grateful we was<lb/> alive and well
                        and she had us still, stead of fretting over what was past and done.<lb/> So
                        then she kissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind of
                        a<lb/> brown study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Why, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid not come yet! What <hi

                    <p>Well, he warn't there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.</p>
                    <p>He come back about ten, a little bit uneasy; hadn't run across Tom's

                    <p>And then when I went up to bed<lb/> she come up with me and fetched her<lb/>

                        and<lb/> talked with me a long time, and said<lb/> what a splendid boy Sid

                        kept asking me every now<lb/> and then, if I reckoned he could a got<lb/>
                        lost, or hurt, or maybe drownded, and<lb/> might be laying at this minute,

                        she not<lb/> by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down, silent,
                        and I would tell<lb/> her that Sid was all right, and would be home in the

                        tell me to say it again, and keep<lb/> on saying it, because it done her
                        good, and she was in so much trouble. And when<lb/> she was going away, she
                        looked down in my eyes, so steady and gentle, and says:</p>

                        but couldn't get no track of<lb/> Tom; and both of them set at the<lb/>

                        and looking mournful, and their<lb/> coffee getting cold, and not eating

                    <p>"Well, I must a forgot it."</p>
                    <p>So he rummaged his pockets, and<lb/> then went off somewheres where he
                        had<lb/> laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her. She says:</p>

                    <p>I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn't stir. But before<lb/>
                        she could break it open, she dropped it and run&#x2014;for she see
                        something. And so<lb/> did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old
                        doctor; and Jim, in <hi rend="italic">her</hi><lb/> calico dress, with his
                        hands tied behind him; and a lot of people. I hid the<lb/> letter behind the
                        first thing that come handy, and rushed. She flung herself at<lb/> Tom,
                        crying, and says:</p>
                    <pb n="356" entity="u000002472_0371"/>
                    <p>"Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!"</p>
                    <p>And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,
                        which<lb/> showed he warn't in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,
                        and says:</p>
                    <p>"He's alive, thank God! And that's enough!" and she snatched a kiss of<lb/>
                        him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders
                        right and<lb/> left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue
                        could go, every jump<lb/> of the way.</p>
                    <p>I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the
                        old<lb/> doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house. The men
                        was very<lb/> huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim, for an example to
                        all the other<lb/> niggers around there, so they wouldn't be trying to run
                        away, like Jim done, and<lb/> making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a
                        whole family scared most to death for<lb/> days and nights. But the others
                        said, don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all, he<lb/> ain't our nigger, and
                        his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. So<lb/> that cooled
                        them down a little, because the people that's always the most anxious<lb/>
                        for to hang a nigger that hain't done just right, is always the very ones
                        that ain't<lb/> the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their
                        satisfaction out of him.</p>
                    <p>They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two, side
                        the<lb/> head, once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let
                        on to know<lb/> me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own
                        clothes on him, and<lb/> chained him again, and not to no bed-leg, this
                        time, but to a big staple drove<lb/> into the bottom log, and chained his
                        hands, too, and both legs, and said he warn't<lb/> to have nothing but bread
                        and water to eat, after this, till his owner come or he<lb/> was sold at
                        auction, because he didn't come in a certain length of time, and filled<lb/>
                        up our hole, and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch
                        around<lb/> about the cabin every night, and a bull-dog tied to the door in
                        the day-time; and<lb/> about this time they was through with the job and was
                        tapering off with a kind<lb/> of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old
                        doctor comes and takes a look, and<lb/> says:</p>
                    <p>"Don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to, because he ain't a
                        bad<lb/> nigger. When I got to where I found the boy, I see I couldn't cut
                        the bullet out<lb/> without some help, and he warn't in no condition for me
                        to leave, to go and get<lb/>
                        <pb n="357" entity="u000002472_0372"/> help; and he got a little worse and a
                        little worse, and after a long time he went<lb/> out of his head, and
                        wouldn't let me come anigh him, any more, and said if I<lb/> chalked his
                        raft he'd kill me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see<lb/>
                        I couldn't do anything at all with him; so I says, I got to have <hi
                            rend="italic">help,</hi> somehow;<lb/> and the minute I says it, out
                        crawls this nigger from somewheres, and says he'll<lb/> help, and he done
                        it, too, and done it<lb/> very well. Of course I judged he<lb/> must be a
                        runaway nigger, and there<lb/> I <hi rend="italic">was!</hi> and there I had
                        to stick, right<lb/> straight along all the rest of the day,<lb/> and all
                        night. It was a fix, I tell<lb/> you! I had a couple of patients with<lb/>
                        the chills, and of course I'd of liked<lb/> to run up to town and see them,
                        but<lb/> I dasn't, because the nigger might get<lb/> away, and then I'd be
                        to blame; and<lb/> yet never a skiff come close enough<lb/> for me to hail.
                        So there I had to<lb/> stick, plumb till daylight this <reg orig="morn-|ing"
                            >morning</reg>;<lb/> and I never see a nigger that<lb/> was a better
                        nuss or faithfuller, and<lb/> yet he was resking his freedom to do<lb/> it,
                        and was all tired out, too, and I<lb/> see plain enough he'd been
                        worked<lb/> main hard, lately. I liked the nigger for that; I tell you,
                        gentlemen, a nigger<lb/> like that is worth a thousand
                        dollars&#x2014;and kind treatment, too. I had <reg orig="every-|thing"
                            >everything</reg><lb/> I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as
                        he would a done at home<lb/> &#x2014;better, maybe, because it was so
                        quiet; but there I <hi rend="italic">was,</hi> with both of 'm on my<lb/>
                        hands; and there I had to stick, till about dawn this morning; then some
                        men<lb/> in a skiff come by, and as good luck would have it, the nigger was
                        setting by the<lb/> pallet with his head propped on his knees, sound asleep;
                        so I motioned them in,<lb/> quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed
                        him and tied him before he</p>
                    <figure id="f170" rend="inline" entity="u000002472_0372">

                    <p>knowed what he was about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being
                        in<lb/> a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the
                        raft on, and<lb/> towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never
                        made the least row nor<lb/> said a word, from the start. He ain't no bad
                        nigger, gentlemen; that's what I<lb/> think about him."</p>
                    <p>Somebody says:</p>
                    <p>"Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged to say."</p>
                    <p>Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful to
                        that<lb/> old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was
                        according to my<lb/> judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good
                        heart in him and was a<lb/> good man, the first time I see him. Then they
                        all agreed that Jim had acted<lb/> very well, and was deserving to have some
                        notice took of it, and reward. So<lb/> every one of them promised, right out
                        and hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him<lb/> no more.</p>
                    <p>Then they come out and locked him up. I hoped they was going to say<lb/> he
                        could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten<lb/>
                        heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water, but they<lb/>
                        didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, but
                        I<lb/> judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally, somehow or other, as
                        soon as I'd<lb/> got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me.
                        Explanations, I mean,<lb/> of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot,
                        when I was telling how him<lb/> and me put in that dratted night paddling
                        around hunting the runaway nigger.</p>
                    <p>But I had plenty time. Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day and
                        all<lb/> night; and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around, I dodged
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt
                        Sally<lb/> was gone to get a nap. So I slips to the sick-room, and if I
                        found him awake I<lb/> reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that
                        would wash. But he was<lb/> sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and
                        pale, not fire-faced the way he was<lb/> when he come. So I set down and
                        laid for him to wake. In about a half an<lb/> hour, Aunt Sally comes gliding
                        in, and there I was, up a stump again! She <reg orig="mo-|tioned"
                            >motioned</reg><lb/> me to be still, and set down by me, and begun to
                        whisper, and said we<lb/> could all be joyful now, because all the symptoms
                        was first rate, and he'd been<lb/>
                        <pb n="359" entity="u000002472_0374"/> sleeping like that for ever so long,
                        and looking better and peacefuller all the<lb/> time, and ten to one he'd
                        wake up in his right mind.</p>
                    <p>So we set there watching, and by-and-by he stirs a bit, and opened his
                        eyes<lb/> very natural, and takes a look, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Hello, why I'm at <hi rend="italic">home!</hi> How's that? Where's the
                        raft?"</p>
                    <p>"It's all right," I says.</p>
                    <p>"And <hi rend="italic">Jim?"</hi></p>
                    <p>"The same," I says, but couldn't say it pretty brash. But he never
                        noticed,<lb/> but says:</p>
                    <p>"Good! Splendid! <hi rend="italic">Now</hi> we're all right and safe! Did you
                        tell Aunty?"</p>
                    <p>I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:</p>
                    <p>"About what, Sid?"</p>
                    <p>"Why, about the way the whole thing was done."</p>
                    <p>"What whole thing?"</p>
                    <p>"Why, <hi rend="italic">the</hi> whole thing. There ain't but one; how we set
                        the runaway <reg orig="nig-|ger">nigger</reg><lb/> free&#x2014;me and

                    <p>"Good land! Set the run&#x2014; What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the child

                        cost us a power of work&#x2014;weeks of it&#x2014;hours and
                        hours,<lb/> every night, whilst you was all asleep. And we had to steal

                        tin plates, and case-knives,<lb/> and the warming-pan, and the grindstone,
                        and flour, and just no end of things, and<lb/> you can't think what work it
                        was to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions,<lb/> and one thing or

                        dig the hole into the cabin,<lb/> and make the rope-ladder and send it in
                        cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons<lb/> and things to work with, in your

                        on, for company for<lb/> Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the

                        because the men come before we was out of the<lb/> cabin, and we had to

                        canoe, and made for the raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and
                        we<lb/> done it all by ourselves, and <hi rend="italic">wasn't</hi> it

                    <p>"Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! So it was <hi

                    <p>But Tom, he <hi rend="italic">was</hi> so proud and joyful, he just <hi

                    <p>"Meddling with <hi rend="italic">who?</hi>" Tom says, dropping his smile and

                    <p>"With <hi rend="italic">who?</hi> Why, the runaway nigger, of course. Who'd

                    <p>Tom looks at me very grave, and says:</p>
                    <p>"Tom, didn't you just tell me he was all right? Hasn't he got away?"</p>

                        claimed or sold!"</p>
                    <p>Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening
                        and<lb/> shutting like gills, and sings out to me:</p>

                    <p>"Well, that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a question, I must<lb/> say; and <hi

                    <p>Aunt Sally jumped for her, and<lb/> most hugged the head off of her, and
                        cried over her, and I found a good enough<lb/> place for me under the bed,

                        me.<lb/> And I peeped out, and in a little while Tom's Aunt Polly shook
                        herself loose and<lb/> stood there looking across at Tom over her
                        spectacles&#x2014;kind of grinding him into<lb/> the earth, you know.
                        And then she says:</p>
                    <p>"Yes, you <hi rend="italic">better</hi> turn y'r head away&#x2014;I would
                        if I was you, Tom."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, deary me!" says Aunt Sally; "<hi rend="italic">is</hi> he changed so?
                        Why, that ain't <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi><lb/> it's Sid;
                        Tom's&#x2014;Tom's&#x2014;why, where is Tom? He was here a minute
                        ago."</p>
                    <p>"You mean where's Huck <hi rend="italic">Finn</hi>&#x2014;that's what you
                        mean! I reckon I hain't<lb/> raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years,
                        not to know him when I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> him.<lb/> That <hi
                            rend="italic">would</hi> be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that
                        bed, Huck Finn."</p>
                    <p>So I done it. But not feeling brash.</p>
                    <p>Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest looking persons I ever see; except<lb/>
                        <pb n="362" entity="u000002472_0377"/> one, and that was Uncle Silas, when
                        he come in, and they told it all to him. It<lb/> kind of made him drunk, as
                        you may say, and he didn't know nothing at all the<lb/> rest of the day, and
                        preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that give him<lb/> a rattling
                        ruputation, because the oldest man in the world couldn't a understood<lb/>
                        it. So Tom's Aunt Polly, she told all about who I was, and what; and I had
                        to<lb/> up and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps
                        took me for<lb/> Tom Sawyer&#x2014;she chipped in and says, "Oh, go on
                        and call me Aunt Sally, I'm<lb/> used to it, now, and 'tain't no need to
                        change"&#x2014;that when Aunt Sally took me<lb/> for Tom Sawyer, I had
                        to stand it&#x2014;there warn't no other way, and I knowed he<lb/>
                        wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a mystery, and
                        he'd<lb/> make an adventure out of it and be perfectly satisfied. And so it
                        turned out,<lb/> and he let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he
                        could for me.</p>
                    <p>And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting<lb/>
                        Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took
                        all<lb/> that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free!<lb/> and I
                        couldn't ever understand, before, until that<lb/> minute and that talk, how
                        he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> help a body<lb/> set a nigger free, with his
                        bringing-up.</p>
                    <p>Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally<lb/> wrote to her that Tom and
                            <hi rend="italic">Sid</hi> had come, all right<lb/> and safe, she says
                        to herself:</p>

                        all<lb/> the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and<lb/> find out what

                        Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom,
                        they<lb/> made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him
                        all he<lb/> wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do. And we had
                        him up to the<lb/>
                        <pb n="365" entity="u000002472_0380"/> sick-room; and had a high talk; and
                        Tom give Jim forty dollars for being<lb/> prisoner for us so patient, and
                        doing it up so good, and Jim was pleased most to<lb/> death, and busted out,
                        and says:</p>

                    <p>And then Tom he talked along, and talked<lb/> along, and says, le's all three
                        slide out of here,<lb/> one of these nights, and get an outfit, and go
                        for<lb/> howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in<lb/> the Territory,
                        for a couple of weeks or two; and<lb/> I says, all right, that suits me, but
                        I aint got no<lb/> money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn't get
                        none from home, because<lb/> it's likely pap's been back before now, and got
                        it all away from Judge Thatcher<lb/> and drunk it up.</p>
                    <p>"No he hain't," Tom says; "it's all there, yet&#x2014;six thousand
                        dollars and<lb/> more; and your pap hain't ever been back since. Hadn't when
                        I come away,<lb/> anyhow."</p>
                    <p>Jim says, kind of solemn:</p>
                    <p>"He ain't a comin' back no mo', Huck."</p>
                    <p>I says:</p>
                    <p>"Why, Jim?"</p>
                    <p>"Nemmine why, Huck&#x2014;but he ain't comin' back no mo'."</p>
                    <p>But I kept at him; so at last he says:</p>
                    <p>"Doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river, en dey wuz a<lb/>
                        man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn' let you<lb/>
                        <pb n="366" entity="u000002472_0381"/> come in? Well, den, you k'n git yo'
                        money when you wants it; kase dat wuz<lb/> him."</p>
                    <p>Tom's most well, now, and got his bullet around his neck on a
                        watch-guard<lb/> for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so
                        there ain't nothing more<lb/> to write about, and I am rotten glad of it,
                        because if I'd a knowed what a trouble<lb/> it was to make a book I wouldn't
                        a tackled it and aint't agoing to no more. But<lb/> I reckon I got to light
                        out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally<lb/> she's going
                        to adopt me and sivilize me and I can't stand it. I been there before.</p>
