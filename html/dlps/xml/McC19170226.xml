            <salute>Dear Marcelle:</salute>

            <p>
            How goes it?
            Seems ages since I’ve
            heard from you.  I’m
            still here, as you see,
            and the Major won’t tell
            me when I can go.  I’m
            awfully anxious to get 
            out.
            </p><p>
            Your dear mother
            was awfully nice to me &mdash;
            she sent me a lot of
            chocolate &amp; cake and just
            after I’d thanked her a box
            
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            of “Force” arrived.
            </p><p>
            Its been beautiful the
            last two days &mdash; Just 
            like spring.  Its warm
            and there is that 
            indefinable sweet swell in
            the air that goes with
            the rebirth of growing
            things.  The soft caress
            of the gentle breeze fills
            one with a lively joy
            and makes one forget
            la crise du Charbon.
            
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            Here’s a good “trade” for
            you.  Excerpt from letter of
            one Betty Baldwin, date of
            Feb 23rd:
            
            “Yesterday Marcelle had
            a tea party to which she very
            kindly asked me &mdash; I was simply
            overcome at the charm of that
            girl in her own home.  She was
            delightful.  No one who hasn’t seen
            her as hostess knows how
            very charming she is, I think.
            Then too, she has such <hi rend="underline">glorious</hi>
            hair.  She looked ravishingly
            pretty and her manner was
            cordiality itself”!!! Endorsed

            </p><p>
            
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            How did you make out 
            with Capt. Hall this time?
            I hear Mrs. Hall is mad with
            me because of remarks I made
            about that lovely U.S.A.  Tell
            her she’s a flag waver.
            </p><p>
            Do let me hear from you
            a little more often.
            </p>
