                <p>The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met, in Open Session, at 8:30
                    a.m., Friday, <date value="2002-01-25">January 25, 2002</date>, in the Board
                    Room of the Rotunda; <name>John P. Ackerly, III</name>, Rector, presided. <name
                        type="present">Thomas J. Bliley, Jr., Charles M. Caravati, Jr., M.D.,
                        William G. Crutchfield, Jr., Thomas F. Farrell, II, Charles L. Glazer,
                        William H. Goodwin, Jr., T. Keister Greer, Gordon F. Rainey, Jr., Timothy B.
                        Robertson, Terence P. Ross, Thomas A. Saunders, III, Ms. Elizabeth A. Twohy,
                        Benjamin P.A. Warthen, and Ms. Sasha L. Wilson</name> were present.</p>
                <p>Also present were <name type="present">John T. Casteen, III, Leonard W.
                        Sandridge, Alexander G. Gilliam, Jr., Paul J. Forch, Gene D. Block, Ms.
                        Colette Sheehy, Robert E. Reynolds, M.D., Ms. Yoke San Reynolds, R. Ariel
                        Gomez, M.D., William W. Harmon, and Ms. Jeanne Flippo Bailes</name>.</p>
                <p>The Rector welcomed <name>Mr. R. Edward Howell</name>, who will assume his duties
                    as Chief Executive Officer of the Medical Center in February. Mr. Howell
                    attended most sessions of the Board meeting as well as meetings of Board
                    committees.</p>
                <p> On motion, the Minutes of the meeting of the Board of Visitors of <dateRange
                        from="2001-10-18" to="2001-10-19">October 18-19, 2001</dateRange>, were
                    approved.</p>
                <p>The President gave his customary report, the greater part of which was given over
                    to an account of the state budget as it affects the University. There have been
                    significant budget cuts announced by the Governor. Some of these had been
                    anticipated by the University but others are more serious than had been
                    expected. Arts &amp; Sciences is more vulnerable than most areas of the
                    University to cuts of this sort. Of particular concern, however, is the state's
                    failure to grant salary raises to faculty and staff for the second straight
                    year. The faculty are dropping yet further behind their peer group and the cost
                    of living in Charlottesville, which is among the highest in the state, is having
                    a substantial impact on faculty and staff.</p>
                <pb n="6094"/>
                <p>The President expressed grave concern about two proposals under discussion in the
                    General Assembly which would cap out-of-state enrollment at the University. He
                    explained why measures of this sort are bad policy for the University as well as
                    for higher education in general in Virginia. He reported as well on the
                    Governor's proposal to revert to the state revenue generated by the small
                    increase in tuition that would be allowed by this proposal, which the President
                    characterized as a tax on college students and their parents.</p>
                <p><name>Mr. Sandridge</name> then gave a brief report on emergency planning at the
                    University in light of the events of <date value="2001-09-11">September 11th,
                        2001</date>.</p>
                <p>The President resumed with his customary report on gifts and grants, noting
                    particularly a gift of $3.9million from <name>Mr. and Mrs. Goodwin</name> to the
                    Health System for the Human Immune Therapy Center, as well as $560,000 given by
                    the John M. Olin Foundation to the Law School.</p>
                <p>By resolution, the Board accepted the report on gifts and grants.</p>
                <p>The President concluded his remarks by noting that University employees gave more
                    than $550,000 to the Combined Virginia Campaign, which was the highest amount
                    raised by any state agency. He then offered condolences to the Appalachian
                    School of Law and to the Vice Chair of its board, Mr. Wolfe, on the recent
                    tragedy at the School.</p>
                <ornament type="characters">---------</ornament>
                <p>The Board recessed at 9:05 a.m. to begin Committee meetings.</p>
