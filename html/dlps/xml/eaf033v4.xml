<p><hi rend="small-caps">I am</hi> very far from being a wise girl. So conscience <lb/>
whispers me, and though vanity is eager to refute the charge, <lb/>
I must acknowledge that she is seldom successful. <reg orig="Con-|science">Conscience</reg> <lb/>
tells me it is folly, it is guilt to wrap up my existence <lb/>
in one frail mortal; to employ all my thoughts, to lavish all <lb/>
my affections upon one object; to dote upon a human being, <lb/>
who, as such, must be the heir of many frailties, and whom <lb/>
I know to be not without his faults; to enjoy no peace but <lb/>
in his presence, to be grateful for his permission to sacrifice <lb/>
fortune, ease, life itself for his sake.</p>
<p>From the humiliation produced by these charges, vanity <lb/>
endeavors to relieve me by insinuating that all happiness <lb/>
springs from affection; that nature ordains no tie so strong <lb/>
as that between the sexes; that to love without bounds is to <lb/>
confer bliss not only on ourselves but on another; that <reg orig="con-|jugal">conjugal</reg> <lb/>
affection is the genuine sphere not only of happiness but <lb/>
duty.</p>
<p>Besides, my heart will not be persuaded but that its <reg orig="fond-|ness">fondness</reg> <lb/>
for you is nothing more than simple justice. Ought I <lb/>
not to love excellence, and does my poor imagination figure <lb/>
to itself any thing in human shape more excellent than thou?</p>
<p>But yet there are bounds beyond which passion cannot <lb/>
go without counteracting its own purposes. I am afraid <lb/>
mine goes beyond those bounds. So far as it produces <lb/>
<pb n="4" entity="eaf033v4_0017" pid="uva-lib:350026"/>
rapture, it deserves to be cherished, but when productive of <lb/>
impatience, repining, agony, on occasions too that are slight, <lb/>
trivial, or unavoidable, 'tis surely culpable.</p>
<p>Methinks, my friend, I would not have had thee for a <lb/>
witness of the bitterness, the tumult of my feelings, during <lb/>
this day; ever since you left me. You cannot conceive <lb/>
any thing more forlorn, more vacant, more anxious than <lb/>
this weak heart has been and still is. I was terrified at my <lb/>
own sensations, and, with my usual folly began to construe <lb/>
them into omens of evil; so inadequate, so disproportioned <lb/>
was my distress to the cause that produced it.</p>
<p>Ah! my friend! a weak&mdash;very weak creature is thy <lb/>
Jane. From excess of love arises that weakness; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> must <lb/>
be its apology with thee, for, in thy mind, my fondness, I <lb/>
know, needs an apology.</p>
<p>Shall I scold you a little? I have held in the rein a long <lb/>
time, but my overflowing heart must have relief, and I shall <lb/>
find a sort of comfort in chiding you. Let me chide you <lb/>
then, for coldness, for insensibility&mdash;but no; I will not. Let <lb/>
me enjoy the rewards of self-denial, and forbearance, and <lb/>
seal up my accusing lips. Let me forget the coldness of <lb/>
your last salute, your ill-concealed effort to disengage <reg orig="your-|self">yourself</reg> <lb/>
from my foolishly fond arms. You have got at your <lb/>
journey's end, I hope. Farewell,</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I must</hi> write to you, you said, frequently, and copiously; <lb/>
you did not mean, I suppose that I should always be <reg orig="scrib-|bling">scribbling</reg>, <lb/>
but I cannot help it. I can do nothing but converse with <lb/>
you. When present, my prate is incessant; when absent, <lb/>
I can prate to you with as little intermission; for the pen, used <lb/>
as carelessly and thoughtlessly as I use it, does <hi rend="italic">but</hi> prate.</p>
<p>Besides, I have not forgotten my promise. 'Tis true the <lb/>
story you wished me to give you, is more easily <reg orig="communi-|cated">communicated</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="5" entity="eaf033v4_0018" pid="uva-lib:350027"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">2</fw></pb>
by the pen, than by the lips. I admit your claim to <lb/>
be acquainted with all the incidents of my life, be they <reg orig="mo-|mentous">momentous</reg> <lb/>
or trivial. I have often told you that the retrospect <lb/>
is very mournful, but that ought not to prevent me from <lb/>
making it, when so useful a purpose as that of thoroughly <lb/>
disclosing to you the character of one, on whom your future <lb/>
happiness is to depend, will be effected by it. I am not <lb/>
surprised that calumny has been busy with my life, and am <lb/>
very little anxious to clear myself from unjust charges, <lb/>
except to such as you.</p>
<p>At this moment, I may add, my mood is not unfriendly <lb/>
to the undertaking. I can do nothing in your absence but <lb/>
write to you. To write what I have, ten thousand times, <lb/>
spoken, and which can be perfectly understood only when <lb/>
accompanied by looks and accents, seems absurd. <reg orig="Especial-|ly">Especially</reg> <lb/>
while there is a subject, on which my <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi> can never <lb/>
expatiate, but on which it is necessary that you should know <lb/>
all that I can tell you.</p>
<p>The prospect of filling up this interval with the relation of <lb/>
the most affecting parts of my life, somewhat reconciled me <lb/>
to your necessary absence, yet I know my heart will droop. <lb/>
Even this preparation, to look back, makes me shudder <lb/>
already. Some reluctance to recall tragical or humiliating <lb/>
scenes, and by thus recalling, to endure them, in some sense, <lb/>
a second time, I must expect to feel.</p>
<p>But let me lay down the pen for the present. Let me <lb/>
take my favorite and lonely path, and by a deliberate review <lb/>
of the past, refresh my memory and methodize my <reg orig="recollec-|tions">recollections</reg>. <lb/>
Adieu till I return.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I am</hi> glad I left not word how soon I meant to return, for <lb/>
here has been, it seems, during my short absence, a pair of <lb/>
<pb n="6" entity="eaf033v4_0019" pid="uva-lib:350028"/>
gossips. They have just gone, lamenting the <reg orig="disappoint-|ment">disappointment</reg>, <lb/>
and leaving me a world of complimentary <reg orig="con-|dolences">condolences</reg>.</p>
<p>I shall take care to prevent future interruption by shutting <lb/>
up the house and retiring to my chamber, where I am <reg orig="re-|solved">resolved</reg> <lb/>
to remain till I have fully disburthened my heart. <lb/>
Disburthen it, said I? I shall load it, I fear, with sadness, <lb/>
but I will not regret an undertaking which my duty to you <lb/>
makes indispensable.</p>
<p>One of the earliest incidents that I remember, is an <reg orig="ex-|postulation">expostulation</reg> <lb/>
with my father. I saw several strange people <lb/>
enter the chamber where my mother was. Somewhat <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg> <lb/>
to my childish fancy that these strangers meant to <lb/>
take her away, and that I should never see her again. My <lb/>
terror was violent, and I thought of nothing but seizing her <lb/>
gown or hand, and holding her back from the rude assailants. <lb/>
My father detained me in his arms, and endeavored to <lb/>
sooth my fears, but I would not be appeased. I struggled <lb/>
and shrieked, and, hearing some movements in my mother's <lb/>
room, that seemed to betoken the violence I so much <reg orig="dread-|ed">dreaded</reg>, <lb/>
I leaped, with a sudden effort, from my father's arms, <lb/>
but fainted before I reached the door of the room.</p>
<p>This may serve as a specimen of the impetuosity of my <lb/>
temper. It was always fervent and unruly; unacquainted with <lb/>
moderation in its attachments, violent in its indignation, and <lb/>
its enmity, but easily persuaded to pity and forgiveness.</p>
<p>When I recovered from my swoon, I ran to my mother's <lb/>
room, but she was gone. I rent the air with my cries, and <lb/>
shocked all about me with importunities to know whither <lb/>
they had carried her. They had carried her to the grave, and <lb/>
nothing would content me, but to visit the spot three or four <lb/>
times a day, and to sit in the room in which she died, in <lb/>
stupid and mopeful silence all night long.</p>
<p>At this time I was only five years old, an age at which, <lb/>
in general, a deceased parent is quickly forgotten; but, in <lb/>
my attachment to my mother, I shewed none of the <reg orig="volatili-|ty">volatility</reg> <lb/>
of childhood. While she lived, I was never at ease but <lb/>
when seated at her knee, or with my arms round her neck. <lb/>
When dead, I cherished her remembrance for years, and <lb/>
have paid, hundreds of times, the tribute of my tears at the <lb/>
foot of her grave.</p>
<pb n="7" entity="eaf033v4_0020" pid="uva-lib:350029"/>
<p>My brother, who was three years older than myself, <reg orig="be-|haved">behaved</reg> <lb/>
in a very different manner. I used to think the <reg orig="dif-|ference">difference</reg> <lb/>
between us was merely that of sex; that every boy <lb/>
was boisterous, ungrateful, imperious, and inhuman, as <lb/>
every girl was soft, pliant, affectionate. Time has cured <lb/>
me of that mistake, and as it has shewn me females, <reg orig="un-|feeling">unfeeling</reg> <lb/>
and perverse, so it has introduced me to men full of <lb/>
gentleness and sensibility. My brother's subsequent <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg> <lb/>
convinced me that he was at all times, selfish and <reg orig="iras-|cible">irascible</reg> <lb/>
beyond most other men, and that his ingratitude and <lb/>
insolence to his mother were only congenial parts of the <lb/>
character he afterwards displayed at large.</p>
<p>My brother and I passed our infancy in one <reg orig="uninter-|mitted">unintermitted</reg> <lb/>
quarrel. We were never together, but he played <lb/>
some cruel and mischievous prank, which I never failed to <lb/>
resent to the utmost of my little power. I soon found that <lb/>
my tears only increased his exultation, and my complaints <lb/>
only grieved my mother. I, therefore, gave word for word <lb/>
and blow for blow, but being always worsted in such <reg orig="con-|flicts">conflicts</reg> <lb/>
I shunned him whenever it was possible, and <reg orig="what-|ever">whatever</reg> <lb/>
his malice made me suffer, I endeavored to conceal it <lb/>
from her.</p>
<p>My mother, on her death-bed, was anxious to see him, <lb/>
but he had strolled away after some boyish amusement, <lb/>
with companions as thoughtless as himself. The news of <lb/>
her death scarcely produced an hour's seriousness. He <lb/>
made my affliction a topic of sarcasm and contempt.</p>
<p>To soften my grief, my father consented to my living <lb/>
under the care of her, whom I now call my mother. Mrs. <lb/>
Fielder was merely the intimate from childhood of my own <lb/>
mother, with whom, however, since her marriage, <reg orig="con-|tracted">contracted</reg> <lb/>
against Mrs. Fielder's inclination and remonstrances, <lb/>
she had maintained but little intercourse. My mother's <lb/>
sudden death and my helpless age, awakened all her early <lb/>
tenderness, and induced her to offer an asylum to me. <lb/>
Having a considerable fortune and no family, her offer, <reg orig="not-|withstanding">notwithstanding</reg> <lb/>
ancient jealousies, was readily accepted by my <lb/>
father.</p>
<p>My new residence was, in many respects, the reverse of <lb/>
my former one. The treatment I received from my new <lb/>
parent, without erasing the memory of the old one, quickly <lb/>
<pb n="8" entity="eaf033v4_0021" pid="uva-lib:350030"/>
excited emotions as filial and tender as I had ever <reg orig="expe-|rienced">experienced</reg>. <lb/>
Comfort and quiet, peace and harmony, <reg orig="obse-|quious">obsequious</reg> <lb/>
and affectionate attendants and companions, I had <lb/>
never been accustomed to under the paternal roof.</p>
<p>From this period till I was nearly sixteen years of age, I <lb/>
merely paid occasional visits to my father. He loved me <lb/>
with as much warmth as his nature was capable of feeling, <lb/>
which I repaid him in gratitude and reverence. I never <lb/>
remitted my attention to his affairs, and studied his security <lb/>
and comfort as far as these were within my power.</p>
<p>My brother was not deficient in talents, but he wanted <lb/>
application. Very early he shewed strong propensities to <lb/>
active amusements and sensual pleasures. The school and <lb/>
college were little attended to, and the time that ought <lb/>
to have been appropriated to books and study, was wasted <lb/>
in frolics and carousals. As soon as he was able to manage <lb/>
a gun and a horse, they were procured, and these and the <lb/>
company to which they introduced him, afforded <reg orig="employ-|ment">employment</reg> <lb/>
for all his attention and time.</p>
<p>My father had devoted his early years to the <reg orig="indefatiga-|ble">indefatigable</reg> <lb/>
pursuit of gain. He was frugal and abstemious, though <lb/>
not covetous, and amassed a large property. This <reg orig="pro-|perty">property</reg> <lb/>
he intended to divide between his two children, and to <lb/>
secure my portion to his nephew, whom his parents had <lb/>
left an orphan in his infancy, and whom my father had taken <lb/>
and treated as his own child by marrying him to me. This <lb/>
nephew passed his childhood among us. His temper being <lb/>
more generous than my brother's, and being taught <reg orig="mutu-|ally">mutually</reg> <lb/>
to regard each other as destined to a future union, our <lb/>
intercourse was cordial and affectionate.</p>
<p>We parted at an age at which nothing like passion could <lb/>
be felt. He went to Europe, in circumstances very <reg orig="favor-|able">favorable</reg> <lb/>
to his improvement, leaving behind him the <reg orig="expecta-|tion">expectation</reg> <lb/>
of his returning in a few years. Meanwhile, my <reg orig="fa-|ther">father</reg> <lb/>
was anxious that we should regard each other, and <lb/>
maintain a correspondence as persons betrothed. In <reg orig="per-|sons">persons</reg> <lb/>
at our age, this scheme was chimerical. As soon as <lb/>
I acquired the power of reflection, I perceived the folly of <lb/>
such premature bonds, and though I did not openly oppose <lb/>
my father's wishes, held myself entirely free to obey any <lb/>
new impulse which circumstances might produce. My <lb/>
<pb n="9" entity="eaf033v4_0022" pid="uva-lib:350031"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">2*</fw></pb>
mother, so let me still call Mrs. Fielder, fully concurred in <lb/>
my views.</p>
<p>You are acquainted, my friend, with many events of my <lb/>
early life. Most of those not connected with my father and <lb/>
his nephew, I have often related. At present, therefore, I <lb/>
shall omit all collateral and contemporary incidents, and <lb/>
confine myself entirely to those connected with these two <lb/>
persons.</p>
<p>My father, on the death of his wife, retired from <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg>, <lb/>
and took a house in an airy and secluded situation. <lb/>
His household consisted of a housekeeper, and two or three <lb/>
servants, and apartments were always open for his son.</p>
<p>My brother's temper grew more unmanageable as he <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg> <lb/>
in years. My father's views with regard to him <lb/>
were such as parental foresight and discretion commonly <lb/>
dictate. He wished him to acquire all possible advantages <lb/>
of education, and then to betake himself to some liberal <lb/>
profession, in which he might obtain honor as well as riches. <lb/>
This sober scheme by no means suited the restless <reg orig="tem-|per">temper</reg> <lb/>
of the youth. It was his maxim that all restraints were <lb/>
unworthy of a lad of spirit, and that it was far more wise <lb/>
to spend freely what his father had painfully acquired, than <lb/>
by the same plodding and toilsome arts, to add to the heap.</p>
<p>I scarcely know how to describe my feelings in relation <lb/>
to this young man. My affection for him was certainly <lb/>
without that tenderness which a good brother is sure to <reg orig="ex-|cite">excite</reg>. <lb/>
I do not remember a single direct kindness that I ever <lb/>
received from him, but I remember innumerable ill offices <lb/>
and contempts. Still there was some inexplicable charm <lb/>
in the mere tie of kindred, which made me more deplore <lb/>
his errors, exult in his talents, rejoice in his success, and <lb/>
take a deeper interest in his concerns than in those of any <lb/>
other person.</p>
<p>As he advanced in age, I had new cause for my zeal in <lb/>
his behalf. My father's temper was easy and flexible; my <lb/>
brother was at once vehement and artful. Frank's <reg orig="argu-|ments">arguments</reg> <lb/>
and upbraidings created in his father an unnatural <lb/>
awe, an apprehension and diffidence in thwarting his wishes <lb/>
and giving advice, which usually distinguish the filial <reg orig="charac-|ter">character</reg>. <lb/>
The youth perceived his advantages, and employed <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="eaf033v4_0023" pid="uva-lib:350032"/>
them in carrying every point on which his inclination was <lb/>
set.</p>
<p>For a long time this absurd indulgence was shewn in <lb/>
allowing his son to employ his time as he pleased; in <reg orig="re-|fraining">refraining</reg> <lb/>
from all animadversions on his idleness and <reg orig="dissipa-|tion">dissipation</reg>, <lb/>
and supplying him with a generous allowance of pocket <lb/>
money. This allowance required now and then to be <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg>. <lb/>
Every year and every month, by adding new <lb/>
sources of expense, added something to the stipend.</p>
<p>My father's revenue was adequate to a very splendid <reg orig="es-|tablishment">establishment</reg>, <lb/>
but he was accustomed to live frugally, and <lb/>
thought it wise to add his savings to the principal of his <reg orig="es-|tate">estate</reg>. <lb/>
These savings gradually grew less and less, till at <lb/>
length my brother's numerous excursions, a French girl <lb/>
whom he maintained in expensive lodgings, his horses, dogs, <lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">friends,</hi> consumed the whole of it.</p>
<p>I never met my brother but by accident. These <reg orig="inter-|views">interviews</reg> <lb/>
were, for the most part, momentary, either in the <lb/>
street or at my father's house, but I was too much interested <lb/>
in all that befel him, not to make myself, by various means, <lb/>
thoroughly acquainted with his situation.</p>
<p>I had no power to remedy the evil; as my elder brother <lb/>
and as a man, he thought himself entitled to govern and <reg orig="de-|spise">despise</reg> <lb/>
me. He always treated me as a frivolous girl, with <lb/>
whom it was waste of time to converse, and never spoke to <lb/>
me at all except to direct or admonish. Hence I could do <lb/>
nothing but regret his habits. Their consequences to <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
it was beyond my power to prevent.</p>
<p>For a long time I was totally unaware of the tendencies <lb/>
of this mode of life. I did not suspect that a brother's <reg orig="pas-|sions">passions</reg> <lb/>
would carry him beyond the bound of vulgar prudence, <lb/>
or induce him to encroach on those funds, from which his <lb/>
present enjoyments were derived. I knew him to be <reg orig="en-|dowed">endowed</reg> <lb/>
with an acute understanding, and imagined that this <lb/>
would point out, with sufficient clearness, the wisdom of <lb/>
limiting his expenses to his income.</p>
<p>In my daily conversations with my father, I never <reg orig="volun-|tarily">voluntarily</reg> <lb/>
introduced Frank as our topic, unless by the harmless <lb/>
and trite questions of "when was he here?" "where has <lb/>
he gone?" and the like. We met only by accident, at his <lb/>
lodgings; when I entered the room where he was, he never <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="eaf033v4_0024" pid="uva-lib:350033"/>
thought of bestowing more than a transient look on me, just <lb/>
to know who it was that approached. Circumstances, at <lb/>
length, however, occurred, which put an end to this state <lb/>
of neutrality.</p>
<p>I heard, twice or thrice a year, from my cousin Risberg. <lb/>
One day a letter arrived in which he obscurely intimated <lb/>
that the failure of remittances from my father, for more <lb/>
than half a year, had reduced him to great distress. My <lb/>
father had always taught him to regard himself as entitled <lb/>
to all the privileges of a son; had sent him to Europe under <lb/>
express conditions of supplying him with a reasonable <reg orig="sti-|pend">stipend</reg>, <lb/>
till he should come of age, at which period it was <lb/>
concerted that Risberg should return and receive a portion <lb/>
with me, enabling him to enter advantageously on the <reg orig="profes-|sion">profession</reg> <lb/>
of the law, to which he was now training. This stipend <lb/>
was far from being extravagant; or more than sufficient for <lb/>
the decent maintenance of a student at the temple, and <lb/>
Risberg's conduct had always been represented, by those <lb/>
under whose eye he had been placed, as regular and <reg orig="exem-|plary">exemplary</reg>.</p>
<p>This intimation surprised me a good deal; I could easily <lb/>
imagine the embarrassments to which a failure of this kind <lb/>
must subject a generous spirit, and thought it my duty to <lb/>
remove them as soon as possible. I supposed that some <lb/>
miscarriage or delay had happened to the money, and that <lb/>
my father would instantly rectify any error, or supply any <lb/>
deficiency. I hastened, therefore, to his house, with the <lb/>
opened letter. I found him alone, and immediately showed <lb/>
him that page of the letter which related to this affair. I <lb/>
anxiously watched his looks while he read it.</p>
<p>I observed marks of great surprise in his countenance, <lb/>
and as soon as he laid down the letter, I began to expatiate <lb/>
on the inconveniences which Risberg had suffered. He <lb/>
listened to me, in gloomy silence, and when I had done, <lb/>
made no answer but by a deep sigh and downcast look.</p>
<p>Pray, dear sir, continued I, what could have happened <lb/>
to the money which you sent? You had not heard, I <reg orig="sup-|pose">suppose</reg>, <lb/>
of its miscarriage.</p>
<p>No, I had not heard of it before. I will look into it, and <lb/>
see what can be done. Here further conversation was <reg orig="sus-|pended">suspended</reg> <lb/>
by a visitant. I waited with impatience till the guest <lb/>
<pb n="12" entity="eaf033v4_0025" pid="uva-lib:350034"/>
had retired, but he had scarcely left the room when my <lb/>
brother entered. I supposed my father would have <reg orig="imme-|diately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
introduced this subject, and as my brother usually <lb/>
represented him in every affair of business, and could of <lb/>
course throw some light upon the present mystery, I saw <lb/>
no reason why I should be excluded from a conference in <lb/>
which I had some interest, and was, therefore, somewhat <lb/>
surprised when my father told me he had no need of my <lb/>
company for the rest of the day, and wished to be alone <lb/>
with Francis. I rose, instantly to depart, but said, pray, sir, <lb/>
tell my brother what has happened. Perhaps he can <reg orig="ex-|plain">explain</reg> <lb/>
the mystery.</p>
<p>What, cried my brother, with a laugh, has thy silly brain <lb/>
engendered a mystery which I am to solve? Thou mayest <lb/>
save thyself the trouble of telling me, for, really, I have no <lb/>
time to throw away on thee or thy mysteries.</p>
<p>There was always something in my brother's raillery <lb/>
which my infirm soul could never support. I ought always <lb/>
to have listened and replied without emotion, but a fluttering <lb/>
indignation usually deprived me of utterance. I found my <lb/>
best expedient was flight, when I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> fly, and silence <lb/>
when obliged to remain; I therefore made no answer to <lb/>
this speech, but hastily withdrew.</p>
<p>Next morning, earlier than usual, I went to my father. <lb/>
He was thoughtful and melancholy. I introduced the subject <lb/>
that was nearest my heart, but he answered me reluctantly, <lb/>
and in general terms, that he had examined the affair, and <lb/>
would take the necessary measures.</p>
<p>But, dear sir, said I, how did it happen? How did the <lb/>
money miscarry?</p>
<p>Never mind, said he, a little peevishly, we shall see things <lb/>
put to rights, I tell you, and let that satisfy you.</p>
<p>I am glad of it. Poor fellow! Young, generous, <reg orig="disdain-|ing">disdaining</reg> <lb/>
obligation, never knowing the want of money, how must <lb/>
he have felt on being left quite destitute, pennyless, running <lb/>
in arrear for absolute necessaries; in debt to a good woman <lb/>
who lived by letting lodgings, and who dunned him, after so <lb/>
long a delay, in so indirect and delicate a manner.&mdash;What <lb/>
must he have suffered, accustomed to regard you as a <lb/>
father, and knowing you had no personal calls for your large <lb/>
revenue, and being so solemnly enjoined by you not to stint <lb/>
<pb n="13" entity="eaf033v4_0026" pid="uva-lib:350035"/>
himself in any rational pleasure, for you would be always <lb/>
ready to exceed your stated remittances, when there should <lb/>
be just occasion. Poor fellow! my heart bleeds for him. <lb/>
But how long will it be before he hears from you? His <reg orig="let-|ter">letter</reg> <lb/>
is dated seven weeks ago. It will be another six or <lb/>
eight weeks before he receives an answer, at least three <lb/>
months in all, and during all this time he will be without <lb/>
money. But perhaps he will receive it sooner.</p>
<p>My father frequently changed countenance, and shewed <lb/>
great solicitude. I did not wonder at this, as Risberg had <lb/>
always been loved as a son. A little consideration, therefore, <lb/>
ought to have showed me the impropriety of thus <reg orig="descant-|ing">descanting</reg> <lb/>
on an evil without remedy; yet I still persisted. At <lb/>
length, I asked to what causes I might ascribe his former <lb/>
disappointments, in the letter to Risberg, which I proposed <lb/>
writing immediately.</p>
<p>This question threw him into much confusion. At last <lb/>
he said, peevishly, "I wish, Jane, you would leave these <lb/>
matters to me; I don't like your interference."</p>
<p>This rebuke astonished me. I had sufficient discernment <lb/>
to suspect something extraordinary, but was for a few <reg orig="min-|utes">minutes</reg> <lb/>
quite puzzled and confounded. He had generally <lb/>
treated me with tenderness and even deference, and I saw <lb/>
nothing peculiarly petulant or improper in what I had said.</p>
<p>"Dear sir, forgive me, you know I write to my cousin, <lb/>
and as he stated his complaints to me, it will be natural to <lb/>
allude to them in my answer to his letter, but I will only tell <lb/>
him that all difficulties are removed, and refer him to your <lb/>
letter for further satisfaction; for you will no doubt write to <lb/>
him."</p>
<p>I wish you would drop the subject. If you write, you <lb/>
may tell him&mdash;but tell him what you please, or rather it <lb/>
would be best to say nothing on the subject&mdash;but drop the <lb/>
subject, I beseech you.</p>
<p>Certainly, if the subject displeases you, I will drop it.&mdash; <lb/>
Here a pause of mutual embarrassment succeeded, which <lb/>
was, at length, broken by my father.</p>
<p>I will speak to you tomorrow, Jane, on this subject. I <lb/>
grant your curiosity is natural, and will then gratify it. <reg orig="To-|morrow">To-morrow</reg>, <lb/>
I may possibly explain why Risberg has not <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="14" entity="eaf033v4_0027" pid="uva-lib:350036"/>
what, I must own, he had a right to expect. We'll <lb/>
think no more of it at present, but play a game at <hi rend="italic">draughts.</hi></p>
<p>I was impatient, you may be sure, to have a second <lb/>
meeting. Next day my father's embarrassment and <reg orig="per-|plexity">perplexity</reg> <lb/>
was very evident. It was plain that he had not <reg orig="for-|got">forgot</reg> <lb/>
the promised explanation, but that something made it a <lb/>
very irksome task. I did not suffer matters to remain long <lb/>
in suspense, but asked him, in direct terms, what had caused <lb/>
the failure of which my cousin complained, and whether he <lb/>
was hereafter to receive the stipulated allowance?</p>
<p>He answered hesitatingly, and with downcast eyes&mdash;why <lb/>
&mdash;he did not know. He was sorry. It had not been <lb/>
his fault. To say truth, Francis had received the usual <lb/>
sums to purchase the bills. Till yesterday, he imagined <lb/>
they had actually been purchased and sent. He always <lb/>
understood them to have been so from Francis. He had <lb/>
mentioned, after seeing Risberg's complaining letter, he had <lb/>
mentioned the affair to Francis. Francis had confessed <lb/>
that he had never sent the bills. His own necessities <reg orig="com-|pelled">compelled</reg> <lb/>
him to apply the money given him for this purpose <lb/>
to his own use. To be sure, Risberg was his nephew; had <lb/>
always depended on him for his maintenance, but somehow <lb/>
or another the wants of Francis had increased very much <lb/>
of late years, and swallowed up all that he could <hi rend="italic">rap</hi> and <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">rend</hi> without encroaching on his principal. Risberg was but <lb/>
his nephew, Frank was his own and only son. To be sure, <lb/>
he once thought that he had enough for his <hi rend="italic">three</hi> children, <lb/>
but times, it seems, were altered. He did not spend on his <lb/>
own wants more than he used to do; but Frank's expenses <lb/>
were very great, and swallowed up every thing. To be <lb/>
sure, he pitied the young man, but he was enterprising and <lb/>
industrious, and could, no doubt, shift for himself; yet he <lb/>
would be quite willing to assist him, were it in his power, <lb/>
but really it was no longer in his power.</p>
<p>I was, for a time, at a loss for words to express my surprise <lb/>
and indignation at my brother's unfeeling selfishness. I could <lb/>
no longer maintain my usual silence on his conduct, but <reg orig="in-|veighed">inveighed</reg> <lb/>
against it, as soon as I could find breath, with the <lb/>
utmost acrimony.</p>
<p>My father was embarrassed, confounded, grieved. He <lb/>
sighed, and even wept.&mdash;Francis, said he, at last, to be <lb/>
<pb n="15" entity="eaf033v4_0028" pid="uva-lib:350037"/>
sure, has not acted quite right. But what can done? Is <lb/>
he not my child, and if he has faults, is he altogether <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
virtue? No, if he did not find a lenient and forgiving <lb/>
judge in me, his father, in whom could he look for one. <lb/>
Besides, the thing is done, and therefore without remedy. <lb/>
This year's income is nearly exhausted, and I really fear <lb/>
before another quarter comes round, I shall want myself.</p>
<p>I again described, in as strong and affecting terms as I <lb/>
could, Risberg's expectations and disappointment, and <reg orig="insin-|uated">insinuated</reg> <lb/>
to him, that, in a case like this, there could be no <reg orig="im-|propriety">impropriety</reg> <lb/>
in selling a few shares of his bank stock.</p>
<p>This hint was extremely displeasing, but I urged him <lb/>
so vehemently that he said, Francis will perhaps consent to <lb/>
it; I will try him this evening.</p>
<p>Alas! said I, my brother will never consent to such a <lb/>
measure. If he has found occasion for the money you <lb/>
had designed for my poor cousin, and of all your <reg orig="cur-|rent">current</reg> <lb/>
income, his necessities will not fail to lay hold of <lb/>
this.</p>
<p>Very true, (glad, it seemed of an excuse for not <reg orig="thwart-|ing">thwarting</reg> <lb/>
his son's will,) Frank will never consent. So you see, <lb/>
it will be impossible to do any thing.</p>
<p>I was going to propose that he should execute this <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg> <lb/>
without my brother's knowledge, but instantly <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg> <lb/>
the impossibility of that. My father had for some <lb/>
years devolved on his son the management of all his affairs, <lb/>
and habit had made him no longer qualified to act for <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>. <lb/>
Frank's opinion of what was proper to be done, was <lb/>
infallible, and absolute in all cases.</p>
<p>I returned home with a very sad heart. I was deeply <lb/>
afflicted with this new instance of my brother's selfishness <lb/>
and of my father's infatuation&mdash;poor Risberg! said I, <lb/>
what will become of thee. I love thee as my brother. I <lb/>
feel for thy distresses. Would to heaven I could remove <lb/>
them. And cannot I remove them? As to contending <lb/>
with my brother's haughtiness in thy favor, that is a <reg orig="hope-|less">hopeless</reg> <lb/>
task. As to my father, he will never submit to my <lb/>
guidance.</p>
<p>After much fruitless meditation, it occurred to me that I <lb/>
might supply Risberg's wants from my own purse. My <lb/>
mother's indulgence to me was without bounds. She openly <lb/>
<pb n="16" entity="eaf033v4_0029" pid="uva-lib:350038"/>
considered and represented me as the heiress of her <reg orig="for-|tunes">fortunes</reg>, <lb/>
and confided fully in my discretion. The chief uses <lb/>
I had hitherto found for money were charitable ones. I <lb/>
was her almoner. To stand in the place of my father, <lb/>
with respect to Risberg, and supply his customary stipend <lb/>
from my own purse, was an adventurous undertaking for a <lb/>
young creature like me. It was impossible to do this <reg orig="clan-|destinely">clandestinely</reg>; <lb/>
at least, without the knowledge and consent of <lb/>
Mrs. Fielder. I therefore resolved to declare what had <lb/>
happened, and request her counsel. An opportunity <reg orig="suit-|able">suitable</reg> <lb/>
to this did not immediately offer.</p>
<p>Next morning, as I was sitting alone in the parlor, at <lb/>
work, my brother came in. Never before had I received a <lb/>
visit from him. My surprise, therefore, was not small. <lb/>
I started up with the confusion of a stranger, and requested <lb/>
him, very formally, to be seated.</p>
<p>I instantly saw in his looks marks of displeasure, and <lb/>
though unconscious of meriting it, my trepidation increased. <lb/>
He took a seat without speaking, and after some pause <reg orig="ad-|dressed">addressed</reg> <lb/>
me thus.</p>
<p>So girl, I hear that you have been meddling with things <lb/>
that do not concern you; sowing dissension between the <lb/>
old man and me; presuming to dictate to us how we are <lb/>
to manage our own property. He retailed to me, last night, <lb/>
a parcel of impertinence with which you had been teazing <lb/>
him, about this traveller Risberg, assuming, long before <lb/>
your time, the province of his care taker. Why, do you <lb/>
think, continued he, contemptuously, he'll ever return to <lb/>
marry you? Take my word for't, he's no such fool. I <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">know</hi> that he never will.</p>
<p>The infirmity of my temper, has been a subject of <reg orig="eter-|nal">eternal</reg> <lb/>
regret to me; yet it never displayed itself with much <lb/>
force, except under the lash of my brother's sarcasms. <lb/>
My indignation on those occasions had a strange mixture of <lb/>
fear in it, and both together suffocated my speech. I made <lb/>
no answer to this boisterous arrogance.</p>
<p>But come, continued he, pray let us hear your very wise <lb/>
objections to a man's applying his own property to his own <lb/>
use. To rob himself, and spend the spoil upon another is <lb/>
thy sage maxim, it seems, for which, thou deservest to be <lb/>
dubbed a <hi rend="italic">she Solomon,</hi> but let's see if thou art as cunning <lb/>
<pb n="17" entity="eaf033v4_0030" pid="uva-lib:350039"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">3</fw></pb>
in defending as in coining maxims. Come there is a chair; <lb/>
lay it on the floor, and suppose it a bar or rostrum, which <lb/>
thou wilt, and stand behind it, and plead the cause of <reg orig="fool-|ish">foolish</reg> <lb/>
prodigality against common sense.</p>
<p>I endeavored to muster up a little spirit, and replied, I <lb/>
could not plead before a more favorable judge. An appeal <lb/>
to my brother on behalf of foolish prodigality, could hardly <lb/>
fail of success. Poor common sense must look for justice <lb/>
at some other tribunal.</p>
<p>His eyes darted fire. Come, girl, none of your insolence. <lb/>
I did not come here to be insulted.</p>
<p>No, you rather came to commit than to receive an <lb/>
insult.</p>
<p>Paltry distinguisher! to jest with you, and not chide you <lb/>
for your folly, is to insult you, is it? Leave off romance, and <lb/>
stick to common sense, and you will never receive any <lb/>
thing but kindness from me. But come, if I must humor <lb/>
you, let me hear how you have found yourself out to be <lb/>
wiser than your father and brother.</p>
<p>I do not imagine, brother, any good will result from our <lb/>
discussing this subject. Education, or sex, if you please, has <lb/>
made a difference in our judgments, which argument will <lb/>
never reconcile.</p>
<p>With all my heart. A truce everlasting let there be, but <lb/>
in truth, I merely came to caution you against intermeddling <lb/>
in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> affairs, to tell you to beware of sowing jealousy and <lb/>
ill will between the <hi rend="italic">old man</hi> and me. Prate away on other <lb/>
subjects as much as you please, but on this affair of Risberg's, <lb/>
hold your tongue for the future.</p>
<p>I thank you for your brotherly advice, but I am afraid I <lb/>
never shall bring myself to part with the liberty of <hi rend="italic">prating</hi> <lb/>
on every subject that pleases me; at least, my forbearance <lb/>
will flow from my own discretion, and not from the <reg orig="imperi-|ous">imperious</reg> <lb/>
prohibition of another.</p>
<p>He laughed. Well said, oddity. I am not displeased to <lb/>
see you act with some spirit; but I repeat my charge; <hi rend="italic">be <lb/>
quiet.</hi> Your interference will do no good.</p>
<p>Indeed, I firmly believe that it will not; and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> will be <lb/>
a motive for my silence, that shall always have its due <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="eaf033v4_0031" pid="uva-lib:350040"/>
weight with me. Risberg, I see, must look elsewhere for <lb/>
a father and a brother.</p>
<p>Poor thing! do; put its finger in its eye and weep. Ha! <lb/>
ha! ha! poor Risberg! how would he laugh to see these <lb/>
compassionate tears. It seems he has written in a very <lb/>
doleful strain to thee; talked very pathetically about his <lb/>
debts, to his laundress and his landlady. I have a good <lb/>
mind to leave thee in this amiable ignorance, but I'll prove <lb/>
for once a kind brother, by telling you that Risberg is a <reg orig="pro-|fligate">profligate</reg> <lb/>
and prodigal; that he neglects every study, but that <lb/>
of dice; that this is the true reason why I have stood in <lb/>
the way of the old man's bounty to him. I have <reg orig="unques-|tionable">unquestionable</reg> <lb/>
proofs of his worthlessness, and see no reason to <lb/>
throw away money upon London prostitutes and gamblers. <lb/>
I never mentioned this to the old man, because I would not <lb/>
needlessly distress him, for I know he loves Jack at least as <lb/>
well as his own children. I tell it you to justify my <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg>, <lb/>
and hope that I may for once trust to your good <lb/>
sense not to disclose it to your father.</p>
<p>My heart could not restrain its indignation at these words.</p>
<p>'Tis false, I exclaimed, 'tis a horrid calumny against <lb/>
one who cannot defend himself; I will never believe the <lb/>
depravity of my absent brother, till I have as good proof of <lb/>
it, as my present brother has given me of his.</p>
<p>Bravo! my girl, who could have thought you could <lb/>
give the lie with such a grace? why don't you spit in the <lb/>
face of the vile calumniator?&mdash;But I am not angry with you, <lb/>
Jane; I only pity you; yet I'll not leave you before I tell <lb/>
you my mind. I have no doubt Risberg means to return. <lb/>
He knows on what footing you are with Mrs. Fielder, and <lb/>
will take care to return; but, mind me; Jane, you shall <lb/>
never throw yourself and your fortune away upon Risberg, <lb/>
while I have a voice or an arm to prevent it; and now&mdash; <lb/>
good bye to you.</p>
<p>So ended this conversation. He left me in a hurry and <lb/>
confusion of spirits not to be described. For a time I felt <lb/>
nothing but indignation and abhorrence for what, I thought, <lb/>
a wicked and cruel calumny, but in proportion as I regained <lb/>
my tranquillity, my reflections changed. Did not my <reg orig="bro-|ther">brother</reg> <lb/>
speak truth? Was there not something in his manner <lb/>
very different from that of an impostor? How unmoved <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="eaf033v4_0032" pid="uva-lib:350041"/>
was he by the doubts which I ventured to insinuate of his <lb/>
truth! Alas! I fear 'tis too true.</p>
<p>I told you before that we parted at an age when love <lb/>
could not be supposed to exist between us. If I know <lb/>
myself, I felt no more for him than for a mere brother; but <lb/>
then I felt all the solicitude and tenderness of a sister. I <lb/>
knew not scarcely how to act in my present situation; but at <lb/>
length determined to disclose the whole affair to my mother. <lb/>
With her approbation I enclosed an order on a London <reg orig="mer-|chant">merchant</reg> <lb/>
in a letter to this effect:</p>
<p>"I read your letter my friend, with the sentiments of <lb/>
one who is anxious for your happiness. The difficulties <lb/>
you describe, will, I am afraid, be hereafter prevented only <lb/>
by your own industry. My father's and brother's expenses <lb/>
consume the whole of that income in which you have <lb/>
hitherto had a share, and I am obliged to apprize you that <lb/>
the usual remittances will no longer be made. You are <lb/>
now advancing to manhood, and, I hope will soon be able <lb/>
to subsist upon the fruits of your own learning and industry.</p>
<p>"I have something more to say to you, which I scarcely <lb/>
know how to communicate. Somebody here has loaded <lb/>
your character with very heavy imputations. You are said <lb/>
to be addicted to gaming, sensuality and the lowest vices. <lb/>
How much grief this intelligence has given to all who love <lb/>
you, you will easily imagine. To find you innocent of these <lb/>
charges would free my heart from the keenest solicitude it <lb/>
has hitherto felt. I leave to you the proper means of doing <lb/>
this, if you can do it, without violation of truth.</p>
<p>"I am very imperfectly acquainted with your present <lb/>
views. You originally designed, after having completed <lb/>
your academical and legal education, to return to America. <lb/>
If this should still be your intention, the enclosed will <reg orig="ob-|viate">obviate</reg> <lb/>
some of your pecuniary embarrassments, and my <lb/>
mother enjoins me to tell you that, as you may need a few <lb/>
months longer to make the necessary preparations for <reg orig="re-|turning">returning</reg>, <lb/>
you may draw on her for an additional sum of five <lb/>
hundred dollars. Adieu."</p>
<p>My relation to Risberg was peculiarly delicate. His <lb/>
more lively imagination had deceived him already into a <reg orig="be-|lief">belief</reg> <lb/>
that he was in love. At least, in all his letters, he <lb/>
seemed fond of recognising that engagement which my <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="eaf033v4_0033" pid="uva-lib:350042"/>
father had established between us, and exaggerated the <lb/>
importance to his happiness, of my regard. Experience <lb/>
had already taught me to set their just value on such <reg orig="pro-|fessions">professions</reg>. <lb/>
I knew that men are sanguine and confident, and <lb/>
that the imaginary gracefulness of passion naturally prompts <lb/>
them to make their words outstrip their feelings. Though <lb/>
eager in their present course, it is easy to divert them from <lb/>
it, and most men of an ardent temper can be dying of love <lb/>
for half a dozen different women in the course of a year.</p>
<p>Women feel deeply, but boast not. The supposed <reg orig="inde-|cency">indecency</reg> <lb/>
of forwardness makes their words generally fall short <lb/>
of their sentiments, and passion, when once thoroughly <reg orig="im-|bibed">imbibed</reg>, <lb/>
is as hard to be escaped from, as it was difficultly <lb/>
acquired. I felt no passion, and endeavored not to feel <lb/>
any for Risberg, till circumstances should make it proper <lb/>
and discreet. My attachment was to his interest, his <reg orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg>, <lb/>
and not to his person, and to convince him of this, <lb/>
was extremely difficult. To persuade him that his freedom <lb/>
was absolute and entire; that no tie of honor or compassion <lb/>
bound him to me, but that, on the contrary, to dispose of <lb/>
his affections elsewhere, would probably be most conducive <lb/>
to the interests of both.</p>
<p>These cautious proceedings were extremely unpleasing <lb/>
to my cousin, who pretended to be deeply mortified at any <lb/>
thing betokening indifference, and terribly alarmed at the <lb/>
possibility of losing me. On the whole, I confess to you, <lb/>
that I thought my cousin and I were destined for each other, <lb/>
and felt myself, if I may so speak, not in love with him, <lb/>
but prepared, at the bidding of discretion, to love him.</p>
<p>My brother's report, therefore, greatly distressed me. <lb/>
Should my cousin prove a reprobate, no power on earth <lb/>
should compel me to be his. If his character should prove <lb/>
blameless, and my heart raise no obstacles, at a proper <lb/>
time, I should act with absolute independence of my <reg orig="bro-|ther's">brother's</reg> <lb/>
inclinations. The menace, that while he had voice <lb/>
or arm he would hinder my choice of Risberg, made the <lb/>
less impression as it related to an event, necessarily <reg orig="dis-|tant">distant</reg>, <lb/>
and which probably might never happen.</p>
<p>The next letter from Risberg put an end to all further <lb/>
intercourse between us. It informed us of his being on <lb/>
the eve of marriage into an opulent family. It expressed <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="eaf033v4_0034" pid="uva-lib:350043"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">3*</fw></pb>
much indignation at the calumny which had prevailed with <lb/>
my father to withdraw his protection; declared that he <lb/>
deemed himself by no means equitably or respectfully <lb/>
treated by him; expressed gratitude to my mother for the <lb/>
supply she had remitted, which had arrived very <reg orig="seasona-|bly">seasonably</reg> <lb/>
and prevented him from stooping to humiliations which <lb/>
might have injured his present happy prospects; and <reg orig="pro-|mised">promised</reg> <lb/>
to repay the sum as soon as possible. This promise <lb/>
was punctually performed, and Risberg assured me that he <lb/>
was as happy as a lovely and rich wife could make him.</p>
<p>I was satisfied with this result, and bestowed no further <lb/>
thought on that subject. From morn to midnight have I <lb/>
written, and have got but little way in my story. Adieu.</p>

<opener>
<dateline>Wednesday Morning, October 5.</dateline>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I continued</hi> my visits to my father as usual. Affairs <lb/>
proceeded nearly in their old channel. Frank and I never <lb/>
met but by accident, and our interviews began and ended <lb/>
merely with a good morrow. I never mentioned Risberg's <lb/>
name to my father, and observed that he as studiously <lb/>
avoided lighting on the same topic.</p>
<p>One day a friend chanced to mention the greatness of my <lb/>
fortune, and congratulated me on my title to two such <lb/>
large patrimonies as those of Mrs. Fielder and my father. <lb/>
I was far from viewing my condition in the same light with <lb/>
my friend. My mother's fortune was indeed large and <reg orig="per-|manent">permanent</reg>, <lb/>
but my claim to it was merely through her <reg orig="volun-|tary">voluntary</reg> <lb/>
favor, of which a thousand accidents might bereave me. <lb/>
As to my father's property, Frank had taken care very early <lb/>
to suggest to him that I was amply provided for in Mrs. <lb/>
Fielder's good graces, and that it was equitable to bequeath <lb/>
the whole inheritance to him. This disposition indeed was <lb/>
not made without my knowledge; but though I was <reg orig="sensi-|ble">sensible</reg> <lb/>
that I held of my maternal friend but a very precarious <lb/>
<pb n="22" entity="eaf033v4_0035" pid="uva-lib:350044"/>
tenure; that my character and education were likely to <reg orig="se-|cure">secure</reg> <lb/>
a much wiser and more useful application of money <lb/>
than my brother's habits, it was impossible for me openly to <lb/>
object to this arrangement; so that, as things stood, though <lb/>
the world, in estimating my merits, never forgot that my <lb/>
father was rich, and that Frank and I were his only <reg orig="chil-|dren">children</reg>, <lb/>
I had in reality no prospect of inheriting a farthing from <lb/>
him.</p>
<p>Indeed, I always entertained a presentiment that I should <lb/>
one day be poor, and have to rely for subsistence on my <lb/>
own labor. With this persuasion, I frequently busied my <lb/>
thoughts in imagining the most lucrative and decent means <lb/>
of employing my ingenuity, and directed my inquiries to <lb/>
many things of little or no use, but on the irksome <reg orig="supposi-|tion">supposition</reg>, <lb/>
that I should one day live by my own labor. But this <lb/>
is a digression.</p>
<p>In answer to my friend's remarks, I observed that my <lb/>
father's property was much less considerable than some <lb/>
people imagined, that time made no accession to it, and <lb/>
that my brother's well known habits, were likely to reduce <lb/>
it much below its present standard, long before it would <lb/>
come to a division.</p>
<p>There, Jane, you are mistaken, said my friend, or rather <lb/>
you are willing to mislead me; for you must know that, <lb/>
though your father appears to be idle, yet your brother is <lb/>
speculating with his money at an enormous rate.</p>
<p>And pray, said I, for I did not wish to betray all the <reg orig="sur-|prise">surprise</reg> <lb/>
that this intelligence gave me, in what speculations is <lb/>
he engaged?</p>
<p>How should I tell you, who scarcely know the meaning <lb/>
of the word. I only heard my father say that young <reg orig="Tal-|bot">Talbot</reg>, <lb/>
though seemingly swallowed up in pleasure, knew how <lb/>
to turn a penny as well as another, and was employing his <lb/>
father's wealth in <hi rend="italic">speculation;</hi> that, I remember, was his <lb/>
word, but I never, for my part, took the trouble to inquire <lb/>
what <hi rend="italic">speculation</hi> meant. I know only that it is some <reg orig="haz-|ardous">hazardous</reg> <lb/>
or complicated way of getting money.</p>
<p>These hints, though the conversation passed immediately <lb/>
to other subjects, made a deep impression on my mind. <lb/>
My brother's character, I knew to be incompatible with any <lb/>
sort of industry, and had various reasons for believing my <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="eaf033v4_0036" pid="uva-lib:350045"/>
father's property to be locked up in bank stock. If my friend's <lb/>
story were true, there was a new instance of the influence <lb/>
which Frank had acquired over his father. I had very <reg orig="in-|distinct">indistinct</reg> <lb/>
ideas of speculation, but was used to regard it as <lb/>
something very hazardous, and almost criminal.</p>
<p>I told my mother all my uneasiness. She thought it <lb/>
worth while to take some means of getting at the truth, in <lb/>
conversation with my father. Agreeably to her advice, on <lb/>
my next visit, I opened the subject, by repeating exactly <lb/>
what I heard. I concluded by asking if it were true.</p>
<p>Why yes, said he, it is partly true, I must confess. Some <lb/>
time ago Frank laid his projects before me, and they <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg> <lb/>
so promising and certain of success, that I ventured <lb/>
to give him possession of a large sum.</p>
<p>And what scheme, sir, was it, if I may venture to ask?</p>
<p>Why child, these are subjects so much out of thy way, <lb/>
that thou wouldst hardly comprehend any explanation that <lb/>
I could give.</p>
<p>Perhaps so; but what success, dear sir, have you met <lb/>
with?</p>
<p>Why I can't but say, that affairs have not been quite as <lb/>
expeditious in their progress as I had reason, at first, to <reg orig="ex-|pect">expect</reg>. <lb/>
Unlooked for delays and impediments will occur in <lb/>
the prosecution of the best schemes, and these, I must own, <lb/>
have been well enough accounted for.</p>
<p>But, dear sir, the scheme I doubt not was very beneficial <lb/>
that induced you to hazard your whole fortune. I thought <lb/>
you had absolutely withdrawn yourself from all the hazards <lb/>
and solicitudes of business.</p>
<p>Why, indeed, I had so, and should never have engaged <lb/>
again in them, of my own accord. Indeed, I trouble not <lb/>
myself with any details at present. I am just as much at <lb/>
my ease as I used to be. I leave every thing to Frank.</p>
<p>But sir, the hazard; the uncertainty of all projects. Would <lb/>
you expose yourself at this time of life, to the possibility of <lb/>
being reduced to distress. And had you not enough <reg orig="al-|ready">already</reg>.</p>
<p>Why what you say, Jane, is very true; these things did <lb/>
occur to me, and they strongly disinclined me, at first, from <lb/>
your brother's proposals; but, I don't know how it was, he <lb/>
made out the thing to be so very advantageous; the <reg orig="suc-|cess">success</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="24" entity="eaf033v4_0037" pid="uva-lib:350046"/>
of it so infallible; and his own wants were so numerous <lb/>
that my whole income was insufficient to supply them; the <lb/>
Lord knows how it has happened. In my time, I could <lb/>
live upon a little. Even with a wife and family; my <lb/>
needs did not require a fourth of the sum that Frank, <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
wife or child, contrives to spend, yet I can't object <reg orig="nei-|ther">neither</reg>. <lb/>
He makes it out that he spends no more than his <lb/>
rank in life, as he calls it, indispensably requires. Rather <lb/>
than encroach upon my funds, and the prospects of success <lb/>
being so very flattering, and Frank so very urgent and so <lb/>
very sanguine, whose own interest it is to be sure of his <lb/>
footing, I even, at last, consented.</p>
<p>But I hope, dear sir, your prudence provided in some <lb/>
degree against the possibility of failure. No doubt, you <reg orig="re-|served">reserved</reg> <lb/>
something which might serve as a stay to your old <lb/>
age in case this hopeful project miscarried. Absolutely to <lb/>
hazard <hi rend="italic">all</hi> on the faith of any project whatever, was <reg orig="unwor-|thy">unworthy</reg> <lb/>
of one of your experience and discretion.</p>
<p>My father, Henry, was a good man. Humane, <reg orig="affec-|tionate">affectionate</reg>, <lb/>
kind, and of strict integrity, but I scarcely need to <lb/>
add, after what I have already related, that his <reg orig="understand-|ing">understanding</reg> <lb/>
was far from being vigorous, or his temper firm. His <lb/>
foibles, indeed, acquired strength as he advanced in years, <lb/>
while his kindness and benevolence remained undiminished.</p>
<p>His acquiescence in my brother's schemes can hardly be <lb/>
ranked with follies; you, who know what scheme it was, <lb/>
who know the intoxicating influence of a specious project, <lb/>
and especially, the wonderful address and plausibility of <lb/>
Catling, the adventurer, who was my brother's prime <reg orig="minis-|ter">minister</reg> <lb/>
and chief agent in that ruinous transaction, will not <reg orig="con-|sider">consider</reg> <lb/>
their adopting the phantom as any proof of the folly of <lb/>
either father or son. But let me return. To my <reg orig="compli-|ment">compliment</reg> <lb/>
to his experience and discretion, my father replied&mdash; <lb/>
why, truly, I hardly know how it may turn out in the long <lb/>
run. At first, indeed, I only consented to come down with <lb/>
a few thousands, the total loss of which would not break my <lb/>
heart; but this, it seems, though it was all they at first <reg orig="de-|manded">demanded</reg>, <lb/>
did not prove quite sufficient. Some debts they <lb/>
were obliged to contract, to no great amount, indeed, and <lb/>
these must be paid or the scheme relinquished. Having <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="eaf033v4_0038" pid="uva-lib:350047"/>
gone so far into the scheme it was absurd to let a trifle stop <lb/>
me. I must own, had I foreseen all the demands that have <lb/>
been made, from time to time, I should never have engaged <lb/>
in it, but I have been led on from one step to another, till I <lb/>
fear, it would avail me nothing to hesitate or hold back; and <lb/>
Frank's representations are so very plausible!</p>
<p>Does your whole subsistence then, my dear sir, depend <lb/>
on the success of this scheme? Suppose it should utterly <lb/>
fail, what will be the consequences to yourself.</p>
<p>Fail! That is impossible. It cannot fail, but through <lb/>
want of money, and I am solemnly assured that no more <lb/>
will be necessary.</p>
<p>But how often, sir, has this assurance been given? No <lb/>
doubt with as much solemnity the first time as the last.</p>
<p>My father began to grow impatient&mdash;It is useless, Jane, <lb/>
to start difficulties and objections now. It is too late to go <lb/>
back, even if I were disinclined to go forward, and I have no <lb/>
doubt of ultimate success. Be a good girl, and you shall <lb/>
come in for a share of the profit. Mrs. Fielder and I, <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
us, will make you the richest heiress in America. <lb/>
Let that consideration reconcile you to the scheme.</p>
<p>I could not but smile at this argument. I well knew that <lb/>
my brother's rapacity was not to be satisfied with millions. <lb/>
To sit down and say, "I have enough," was utterly <reg orig="incom-|patible">incompatible</reg> <lb/>
with his character. I dropped the conversation for <lb/>
the present.</p>
<p>My thoughts were full of uneasiness. The mere sound <lb/>
of the word "project," alarmed me. I had little desire of <lb/>
knowing the exact nature of the scheme, being nowise <lb/>
qualified to judge of its practicability; but a scheme in <lb/>
which my brother was the agent, in which my father's <lb/>
whole property was hazarded, and which appeared, from <lb/>
the account I had just heard, at least, not to have fulfilled <lb/>
the first expectations, could not be regarded with <reg orig="tran-|quillity">tranquillity</reg>.</p>
<p>I took occasion to renew the subject with my father, some <lb/>
time after this. I could only deal in general observations <lb/>
on the imprudence of putting independence and subsistence <lb/>
to hazard; though the past was not to be recalled, yet the <lb/>
future was his own, and it would not be unworthy of him to <lb/>
act with caution. I was obliged to mingle this advice with <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="eaf033v4_0039" pid="uva-lib:350048"/>
much foreign matter, and convey it in the most indirect and <lb/>
gentle terms. His pride was easily offended at being thought <lb/>
to want the counsel of a girl.</p>
<p>He replied to my remarks with confidence, that no <reg orig="far-|ther">farther</reg> <lb/>
demand would be made upon him. The last sum was <lb/>
given with extreme reluctance, and nothing but the positive <lb/>
assurance that it would absolutely be the last, had prevailed <lb/>
with him.</p>
<p>Suppose, sir, said I, what you have already given should <lb/>
prove insufficient. Suppose some new demand should be <lb/>
made upon you.</p>
<p>I cannot suppose that, after so many solemn and positive <lb/>
assurances.</p>
<p>But were not assurances as positive and solemn on every <lb/>
former occasion as the last.</p>
<p>Why, yes, I must own they were, but new circumstances <lb/>
arose that could not be foreseen.</p>
<p>And, dear sir, may not new circumstances arise hereafter <lb/>
that could not be foreseen.</p>
<p>Nay, nay, (with some impatience) I tell you there cannot <lb/>
be any.</p>
<p>I said no more on this subject at this time, but my father, <lb/>
notwithstanding the confidence he expressed, was far from <lb/>
being at ease.</p>
<p>One day I found him in great perturbation. I met my <lb/>
brother, who was going out as I entered, and suspected the <lb/>
cause of his disquiet. He spoke less than usual, and sighed <lb/>
deeply. I endeavored, by various means, to prevail on him <lb/>
to communicate his thoughts, and, at last succeeded. My <lb/>
brother, it seems, had made a new demand upon his purse, <lb/>
and he had been brought reluctantly, to consent to raise the <lb/>
necessary sum by a mortgage on his house, the only real <lb/>
property he possessed. My brother had gone to procure a <lb/>
lender and prepare the deeds.</p>
<p>I was less surprised at this intelligence than grieved. I <lb/>
thought I saw my father's ruin was inevitable, and knew not <lb/>
how to prevent or procrastinate it. After a long pause, I <lb/>
ventured to insinuate that, as the thing was yet to be done, <lb/>
as there was still time for deliberation&mdash;</p>
<p>No, no, interrupted he, I must go on. It is too late to <lb/>
repent. Unless new funds are supplied, all that we have <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="eaf033v4_0040" pid="uva-lib:350049"/>
hitherto done will go for nothing, and Frank assures me that <lb/>
one more sacrifice, and all will be well.</p>
<p>Alas! sir, are you still deceived by that language? Can <lb/>
you still listen to assurances, which experience has so often <lb/>
shown to be fallacious. I know nothing of this fine project, <lb/>
but I can see, too clearly, that unless you hold your hand <lb/>
you will be undone. Would to heaven you would hestitate <lb/>
a moment.&mdash;I said a great deal more to the same purpose, <lb/>
and was at length interrupted by a message from my <reg orig="bro-|ther">brother</reg>, <lb/>
who desired to see me a few minutes in the parlor below. <lb/>
Though at a loss as to what could occasion such an unusual <lb/>
summons, I hastened down.</p>
<p>I found my brother with a strange mixture of pride, <reg orig="per-|plexity">perplexity</reg> <lb/>
and solicitude in his looks. His "how d'ye" was <lb/>
delivered in a graver tone than common, and he betrayed a <lb/>
disposition to conciliate my good will, far beyond what I had <lb/>
ever witnessed before. I waited with impatience to hear <lb/>
what he had to communicate.</p>
<p>At last, with many pauses and much hesitation, he said; <lb/>
Jane, I suppose your legacy is untouched. Was it two or <lb/>
three thousand Mrs. Mathews put you down for in her will?</p>
<p>The sum was three thousand dollars. You know that, <lb/>
though it was left entirely at my own disposal, yet the <reg orig="be-|quest">bequest</reg> <lb/>
was accompanied with advice to keep it unimpaired <lb/>
till I should want it for my own proper subsistence. On <lb/>
that condition I received, and on that condition shall keep it.</p>
<p>I am glad of it with all my heart, replied he, with <reg orig="affect-|ed">affected</reg> <lb/>
vivacity. I was afraid you had spent it by this time on <lb/>
dolls, trinkets, and babythings. The sum is entire you say? <lb/>
In your drawer? I am surprised you could resist the <reg orig="tempta-|tion">temptation</reg> <lb/>
to spend it. I wonder nobody thought of robbing you.</p>
<p>You cannot suppose, brother, I would keep that sum in <lb/>
my possession. You know it was in bank at my Aunt's <lb/>
death, and there it has remained.</p>
<p>At what bank pr'ythee?</p>
<p>I told him.</p>
<p>Well, I am extremely glad thou hadst wit enough to keep <lb/>
it snug, for now the time has come to put it to some use. <lb/>
My father and I have a scheme on foot by which we shall <lb/>
realize immense profit. The more engines we set to work, <lb/>
the greater and more speedy will be the ultimate advantage. <lb/>
<pb n="28" entity="eaf033v4_0041" pid="uva-lib:350050"/>
It occurred to me that you had some money, and that, unless <lb/>
it were better employed, it would be but justice to allow you <lb/>
to throw it into stock. If, therefore, you are willing, it shall <lb/>
be done. What say you, Jane?</p>
<p>This proposal was totally unexpected. I harbored not <lb/>
a moment's doubt as to the conduct it became me to pursue, <lb/>
but how to declare my resolutions, or state my reasons for <lb/>
declining his offer, I knew not.</p>
<p>At last, I stammered out, that, my aunt had bequeathed <lb/>
me this money, with views as to the future disposition of it, <lb/>
from which I did not think myself at liberty to swerve.</p>
<p>And pray, said he, with some heat, what were these <reg orig="pro-|found">profound</reg> <lb/>
views?</p>
<p>They were simple and obvious views. She knew my <lb/>
sex and education laid me under peculiar difficulties as to <lb/>
subsistence. As affairs then stood, there was little danger <lb/>
of my ever being reduced to want or dependence, but still <lb/>
there was a possibility of this. To insure me against this <lb/>
possible evil, she left me this sum, to be used only for <reg orig="sub-|sistence">subsistence</reg>, <lb/>
and when I should be deprived of all other means.</p>
<p>Go on, said my brother. Repeat the clause in which <lb/>
she forbids you, if at any time the opportunity should be <lb/>
offered of doubling or trebling your money, and thereby <lb/>
effectually securing that independence which she wished to <lb/>
bequeath to you, to profit by the offer. Pray, repeat that <lb/>
clause.</p>
<p>Indeed, said I, innocently, there is no such clause.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear it. I was afraid that she was silly <lb/>
enough to insert some such prohibition. On the contrary, <lb/>
the scheme I propose to you, will merely execute your <lb/>
aunt's great purpose. Instead of forbidding, she would <lb/>
have earnestly exhorted you, had she been a prophetess, as <lb/>
well as a saint, to close with such an offer as I now make <lb/>
you, in which, I can assure you, I have your own good as <lb/>
well as my own in view.</p>
<p>Observing my silent and perplexed air&mdash;Why, Jane, said <lb/>
he, surely you cannot hesitate. What is your Objection? <lb/>
Perhaps you are one of those provident animals who look <lb/>
before they leap, and having gained a monopoly of wisdom, <lb/>
will take no scheme upon trust. You must examine with <lb/>
your own eyes, I will explain the affair to you if you choose, <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="eaf033v4_0042" pid="uva-lib:350051"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">4</fw></pb>
and convince you beyond controversy that your money may <lb/>
be trebled in a twelvemonth.</p>
<p>You know brother, I can be no judge of any scheme that <lb/>
is at all intricate.</p>
<p>There is no intricacy here. All is perfectly simple and <lb/>
obvious. I can make the case as plain to you, in three <lb/>
minutes, as that you have two thumbs. In the English <lb/>
Cottons, in the first place, there is&mdash;</p>
<p>Nay, Brother, it is entirely unnecessary to explain the <lb/>
scheme. My determinations will not be influenced by a <lb/>
statement which no mortal eloquence will make intelligible <lb/>
to me.</p>
<p>Well then, you consent to my proposal?</p>
<p>I would rather you would look elsewhere for a partner in <lb/>
your undertaking.</p>
<p>The girl's a fool&mdash;Why? what do you fear? suspect? <lb/>
You surely cannot doubt my being faithful to your interest. <lb/>
You will not insult me so much as to suppose that I would <lb/>
defraud you of your money. If you do, for, I know, I do <lb/>
not stand very high in your opinion, if you doubt my honesty, <lb/>
I will give you the common proofs of having received your <lb/>
money. Nay, so certain am I of success, that I will give <lb/>
you my note, bond, what you please; for thrice the amount, <lb/>
payable in one year.</p>
<p>My brother's bond will be of no use to me; I shall never <lb/>
go to law with my brother.</p>
<p>Well then, what will satisfy you?</p>
<p>I am easily satisfied, brother. I am contented with things <lb/>
just as they are. The sum, indeed, is a trifle, but it will <lb/>
answer all my humble purposes.</p>
<p>Then you will, replied he, struggling with his rage, you <lb/>
will not agree?</p>
<p>My silence was an unequivocal answer.</p>
<p>You turn out to be what I always thought you, a little, <lb/>
perverse, stupid, obstinate&mdash;but take time (softening his tone, <lb/>
a little,) take time to consider of it.</p>
<p>Some unaccountable oddity, some freak must have taken <lb/>
hold of you, just now, and turned your wits out of door. 'Tis <lb/>
impossible you should deliberately reject such an offer. <lb/>
Why, girl, three thousand dollars has a great sound, perhaps, <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="eaf033v4_0043" pid="uva-lib:350052"/>
to your ears, but you'll find it a most wretched pittance, if <lb/>
you should ever be obliged to live upon it. The interest <lb/>
would hardly buy you garters and topknots. You live, at <lb/>
this moment, at the rate of six times the sum. You are <lb/>
now a wretched and precarious dependant on Mrs. Fielder, <lb/>
her marriage, (a very likely thing for one of her habits, <lb/>
fortune and age,) will set you afloat in the world, and then <lb/>
where will be your port. Your legacy, in any way you can <lb/>
employ it, will not find you bread. Three times the sum <lb/>
might answer, perhaps, and that, if you will fall on my <lb/>
advice, you may now attain in a single twelvemonth. <reg orig="Con-|sider">Consider</reg> <lb/>
these things, and I will call on you in the evening for <lb/>
your final answer.</p>
<p>He was going, but I mustered resolution enough to call <lb/>
him back. Brother one word. All deliberation in this case <lb/>
is superfluous. You may think my decision against so <reg orig="plau-|sible">plausible</reg> <lb/>
a scheme, perverse and absurd, but, in this instance, I <lb/>
am fully sensible that I have a right to do as I please, and <lb/>
shall exert that right whatever censure I may incur.</p>
<p>So, then, you are determined not to part with your <reg orig="pal-|try">paltry</reg> <lb/>
legacy?</p>
<p>I am determined not to part with it.</p>
<p>His eyes sparkled with rage, and stamping on the floor, <lb/>
he exclaimed&mdash;Why then let me tell you, Miss, you are a <lb/>
damned idiot. I knew you were a fool, but could not believe <lb/>
that your folly would ever carry you to these lengths&mdash; <lb/>
much more in this style did poor Frank utter on this <reg orig="occa-|sion">occasion</reg>. <lb/>
I listened trembling, confounded, vexed; and as <lb/>
soon as I could recover presence of mind, hastened out of <lb/>
his presence.</p>
<p>This dialogue occupied all my thoughts during that day <lb/>
and the following. I was sitting, next evening, at twilight <lb/>
pensively, in my own apartment, when, to my infinite <reg orig="sur-|prise">surprise</reg>, <lb/>
my brother was announced. At parting with him the <lb/>
day before, he swore, vehemently, that he would never <lb/>
see my face again if he could help it. I suppose this <reg orig="reso-|lution">resolution</reg> <lb/>
had given way to his anxiety to gain my concurrence <lb/>
with his schemes, and would fain have shunned a second <lb/>
interview. This however was impossible. I therefore <reg orig="com-|posed">composed</reg> <lb/>
my tremors as well as I was able, and directed him <lb/>
be to admitted. The angry emotions of yesterday had <reg orig="dis-|appeared">disappeared</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="eaf033v4_0044" pid="uva-lib:350053"/>
from his countenance, and he addressed me, with <lb/>
his customary carelessness. After a few trifling <reg orig="prelimina-|ries">preliminaries</reg>, <lb/>
he asked me, if I had considered the subject of our <lb/>
yesterday's conversation. I answered that I had supposed <lb/>
that subject to have been dismissed forever. It was not <lb/>
possible for time or argument to bring us to the same way of <lb/>
thinking on it. I hoped therefore that he would not <reg orig="com-|pel">compel</reg> <lb/>
me to discuss it a second time.</p>
<p>Instead of flying into rage, as I expected, he fixed his <lb/>
eyes thoughtfully on the floor, and after a melancholy pause, <lb/>
said&mdash;I expected to find you invincible on that head. To <lb/>
say truth, I came not to discuss that subject with you anew. <lb/>
I came merely to ask a trifling favor&mdash;here he stopped. <lb/>
He was evidently at a loss how to proceed. His features <lb/>
became more grave, and he actually sighed.</p>
<p>My heart, I believe, thou knowest, Harry, is the sport, <lb/>
the mere plaything of gratitude and pity. Kindness will <lb/>
melt my firmest resolutions in a moment. Entreaty will lead <lb/>
me to the world's end. Gentle accents, mournful looks in <lb/>
my brother, was a claim altogether irresistible. The <reg orig="mild-|ness">mildness</reg>, <lb/>
the condescension which I now witnessed, thrilled to <lb/>
my heart. A grateful tear rushed to my eye, and I almost <lb/>
articulated, "dear, dear brother, he always thus kind and <lb/>
thus good, and I will lay down my life for you."</p>
<p>It was well for us both that my brother had too much <lb/>
pride or too little cunning to profit by the peculiarities of my <lb/>
temper. Had he put a brotherly arm around me, and <lb/>
said, in an affectionate tone, "dear sister, oblige me," I <lb/>
am afraid I should have instantly complied with the most <lb/>
indiscreet and extravagant of his requests.</p>
<p>Far otherwise, however, was his deportment. This <lb/>
condescension was momentary. The words had scarcely <lb/>
escaped him before he seemed to recollect them as having <lb/>
been unworthy of his dignity. He resumed his arrogant <lb/>
and careless air, half whistled "Caira" and glanced at the <lb/>
garden, with "a tall poplar, that. How old?"</p>
<p>Not very old, for <hi rend="italic">I</hi> planted it.</p>
<p>Very likely. Just such another giddy head and slender <lb/>
body as the planter's.&mdash;But now I think of it, Jane, since <lb/>
your money is idle, suppose you lend me five hundred <reg orig="dol-|lars">dollars</reg> <lb/>
of it till tomorrow. Upon my honor, I'll repay it then. <lb/>
<pb n="32" entity="eaf033v4_0045" pid="uva-lib:350054"/>
My calls just now are particularly urgent. See here, I have <lb/>
brought a <hi rend="italic">check</hi> ready filled. It only wants your signature.</p>
<p>I felt instant and invincible repugnance to this request. I <lb/>
had so long regarded my brother as void of all discretion, and <lb/>
as habitually misapplying money to vicious purposes, that <lb/>
I deemed it a crime of no inconsiderable degree, to supply <lb/>
the means of his prodigality. Occasions were daily <reg orig="occur-|ring">occurring</reg> <lb/>
in which much good was effected by a few dollars, as <lb/>
well as much evil produced by the want of them. My <lb/>
imagination pondered on the evils of poverty much oftener <lb/>
than perhaps was useful, and had thence contracted a terror <lb/>
of it not easily controled. My legacy I had always <reg orig="re-|garded">regarded</reg> <lb/>
as a sacred deposit; an asylum in distress which <lb/>
nothing but the most egregious folly would rob or dissipate. <lb/>
Yet now I was called upon to transfer, by one stroke of the <lb/>
pen, to one who appeared to me to be engaged in ruinous <lb/>
vices or chimerical projects, so large a portion as five <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg> <lb/>
dollars.</p>
<p>I was no niggardly hoarder of the allowance made me <lb/>
by my mother, but so diffident was I of my own <reg orig="discern-|ment">discernment</reg>, <lb/>
that I never laid out twenty dollars without her <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
and concurrence. Could I then give away <hi rend="italic">five <reg orig="hun-|dred">hundred</reg></hi> <lb/>
of this sacred treasure, bestowed on me for very <reg orig="dif-|ferent">different</reg> <lb/>
purposes, without her knowledge? It was useless to <lb/>
acquaint her with my brother's request, and solicit her <reg orig="per-|mission">permission</reg>. <lb/>
She would never grant it.</p>
<p>My brother, observing me hesitate, said&mdash;Come, Jane; <lb/>
make haste. Surely this is no such mighty favor that you <lb/>
should stand a moment. 'Twill be all the same to you, <lb/>
since I return it tomorrow. May I perish, if I don't.</p>
<p>I still declined the offered pen&mdash;For what purpose, <reg orig="bro-|ther">brother</reg>, <lb/>
surely I may ask? so large a sum.</p>
<p>He laughed; a mere trifle, girl. 'Tis a bare nothing; <lb/>
but much or little, you shall have it again, I tell you, <reg orig="to-|morrow">to-morrow</reg>. <lb/>
Come; time flies. Take the pen, I say, and <lb/>
make no more words about the matter.</p>
<p>Impossible! till I know the purpose. Do not urge me <lb/>
to a wrong thing.</p>
<p>His face reddened with indignation. A wrong thing! <lb/>
you are fool enough to tire the patience of a saint. What <lb/>
do I ask, but the loan of a few dollars, for a single day? <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="eaf033v4_0046" pid="uva-lib:350055"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">4*</fw></pb>
Money that is absolutely idle; for which you have no use. <lb/>
You know that my father's property is mine; and that my <lb/>
possessions are twenty times greater than your own; yet you <lb/>
refuse to lend this paltry sum for one day. Come, Jane, <lb/>
sister; you have carried your infatuation far enough. Where <lb/>
a raw girl should gain all these scruples and punctilios I <lb/>
can't imagine. Pray, what is your objection?</p>
<p>In these contests with my brother, I was never mistress <lb/>
of my thoughts. His boisterous, negligent, contemptuous <lb/>
manners, awed, irritated, embarrassed me. To say any <lb/>
thing which implied censure of his morals or his prudence, <lb/>
would be only raising a storm which my womanish spirit <lb/>
could not withstand. In answer to his expostulations, I <lb/>
only repeated&mdash;impossible! I cannot.</p>
<p>Finding me inflexible, he once more gave way to <reg orig="indig-|nation&mdash;What">indignation&mdash;What</reg> <lb/>
a damn'd oaf! to be thus creeping and <reg orig="cring-|ing">cringing</reg> <lb/>
to an idiot; a child; an ape. Nothing but necessity, <lb/>
cruel necessity, would have put me on this task. Then <reg orig="turn-|ing">turning</reg> <lb/>
to me, he said in a tone half supplicating, half threatening; <lb/>
let me ask you once more; will you sign this check? Do <lb/>
not answer hastily; for much, very much depends on it. <lb/>
By all that is sacred I will return it to you tomorrow. Do <lb/>
it, and save me and your father from infamy; from ruin; <lb/>
from a prison; from death. He may have cowardice <lb/>
enough to live and endure his infamy, but I have spirit <lb/>
enough to die and escape it.</p>
<p>This was uttered with an impetuosity that startled me. <lb/>
The words ruin, prison, death, rung in my ears, and <reg orig="al-|most">almost</reg> <lb/>
out of breath, I exclaimed&mdash;what do you mean? my <lb/>
father go to prison? my father ruined? what do you mean?</p>
<p>I mean what I say. Your signing this check may save <lb/>
me from irretrievable ruin. This trifling supply, which I <lb/>
can no where else procure, if it comes to night, may place <lb/>
us out of danger. If delayed till tomorrow morning, there <lb/>
will be no remedy. I shall receive an adequate sum <reg orig="to-|morrow">to-morrow</reg> <lb/>
afternoon, and with that I will replace this.</p>
<p>My father ruined! In danger of a goal! Good Heaven! <lb/>
Let me fly to him. Let me know from himself the full <lb/>
extent of the evil&mdash;I left my seat with this purpose, but he <lb/>
stopped me. Are you mad, girl? He does not know the <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="eaf033v4_0047" pid="uva-lib:350056"/>
full extent of the evil. Indeed the evil will be perfectly <lb/>
removed by this trifling loan. He need not know it.</p>
<p>Ah! my poor father, said I, I see thy ruin, indeed. <lb/>
Too fatally secure hast thou been; too doating in thy <reg orig="con-|fidence">confidence</reg> <lb/>
in others. These words, half articulated, did not <lb/>
escape my brother. He was, at once, astonished and <reg orig="en-|raged">enraged</reg> <lb/>
by them, and even in these circumstances could not <lb/>
suppress his resentment.</p>
<p>He had, however, conjured up a spirit in me which made <lb/>
me deaf to his invective. I made towards the door.</p>
<p>Where are you going? You shall not leave the room till <lb/>
you have signed this paper.</p>
<p>Nothing but force shall keep me from my father. I will <lb/>
know his true situation, this instant from his own lips. Let <lb/>
me go. I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> go.</p>
<p>I attempted to rush by him, but he shut the door and <lb/>
swore I should not leave the room till I had complied with <lb/>
his request.</p>
<p>Perceiving me thoroughly in earnest, and indignant in <lb/>
my turn at his treatment, he attempted to sooth me, by <lb/>
saying, that I had misunderstood him in relation to my <reg orig="fa-|ther">father</reg>; <lb/>
that he had uttered words at random; that he was <lb/>
really out of cash at this moment; I should inexpressibly <lb/>
oblige him by lending him this trifling sum till tomorrow <reg orig="even-|ing">evening</reg>.</p>
<p>Brother, I will deal candidly with you. You think me <lb/>
childish, ignorant and giddy. Perhaps, I am so, but I have <lb/>
sense enough to resolve, and firmness enough to adhere to <lb/>
my resolution, never to give money without thoroughly <lb/>
knowing and fully approving of the purposes to which it is <lb/>
to be applied. You tell me, you are in extreme want of <lb/>
an immediate supply. Of what nature is your necessity? <lb/>
What has occasioned your necessity? I will not withhold, <lb/>
what will really do you good; what I am thoroughly <reg orig="con-|vinced">convinced</reg> <lb/>
will do you good, but I must first be convinced.</p>
<p>What, would you have more than my word? I tell you <lb/>
it will save your&mdash;I tell you it will serve me essentially. It <lb/>
is surely, needless to enter into long and intricate details, <lb/>
which, ten to one, you will not understand.</p>
<p>As your please, said I. I have told you that I will not <lb/>
act in the dark.</p>
<pb n="35" entity="eaf033v4_0048" pid="uva-lib:350057"/>
<p>Well then, I will explain my situation to you as clearly as <lb/>
possible.</p>
<p>He then proceeded to state transactions of which I <reg orig="un-|derstood">understood</reg> <lb/>
nothing. All was specious and plausible, but I <lb/>
easily perceived the advantages under which he spoke, and <lb/>
the gross folly of suffering my conduct to be influenced <lb/>
by representations, of whose integrity I had no means of <lb/>
judging.</p>
<p>I will not detain you longer by this conversation. Suffice <lb/>
it to say, that I positively refused to comply with his wishes. <lb/>
The altercation that ensued was fortunately interrupted by <lb/>
the entrance of two or three visitants, and after lingering <lb/>
a few minutes, he left the house gloomy and dissatisfied.</p>
<p>I have gone into these incidents with a minuteness that I <lb/>
fear has tired you; but I will be more concise for the future. <lb/>
These incidents are chiefly introductory to others of a more <lb/>
affecting nature, and to those I must now hasten. <reg orig="Mean-|while">Meanwhile</reg> <lb/>
I will give some little respite to my fingers.</p>

<head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">To Henry Colden.</hi></head>
<opener>
<dateline>Thursday Morning, October 6.</dateline>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">As</hi> soon as my visitants had gone, I hastened to my <lb/>
father. I immediately introduced the subject of which <lb/>
my heart was full. I related the particulars of my late <lb/>
interview with my brother; entreated him with the utmost <lb/>
earnestness to make the proper inquiries into the state of <lb/>
my brother's affairs, with whose fate it was too plain, that <lb/>
his own were inextricably involved.</p>
<p>He was seized with extreme solicitude on hearing my <lb/>
intelligence. He could not keep his chair one moment at <lb/>
a time, but walked about the floor trembling. He called <lb/>
his servant, and directed him in a faltering voice to go <lb/>
to my brother's house, and request him to come <reg orig="im-|mediately">immediately</reg>.</p>
<p>I was sensible that what I had done was violently adverse <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="eaf033v4_0049" pid="uva-lib:350058"/>
to my brother's wishes. Nevertheless, I urged my father <lb/>
to an immediate explanation, and determined to be present <lb/>
at the conference.</p>
<p>The messenger returned. My brother was not at home. <lb/>
We waited a little while, and then despatched the <reg orig="messen-|ger">messenger</reg> <lb/>
again, with directions to wait till his return. We waited, <lb/>
in vain, till nine; ten; eleven o'clock. The messenger <lb/>
then came back, informing us that Frank was still abroad. <lb/>
I was obliged to dismiss the hope of a conference this night, <lb/>
and returned in an anxious and melancholy mood to Mrs. <lb/>
Fielder's.</p>
<p>On my way, while ruminating on these events, I began <lb/>
to fear that I had exerted an unjustifiable degree of caution; <lb/>
I knew that those who embark in pecuniary schemes are <lb/>
often reduced to temporary straits and difficulties; that <lb/>
ruin and prosperity frequently hang on the decision of the <lb/>
moment; that a gap may be filled up by a small effort <reg orig="sea-|sonably">seasonably</reg> <lb/>
made, which if neglected, rapidly widens and <reg orig="irre-|vocably">irrevocably</reg> <lb/>
swallows up the ill-fated adventurer.</p>
<p>It was possible that all my brother had said was literally <lb/>
true; that he merited my confidence in this instance, and <lb/>
that the supply he demanded would save both him and my <lb/>
father from the ruin that impended over them. The more <lb/>
I pondered on the subject, the more dissatisfied I became <lb/>
with my own scruples. In this state of mind I reached <lb/>
home. The servant, while opening the door, expressed her <lb/>
surprise at my staying out so late, telling me, that my brother <lb/>
had been waiting my return for several hours, with marks <lb/>
of the utmost impatience. I shuddered at this intelligence, <lb/>
though just before I had almost formed the resolution of <reg orig="go-|ing">going</reg> <lb/>
to his house and offering him the money he wanted.</p>
<p>I found him in my apartment.&mdash;Good God! cried he, <lb/>
where have you been till this time of night?</p>
<p>I told him frankly where I had been, and what had <reg orig="de-|tained">detained</reg> <lb/>
me. He was thunderstruck. Instead of that storm <lb/>
of rage and invective which I expected, he grew pale with <lb/>
consternation; and said in a faint voice;</p>
<p>Jane you have ruined me beyond redemption. Fatal, <lb/>
fatal rashness. It was enough to have refused me a loan which <lb/>
though useless to you, is as indispensable to my existence as <lb/>
my heart's blood. Had you quietly lent me the trifling <reg orig="pit-|tance">pittance</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="eaf033v4_0050" pid="uva-lib:350059"/>
I asked, all might yet have been well; my father's <lb/>
peace have been saved and my own affairs been completely <lb/>
reestablished.</p>
<p>All arrogance and indignation were now laid aside. His <lb/>
tone and looks betokened the deepest distress. All the <lb/>
firmness, reluctance and wariness of my temper vanished in <lb/>
a moment. My heart was seized with an agony of <reg orig="com-|punction">compunction</reg>. <lb/>
I came close to him and taking his hand <reg orig="involun-|tarily">involuntarily</reg> <lb/>
said&mdash;Dear brother! Forgive me.</p>
<p>Strange what influence calamity possesses in softening <lb/>
the character. He made no answer, but putting his arms <lb/>
around me, pressed me to his breast while tears stole down <lb/>
his cheek.</p>
<p>Now was I thoroughly subdued. I am quite an April <lb/>
girl, thou knowest, Harry, and the most opposite emotions <lb/>
fill, with equal certainty my eyes. I could scarcely <reg orig="articu-|late&mdash;O">articulate&mdash;O</reg>! <lb/>
my dear brother, forgive me. Take what you <lb/>
ask. If it can be any of service to you, take all I have.</p>
<p>But how, shall I see my father. Infinite pains have I <lb/>
taken to conceal from him a storm which I thought could <lb/>
be easily averted; which his knowledge of it would only <lb/>
render more difficult to resist, but my cursed folly, by <reg orig="say-|ing">saying</reg> <lb/>
more than I intended to you, has blasted my designs.</p>
<p>I again expressed my regret for the rashness of my <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg>, <lb/>
and entreated him to think better of my father, than to <lb/>
imagine him invincible to argument. I promised to go to him <lb/>
in the morning, and counteract, as much as I could, the <reg orig="ef-|fects">effects</reg> <lb/>
of my evening conversation. At length he <reg orig="depart-|ed">departed</reg>, <lb/>
with somewhat renovated spirits, and left me to muse <lb/>
upon the strange events of this day.</p>
<p>I could not free myself from the secret apprehension of <lb/>
having done mischief rather than good, by my compliance. <lb/>
I had acted without consulting my mother, in a case where <lb/>
my youth and inexperience stood it the utmort need of <reg orig="ad-|vice">advice</reg>. <lb/>
On the most trivial occasions I had hitherto held it a <lb/>
sacred duty, to make her the arbitress and judge of my <lb/>
whole conduct, and now shame for my own precipitance <lb/>
and regard for my brother's feelings seemed to join in <reg orig="for-|bidding">forbidding</reg> <lb/>
me to disclose what had passed. A most restless <lb/>
and unquiet night did I pass.</p>
<p>Next morning was I to go to my father, to repair as much <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="eaf033v4_0051" pid="uva-lib:350060"/>
as possible the breach I had thoughtlessly made in his <reg orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg>. <lb/>
I knew not what means to employ for this purpose. <lb/>
What could I say? I was far from being satisfied, myself, <lb/>
with my brother's representations. I hoped, but had very <lb/>
little confidence that any thing in my power to do, would <lb/>
be of permanent advantage.</p>
<p>These doubts did not make me defer my visit. I was <lb/>
greatly surprised to find my father as cheerful and serene as <lb/>
usual, which he quickly accounted for, by telling, me that <lb/>
he had just had a long conversation with Frank, who had <lb/>
convinced him that there was no ground for the terrors I <lb/>
had inspired him with the night before. He could not <reg orig="for-|bear">forbear</reg> <lb/>
a little acrimony on the impropriety of my interference, <lb/>
and I tacitly acquiesced in the censure. I found that he <lb/>
knew nothing of the sum I had lent, and I thought not <lb/>
proper to mention it.</p>
<p>That day, notwithstanding his promises of payment, <reg orig="pass-|ed">passed</reg> <lb/>
away without hearing from my brother. I had never laid <lb/>
any stress upon the promise, but drew a bad omen from this <lb/>
failure.</p>
<p>A few days elapsed without any material incident. The <lb/>
next occasion on which my brother was introduced into <reg orig="con-|versation">conversation</reg> <lb/>
with Mrs. Fielder, took place one evening after <lb/>
my friend had returned from spending the day abroad. <lb/>
After a pause in which there was more significance than <lb/>
usual&mdash;pray have you seen Frank lately?</p>
<p>I made some vague answer.</p>
<p>He has been talked about this afternoon, very little, as <lb/>
usual, to his advantage.</p>
<p>I trembled from head to foot.</p>
<p>I fear continued she, he is going to ruin, and will drag <lb/>
your father down the same precipice.</p>
<p>Dearest madam! what new circumstance?</p>
<p>Nothing very new. It seems Mr. Frazer&mdash;his wife told <lb/>
the story&mdash;sold him, a twelvemonth ago, a curricle and pair <lb/>
of horses. Part of the money, after some delay, was paid. <lb/>
The rest was dunned for unavailingly a long time. At <lb/>
length curricle and horses scoured the roads under the <reg orig="man-|agement">management</reg> <lb/>
of Mons. Petitgrave, brother to Frank's <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="house-|keeper">house-keeper</reg>,</hi> <lb/>
the handsome mustee. This gave Frazer <reg orig="uneasi-|ness">uneasiness</reg> <lb/>
and some importunity extorted from Frank a note, <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="eaf033v4_0052" pid="uva-lib:350061"/>
which being due <hi rend="italic">last Tuesday</hi> was at Frank's importunity, <lb/>
withdrawn from bank to prevent protest. Next day <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg> <lb/>
it was paid.</p>
<p>I ventured to ask if Mrs. Frazer had mentioned any sum.</p>
<p>Yes; a round sum; <hi rend="italic">five hundred dollars.</hi></p>
<p>Fortunately the dark prevented my mother from <reg orig="perceiv-|ing">perceiving</reg> <lb/>
my confusion. It was Tuesday evening on which I had <lb/>
lent the money to Frank. He had given me reason to <reg orig="be-|lieve">believe</reg> <lb/>
that his embarrassments arose from his cotton-weaving <lb/>
scheme, and that the sum demanded from me was to pay <lb/>
the wages of craving but worthy laborers.</p>
<p>While in the first tumult of these reflections, some one <lb/>
brought a letter. It was from my brother; this was the <lb/>
tenor&mdash;</p>
<p>"I fear, Jane, I have gained but little credit with you <lb/>
for punctuality. I ought to have fulfilled my promise, <lb/>
you will say. I will not excuse my breach of it by saying, <lb/>
(though I might say so, perhaps, with truth,) that you have <lb/>
no use for the money; that I have pressing use for it, and <lb/>
that a small delay, without being of any importance to you, <lb/>
will be particularly convenient to me; no. The true and <lb/>
all sufficient reason why I did not return the money, was&mdash; <lb/>
because I had it not. To convince you that I am really in <lb/>
need, I enclose you a check for another five hundred, which <lb/>
you'll much oblige me by signing. I can repay you both <lb/>
sums together by Saturday&mdash;if you needs must have it so <lb/>
soon. The bearer waits."</p>
<p>In any state of my thoughts, there was little likelihood of <lb/>
my complying with a request made in these terms. With <lb/>
my present feelings, it was difficult to forbear returning an <lb/>
angry and reproachful answer. I sent him back these lines.</p>
<p>"I am thoroughly convinced that it is not in my power to <lb/>
afford you any effectual aid in your present difficulties. It <lb/>
will be very easy to injure myself. The request you make <lb/>
can have no other tendency. I must therefore decline <lb/>
complying."</p>
<p>The facility with which I had yielded up my first <reg orig="resolu-|tions">resolutions</reg>, <lb/>
probably encouraged him to this second application, <lb/>
and I formed very solemn resolutions not to be seduced a <lb/>
second time.</p>
<p>In a few minutes after despatching my answer, he <reg orig="appear-|ed">appeared</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="40" entity="eaf033v4_0053" pid="uva-lib:350062"/>
I need not repeat our conversation. He extorted from <lb/>
me without much difficulty, what I had heard through my <lb/>
mother, and methinks I am ashamed to confess it&mdash;by <reg orig="ex-|changing">exchanging</reg> <lb/>
his boisterous airs for pathetic ones&mdash;by appealing <lb/>
to my sisterly affection, and calling me his angel and <reg orig="sa-|vior">savior</reg>; <lb/>
and especially by solemnly affirming that Frazer's <lb/>
story was a calmny. I, at length, did as he would have <lb/>
me; yet only for <hi rend="italic">three</hi> hundred; I would not go beyond <lb/>
that sum.</p>
<p>The moment he left me, I perceived the weakness and <lb/>
folly of my conduct in the strongest light. I renewed all my <lb/>
prudent determinations; yet strange to tell, within less than <lb/>
a week, the same scene of earnest importunity on his side, <lb/>
and of foolish flexibility on mine was reacted.</p>
<p>With every new instance of folly, my shame and self <reg orig="con-|demnation">condemnation</reg> <lb/>
increased, and the more difficult I found it to <reg orig="dis-|close">disclose</reg> <lb/>
the truth to my mother.</p>
<p>In the course of a very few days, one half of my little <lb/>
property, was gone. A sum sufficient, according to my <lb/>
system of economy, to give me decent independence of the <lb/>
world for, at least, three years, had been dissipated by the <lb/>
prodigality of a profligate woman. At the time, indeed, I <lb/>
was ignorant of this. It was impossible not to pay some <reg orig="re-|gard">regard</reg> <lb/>
to the plausible statements and vehement asseverations <lb/>
of my brother, and to suffer them to weigh something against <lb/>
charges which might possibly be untrue. As soon as <reg orig="acci-|dent">accident</reg> <lb/>
had put me in full possession of the truth on this head, <lb/>
I was no longer thus foolishly obsequious.</p>
<p>The next morning after our last interview I set out as <lb/>
usual, to bid good morrow to my father. My uneasy <lb/>
thoughts led me unaware to extend my walk, till I reached <lb/>
the door of a watch maker with whom my servant had some <lb/>
time before, left a watch to be repaired. It occurred to me <lb/>
that since I was now on the spot, I might as well stop and <lb/>
make some inquiry about it. On entering the shop I almost <lb/>
repented of my purpose, as two persons were within the bar, <lb/>
if I may call it so, seated in a lounging posture, by a small <lb/>
stove, smoking segars and gazing at me with an air of <reg orig="indo-|lent">indolent</reg> <lb/>
impertinence. I determined to make my stay as short <lb/>
as possible, and hurried over a few questions to the artist, <lb/>
who knew me only as the owner of the watch. My <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="eaf033v4_0054" pid="uva-lib:350063"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">5</fw></pb>
was quickly roused by one of the loungers, who, having <lb/>
satisfied his curiosity, by gazing at me, turned to the other <lb/>
and said; well; you have hardly been to Frank's this <lb/>
morning, I suppose?</p>
<p>Indeed, but I have; was the reply.</p>
<p>Why, damn it, you pinch too hard. Well, and what <reg orig="suc-|cess">success</reg>?</p>
<p>Why, what do you think?</p>
<p>Another <hi rend="italic">put-off,</hi> another <hi rend="italic">call-again,</hi> to be sure.</p>
<p>I would not go till he downed with the stuff.</p>
<p>No! (with a broad stare) it an't possible.</p>
<p>Seeing is believing I hope&mdash;producing a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Why so it is. A check&mdash;but&mdash;what's that name?&mdash;let's <lb/>
see, stooping to examine the signature&mdash;"<hi rend="italic">Jane Talbot,</hi>" <lb/>
who the Devil is she?</p>
<p>Don't you know her? She's his sister. A devilish rich <lb/>
girl.</p>
<p>But how? does <hi rend="italic">she</hi> lend him money?</p>
<p>Yes, to be sure. She's his sister you know.</p>
<p>But how does she get money? Is she a widow?</p>
<p>No. She is a girl, I've heard, not eighteen. 'Tis not <lb/>
my look out how she gets money, so as her check's good, <lb/>
and that I'll fix as soon as the door's open.</p>
<p>Why damn it, if I don't think it a forgery. How should <lb/>
such a girl as that get so much money?</p>
<p>Can't conceive. Coax or rob her aunt of it, I suppose. <lb/>
If she's such another as Frank, she is able to outwit the <lb/>
devil. I hope it may be good. If it isn't, he shan't be his <lb/>
own man one day longer.</p>
<p>But how did you succeed so well?</p>
<p>He asked me yesterday, to call once more. So I called, <lb/>
you see, by times, and finding that he had a check for a <lb/>
little more than my debt, I teazed him out of it, promising <lb/>
to give him the balance. I pity the fellow from my soul. <lb/>
It was all for trinkets and furniture bought by that prodigal <lb/>
jade, Mademoiselle Couteau. She would ruin a prince, if <lb/>
she had him as much at her command as she has Frank. <lb/>
Little does the sister know for what purpose she gives her <lb/>
money; however, that, as I said before, be her look out.</p>
<p>During this dialogue, my eye was fixed upon the artist, <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="eaf033v4_0055" pid="uva-lib:350064"/>
who with the watch open in one hand, and a piece of wire <lb/>
in the other, was describing, with great formality, the exact <lb/>
nature of the defect, and the whole process of the cure; <lb/>
but though I looked steadfastly at him, I heard not a syllable <lb/>
of his dissertation. I broke away when his first pause <reg orig="al-|lowed">allowed</reg> <lb/>
me.</p>
<p>The strongest emotion in my heart was resentment. That <lb/>
my name should be prostituted by the foul mouths of such <lb/>
wretches, and my money be squandered for the gratification <lb/>
of a meretricious vagabond, were indignities not to be <reg orig="en-|dured">endured</reg>. <lb/>
I was carried involuntarily towards my brother's <lb/>
house. I had lost all that awe in his presence, and <reg orig="trepi-|dation">trepidation</reg> <lb/>
at his scorn, which had formerly been so troublesome. <lb/>
His sarcasms or revilings had become indifferent to me, as <lb/>
every day's experience had of late convinced me that, in no <lb/>
valuable attribute was he, any wise, superior to his sister. <lb/>
The consciousness of having been deceived and wronged <lb/>
by him, set me above both his anger and his flattery. I <lb/>
was hastening to his house to give vent to my feelings, when <lb/>
a little consideration turned my steps another way. I <reg orig="re-|collected">recollected</reg> <lb/>
that I should probably meet his companion, and <lb/>
that was an encounter which I had hitherto carefully <reg orig="avoid-|ed&mdash;I">avoided&mdash;I</reg> <lb/>
went, according to my first design, to my father's&mdash;I <lb/>
was in hopes of meeting Frank there, some time in the day, <lb/>
or of being visited by him at Mrs. Fielder's.</p>
<p>My soul was in a tumult that unfitted me for conversation. <lb/>
I felt hourly increasing remorse at having concealed my <lb/>
proceedings from my mother. I imagined that had I treated <lb/>
her, from the first, with the confidence due to her, I should <lb/>
have avoided all my present difficulties. Now the obstacles <lb/>
to confidence appeared insurmountable, and my only <reg orig="con-|solation">consolation</reg> <lb/>
was, that by inflexible resolution, I might shun any <lb/>
new cause for humiliation and regret.</p>
<p>I had purposed to spend the greater part of the day at <lb/>
my father's, chiefly in the hope of a meeting with my <reg orig="bro-|ther">brother</reg>, <lb/>
but after dinner, my mother sent for me home. <reg orig="Some-|thing">Something</reg>, <lb/>
methought, very extraordinary, must have happened, <lb/>
as my mother was well; as, according to the messenger's <lb/>
account, she had just parted with a gentleman who seemed <lb/>
to have visited her on private business, my heart <reg orig="mis-|gave">misgave</reg> <lb/>
me.</p>
<pb n="43" entity="eaf033v4_0056" pid="uva-lib:350065"/>
<p>As soon as I got home, my mother took me into her <lb/>
chamber, and told me, after an affecting preface, that a <reg orig="gen-|tleman">gentleman</reg> <lb/>
in office at &mdash; Bank, had called on her and <reg orig="in-|formed">informed</reg> <lb/>
her that checks of my signing to a very large amount <lb/>
had lately been offered, and that the last made its <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
to day, and was presented by a man with whom it <lb/>
was highly disreputable for one in my condition to be <lb/>
thought to have any sort of intercourse.</p>
<p>You may suppose, that after this introduction, I made <lb/>
haste to explain every particular. My mother was <reg orig="sur-|prised">surprised</reg> <lb/>
and grieved. She rebuked me, with some asperity, <lb/>
for my reserves. Had I acquainted her with my brother's demands, she could have apprized me of all that I had since <lb/>
discovered. My brother, she asserted, was involved <reg orig="be-|yond">beyond</reg> <lb/>
any one's power to extricate him, and his temper, his <lb/>
credulity were such, that he was forever doomed to poverty.</p>
<p>I had scarcely parted with my mother, on this occasion, <lb/>
to whom I had promised to refer every future application, <lb/>
when my brother made his appearance. I was prepared <lb/>
to overwhelm him with upbraidings for his past conduct, but <lb/>
found my tongue tied in his presence. I could not bear to <lb/>
inflict so much shame and mortification, and besides, the <lb/>
past being irrevocable, it would only aggravate the <reg orig="disap-|pointment">disappointment</reg> <lb/>
which I was determined every future application <lb/>
should meet with. After some vague apology for non-<reg orig="pay-|ment">payment</reg>, <lb/>
he applied for a new loan. He had borrowed, he <lb/>
said, of a deserving man, a small sum, which he was now <lb/>
unable to repay. The poor fellow was in narrow <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg>; <lb/>
was saddled with a numerous family; had been <lb/>
prevailed upon to lend, after extreme urgency on my <reg orig="bro-|ther's">brother's</reg> <lb/>
part; was now driven to the utmost need, and by a <lb/>
prompt repayment would probably be saved from ruin. A <lb/>
minute and plausible account of the way in which the debt <lb/>
originated, and his inability to repay it shewn to have <reg orig="pro-|ceeded">proceeded</reg> <lb/>
from no fault of his.</p>
<p>I repeatedly endeavored to break off the conversation, <lb/>
by abruptly leaving the room, but he detained me by <reg orig="impor-|tunity">importunity</reg>; <lb/>
by holding my hand; by standing against the door.</p>
<p>How irresistible is supplication! The glossings and <lb/>
plausibilities of eloquence are inexhaustible. I found my <lb/>
courage wavering. After a few ineffectual struggles, I <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="eaf033v4_0057" pid="uva-lib:350066"/>
ceased to contend. He saw that little remained to <reg orig="com-|plete">complete</reg> <lb/>
his conquest, and to effect that little, by convincing <lb/>
me that his tale was true, he stepped out a moment, to <lb/>
bring in his creditor, whose anxiety had caused him to <reg orig="ac-|company">accompany</reg> <lb/>
Frank to the door.</p>
<p>This momentary respite gave me time to reflect. I ran <lb/>
through the door, now no longer guarded; up stairs I flew <lb/>
into my mother's chamber, and told her from what kind of <lb/>
persecution I had escaped.</p>
<p>While I was speaking, some one knocked at the door. <lb/>
It was a servant, despatched by my brother to summon me <lb/>
back. My mother went in my stead. I was left, for some <lb/>
minutes, alone.</p>
<p>So persuasive had been my brother's rhetoric, that I <lb/>
began to regret my flight.</p>
<p>I felt something like compunction at having deprived him <lb/>
of an opportunity to prove his assertions. Every gentle <lb/>
look and insinuating accent reappeared to my memory, and I <lb/>
more than half repented my inflexibility.</p>
<p>While buried in these thoughts, my mother returned. <lb/>
She told me that my brother was gone, after repeatedly <reg orig="re-|questing">requesting</reg> <lb/>
an interview with me, and refusing to explain his <lb/>
business to any other person.</p>
<p>Was there any body with him, madam?</p>
<p>Yes. One Clarges: a jeweller. An ill looking <reg orig="suspi-|cious">suspicious</reg> <lb/>
person.</p>
<p>Do you know any thing of this Clarges?</p>
<p>Nothing, but what I am sorry to know. He is a <reg orig="disso-|lute">dissolute</reg> <lb/>
fellow, who has broken the hearts of two wives, and <lb/>
thrown his children for maintenance on their maternal <reg orig="rela-|tions">relations</reg>. <lb/>
'Tis the same who carried your last check to the bank.</p>
<p>I, just then, faintly recollected the name of Clarges, as <lb/>
having occurred in the conversation at the watchmaker's, <lb/>
and as being the name of him who had produced the paper. <lb/>
This, then, was the person who was to have been introduced <lb/>
to me as the friend in need, the meritorious father of a <lb/>
numerous family, whom the payment of a just debt was to <lb/>
relieve from imminent ruin! How loathsome, how <reg orig="detesta-|ble">detestable</reg>, <lb/>
how insecure, are fraud and treachery. Had he been <lb/>
confronted with me, no doubt he would have recognised the <lb/>
person whom he stared at, at the watchmaker's.</p>
<pb n="45" entity="eaf033v4_0058" pid="uva-lib:350067"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">5*</fw></pb>
<p>Next morning I received a note, dated on the preceding <lb/>
evening. These were the terms of it.</p>
<p>"I am sorry to say, Jane, that the ruin of a father and <lb/>
brother may justly be laid at your door. Not to save them, <lb/>
when the means were in your power, and when entreated to <lb/>
use the means, makes you the author of their ruin. The <lb/>
crisis has come. Had you shewn a little mercy, the crisis <lb/>
might have terminated favorably. As it is, we are undone. <lb/>
You do not deserve to know the place of my retreat. Your <lb/>
unsisterly heart will prompt you to intercept, rather than to <lb/>
aid or connive at my flight. Fly, I must, whither, it is <lb/>
pretty certain, will never come to your knowledge. <reg orig="Fare-|well">Farewell</reg>."</p>
<p>My brother's disappearance, the immediate ruin of my <lb/>
father, whose whole fortune was absorbed by debts <reg orig="contract-|ed">contracted</reg> <lb/>
in his name, and for the most part without his knowledge, <lb/>
the sudden affluence of the adventurer who had suggested <lb/>
his projects to my brother, were the immediate consequences <lb/>
of this event. To a man of my father's habits and views, <lb/>
no calamity can be conceived greater than this. Never did <lb/>
I witness a more sincere grief; a more thorough despair. <lb/>
Every thing he once possessed, was taken away from him <lb/>
and sold. My mother, however, prevented all the most <reg orig="op-|probrious">opprobrious</reg> <lb/>
effects of poverty, and all in my power to alleviate <lb/>
his solitude, and console him in his distress, was done.</p>
<p>Would you have thought, after this simple relation, that <lb/>
there was any room for malice and detraction to build up <lb/>
their inventions?</p>
<p>My brother was enraged that I refused to comply with <lb/>
any of his demands; not grateful for the instances in which <lb/>
I did comply. Clarges resented the disappointment of his <lb/>
scheme as much as if honor and integrity had given him a <lb/>
title to success.</p>
<p>How many times has the story been told, and with what <lb/>
variety of exaggeration, that the sister refused to lend her <lb/>
brother money, when she had plenty at command, and when <lb/>
a seasonable loan would have prevented the ruin of her <lb/>
family, while, at the same time, she had such an appetite for <lb/>
toys and baubles, that ere yet she was eighteen years old, <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="eaf033v4_0059" pid="uva-lib:350068"/>
she ran in debt to Clarges the Jeweller, for upwards of five <lb/>
hundred dollars worth.</p>
<p>You are the only person to whom I have thought myself <lb/>
bound to tell the whole truth. I do not think my reluctance <lb/>
to draw the follies of my brother from oblivion, a culpable <lb/>
one. I am willing to rely, for my justification from malicious <lb/>
charges, on the general tenor of my actions, and am <reg orig="scarce-|ly">scarcely</reg> <lb/>
averse to buy my brother's reputation at the cost of my <lb/>
own. The censure of the undistinguishing and <reg orig="undistin-|guished">undistinguished</reg> <lb/>
multitude, gives me little uneasiness. Indeed the <lb/>
disapprobation of those who have no particular connexion <lb/>
with us, is a very faint, dubious, and momentary feeling. <lb/>
We are thought of, now and then, by chance, and <reg orig="immedi-|ately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
forgotten. Their happiness is unaffected by the <reg orig="sen-|tence">sentence</reg> <lb/>
casually pronounced on us, and we suffer nothing <lb/>
since it scarcely reaches our ears, and the interval between <lb/>
the judge and the culprit, hinders it from having any <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg> <lb/>
on their actions. Not so, when the censure reaches <lb/>
those who love us. The charge engrosses their attention, <lb/>
influences their happiness, and regulates their deportment <lb/>
towards us. My self-regard, and my regard for you, equally <lb/>
leads me to vindicate myself to you, from any charge, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg> <lb/>
chimerical or obsolete it may be.</p>
<p>My brother went to France. He seemed disposed to <lb/>
forget that he ever had kindred or country; never informed <lb/>
us of his situation and views. All our tidings of him came <lb/>
to us indirectly. In this way we heard that he procured a <lb/>
commission in the republican troops, had made some <reg orig="fortu-|nate">fortunate</reg> <lb/>
campaigns, and had enriched himself by lucky <reg orig="specula-|tions">speculations</reg> <lb/>
in the forfeited estates.</p>
<p>My mother was informed, by some one lately returned <lb/>
from Paris, that Frank had attained possession of the whole <lb/>
property of an emigrant Compte de Puysegur, who was far <lb/>
from being the poorest of the ancient nobles; that he lived, <lb/>
with princely luxury in the Count's hotel; that he had <reg orig="mar-|ried">married</reg>, <lb/>
according to the new mode, the Compte's sister, and <lb/>
was, probably, for the remainder of his life, a Frenchman. <lb/>
He is attentive to his countrymen, and this reporter partook <lb/>
of several entertainments at his house.</p>
<p>Methinks the memory of past incidents must sometimes <lb/>
intrude upon his thoughts. Can he have utterly forgotten <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="eaf033v4_0060" pid="uva-lib:350069"/>
the father whom he reduced to indigence; whom he sent to <lb/>
a premature grave? Amidst his present opulence one <lb/>
would think it would occur to him to inquire into the effects <lb/>
of his misconduct, not only to his own family but on others.</p>
<p>What a strange diversity there is among human characters. <lb/>
Frank is, I question not, gay, volatile, impetuous as ever. <lb/>
The jovial carousal and the sound sleep are never molested, <lb/>
I dare say, by the remembrance of the incidents I have <reg orig="re-|lated">related</reg> <lb/>
to you.</p>
<p>Methinks, had I the same heavy charges to make against <lb/>
my conscience, I should find no refuge but death, from the <lb/>
goadings of remorse. To have abandoned a father to the <lb/>
gaol or the hospital, or to the charity of strangers; a father <lb/>
too who had yielded him an affection and a trust without <lb/>
limits; to have wronged a sister out of the little property on <lb/>
which she relied for support, to her unprotected youth or <lb/>
helpless age. A sister who was virtually an orphan; who <lb/>
had no natural claim upon her present patroness, but might <lb/>
be dismissed pennyless from the house that sheltered her, <lb/>
without exposing the self-constituted mother to any reproach.</p>
<p>And has not this event taken place already? What can <lb/>
I expect but that, at <hi rend="italic">least,</hi> it will take place as soon as she <lb/>
hears of my resolution with regard to thee? She ought to <lb/>
know it immediately. I myself ought to tell it, and this was <lb/>
one of the tasks which I designed to perform in your absence; <lb/>
yet, alas! know not how to set about it.</p>
<p>My fingers are for once thoroughly weary. I must lay <lb/>
down the pen&mdash;But first&mdash;why don't I hear from you? <lb/>
Every day since Sunday, when you left me, have I <reg orig="de-|spatched">despatched</reg> <lb/>
an enormous packet; and have not received a <reg orig="sen-|tence">sentence</reg> <lb/>
in answer. 'Tis not well done, my friend, to forget <lb/>
and neglect me thus. You gave me some reason, indeed, <lb/>
to expect no very sudden tidings from you, but there is <reg orig="in-|expiable">inexpiable</reg> <lb/>
treason in the silence of four long days. If you do <lb/>
not offer substantial excuses for this delay, wo be to thee.</p>
<p>Take this letter, and expect not another syllable from my <lb/>
pen till I hear from you.</p>

<head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">To Henry Colden.</hi></head>
<opener>
<dateline>Thursday Night.</dateline>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">What</hi> a little thing subverts my peace; dissipates my <lb/>
resolutions:&mdash;am I not an honest, foolish creature, Hal? I <lb/>
uncover this wayward heart to thy view as promptly as if <lb/>
the disclosure had no tendency to impair thy esteem, and <lb/>
forfeit thy love; that is, to devote me to death; to ruin me <lb/>
beyond redemption.</p>
<p>And yet, if the unveiling of my follies should have this <lb/>
effect, I think I should despise thee for stupidity, and hate <lb/>
thee for ingratitude; for whence proceed my irresolution, <lb/>
my vicissitudes of purpose, but from my love, and, that man's <lb/>
heart must be made of strange stuff that can abhor or <reg orig="con-|temn">contemn</reg> <lb/>
a woman for loving him too much. Of such stuff the <lb/>
heart of my friend, thank heaven, is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> made. Though I <lb/>
love him far&mdash;<hi rend="italic">far</hi> too much, he will not trample on, or scof <lb/>
at me.</p>
<p>But how my pen rambles.&mdash;No wonder! for my <reg orig="intel-|lects">intellects</reg> <lb/>
are in a strange confusion. There is an acute pain <lb/>
just here. Give me your hand and let me put it on the <lb/>
very spot. Alas! there is no dear hand within my reach. <lb/>
I remember feeling just such a pain but once before. Then <lb/>
you chanced to be seated by my side. I put your hand to <lb/>
the spot, and, strange to tell, a moment after, I looked for <lb/>
the pain and 'twas gone&mdash;utterly vanished! Cannot I <reg orig="ima-|gine">imagine</reg> <lb/>
so strongly as to experience that relief which your <lb/>
hand pressed to my forehead would give? Let me lay <lb/>
down the pen and try.</p>
<p>Ah! my friend! when present, thou'rt an excellent <reg orig="phy-|sician">physician</reg>, <lb/>
but as thy presence is my cure, so thy absence is my <lb/>
only, my fatal malady.</p>
<p>My desk is, of late, always open; my paper spread; my <lb/>
pen moist. I must talk to you, though you give me no <lb/>
answer, though I have nothing but gloomy forebodings to <lb/>
communicate, or mournful images to call up. I must talk <lb/>
to you, even when you cannot hear; when invisible; when <lb/>
distant many a mile. It is some relief even to corporeal <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="eaf033v4_0062" pid="uva-lib:350071"/>
agonies. Even the pain, which I just now complained of, is <lb/>
lessened since I took up the pen&mdash;O! Hal! Hal! If you <lb/>
ever prove ungrateful or a traitor to me, and there be a <lb/>
state retributive hereafter, terrible will be thy punishment.</p>
<p>But why do I talk to thee thus wildly? why deal I in <lb/>
such rueful prognostics? I want to tell you why, for I have <lb/>
a reason for my present alarms; they all spring from one <lb/>
source&mdash;my doubts of thy fidelity. Yes, Henry, since <lb/>
your arrival at Wilmington, you have been a frequent <reg orig="visit-|ant">visitant</reg> <lb/>
of Miss Secker, and have kept a profound silence <reg orig="to-|wards">towards</reg> <lb/>
me.</p>
<p>Nothing can be weaker and more silly than these <reg orig="dis-|quiets">disquiets</reg>. <lb/>
Cannot my friend visit a deserving woman a few <lb/>
times, but my terrors must impertinently intrude.&mdash;Cannot <lb/>
he forget the pen, and fail to write to me, for half a week <lb/>
together, but my rash resentments must conjure up the <lb/>
phantoms of ingratitude and perfidy.</p>

letter my relief from every disquiet. I believe, and do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> <lb/>

with a thousand mischiefs, or is fair and innocent, according <lb/>
to my reigning temper.&mdash;Adieu; but let me hear from you <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I thought</hi> I had convinced my friend, that a letter from <lb/>
me ought not to be expected earlier than Monday. I left <lb/>
her to gratify no fickle humor, or because my chief pleasure <lb/>
lay any where but in her company. She knew of my <reg orig="de-|sign">design</reg> <lb/>
to make some stay at this place, and that the <lb/>
business that occasioned my stay would leave me no leisure <lb/>
to write.</p>
<pb n="50" entity="eaf033v4_0063" pid="uva-lib:350072"/>
<p>Is it possible that my visits to Miss Secker have given <lb/>
you any concern? why must the source of your anxiety be <lb/>
always so mortifying and opprobrious to me? that the <reg orig="ab-|sence">absence</reg> <lb/>
of a few days, and the company of another woman <lb/>
should be thought to change my sentiments, and make me <lb/>
secretly recant those vows which I offered to you, is an <reg orig="im-|putation">imputation</reg> <lb/>
on my common sense which&mdash;I suppose I deserve. <lb/>
You judge of me from what you know of me. How can you <lb/>
do otherwise? If my past conduct naturally creates such <reg orig="sus-|picions">suspicions</reg>, <lb/>
who am I to blame but myself? Reformation should <lb/>
precede respect, and how should I gain confidence in my <lb/>
integrity, but as the fruit of perseverance in well doing.</p>
<p>Alas! how much has he lost who has forfeited his own <lb/>
esteem?</p>
<p>As to Miss Secker, your ignorance of her, and, I may <lb/>
add, of yourself, has given her the preference. You think <lb/>
her your superior, no doubt, in every estimable and <reg orig="attrac-|tive">attractive</reg> <lb/>
quality, and therefore suspect her influence on a being <lb/>
so sensual and volatile as poor Hal. Were she really more <lb/>
lovely, the faithless and giddy wretch might possibly forget <lb/>
you, but Miss Secker is a woman whose mind and perses <lb/>
are not only inferior to yours, but wholly unfitted to inspire <lb/>
love. If it were possible to smile in my present mood, I <lb/>
think I should indulge <hi rend="italic">one smile</hi> at the thought of falling in <lb/>
love with a woman who has scarcely had education enough <lb/>
to enable her to write her name; who has been confined <lb/>
to her bed about eighteen months, by a rheumatism <reg orig="con-|tracted">contracted</reg> <lb/>
by too assiduous application to the wash-tub, and <lb/>
who often boasts, that she was born, not above forty-five <lb/>
years ago, in an upper story of the mansion at Mount <lb/>
Vernon.</p>
<p>You do not tell me who it was that betrayed me to you <lb/>
I suspect, however, it was Miss Jessup. She was passing <lb/>
through this town, in her uncle's carriage, on Wednesday, <lb/>
on her way home. Seeing me come out of the poor <reg orig="wo-|man's">woman's</reg> <lb/>
lodgings, she stopped the coach, prated for five <reg orig="min-|utes">minutes</reg>, <lb/>
and left me with ironical menaces of telling you of my <lb/>
frequent visits to a single lady, of whom it appeared that <lb/>
she had some knowledge. Thus you see that your disquiets <lb/>
have had no foundation but in the sportive malice of your <lb/>
talkative neighbor.</p>
<pb n="51" entity="eaf033v4_0064" pid="uva-lib:350073"/>
<p>Hannah Secker chanced to be talked of at Mr. <reg orig="Hen-|shaw's">Henshaw's</reg> <lb/>
as a poor creature, who was sick and destitute, and <lb/>
lay, almost deserted, in a neighboring hovel. She existed <lb/>
on charity, which was the more scanty and reluctant, as <lb/>
she bore but an indifferent character either for honesty or <lb/>
gratitude.</p>
<p>The name, when first mentioned, struck my ear as <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
that had once been familiar, and, in my solitary <reg orig="even-|ing">evening</reg> <lb/>
walk, I stopped at her cottage. The sight of her, though <lb/>
withered by age and disease, called her fully to mind. <lb/>
Three years ago, she lived in the city, and had been very <lb/>
serviceable to me in the way of her calling. I had <reg orig="dismiss-|ed">dismissed</reg> <lb/>
her, however, after receiving several proofs that a pair <lb/>
of silk stockings and a muslin cravat, offered too mighty a <lb/>
temptation for her virtue. You know I have but little <lb/>
money to spare from my own necessities, and all the service <lb/>
I could render her, was to be her petitioner and advocate <lb/>
with some opulent families in this place.&mdash;But enough, and <lb/>
too much of Hannah Secker.</p>
<p>Need I say that I have read your narrative, and that I <lb/>
fully acquit you of the guilt laid to your charge. That was <lb/>
done, indeed, before I heard your defence, and I was <reg orig="anx-|ious">anxious</reg> <lb/>
to hear your story, merely because all that relates to <lb/>
you is, in the highest degree, interesting to me.</p>
<p>This letter, notwithstanding my engagements, should be <lb/>
longer, if I were not in danger, by writing on, of losing the <lb/>
post. So, dearest love, farewell, and tell me in your next, <lb/>
which I shall expect on Tuesday, that every pain has <reg orig="van-|ished">vanished</reg> <lb/>
from your head and from your heart. You may as <lb/>
well delay writing to your mother till I return. I hope it <lb/>
will be permitted me to do so very shortly. Again, my only <lb/>
friend, farewell.</p>

<dateline><name type="place">Philadelphia,</name> Monday, October 11.</dateline>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I am</hi> ashamed of myself, Henry. What an inconsistent <lb/>
creature am I? I have just placed this dear letter of yours <lb/>
next my heart. The sensation it affords, at this moment, is <lb/>
delicious; almost as much so as I once experienced from a <lb/>
certain somebody's hand, placed on the same spot. But <lb/>
that somebody's hand was never (if I recollect aright) so <lb/>
highly honored as this paper. Have I not told you that your <lb/>
letter is deposited <hi rend="italic">next</hi> my heart?</p>
<p>And with all these proofs of the pleasure your letter <lb/>
affords me, could you guess at the cause of those tears <lb/>
which even now, have not ceased flowing? your letter has <lb/>
so little tenderness&mdash;is so <hi rend="italic">very</hi> cold&mdash;but let me not be <reg orig="un-|grateful">ungrateful</reg> <lb/>
for the preference you grant me, merely because it <lb/>
is not so enthusiastic and unlimited as my own.</p>
<p>I suppose, if I had not extorted from you some account <lb/>
of this poor woman, I should never have heard a syllable <lb/>
of your meeting with her. It is surely possible for people <lb/>
to be their own calumniators, to place their own actions in <lb/>
the worst light; to exaggerate their faults and conceal their <lb/>
virtues. If the fictions and artifices of vanity be <reg orig="detesta-|ble">detestable</reg>, <lb/>
the concealment of our good actions is surely not <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
guilt. The conviction of our guilt is painful to those <lb/>
that love us; wantonly and needlessly to give this pain is <lb/>
very perverse and unjustifiable. If a contrary deportment <lb/>
argue vanity, self-detraction seems to be the offspring of <lb/>
pride.</p>
<p>Thou art the strangest of men, Henry. Thy whole <lb/>
conduct, with regard to me has been a tissue of self-<reg orig="up-|braidings">upbraidings</reg>. <lb/>
You have disclosed not only a thousand <reg orig="mis-|deeds">misdeeds</reg> <lb/>
(as you have thought them) which could not possibly <lb/>
have come to my knowledge by any other means, but have <lb/>
labored to ascribe even your commendable actions to evil to <lb/>
ambiguous motives. Motives are impenetrable, and a <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg> <lb/>
cases have occurred in which every rational observe <lb/>
would have supposed you to be influenced by the best <reg orig="mo-|tives">motives</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="53" entity="eaf033v4_0066" pid="uva-lib:350075"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">6</fw></pb>
but where, if credit be due to your own <reg orig="representa-|tions">representations</reg>, <lb/>
your motives were far from being laudable.</p>
<p>Why is my esteem rather heightened than depressed by <lb/>
this deportment. In truth, there is no crime which remorse <lb/>
will not expiate, and no more shining virtue in the whole <lb/>
catalogue than sincerity. Besides, your own account of <lb/>
yourself, with all the exaggerations of humility, proved you, <lb/>
on the whole, and with the allowances necessarily made by <lb/>
every candid person, to be a very excellent man.</p>
<p>Your deportment to me ought chiefly to govern my <lb/>
opinion of you, and have you not been uniformly <reg orig="gene-|rous">generous</reg>, <lb/>
sincere and upright? not quite passionate enough, <lb/>
perhaps; no blind and precipitate enthusiast; love has not <lb/>
banished discretion, or blindfolded your sagacity, and as <lb/>
I should forgive a thousand errors on the score of love, I <lb/>
cannot fervently applaud that wisdom which tramples upon <lb/>
love. Thou hast a thousand excellent qualities, Henry, that <lb/>
is certain, yet a little more impetuosity and fervor in thy <lb/>
tenderness would compensate for the want of the whole <lb/>
thousand. <hi rend="italic">There</hi> is a frank confession for thee! I am <reg orig="con-|founded">confounded</reg> <lb/>
at my own temerity in making it. Will it not <reg orig="in-|jure">injure</reg> <lb/>
me, in thy esteem, and of all evils which it is possible <lb/>
for me to suffer, the loss of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> esteem would soonest <lb/>
drive me to desperation.</p>
<p>The world has been liberal of its censure, but surely a <lb/>
thorough knowledge of my conduct could not condemn me. <lb/>
When my father and mother united their entreaties to those <lb/>
of Talbot, my heart had never known a preference. The <lb/>
man of their choice was perfectly indifferent to me, but <lb/>
every individual of his sex was regarded with no less <reg orig="indif-|ference">indifference</reg>. <lb/>
I did not conceal from him the state of my <reg orig="feel-|ings">feelings</reg>, <lb/>
but was always perfectly ingenuous and explicit. <lb/>
Talbot acted like every man in love. He was eager to <lb/>
secure me on these terms, and fondly trusted to his <reg orig="ten-|derness">tenderness</reg> <lb/>
and perseverance, to gain those affections, which I <lb/>
truly acknowledged to be free. He would not leave me for <lb/>
his European voyage till he had extorted a solemn promise.</p>
<p>During his absence, I met you. The nature of those <lb/>
throbs, which a glance of your very shadow was sure to <lb/>
produce, even previous to the exchange of a single word <lb/>
<pb n="54" entity="eaf033v4_0067" pid="uva-lib:350076"/>
between us, was entirely unknown to me. I had no <reg orig="ex-|perience">experience</reg> <lb/>
to guide me. The effects of that intercourse <lb/>
which I took such pains to procure, could not be foreseen. <lb/>
My heart was too pure to admit even such a guest as <reg orig="ap-|prehension">apprehension</reg>, <lb/>
and the only information I possessed <reg orig="respect-|ing">respecting</reg> <lb/>
you, impressed me with the notion that your heart <reg orig="al-|ready">already</reg> <lb/>
belonged to another.</p>
<p>I sought nothing but your society and your esteem. If <lb/>
the fetters of my promise to Talbot, became irksome after <lb/>
my knowledge of you, I was unconscious of the true cause. <lb/>
This promise never for a moment lost its obligation with me. <lb/>
I deemed myself as much the wife of Talbot, as if I had <lb/>
stood with him at the altar.</p>
<p>At the prospect of his return, my melancholy was <reg orig="ex-|cruciating">excruciating</reg>, <lb/>
but the cause was unknown to me. I had <lb/>
nothing to wish, with regard to you, but to see you <reg orig="occa-|sionally">occasionally</reg>; <lb/>
to hear your voice, and to be told that you were <lb/>
happy. It never occurred to me that Talbot's return would <lb/>
occasion any difference in this respect. Conscious of <reg orig="no-|thing">nothing</reg> <lb/>
but rectitude in my regard for you; always frank and <lb/>
ingenuous in disclosing my feelings, I imagined that Talbot <lb/>
would adopt you as warmly for his friend as I had done.</p>
<p>I must grant that I erred in this particular, but my error <lb/>
sprung from ignorance unavoidable. I judged of others by <lb/>
my own heart and very sillily imagined that Talbot would <lb/>
continue to be satisfied with that cold and friendly regard <lb/>
for which only my vows made me answerable&mdash;Yet my <lb/>
husband's jealousies and discontents were not unreasonable. <lb/>
He loved me with passion, and if that sentiment can <reg orig="en-|dure">endure</reg> <lb/>
to be unrequited, it will never tolerate the preference <lb/>
of another, even if that preference be less than love.</p>
<p>In compliance with my husband's wishes&mdash;Ah! my <lb/>
friend! why cannot I say that I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> comply with them; what <lb/>
a fatal act is that of plighting hands, when the heart is <reg orig="es-|tranged">estranged</reg>. <lb/>
Never, never let the placable and compassionate <lb/>
spirit, be seduced into a union, to which the affections are <lb/>
averse. Let it not confide in the after birth of love. Such <lb/>
a union is the direst cruelty even to the object who is <reg orig="in-|tended">intended</reg> <lb/>
to be benefited.</p>
<p>I have not yet thoroughly forgiven you for deserting me. <lb/>
My heart swells with anguish at the thought of your setting <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="eaf033v4_0068" pid="uva-lib:350077"/>
more lightly by my resentment than by that of another; of <lb/>
your willingness to purchase any one's happiness at the cost <lb/>
of mine. You are too wise; too dispassionate by far. <lb/>
Don't despise me for this accusation, Henry, you know my <lb/>
unbiassed judgment has always been with you. Repeated <lb/>
proofs have convinced me that my dignity and happiness <lb/>
are safer in your keeping than in my own.</p>
<p>You guess right, my friend. Miss Jessup told me of your <lb/>
visits to this poor sick woman. There is something <reg orig="myste-|rious">mysterious</reg> <lb/>
in the character of this Polly Jessup. She is <reg orig="particu-|larly">particularly</reg> <lb/>
solicitous about every thing which relates to you. It has <lb/>
occurred to me, since reading your letter, that she is not <lb/>
entirely without design in her prattle. Something more, <lb/>
methinks, more than the mere tatling, gossipping, inquisitive <lb/>
propensity, in the way in which she introduces you into <lb/>
conversation.</p>
<p>She had not alighted ten minutes before she ran into my <lb/>
apartment, with a face full of intelligence. The truth <reg orig="re-|specting">respecting</reg> <lb/>
the washwoman was very artfully disguised, and <lb/>
yet so managed as to allow her to elude the imputation of <lb/>
direct falsehood. She will, no doubt, in this, as in former <lb/>
cases, cover up all under the appearance of a good natured <lb/>
jest; yet, if she be in jest, there is more of malice, I <reg orig="sus-|pect">suspect</reg>, <lb/>
than of good nature in her merriment.</p>
<p>Make haste back, my dear Hal. I cannot bear to keep <lb/>
my mother in ignorance of our resolutions, and I am utterly <lb/>
at a loss in what manner to communicate them, so as to <lb/>
awaken the least reluctance. O! what would be wanting <lb/>
to my felicity if my mother could be won over to my side. <lb/>
And is so inestimable a good utterly hopeless. Come, my <lb/>
friend, and dictate such a letter as may subdue those <reg orig="pre-|judices">prejudices</reg>, <lb/>
which, while they continue to exist, will permit me <lb/>
to choose only among deplorable evils.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I have</hi> just heard something which has made me very <lb/>
uneasy. I am afraid of seeming to you impertinent. You <lb/>
have declared your resolution to persist in conduct which <lb/>
my judgment disapproved. I have argued with you and <lb/>
admonished you, hitherto, in vain, and you have (tacitly <lb/>
indeed) rejected my interference; yet I cannot forbear <reg orig="of-|fering">offering</reg> <lb/>
you my counsel once more.</p>
<p>To say truth, it is not so much with a view to change your <lb/>
resolution, that I now write, as to be informed what your <lb/>
resolution is. I have heard what I cannot believe, yet, <reg orig="con-|sidering">considering</reg> <lb/>
your former conduct, I have misgivings that I <reg orig="can-|not">cannot</reg> <lb/>
subdue. Strangely as you have acted of late I am <reg orig="wil-|ing">wiling</reg> <lb/>
to think you incapable of what is laid to your charge. <lb/>
In few words, Jane, they tell me that you mean to be <reg orig="ac-|tually">actually</reg> <lb/>
married to Colden.</p>
<p>You know what I think of that young man. You know <lb/>
my objections to the conduct you thought proper to pursue <lb/>
in relation to Colden, in your husband's life-time. You will <lb/>
judge then with what emotions such intelligence was <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg>.</p>
<p>Indiscreet as you have been, there are, I hope, bounds <lb/>
which your education will not permit you to pass. Some <lb/>
regard, I hope, you will have for your own reputation. If <lb/>
your conscience object not to this proceeding, the dread of <lb/>
infamy, at least, will check your career.</p>
<p>You may think that I speak harshly, and that I ought to <lb/>
wait, at least, till I knew your resolution, before I spoke of <lb/>
it in such terms; but if this report be groundless, my <reg orig="cen-|sures">censures</reg> <lb/>
cannot affect you. If it be true, they may serve, I <lb/>
hope, to deter you from persisting in your scheme.</p>
<p>What more can I say? You are my nearest relation; not <lb/>
my daughter, it is true, but, since I have not any other <lb/>
kindred, you are more than a daughter to me. That love, <lb/>
which a numerous family or kindred would divide among <lb/>
themselves, is all collected and centered in you. The ties <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="eaf033v4_0070" pid="uva-lib:350079"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">6*</fw></pb>
between us have long ceased to be artificial ones, and I <lb/>
feel, in all respects, as if you actually owed your being to <lb/>
me.</p>
<p>You have hitherto consulted my pleasure but little. I <lb/>
have all the rights, in regard to you, of a mother, but these <lb/>
have been hitherto despised or unacknowledged. I once <lb/>
regarded you as the natural successor to my property, and <lb/>
though your conduct has forfeited these claims, I now tell <lb/>
you, and you know that my word is sacred, that all I have <lb/>
shall be yours, on condition that Colden is dismissed.</p>
<p>More than this I will do. Every assurance possible I <lb/>
will give, that all shall be yours at my death, and all I have, <lb/>
I will share with you, <hi rend="italic">equally,</hi> while I live. Only give me <lb/>
your word that, <hi rend="italic">as soon</hi> as the transfer is made, Colden <lb/>
shall be thought of and conversed with, either personally <lb/>
or by letter, no more. I want only your promise; on that <lb/>
I will absolutely rely.</p>
<p>Mere lucre ought not, perhaps, to influence you, in such <lb/>
a case, and if you comply, through regard to my peace, or <lb/>
your own reputation, I shall certainly esteem you more <reg orig="high-|ly">highly</reg> <lb/>
than if you are determined by the present offer, yet, such <lb/>
is my aversion to this alliance, that the hour in which I hear <lb/>
of your consent to the conditions which I now propose to <lb/>
you, will be esteemed one of the happiest of my life.</p>
<p>Think of it, my dear Jane, my friend, my child, think <lb/>
of it. Take time to reflect, and let me have a deliberate <lb/>
answer, such as will remove the fears that at present afflict, <lb/>
beyond my power of expression, your</p>

but is anxious to discover which path has fewest thorns, and <lb/>
in which her duty will allow her to walk.</p>
<p>How greatly do you humble me! and how strongly evince <lb/>

half your property. How low am I fallen in your <lb/>

Lay me not under the cruel necessity of shutting my door <lb/>

<p>After reading your letter, and seeing full proof of your <reg orig="in-|fatuation">infatuation</reg>, <lb/>
I resolved to throw away my care no longer upon <lb/>
you. To think no more of you. To act just as if you <lb/>
never had existence. Whenever it was possible, to shun <lb/>
you. When I met you, by chance, or perforce, to treat you <lb/>
merely as a stranger. I write this letter to acquaint you <lb/>

for they shall all be returned to you unopened.</p>

<p>I know you better than to trust to the appearance of half <lb/>
yielding reluctance which your letter contains. Thus it has <lb/>
always been, and as often as this duteous strain flattered me <lb/>
with hopes of winning you to reason, have I been deceived <lb/>
and disappointed.</p>
<p>I trust to your discernment; your seeming humility no <lb/>
longer. No child are you of mine. You have, <reg orig="hence-|forth">henceforth</reg>, <lb/>
no part in my blood, and may I very soon forget that <lb/>
so lost and betrayed a wretch ever belonged to it.</p>
<p>I charge you, write not to me again.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Impossible</hi>! Are you not my mother? more to me than <lb/>
any mother. Did I not receive your protection and <reg orig="instruc-|tion">instruction</reg> <lb/>
in my infancy and my childhood? When left an <reg orig="or-|phan">orphan</reg> <lb/>
by my own mother, your bosom was open to receive <lb/>
me. <hi rend="italic">There</hi> was the helpless babe cherished, and there was <lb/>
it taught all that virtue, which it has since endeavored to <reg orig="pre-|serve">preserve</reg> <lb/>
unimpaired in every trial.</p>
<p>You must not cast me off. You must not hate me. <lb/>
You must not call me ungrateful and a wretch. Not to <lb/>
have merited these names is all that enables me to endure <lb/>
your displeasure. As long as that belief consoles me, my <lb/>
heart will not break.</p>
<p>Yet that, even that, will not much avail me. The <reg orig="dis-|tress">distress</reg> <lb/>
that I now feel, that I have felt ever since the receipt <lb/>
of your letter cannot be increased.</p>
<p>You forbid me to write to you, but I cannot forbear as <lb/>
long as there is hope of extorting from you the cause of <lb/>
your aversion to my friend. I solicit not this disclosure <lb/>
with a view or even in the hope of repelling your objections. <lb/>
I want, I had almost said, I <hi rend="italic">want</hi> to share your antipathies. <lb/>
I want only to be justified in obeying you. When known, <lb/>
they will, perhaps, be found sufficient. I conjure you, once <lb/>
more, tell me your objections to this marriage.</p>
<pb n="61" entity="eaf033v4_0074" pid="uva-lib:350083"/>
<p>As well as I can, I have examined myself. Passion <lb/>
may influence me, but I am unconscious of its influence. I <lb/>
think I act with no exclusive regard to my own pleasure, <lb/>
but as it flows from and is dependent on the happiness of <lb/>
others.</p>
<p>If I am mistaken in my notions of duty, God forbid that <lb/>
I should shut my ears against good counsel. Instead of <lb/>
loathing or shunning it, I am anxious to hear it. I know <lb/>
my own short sighted folly; my slight experience. I know <lb/>
how apt I am to go astray. How often my own heart <reg orig="de-|ceives">deceives</reg> <lb/>
me, and hence I always am in search of better <lb/>
knowledge; hence I listen to admonition, not only with <reg orig="do-|cility">docility</reg> <lb/>
but gratitude. My inclination ought, perhaps to be <lb/>
absolutely neuter, but if I know myself, it is with reluctance <lb/>
that I withhold my assent from the expostulator. I am <reg orig="de-|lighted">delighted</reg> <lb/>
to receive conviction from the arguments of those <lb/>
that love me.</p>
<p>In this case, I am prepared to hear and weigh, and be <lb/>
convinced by any thing you think proper to urge.</p>
<p>I ask not pardon for my faults, nor compassion on my <lb/>
frailty. That I love Colden I will not deny, but I love his <lb/>
worth; his merits real or imaginary enrapture my soul. <lb/>
Ideal his virtues may be, but to me they are real, and the <lb/>
moment they cease to be so, that the illusion disappears, I <lb/>
cease to love him, or, at least, I will do all that is in my power <lb/>
to do. I will forbear all intercourse or correspondence with <lb/>
him&mdash;for his, as well as my own sake.</p>
<p>Tell me then, my mother, what you know of him. <lb/>
What heinous offence has he committed, that makes him <lb/>
unworthy of my regard.</p>
<p>You have raised, without knowing it, perhaps, or <reg orig="de-|signing">designing</reg> <lb/>
to effect it in this way, a bar to this detested <reg orig="alli-|ance">alliance</reg>. <lb/>
While you declare, that Colden has been guilty of <lb/>
base actions, it is impossible to grant him my esteem as fully <lb/>
as a husband should claim. Till I know what the actions <lb/>
are which you impute to him, I never will bind myself to <lb/>
him by indissoluble bands.</p>
<p>I have told him this and he joins with me to entreat you <lb/>
to communicate your charges to me. He believes that you <lb/>
are misled by some misapprehension; some slander. He <lb/>
is conscious that many of his actions have been, in some <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="eaf033v4_0075" pid="uva-lib:350084"/>
respects, ambiguous, capable of being mistaken by careless, <lb/>
or distant, or prejudiced observers. He believes that you <lb/>
have been betrayed into some fatal error in relation to <unclear id="u1"/> <lb/>
action of his life.</p>
<p>If this be so, he wishes only to be told his fault, and will <lb/>
spare no time and no pains to remove your mistake, if you <lb/>
should appear to be mistaken.</p>
<p>How easily, my good mamma, may the most discerning <lb/>
and impartial be misled! The ignorant and envious have <lb/>
no choice between truth and error. Their tales must want <lb/>
something to complete it, or must possess more than the <lb/>
truth demands. Something you have heard of my friend <lb/>
injurious to his good name, and you condemn him unheard.</p>
<p>Yet this displeases me not. I am not anxious for his <lb/>
justification, but only to know so much as will authorize me <lb/>
to conform to your wishes.</p>
<p>You warn me against this marriage for my own sake. <lb/>
You think it will be disastrous to me.&mdash;The reasons of this <lb/>
apprehension would, you think, appear just in my eyes <lb/>
should they be disclosed, yet you will not disclose then, <lb/>
Without disclosure I cannot,&mdash;as a rational creature, I <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="can-|not">cannot</reg></hi> <lb/>
change my resolution. If then I marry and the ed <lb/>
come that is threatened, whom have I to blame? at whose <lb/>
door must my misfortunes be laid if not at her's, who had <lb/>
it in her power to prevent the evil and would not?</p>
<p>Your treatment of me can proceed only from your love, <lb/>
and yet all the fruits of the direst enmity may grow out of <lb/>
it. By untimely concealments may my peace be forfeited <lb/>
forever. Judge then between your obligations to me, and <lb/>
those of secrecy, into which you seem to have entered with <lb/>
another.</p>
<p>My happiness, my future conduct are in your hand. <lb/>
Mould them; govern them as you think proper. I have <lb/>
pointed out the means, and once more conjure you, by the <lb/>
love which you once bore; which you still bear to me, to <lb/>
use them.</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Insolent</hi> creature that thou art, Jane, and cunning as <lb/>
insolent! To elude my just determination by such an <reg orig="ar-|tifice">artifice</reg>! <lb/>
To counterfeit a strange hand in the direction of <lb/>
thy letter, that I might thereby be induced to open it.</p>
<p>Thou wilt not rest, I see, till thou hast torn from my heart <lb/>
every root; every fibre of my once cherished tenderness; <lb/>
till thou hast laid my head low in the grave. To number <lb/>
the tears and the pangs which thy depravity has already <lb/>
cost me&mdash;but thy last act is destined to surpass all former <lb/>
ones.</p>
<p>Thy perseverance in wickedness, thy inflexible imposture, <lb/>
amazes me beyond all utterance. Thy effrontery in <reg orig="boast-|ing">boasting</reg> <lb/>
of thy innocence; in calling this wretch thy <hi rend="italic">friend,</hi> thy <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">soul's</hi> friend, the means of securing the favor of a pure <lb/>
and all-seeing Judge, exceeds all that I supposed possible <lb/>
in human nature. And that thou, Jane, the darling of my <lb/>
heart, and the object of all my care and my pride, should <lb/>
be this profligate, this obdurate creature!</p>
<p>When very young you were ill of a fever. The <reg orig="physi-|cian">physician</reg> <lb/>
gave up, for some hours, all hope of your life. I shall <lb/>
never forget the grief which his gloomy silence gave me. <lb/>
All that I held dear in the world, I then thought, I would <lb/>
cheerfully surrender to save your life.</p>
<p>Poor short-sighted wretch that I was. That event, which, <lb/>
had it then happened, would, perhaps, have bereaved me of <lb/>
reason, would have saved me from a portion far more bitter. <lb/>
I should have never lived to witness the depravity of one, <lb/>
whom my whole life had been employed in training to <lb/>
virtue.</p>
<p>Having opened your letter, and somewhat debated with <lb/>
myself, I consented to read. I will do more than read; I <lb/>
will answer it minutely. I will unfold that secret, by which, <lb/>
you truly think, my aversion to your present scheme has <lb/>
been chiefly caused.</p>
<p>I have hitherto been silent through compassion to you; <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="eaf033v4_0077" pid="uva-lib:350086"/>
through the hope that all might yet be well; that you might <lb/>
be influenced by my persuasions to forbear an action, that <lb/>
will insure forever your ruin. I now perceive the folly of <lb/>
this compassion and these hopes. I need not be assiduces <lb/>
to spare you the shame and mortification of hearing the <lb/>
truth. Shame is as much a stranger to your heart as <reg orig="re-|morse">remorse</reg>. <lb/>
Say what I will; disclose what I will, your <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg> <lb/>
will be just the same. A show of much reluctanct <lb/>
and humility will, no doubt, be made, and the tongue will <lb/>
be busy in imploring favor which the heart disdains.</p>
<p>In the foresight of this, I was going to forbid your <reg orig="writ-|ing">writing</reg>, <lb/>
but you care not for my forbidding. As long as you <lb/>
think it possible to reconcile me to your views, and make <lb/>
me a partaker in your infamy, you with harass me will <reg orig="im-|portunity">importunity</reg>; <lb/>
with feigned penitence and preposterous <reg orig="argu-|ments&mdash;But">arguments&mdash;But</reg> <lb/>
one thing at least is in my power. I can shun <lb/>
you, and I can throw your unopened letters into the fire, <lb/>
and that, believe me, Jane, I shall do.</p>
<p>But I am wasting time. My indignation carries its <lb/>
away from my purpose. Let me return to it, and having <lb/>
told you all my mind, let me dismiss the hateful subject <reg orig="for-|ever">forever</reg>.</p>
<p>I knew the motives that induced you to marry Leus <lb/>
Talbot. They were good ones. Your compliance with <lb/>
mine and your father's wishes in that respect, shewed the <lb/>
force of understanding which I always ascribed to you <lb/>
Your previous reluctance; your scruples, were indeed <reg orig="in-|worthy">inworthy</reg> <lb/>
of you, but you conquered them, and that was <reg orig="bet-|ter">better</reg>; <lb/>
perhaps, it evinced more magnanimity than never to <lb/>
have had them.</p>
<p>You were happy, I long thought, in your union with a <lb/>
man of probity and good sense. You may be sure, I <lb/>
thought of you often, but only with pleasure. Certain <reg orig="in-|dications">indications</reg>, <lb/>
I early saw in you of a sensibility that required <lb/>
strict government; an inattention to any thing but feeling <lb/>
a proneness to romantic friendship and a pining after good <lb/>
not consistent with our nature. I imagined that I had kept <lb/>
at a distance all such books and companions as tend to <reg orig="pro-|duce">produce</reg> <lb/>
this phantastic character, and whence you imbibed <lb/>
this perverse spirit, at so early an age, is, to me, <reg orig="incon-|ceivable">inconceivable</reg>. <lb/>
It cost me many a gloomy foreboding.</p>
<pb n="65" entity="eaf033v4_0078" pid="uva-lib:350087"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">7</fw></pb>
<p>My disquiets increased as you grew up, and that age <reg orig="ar-|rived">arrived</reg> <lb/>
when the heart comes to be entangled with what is <lb/>
called love. I was anxious to find for you a man of merit, <lb/>
to whose keeping your happiness might safely be entrusted. <lb/>
Talbot was such a one, but the wayward heart refused <lb/>
to love him. He was not all your fancy had conceived of <reg orig="ex-|cellent">excellent</reg> <lb/>
and lovely. He was a mere man, with the taste and <lb/>
habits suitable and common to his education and age. He <lb/>
was addicted to industry, was regular and frugal in his <reg orig="man-|ners">manners</reg> <lb/>
and economy. He had nothing of that specious and <lb/>
glossy texture which captivates inexperience and youth, and <lb/>
serves as a substitute for every other virtue. While others <lb/>
talked about their duty he was contented with performing it, <lb/>
and he was satisfied with ignorance of theories as long as <lb/>
his practice was faultless.</p>
<p>He was just such a one as I wished for the darling of <lb/>
my heart, but you thought not so. You did not object to <lb/>
his age, though almost double your own; to his person or <lb/>
aspect, though they were by no means worthy of his mind; <lb/>
to his profession or condition; but your heart sighed after <lb/>
one who could divide with you your sympathies. Who saw <lb/>
every thing just as you saw it. Who could emulate your <lb/>
enthusiasm, and echo back every exclamation which chance <lb/>
should dictate to you.</p>
<p>You even pleaded religion as one of your objections. <lb/>
Talbot, it seems, had nothing that deserved to be called <reg orig="re-|ligion">religion</reg>. <lb/>
He had never reasoned on the subject. He had <lb/>
read no books and had never looked into his bible since he <lb/>
was fifteen years old. He seldom went to church, but <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
it was the fashion, and when there, seldom spared a <lb/>
thought from his own temporal concerns, to a future state <lb/>
and a governing deity. All those expansions of soul, <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg> <lb/>
by meditation on the power and goodness of our <lb/>
Maker, and those raptures that flow from accommodating <lb/>
all our actions to his will, and from consciousness of his <reg orig="ap-|probation">approbation</reg> <lb/>
and presence, you discovered to be strangers to <lb/>
his breast, and, therefore, you scrupled to unite your fate <lb/>
with his.</p>
<p>It was not enough that this man had never been seduced <lb/>
into disbelief. That his faith was steadfast and rational, <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="eaf033v4_0079" pid="uva-lib:350088"/>
without producing those fervors, and reveries, and rhapsodies, <lb/>
which unfit us for the mixed scenes of human life, and <lb/>
breed in us absurd and phantastic notions of our duty or our <lb/>
happiness; that his religion had produced all its practical <lb/>
effects, in honest, regular, sober and consistent conduct.</p>
<p>You wanted a zealot; a sectary; one that should enter <lb/>
into all the trifling distinctions and minute subtileties that <lb/>
make one christian the mortal foe of another, while, in their <lb/>
social conduct, there is no difference to be found between <lb/>
them.</p>
<p>I do not repeat these things to upbraid you for what you then <lb/>
were, but merely to remind you of the inconsistency of these <lb/>
notions with your subsequent conduct. You then, at the <lb/>
instance of your father and at my instance, gave them up, <lb/>
and that compliance, supposing your scruples to have been <lb/>
undissembled, gave you a still greater interest in our <reg orig="af-|fections">affections</reg>.</p>
<p>You never gave me reason to suppose that you repented <lb/>
of this compliance. I never saw you after your <reg orig="engage-|ment">engagement</reg>, <lb/>
but you wore a cheerful countenance; at least, it <lb/>
your unfortunate connexion with Colden. To that <reg orig="con-|nexion">connexion</reg> <lb/>
must be traced every misfortune and depravity that <lb/>
has attended you since.</p>
<p>When I heard from Patty Sinclair, of his frequent visit <lb/>
to you during your retirement at Burlington, I thought of <lb/>
it but little. He was, indeed, a new acquaintance. You <lb/>
were unacquainted with his character and history, except so <lb/>
far as you could collect them from his conversation, and so <lb/>
confidence could, of course, be placed in that. It was <lb/>
therefore, perhaps, somewhat indiscreet, to permit such <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">very</hi> frequent visits; such <hi rend="italic">very</hi> long walks. To neglect the <lb/>
friends whom you lived with, for the sake of exclusive <reg orig="con-|versations">conversations</reg> <lb/>
and lonely rambles, noon and night, with a more <lb/>
stranger. One, not regularly introduced to you. Whose <lb/>
name you were obliged to inquire of himself. You too, <reg orig="al-|ready">already</reg> <lb/>
a betrothed woman; your lover absent; yourself from <lb/>
home, and merely on terms of hospitality! all this did not <lb/>
look well.</p>
<p>But the mischief, it was evident, was to be known by <lb/>
the event. Colden might have probity and circumspection. <lb/>
He might prove an agreeable friend to your future husband <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="eaf033v4_0080" pid="uva-lib:350089"/>
and a useful companion to yourself. Kept within due limits, <lb/>
your complacency for this stranger; your attachment to his <lb/>
company, might occasion no inconvenience; how little did <lb/>
I then suspect to what extremes you were capable of going, <lb/>
and even then had actually gone!</p>
<p>The subject was of sufficient importance to induce me <lb/>
to write to you. Your answer was not quite satisfactory; <lb/>
yet on the whole, laid my apprehensions at rest. I was <reg orig="de-|ceived">deceived</reg> <lb/>
by the confidence you expressed in your own <reg orig="cau-|tion">caution</reg>, <lb/>
and the seeming readiness there was to be governed <lb/>
by my advice.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I heard, through various channels, without <lb/>
any efforts on my part, intelligence of Colden. At first I <lb/>
was not much alarmed. Colden, it is true, was not a <reg orig="fault-|less">faultless</reg> <lb/>
or steadfast character. No gross or enormous vices <lb/>
were ascribed to him. His habits, as far as appearances <lb/>
enabled one to judge, were temperate and chaste. He was <lb/>
contemplative and bookish, and was vaguely described as <lb/>
being somewhat visionary and romantic.</p>
<p>In all this there was nothing formidable. Such a man <lb/>
might surely be a harmless companion. Those with whom <lb/>
he was said to associate most intimately were highly <reg orig="estima-|ble">estimable</reg>. <lb/>
Their esteem was a test of merit, not to be disposed <lb/>
or hastily rejected.</p>
<p>Things, however, quickly took a now face. I was <reg orig="in-|formed">informed</reg> <lb/>
that after your return to the city, Colden continued <lb/>
to be a very constant visitant. Your husband's voyage left <lb/>
you soon after at liberty, and your intercourse with this <lb/>
person only became more intimate and confidential.</p>
<p>Reflecting closely on this circumstance, I began to <reg orig="sus-|pect">suspect</reg> <lb/>
some danger lurking in your path. I now remembered <lb/>
that impetuosity of feeling which distinguished your early <lb/>
age; those notions of kindred among souls; of friendship and <lb/>
harmony of feelings which, in your juvenile age, you loved <lb/>
to indulge.</p>
<p>I reflected that the victory over these chimeras, which <lb/>
you gained by marriage with Talbot, might be merely <reg orig="tem-|porary">temporary</reg>; <lb/>
and that, in order to call these dormant feelings into <lb/>
action, it was only requisite to meet with one, <reg orig="contempla-|tive">contemplative</reg>, <lb/>
bookish and romantic as yourself.</p>
<p>Such a one, it was greatly to be feared, you had now <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="eaf033v4_0081" pid="uva-lib:350090"/>
found in this young man; just such qualities he was <reg orig="report-|ed">reported</reg> <lb/>
to possess, as would render him dangerous to you and <lb/>
you dangerous to him. A poet, not in theory only, but it <lb/>
practice; accustomed to intoxicate the women with <reg orig="melodi-|ous">melodious</reg> <lb/>
flattery; fond of being <hi rend="italic">intimate;</hi> avowedly devoted to <lb/>
the sex; eloquent in his encomiums upon female charms; <lb/>
and affecting to select his <hi rend="italic">friends</hi> only from that sex.</p>
<p>What effect might such a character have upon your peace, <lb/>
even without imputing any ill intention to him? both of you <lb/>
might work your own ruin, while you designed nothing but <lb/>
good; and even supposing that your intercourse should be <lb/>
harmless, or even beneficial with respect to yourselves, what <lb/>
was to be feared for Talbot? An intimacy of this kind <lb/>
could hardly escape his observation on his return. It would <lb/>
be criminal, indeed, to conceal it from him.</p>
<p>These apprehensions were raised to the highest pitch by <lb/>
more accurate information of Colden's character, which I <lb/>
afterwards received. I found, on inquiring of those who <lb/>
had the best means of knowing, that Colden had imbibed <lb/>
that pernicious philosophy, which is now so much in vogue. <lb/>
One who knew him perfectly; who had long been in habits <lb/>
of the closest intimacy with him, who was still a familiar <reg orig="cor-|respondent">correspondent</reg> <lb/>
of his, gave me this account.</p>
<p>I met this friend of Colden's, Thomson his name is, of <lb/>
whom I suppose you have heard something, in this city. <lb/>
His being mentioned as the intimate companion of Colden, <lb/>
made me wish to see him, and fortunately I prevailed upon <lb/>
him to be very communicative.</p>
<p>Thomson is an excellent young man: he loves Colden <lb/>
much, and describes the progress of his friend's opinions <lb/>
with every mark of regret. He even showed me letters <lb/>
that had passed between them, and in which every horrid <lb/>
and immoral tenet was defended by one and denied by the <lb/>
other. These letters showed Colden as the advocate of <lb/>
suicide; a scoffer at promises; the despiser of revelation, <lb/>
of providence and a future state; an opponent of marriage, <lb/>
and as one who denied (shocking!) that any thing but mere <lb/>
habit and positive law, stood in the way of marriage; nay, <lb/>
of intercourse without marriage, between brother and sister, <lb/>
parent and child!</p>
<p>You may readily believe that I did not credit such things <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="eaf033v4_0082" pid="uva-lib:350091"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">7*</fw></pb>
on slight evidence. I did not rely on Thomson's mere words, <lb/>
solemn and unaffected as these were; nothing but Colden's <lb/>
hand-writing could in such a case, be credited.</p>
<p>To say truth, I should not be much surprised had I heard <lb/>
of Colden, as of a youth whose notions, on moral and <reg orig="re-|ligious">religious</reg> <lb/>
topics, were, in some degree, unsettled; that in the <lb/>
fervor and giddiness incident to his age, he had not tamed <lb/>
his mind to investigation; had not subdued his heart to <reg orig="regu-|lar">regular</reg> <lb/>
and devout thoughts; that his passions or his indolence <lb/>
had made the truths of religion somewhat obscure, and shut <lb/>
them out, not properly from his conviction, but only from <lb/>
his attention.</p>
<p>I expected to find, united with this vague and dubious <lb/>
state of mind, tokens of the influence of a pious education; <lb/>
a reverence, at least, for those sacred precepts on which the <lb/>
happiness of men rests, and at least, a practical observance <lb/>
of that which, if not fully admitted by his understanding, <lb/>
was yet very far from having been rejected by it.</p>
<p>But widely and deplorably different was Colden's case. <lb/>
A most fascinating book<ref target="n1" n="1">*</ref>
<note id="n1" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Godwin's Political Justice.</p></note>
 fell at length into his hands, which <lb/>
changed, in a moment, the whole course of his ideas. What <lb/>
he had before regarded with reluctance and terror, this book <lb/>
taught him to admire and love. The writer has the art of <lb/>
the grand deceiver; the fatal art of carrying the worst poison <lb/>
under the name and appearance of wholesome food; of <reg orig="dis-|guising">disguising</reg> <lb/>
all that is impious or blasphemous, or licentious, <lb/>
under the guise and sanctions of virtue.</p>
<p>Colden had lived before this without examination or <reg orig="in-|quiry">inquiry</reg>. <lb/>
His heart, his inclination was, perhaps, on the side <lb/>
of religion and true virtue, but this book carried all his <reg orig="in-|clination">inclination</reg>, <lb/>
his zeal and his enthusiasm, over to the adversary, <lb/>
and so strangely had he been perverted, that he held himself <lb/>
bound, he conceived it to be his duty, to vindicate in private <lb/>
and public, to preach, with vehemence, his new faith. The <lb/>
rage for making converts seized him, and that Thomson was <lb/>
not won over to the same cause, proceeded from no want of <lb/>
industry in Colden.</p>
<p>Such was the man whom you had admitted to your <reg orig="con-|fidence">confidence</reg>; <lb/>
<pb n="70" entity="eaf033v4_0083" pid="uva-lib:350092"/>
whom you had adopted for your bosom friend. I <lb/>
knew your pretensions to religion, the stress which you laid <lb/>
upon piety as the basis of morals. I remembered your <reg orig="ob-|jections">objections</reg> <lb/>
to Talbot on this score, not only as a husband, but <lb/>
as a friend. I could, therefore, only suppose that Colden <lb/>
had joined dissimulation to his other errors, and had gained <lb/>
and kept your good opinion by avowing sentiments which <lb/>
his heart secretly abhorred.</p>
<p>I cannot describe to you, Jane, my alarms upon this <reg orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg>. <lb/>
That your cook had intended to poison you, the <lb/>
next meat which you should eat in your own house, would <lb/>
have alarmed me I assure you, much less. The <reg orig="preserva-|tion">preservation</reg> <lb/>
of your virtue was unspeakably of more importance <lb/>
in my eyes than of your life.</p>
<p>I wrote to you and what was your reply? I could <lb/>
scarcely believe my senses. Every horrid foreboding <reg orig="real-|ized">realized</reg>! <lb/>
already such an adept in this accursed sophistry! <lb/>
the very cant of that detestable sect adopted!</p>
<p>I had plumed myself upon your ignorance. He had <lb/>
taken advantage of that, I supposed, and had won your esteem <lb/>
by counterfeiting a moral and pious strain. To make you <lb/>
put him forever at a distance, it was needed only to tear of <lb/>
his mask. This was done, but, alas, too late for your safety. <lb/>
The poison was already swallowed.</p>
<p>I had no patience with you, to listen to your trifling and <lb/>
insidious distinctions; such as, though you could <reg orig="audacious-|ly">audaciously</reg> <lb/>
urge them to me, possessed no weight; <hi rend="italic">could</hi> possess no <lb/>
weight in your understanding. What was it to me whether <lb/>
he was ruffian or madman; whether in destroying you, he <lb/>
meant to destroy or to save? Is it proper to expose your <lb/>
breast to a sword, because the wretch that wields it, supposes <lb/>
madly that it is a straw, which he holds in his hand?</p>
<p>But I will not renew the subject. The same motives <lb/>
that induced me to attempt to reason with you then, no <lb/>
longer exists. The anguish, the astonishment which your <lb/>
letters, as they gradually unfolded your character, produced <lb/>
in me, I endeavored to show you at the time. Now I pass <lb/>
them over to come to a more important circumstance.</p>
<p>Yet how shall I tell it thee, Jane. I am afraid to entrust <lb/>
it to paper. Thy fame is still dear to me. I would not be <lb/>
<pb n="71" entity="eaf033v4_0084" pid="uva-lib:350093"/>
the means of irretrievably blasting thy fame. Yet what may <lb/>
come of relating some incidents on paper?</p>
<p>Faint is my hope, but I am not without some hope, that <lb/>
thou canst yet be saved; be snatched from perdition. Thy <lb/>
life I value not in comparison with something higher. And <lb/>
if, through an erring sensibility, the sacrifice of Colden cost <lb/>
thee thy life, I shall yet rejoice. As the wife of Colden, <lb/>
thou wilt be worse than dead to me.</p>
<p>What has come to me, I wonder? I began this letter <lb/>
with a firm, and as I thought inflexible soul. Despair had <lb/>
made me serene, yet now thy image rises before me, with <lb/>
all those bewitching graces which adorned thee when thou <lb/>
wast innocent and a child. All the mother seizes my heart, <lb/>
and my tears suffocate me.</p>
<p>Shall I shock, shall I wound thee, my child, by lifting the <lb/>
veil from thy misconduct, behind which thou thinkest thou <lb/>
art screened from every human eye? How little dost thou <lb/>
imagine that I know <hi rend="italic">so much!</hi></p>
<p>Now will thy expostulations and reasonings have an end. <lb/>
Surely they <hi rend="italic">will</hi> have an end. Shame at last; shame at last <lb/>
will overwhelm thee and make thee dumb.</p>
<p>Yet my heart sorely misgives me. I shudder at the <reg orig="ex-|tremes">extremes</reg> <lb/>
to which thy accursed seducer may have urged <lb/>
thee. What thou hast failed in concealing thou mayest be <lb/>
so obdurately wicked as to attempt to justify.</p>
<p>Was it not the unavoidable result of confiding in a man <lb/>
avowedly irreligious and immoral; of exposing thy <reg orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg> <lb/>
and thy heart to such stratagems as his philosophy <lb/>
made laudable and necessary? But I know not what I <lb/>
would say. I must lay down the pen, till I can reason <lb/>
myself into some composure. I will write again <reg orig="tomor-|row">tomorrow</reg>.</p>

<head type="main">LETTER XVI.</head>
<head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">To the Same.</hi></head>
<p>O My lost child! In thy humiliations at this moment I <lb/>
can sympathize. The shame that must follow the detection <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="eaf033v4_0085" pid="uva-lib:350094"/>
of it is more within my thoughts at present, than the <lb/>
negligence or infatuation that occasioned thy faults.</p>
<p>I know all. Thy intended husband knew it all. It was <lb/>
from him that the horrible tidings of thy unfaithfulness to <lb/>
marriage vows first came.</p>
<p>He visited this city on purpose to obtain an interview with <lb/>
me. He entered my apartment with every mark of distress. <lb/>
He knew well the effect of such tidings on my heart. <lb/>
Most eagerly would I have laid down my life to preserve <lb/>
thy purity spotless.</p>
<p>He demeaned himself as one who loved thee, with a <reg orig="ra-|tional">rational</reg> <lb/>
affection, and who, however, deeply he deplored the <lb/>
loss of thy love, accounted thy defection from virtue of <lb/>
infinitely greater moment.</p>
<p>I was willing to discredit even his assertion. Far better <lb/>
it was that the husband should prove the defamer of his wife, <lb/>
than that my darling child should prove a profligate? But <lb/>
he left me no room to doubt by shewing me a letter.</p>
<p>He shewed it me on condition of my being everlastingly <lb/>
silent to you in regard to its contents. He yielded to a <lb/>
jealousy which would not be conquered, and had gotten this <lb/>
letter by surreptitious means. He was ashamed of an <lb/>
action which his judgment condemned as ignoble and <reg orig="de-|ceitful">deceitful</reg>.</p>
<p>Far more wise and considerate was this excellent and <reg orig="in-|jured">injured</reg> <lb/>
man than I. He was afraid, by disclosing to you the <lb/>
knowledge he had thus gained, of rendering you desperate <lb/>
and hardened. As long as reputation was not gone, he thought <lb/>
your errors were retrievable. He distrusted the success of <lb/>
his own efforts, and besought me to be your guardian. As <lb/>
to himself he resigned the hope of ever gaining your love, <lb/>
and entreated me to exert myself for dissolving your <reg orig="con-|nexion">connexion</reg> <lb/>
with Colden, merely for your own sake.</p>
<p>To show me the necessity of my exertions he had <reg orig="com-|municated">communicated</reg> <lb/>
this letter, believing that my maternal interest in <lb/>
your happiness, would prevent me from making any but a <lb/>
salutary use of it. Yet he had not put your safety into my <lb/>
hands, without a surety. He was so fully persuaded of <lb/>
the ill consequences of your knowing how much was known, <lb/>
that he had given me the proofs of your guilt, only on my <lb/>
solemn promise to conceal them from you.</p>
<pb n="73" entity="eaf033v4_0086" pid="uva-lib:350095"/>
<p>I saw the generosity and force of his representations, and <lb/>
while I endeavored by the most earnest remonstrances, to <lb/>
break your union with Colden, I suffered no particle of the <lb/>
truth to escape me. But you were hard as a rock. You <lb/>
would not forbid his visits, nor reject his letters.</p>
<p>I need not repeat to you what followed; by what means <lb/>
I endeavored to effect that end, which your obstinate folly <lb/>
refused.</p>
<p>When I gave this promise to Talbot, I foresaw not his <lb/>
speedy death and the consequences to Colden and yourself. <lb/>
I have been affrighted at the rumor of your marriage, and <lb/>
to justify the conduct I mean to pursue, I have revealed to <lb/>
you, what I promised to conceal, merely because I foresaw <lb/>
not the present state of your affairs.</p>
<p>You will not be surprised that on your marriage with this <lb/>
man, I should withdraw from you what you now hold from <lb/>
my bounty. No faultiness in you shall induce me to leave <lb/>
you without the means of decent subsistence, but I owe no <lb/>
benevolence to Colden. My duty will not permit me to <lb/>
give any thing to your paramour. When you change your <lb/>
name you must change your habitation and leave behind <lb/>
you whatever you found.</p>
<p>Think not, Jane, that I cease to love thee. I am not so <lb/>
inhuman as to refuse my forgiveness to a penitent; yet I <lb/>
ask not thy penitence to insure thee my affection. I have <lb/>
told thee my conditions, and adhere to them still.</p>
<p>To preclude all bickerings and cavils, I enclose the letter <lb/>
which attests your fall.</p>

<dateline><name type="place">New York,</name> October 22.</dateline>
<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Sir,</hi></salute>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I address</hi> myself to you as the mother of an unhappy <lb/>
girl, who has put herself into your power. But I write not <lb/>
to upbraid you or indulge my own indignation, but merely <lb/>
to beseech your compassion for her whom you profess to <lb/>
love.</p>
<p>I cannot apologize for the manner in which I have acted <lb/>
in regard to your connexion with Jane Talbot. In that <lb/>
respect, I must take to myself all the blame you may choose <lb/>
to impute to me.</p>
<p>I call not into question the disinterestedness of your <reg orig="in-|tentions">intentions</reg> <lb/>
in proposing marriage to this woman, nor, if the <lb/>
information which I am going to give you, should possess <lb/>
any influence, shall I ascribe that influence to any thing but <lb/>
a commendable attention to your true interest, and a <reg orig="gene-|rous">generous</reg> <lb/>
regard to the welfare of my daughter.</p>
<p>Be it known to you, then, sir, that Mrs. Talbot possesses <lb/>
no fortune in her own right. Her present dwelling, and <lb/>
her chief means of subsistence, are derived from me; she <lb/>
holds them at my option, and they will be instantly and <reg orig="en-|tirely">entirely</reg> <lb/>
withdrawn, on her marriage with you.</p>
<p>You cannot be unacquainted with the habits and views in <lb/>
which my daughter has been educated. Her life has passed <lb/>
in ease and luxury, and you cannot but perceive the effect <lb/>
of any material change in her way of life.</p>
<p>It would be a wretched artifice to pretend to any <reg orig="particu-|lar">particular</reg> <lb/>
esteem for you, or to attempt to persuade you that any <lb/>
part of this letter is dictated by any regard to your interest, <lb/>
except as that is subservient to the interest of one, whom I <lb/>
can never cease to love.</p>
<p>Yet I ardently hope that this circumstance may not <reg orig="hin-|der">hinder</reg> <lb/>
you from accepting bills upon London to the amount of <lb/>
three hundred pounds sterling. They shall be put into your <lb/>
hands the moment I am properly assured that you have <reg orig="en-|gaged">engaged</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="76" entity="eaf033v4_0089" pid="uva-lib:350098"/>
your passage to Europe, and are determined to be <lb/>
nothing more than a distant well-wisher to my daughter.</p>
<p>I am anxious that you should draw from the terms of this <lb/>
offer, proof of that confidence in your word, which you <lb/>
might not perhaps have expected from my conduct towards <lb/>
you in other respects. Indeed, my conscience acquits me <lb/>
of any design to injure you. On the contrary, it would <lb/>
give me sincere pleasure to hear of your success in every <lb/>
laudable pursuit.</p>
<p>I know your talents and the direction which they have <lb/>
hitherto received. I know that London is a theatre best <lb/>
adapted to the lucrative display of those talents, and that the <lb/>
sum I offer will be an ample fund, till your own exertices <lb/>
may be turned to account.</p>
<p>If this offer be accepted, I shall not only hold myself <lb/>
everlastingly obliged to you, but I shall grant you a higher <lb/>
place in my esteem. Yet, through deference to scruples <lb/>
which you may possibly possess, I most cheerfully plight to <lb/>
you my honor, that this transaction shall be concealed from <lb/>
Mrs. Talbot, and from all the world.</p>
<p>Though property is necessary to our happiness, and my <lb/>
daughter's habits render the continuance of former <reg orig="indul-|gences">indulgences</reg> <lb/>
necessary to her content, I will not be so unjust to <lb/>
her, as to imagine that this is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> which she regards. <reg orig="Re-|spect">Respect</reg> <lb/>
from the world, and the attachment of her ancient <lb/>
friends, are, also, of some value in her eyes. Reflect, sir, <lb/>
I beseech you, whether you are qualified to compensate her <lb/>
for the loss of property; of good name&mdash;my own <reg orig="justifica-|tion">justification</reg>, <lb/>
in case she marries you, will require me to be nothing <lb/>
more than <hi rend="italic">just</hi> to her&mdash;and of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> her ancient friends, who <lb/>
will abhor in her, the faithless wife and the ungrateful child <lb/>
I need not inform <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that <hi rend="italic">your</hi> family will never receive <lb/>
into their bosom one whom her own kindred have rejected.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">O my</hi> friend! Where are you at this trying moment? <lb/>
Why did you desert me? Now, if ever, does my feeble <lb/>
heart stand in need of your counsel and courage.</p>
<p>Did I ever lean these throbbing brows against your arm, <lb/>
and pour my tears into your bosom, that I was not <reg orig="com-|forted">comforted</reg>. <lb/>
Never did that adored voice fail to whisper sweet <lb/>
peace to my soul. In every storm, thy calmer and more <lb/>
strenuous spirit has provided me the means of safety.&mdash;But <lb/>
now I look around for my stay, my monitor, my encourager, <lb/>
in vain.</p>
<p>You will make haste to despatch the business that detains <lb/>
you. You will return, and fly, on the wings of love, to thy <lb/>
Jane. Alas! she will not be found. She will have fled <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="eaf033v4_0091" pid="uva-lib:350100"/>
far away, and in her stead will she leave this sullen <reg orig="messen-|ger">messenger</reg> <lb/>
to tell thee that thy Jane has parted from thee forever!</p>
<p>Do not upbraid me, Hal. Do not call me ungrateful or <lb/>
rash. Indeed, I shall not be able to bear thy reproaches. <lb/>
I know they will kill me quite.</p>
<p>And dont expostulate with me. Confirm me rather in <lb/>
my new resolution. Even if you think it cruel or absurd, <lb/>
aver that it is just. Persuade me that I have done my <lb/>
duty to my mother, and assure me of your cheerful <reg orig="acqui-|escence">acquiescence</reg>.</p>
<p>Too late is it now, even if I would, to recall my <reg orig="pro-|mise">promise</reg>.</p>
<p>I have promised to part with you. In the first tumult of <lb/>
my soul, on receiving the enclosed letters, I wrote an <reg orig="an-|swer">answer</reg>, <lb/>
assuring Mrs. Fielder of my absolute concurrence <lb/>
with her will.</p>
<p>Already does my heart, calling up thy beloved image; <reg orig="re-|flecting">reflecting</reg> <lb/>
on the immense debt which I owe to your <reg orig="gene-|rosity">generosity</reg>; <lb/>
on the disappointment which the tidings of my <lb/>
journey will give you; already do I repent of my <reg orig="precipi-|tation">precipitation</reg>.</p>
<p>I have sought repose but I find it not. My pillow is moist <lb/>
with the bitterest tears that I ever shed. To give vent to <lb/>
my swelling heart, I write to you, but I must now stop. All <lb/>
my former self is coming back upon me, and while I think <lb/>
of you as of my true and only friend, I shall be unable to <lb/>
persist. I will not part with thee, my friend. I cannot do <lb/>
it. Has not my life been solemnly devoted to compensate <lb/>
thee for thy unmerited love? For the crosses and vexations <lb/>
thou hast endured for my sake?</p>
<p>Why shall I forsake thee? To gratify a wayward and <lb/>
groundless prejudice. To purchase the short-lived and <reg orig="du-|bious">dubious</reg> <lb/>
affection of one who loves me in proportion as I am <lb/>
blind to thy merit; as I forget thy benefits; as I <reg orig="counte-|nance">countenance</reg> <lb/>
the envy and slander that pursue thee.</p>
<p>Yet what shall I bring to thy arms? A blasted reputation, <lb/>
poverty, contempt. The indignation of mine and of thy <lb/>
friends. For thou art poor, and so am I. Thy kindred <lb/>
have antipathies for me as strong as those that are fostered <lb/>
against thyself&mdash;</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I will</hi> struggle for sufficient composure to finish this <lb/>
letter. I have spent the day in reflection, and am now, I <lb/>
hope, calm enough to review this most horrid and <reg orig="inexpli-|cable">inexplicable</reg> <lb/>
charge.</p>
<p>Look, my friend, at the letter she has sent me. It is <lb/>
my hand-writing. The very same which I have so often <lb/>
mentioned to you as having been, after so unaccountable a <lb/>
manner, mislaid.</p>
<p>I wrote some part of it, alone, in my own parlor. You <lb/>
recollect the time. The day after that night which a heavy <lb/>
storm of rain, and my fatal importunity prevailed on you to <lb/>
spend under this roof.</p>
<p>Mark the deplorable consequences of an act, which the <lb/>
coldest charity would not have declined. On such a night <lb/>
I would have opened my doors to my worst enemy. Yet <lb/>
because I turned not forth my best friend, on such a night, <lb/>
see to what a foul accusation I have exposed myself.</p>
<p>I had not finished, but it came into my mind that <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
in that which I had a little before received from you, <lb/>
might be seasonably noticed, before I shut up my billet. <lb/>
So I left my paper on the table, open, while I ran up stairs <lb/>
to get your letter, which I had left in a drawer in my <lb/>
chamber.</p>
<p>While turning over clothes and papers, I heard the street <lb/>
door open, and some one enter. This did not hinder me <lb/>
from continuing my search. I thought it was my gossiping <lb/>
neighbor, Miss Jessup, and had some hopes that, finding no <lb/>
one in the parlor, she would withdraw, with as little <reg orig="cere-|mony">ceremony</reg> <lb/>
as she entered.</p>
<p>My search was longer than I expected, but finding it at <lb/>
last, down I went, fully expecting to find a visitant, not <lb/>
having heard any steps returning to the door.</p>
<p>But no visitant was there, and the paper was gone! I <lb/>
was surprised, and a little alarmed. You know my <reg orig="child-|ish">childish</reg> <lb/>
apprehensions of robbers.</p>
<pb n="80" entity="eaf033v4_0093" pid="uva-lib:350102"/>
<p>I called up Molly, who was singing at her work in the <lb/>
kitchen. She had heard the street door open and shut, <lb/>
and footsteps overhead, but she imagined them to be mine. <lb/>
A little heavier, too, she recollected them to be, than <lb/>
mine. She likewise heard a sound as if the door had been <lb/>
opened and shut softly. It thus appeared that my unknown <lb/>
visitant had hastily and secretly withdrawn, and my paper <lb/>
had disappeared.</p>
<p>I was confounded at this incident. Who it was that <lb/>
could thus purloin an unfinished letter and retire in order to <lb/>
conceal the theft, I could not imagine. Nothing else had <lb/>
been displaced. It was no ordinary thief; no sordid <lb/>
villain.</p>
<p>For a time, I thought perhaps, it might be some facetious <lb/>
body, who expected to find amusement in puzzling or <lb/>
alarming me. Yet I was not alarmed; for what had I to <lb/>
fear or to conceal? The contents were perfectly harmless, <lb/>
and being fully satisfied with the purity of my own thoughts. <lb/>
I never dreamed of any construction being put on them, <lb/>
injurious to me.</p>
<p>I soon ceased to think of this occurrence. I had no <lb/>
cause, as I then thought, to be anxious about consequences. <lb/>
The place of the lost letter was easily supplied by my <reg orig="lo-|quacious">loquacious</reg> <lb/>
pen, and I came, at last, to conjecture that I had <lb/>
carelessly whisked it into the fire, and that the visitant had <lb/>
been induced to withdraw, by finding the apartment empty. <lb/>
Yet I never discovered any one who had come in and gone <lb/>
out in this manner. Miss Jessup, whom I questioned <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg>, <lb/>
had spent that day elsewhere. And now, when the <lb/>
letter and its contents were almost forgotten, does it <reg orig="ap-|pear">appear</reg> <lb/>
before me, and is offered in proof of this dreadful <lb/>
charge.</p>
<p>After reading my mother's letter, I opened with <reg orig="trem-|bling">trembling</reg> <lb/>
hand that which was enclosed. I instantly recognised <lb/>
the long lost billet. All of it, appeared, on the first perusal, <lb/>
to be mine. Even the last mysterious paragraph was <reg orig="ac-|knowledged">acknowledged</reg> <lb/>
by my senses. In the first confusion of my <lb/>
mind, I knew not what to believe or reject; my thoughts <lb/>
were wandering, and my repeated efforts had no influence <lb/>
in restoring them to order.</p>
<pb n="81" entity="eaf033v4_0094" pid="uva-lib:350103"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">8*</fw></pb>
<p>Methinks, I then felt as I should have felt if the charge <lb/>
had been true. I shuddered as if to look back would only <lb/>
furnish me with proofs of a guilt of which I had not hitherto <lb/>
been conscious; proofs that had merely escaped <reg orig="remem-|brance">remembrance</reg>, <lb/>
or had failed to produce their due effect, from some <lb/>
infatuation of mind.</p>
<p>When the first horror and amazement were passed, and <lb/>
I took up the letter and pondered on it once more, I caught <lb/>
a glimpse suddenly; suspicion darted all at once into my <lb/>
mind; I strove to recollect the circumstances attending the <lb/>
writing of this billet.</p>
<p>Yes; it was clear. As distinctly as if it were the work <lb/>
of yesterday, did I now remember, that I stopped at the <lb/>
words <hi rend="italic">nobody; mind that.</hi> The following sentences are <lb/>
strange to me. The character is similar to what precedes, <lb/>
but the words were never penned by me.</p>
<p>And could Talbot&mdash;Yet what end? a fraud so&mdash;Ah! <lb/>
let me not suspect my <hi rend="italic">husband</hi> of <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a fraud. Let me <lb/>
not have reason to abhor his memory.</p>
<p>I fondly imagined that with his life, my causes of disquiet <lb/>
were at an end, yet now are my eyes open to an endless <lb/>
series of calamities and humiliations which his decease has <lb/>
made sure.</p>
<p>I cannot escape from them. There is no help for me. <lb/>
I cannot disprove. What testimony can I bring to establish <lb/>
my innocence; to prove that another hand has added these <lb/>
detestable confessions?</p>
<p>True it is you passed that night under my roof. Where <lb/>
was my caution? You, Henry, knew mankind better than <lb/>
I; why did you not repel my importunities, and leave me <lb/>
in spite of my urgencies for your stay?</p>
<p>Poor, thoughtless wretch that I was, not to be aware of <lb/>
the indecorum of allowing one of your sex, not allied to <lb/>
me by kindred&mdash;I, too, alone, without any companion but <lb/>
a servant, to pass the night in the same habitation.</p>
<p>What is genuine of this note, acknowledges your having <lb/>
lodged here. Thus much I cannot, and need not deny; <lb/>
yet how shall I make those distinctions visible to Mrs. <reg orig="Field-|er">Fielder</reg>; <lb/>
how shall I point out that spot in my billet, where the <lb/>
forgery begins? and at whose expense must I vindicate <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="eaf033v4_0095" pid="uva-lib:350104"/>
myself? Better incur the last degree of infamy myself, <lb/>
since it will not be deserved, than to load him that has gone <lb/>
with reproach. Talbot sleeps, I hope, in peace, and let me <lb/>
not, for any selfish or transitory good, molest his asbes. <lb/>
Shall I not be contented with the approbation of a pure and <lb/>
all-seeing judge?</p>
<p>But if I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> vindicate myself, I have not the power; I <lb/>
have forfeited my credit with my mother. With her my <lb/>
word will be of no weight; surely it ought to weigh nothing. <lb/>
Against evidence of this kind, communicated by a <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg>, <lb/>
shall the wild and improbable assertion of the <reg orig="crim-|inal">criminal</reg> <lb/>
be suffered to prevail? I have only my assertion to <lb/>
offer.</p>
<p>Yet, my good God! in what a maze hast thou permitted <lb/>
my unhappy feet to be entangled! With intentions void of <lb/>
blame, have I been pursued by all the consequences of the <lb/>
most atrocious guilt.</p>
<p>In an evil hour, Henry, was it that I saw thee first. <lb/>
What endless perplexities have beset me since that <reg orig="disas-|trous">disastrous</reg> <lb/>
moment. I cannot pray for their termination, for <lb/>
prayer implies hope.</p>
<p>For thy sake, God is my witness, more than for my own, <lb/>
have I determined to be no longer thine. I hereby <reg orig="solemn-|ly">solemnly</reg> <lb/>
absolve you from all engagements to me. I command <lb/>
you, I beseech you, not to cast away a thought on the illfated <lb/>
Jane. Seek a more worthy companion, and be happy.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will feel, not pity, but displeasure, in <reg orig="re-|ceiving">receiving</reg> <lb/>
this letter. You will not deign to answer me, <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg>, <lb/>
or will answer me with sharp rebuke. I have only <lb/>
lived to trouble your peace, and have no claim to your <reg orig="for-|bearance">forbearance</reg>; <lb/>
yet, methinks, I would be spared the misery of <lb/>
hearing your reproaches, reechoed as they will be by my <lb/>
own conscience. I fear they will but the more unfit me <lb/>
for the part that I wish henceforth to act.</p>
<p>I would carry, if possible, to Mrs. Fielder's presence a <lb/>
cheerful aspect. I would be to her that companion which <lb/>
I was in my brighter days. To study her happiness shall <lb/>
be henceforth my only office, but this, unless I can conceal <lb/>
from her an aching heart, I shall be unable to do. Let me <lb/>
not carry with me the insupportable weight of your <reg orig="re-|proaches">reproaches</reg>.</p>

<head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">To Jane Talbot.</hi></head>
<opener>
<dateline><name type="place">Baltimore,</name> October 31.</dateline>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">You</hi> had reason to fear my reproaches, yet you have <lb/>
strangely erred in imagining the cause for which I should <lb/>
blame you. You are never tired, my good friend, of <reg orig="hum-|bling">humbling</reg> <lb/>
me by injurious suppositions.</p>
<p>I do, indeed, reproach you for conduct that is rash; <lb/>
unjust; hurtful to yourself; to your mother; to me; to <lb/>
the memory of him who, whatever were his faults, has done <lb/>
nothing to forfeit your reverence.</p>
<p>You are charged with the blackest guilt that can be <reg orig="im-|puted">imputed</reg> <lb/>
to woman. To know you guilty produces more anguish <lb/>
in the mind of your accuser, than any other evil could <lb/>
produce, and to be convinced of your innocence, would <lb/>
be to remove the chief cause of her sorrow, yet you are <lb/>
contented to admit the charge; to countenance her error <lb/>
by your silence. By stating the simple truth, <reg orig="circumstan-|tially">circumstantially</reg> <lb/>
and fully; by adding earnest and pathetic assurances <lb/>
of your innocence; by shewing all the letters that have <lb/>
passed between us, the contents of which will shew that <lb/>
such guilt was impossible; by making your girl bear witness <lb/>
to the precaution you used on that night, to preclude <lb/>
misconstructions, surely you may hope to disarm her <reg orig="sus-|picions">suspicions</reg>.</p>
<p>But this proceeding has not occurred to you. You have <lb/>
mistrusted the power of truth, and even are willing to <reg orig="perpet-|uate">perpetuate</reg> <lb/>
the error. And why? because you will not blast the <lb/>
memory of the dead. The loss of your own reputation; <lb/>
the misery of your mother, whom your imaginary guilt <lb/>
makes miserable, are of less moment in your eyes than&mdash; <lb/>
what? let not him, my girl, who knows thee best, have most <lb/>
reason to blush for thee.</p>
<p>Talbot, you imagine, forged this calumny. It was a <lb/>
wrong thing and much unhappiness has flowed from it. This <lb/>
calumny, you have it, at length, in your power to refute. <lb/>
Its past effects cannot be recalled, but here the evil may <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="eaf033v4_0097" pid="uva-lib:350106"/>
end, the mistake may be cleared up, and be hindered from <lb/>
destroying the future peace of your mother.</p>
<p>Yet you forbear from tenderness to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> memory, who, <lb/>
if you are consistent with yourself, you must believe to look <lb/>
back on that transaction with remorse, to lament every evil <lb/>
which it has hitherto occasioned, and to rejoice in the means <lb/>
of stopping the disastrous series.</p>
<p>My happiness is just of as little value. Your mother's <lb/>
wishes, though allowed to be irrational and groundless, are <lb/>
to be gratified by the disappointment of mine, which appear <lb/>
to be just and reasonable, and since one must be sacrificed, <lb/>
that affection with which you have inspired me; and those <lb/>
benefits you confess to owe to me; those sufferings believed <lb/>
by you to have been incurred by me for your sake, do not, <lb/>
it seems, entitle me to preference.</p>
<p>On this score, however, my good girl, set your heart at <lb/>
ease. I never assumed the merits you attributed to me. I <lb/>
never urged the claims you were once so eager to admit. <lb/>
I desire not the preference. If, by abjuring me, your <reg orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
could be secured; if it were possible for you to be <lb/>
that cheerful companion of your mother, which you seem so <lb/>
greatly to wish; if, in her society, you could stifle every <lb/>
regret, and prevent your tranquillity from being invaded by <lb/>
self-reproach, most gladly would I persuade you to go to <lb/>
her, and dismiss me from your thoughts forever.</p>
<p>But I know, Jane, that this cannot be. You never will <lb/>
enjoy peace under your mother's roof. The sighing heart <lb/>
and the saddened features, will forever upbraid her, and <lb/>
bickering and repining will mar every domestic scene. Your <lb/>
mother's aversion to me is far from irreconcilable, but that <lb/>
which will hasten reconcilement will be <hi rend="italic">marriage.</hi> You <lb/>
cannot forfeit her love as long as you preserve your <reg orig="integri-|ty">integrity</reg>, <lb/>
and those scruples, which no argument will dissipate, will <lb/>
yield to reflection on an evil (as she will regard it) that <reg orig="can-|not">cannot</reg> <lb/>
be remedied.</p>
<p>Admitting me, in this respect, to be mistaken, your <reg orig="moth-|er's">mother's</reg> <lb/>
resentment will ever give you disquiet. True, but will <lb/>
your union with me, console you nothing? in pressing the <lb/>
hoped for fruit of that union to your breast; in that <reg orig="ten-|derness">tenderness</reg> <lb/>
which you will hourly receive from me, will then <lb/>
be nothing to compensate you for sorrows in which there is <lb/>
<pb n="85" entity="eaf033v4_0098" pid="uva-lib:350107"/>
no remorse, and which, indeed, will owe their poignancy to <lb/>
the generosity of your spirit?</p>
<p>You cannot unite yourself to me, but with some view to <lb/>
my happiness. Will your contributing to that happiness be <lb/>
nothing?</p>
<p>Yet I cannot separate my felicity from your's. I can <lb/>
enjoy nothing at the cost of your peace. In whatever way <lb/>
you decide, may the fruit be content.</p>
<p>I ask you not for proofs of love; for the sacrifice of others <lb/>
to me. My happiness demands it not. It only requires <lb/>
you to seek your own good. Nothing but ceaseless <reg orig="repin-|ings">repinings</reg> <lb/>
can follow your compliance with your mother's wishes; <lb/>
but there is something in your power to do. You can hide <lb/>
these repinings from her, by living at a distance from her. <lb/>
She may know you only through the medium of your letters, <lb/>
and these may exhibit the brightest side of things. She <lb/>
wants nothing but your divorce from me, and that may take <lb/>
place without living under her roof.</p>
<p>You need not stay here. The world is wide and she <lb/>
will eagerly consent to the breaking of your shackles by <lb/>
change of residence. Much and the best part of your <reg orig="coun-|try">country</reg> <lb/>
you have never seen. Variety of objects will amuse you, <lb/>
and new faces and new minds erase the deep impressions <lb/>
of the past. Colden and his merits may sink into <reg orig="forgetful-|ness">forgetfulness</reg>, <lb/>
or be thought of with no other emotion than regret that <lb/>
a being so worthless was ever beloved.&mdash;But I wander from <lb/>
the true point. I meant not to introduce myself into this <lb/>
letter.&mdash;Self! That vile debaser whom I detest as my worst <lb/>
enemy, and who assumes a thousand shapes and practises a <lb/>
thousand wiles to entice me from the right path.</p>
<p>Ah! Jane. Could thy sagacity discover no other cause <lb/>
of thy mother's error than Talbot's fraud? Could thy <lb/>
heart so readily impute to him so black a treachery? Such <lb/>
a prompt and undoubting conclusion, it grieves me to find <lb/>
thee capable of.</p>
<p>How much more likely that Talbot was himself deceived. <lb/>
For it was not by him that thy unfinished letter was <reg orig="pur-|loined">purloined</reg>. <lb/>
At that moment he was probably some thousands <lb/>
of miles distant. It was five weeks before his return from <lb/>
his Hamburg voyage, when that mysterious incident <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg>.</p>
<pb n="86" entity="eaf033v4_0099" pid="uva-lib:350108"/>
<p>Be of good cheer, my sweet girl. I doubt not all will <lb/>
be well. We shall find the means of detecting and <reg orig="defeat-|ing">defeating</reg> <lb/>
this conspiracy, and of re-establishing thee in thy <reg orig="mo-|ther's">mother's</reg> <lb/>
good opinion. At present, I own, I do not see the <lb/>
means; but to say truth, my mind is clouded by anxieties; <lb/>
enfeebled by watching and fatigue.</p>
<p>You know why I came hither. I found my friend in a <lb/>
very bad way, and have no hope but that his pangs, which <lb/>
must end within a few days, may, for his sake, terminate <lb/>
very soon. He will not part with me, and I have seldom <lb/>
left his chamber since I came.</p>
<p>Your letter has disturbed me much, and I seize this <reg orig="in-|terval">interval</reg>, <lb/>
when the sick man has gained a respite from his pain, <lb/>
to tell you my thoughts upon it. I fear I have not reasoned <lb/>
very clearly. Some peevishness, I doubt not, has crept into <lb/>
my style. I rely upon your wonted goodness to excuse it.</p>
<p>I have much to say upon this affecting subject, but must <lb/>
take a future opportunity.</p>
<p>I also have received a letter from Mrs. Fielder, of which <lb/>
I will say no more, since I send you enclosed <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> and my <lb/>
answer. I wish it had come at a time when my mind was <lb/>
more at ease, as an immediate reply seemed to be <reg orig="neces-|sary">necessary</reg>. <lb/>

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Madam,</hi></salute>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> would indeed be needless to apologize for your <reg orig="be-|havior">behavior</reg> <lb/>
to me. I not only acquit you of any enmity to me, <lb/>
but beg leave to return you my warmest thanks for the <lb/>
generous offers which you have made me in this letter.</p>
<p>I should be grossly wanting in that love for Mrs. Talbot <lb/>
which you believe me to possess, if I did not partake in <lb/>
that gratitude and reverence which she feels for one, who <lb/>
has performed for her every parental duty. The esteem of <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="eaf033v4_0100" pid="uva-lib:350109"/>
the good is only of less value in my eyes than the <reg orig="approba-|tion">approbation</reg> <lb/>
of my own conscience. There is no price which I <lb/>
would not pay for your good opinion, consistent with a just <lb/>
regard to that of others and to my own.</p>
<p>I cannot be pleased with the information which you give <lb/>
me. For the sake of my friend, I am grieved that you are <lb/>
determined to make her marriage with me, the forfeiture <lb/>
of that provision which your bounty has hitherto supplied <lb/>
her.</p>
<p>Forgive me if I say, that in exacting this forfeiture, you <lb/>
will not be consistent with yourself. On her marriage with <lb/>
me, she will stand in much more need of your bounty than <lb/>
at present, and her merits, however slender you may deem <lb/>
them, will then be, at least, <hi rend="italic">not less</hi> than they now are.</p>
<p>If there were any methods by which I might be <reg orig="pre-|vented">prevented</reg> <lb/>
from sharing in gifts bestowed upon my wife, I <lb/>
would eagerly concur in them.</p>
<p>I fully believe that your motive in giving me this timely <lb/>
warning was a generous one. Yet, in justice to myself and <lb/>
your daughter, I must observe that the warning was <reg orig="super-|fluous">superfluous</reg>, <lb/>
since Jane never concealed from me the true state <lb/>
of her affairs, and since I never imagined you would honor <lb/>
with your gifts a marriage contracted against your will.</p>
<p>Well do I know the influence of early indulgences. Your <lb/>
daughter is a strong example of that influence, nor will her <lb/>
union with me, if, by that union she forfeit your favor, be <lb/>
any thing more than a choice among evils, all of which are <lb/>
heavy.</p>
<p>My own education and experience sufficiently testify the <lb/>
importance of riches, and I should be the last to despise <lb/>
or depreciate their value. Still, much as habit has <reg orig="en-|deared">endeared</reg> <lb/>
to me the goods of fortune, I am far from setting <lb/>
them above all other goods.</p>
<p>You offer me, Madam, a large alms. Valuable to me as <lb/>
that sum is, and eagerly as I would accept it in any other <lb/>
circumstances, yet, at present, I must, however reluctantly, <lb/>
decline it. A voyage to Europe and such a sum, if your <lb/>
daughter's happiness were not in question, would be the <reg orig="ut-|most">utmost</reg> <lb/>
bound of my wishes.</p>
<p>"Shall I be able to compensate her&mdash;" you ask.</p>
<p>No, indeed, Madam, I am far from deeming myself <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="eaf033v4_0101" pid="uva-lib:350110"/>
qualified to compensate her for the loss of property, <reg orig="reputa-|tion">reputation</reg> <lb/>
and friends. I aspire to nothing but to console her <lb/>
under that loss, and to husband as frugally as I can, those <lb/>
few meagre remnants of happiness which shall be left to us.</p>
<p>I have seen your late letter to her. I should be less than <lb/>
man if I were not greatly grieved at the contents; yet, <lb/>
Madam, I am not cast down below the hope of convincing <lb/>
you that the charge made against your daughter is false. <lb/>
You could not do otherwise than believe it. It is for us to <lb/>
show you by what means, you, and probably Talbot <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>, <lb/>
have been deceived.</p>
<p>To suffer your charge to pass, for a moment, <reg orig="uncontra-|dicted">uncontradicted</reg>, <lb/>
would be unjust, not more to ourselves than to you. <lb/>
The mere denial will not, and ought not to change your <lb/>
opinion. It may even tend to raise higher the acrimony of <lb/>
your aversion to me. It must ever be irksome to a <reg orig="gene-|rous">generous</reg> <lb/>
spirit to deny, without the power of disproving, but a <lb/>
tacit admission of the charge would be unworthy of those <lb/>
who know themselves innocent.</p>
<p>Beseeching your favorable thoughts, and grateful for the <lb/>
good which, but for the interference of higher duties, your <lb/>
heart would prompt you to give, and mine would not <reg orig="scru-|ple">scruple</reg> <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Ah</hi>! my friend! how mortifying are those proofs of thy <lb/>
excellence. How deep is that debasement into which I <lb/>
am sunk, when I compare myself with thee.</p>
<p>It cannot be the want of love that makes thee so easily <lb/>
give me up. My feeble and jealous heart is ever prone to <lb/>
suspect; yet I ought at length to be above these ungenerous <lb/>
surmises.</p>
<p>My own demerits; my fickleness; my precipitation are so <lb/>

<pb n="89" entity="eaf033v4_0102" pid="uva-lib:350111"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">9</fw></pb>
to impute to thee that contempt for me, which I know I so <lb/>
richly deserve. I am astonished that so poor a thing as <lb/>
I am, thus continually betraying her weakness, should <reg orig="re-|tain">retain</reg> <lb/>
thy affection; yet at any proof of coldness or <reg orig="indiffer-|ence">indifference</reg> <lb/>
in thee, do I grow impatient; melancholy; a strange <lb/>
mixture of upbraiding for myself, and resentment for thee, <lb/>
occupies my feelings.</p>
<p>I have read thy letter. I shuddered when I painted to <lb/>
myself thy unhappiness on receiving tidings of my <reg orig="resolu-|tion">resolution</reg> <lb/>
to join my mother. I felt that thy reluctance to part <lb/>
with me, would form the strongest obstacle to going, and <lb/>
yet, being convinced that I must go, I wanted thee to <reg orig="coun-|terfeit">counterfeit</reg> <lb/>
indifference, to feign compliance.</p>
<p>And such a wayward heart is mine that now these <reg orig="assur-|ances">assurances</reg> <lb/>
of thy compliance have come to hand, I am not <reg orig="satis-|fied">satisfied</reg>. <lb/>
The poor contriver wished to find in thee an <reg orig="affec-|tation">affectation</reg> <lb/>
of indifference. Her humanity would be satisfied <lb/>
with that appearance, but her pride demanded that it should <lb/>
be no more than a veil, behind which the inconsolable, the <lb/>
bleeding heart should be distinctly seen.</p>
<p>You are too much in earnest in your equanimity. You <lb/>
study my exclusive happiness with too unimpassioned a soul. <lb/>
You are pleased when I am pleased; but not, it seems, the <lb/>
more so from any relation which my pleasure bears to you; <lb/>
no matter what it is that pleases me; so I am but pleased, <lb/>
you are content.</p>
<p>I don't like this oblivion of self. I want to be essential to <lb/>
your happiness. I want to act with a view to your interests <lb/>
and wishes; these wishes requiring my love and my <reg orig="com-|pany">company</reg> <lb/>
for your own sake.</p>
<p>But I have got into a maze again. Puzzling myself with <lb/>
intricate distinctions. I can't be satisfied with telling you <lb/>
that I am not well, but I must be inspecting with these <reg orig="care-|ful">careful</reg> <lb/>
eyes into causes, and laboring to tell you of what nature <lb/>
my malady is.</p>
<p>It has always been so. I have always found an <reg orig="unac-|countable">unaccountable</reg> <lb/>
pleasure in dissecting, as it were, my heart; <reg orig="un-|covering">uncovering</reg>, <lb/>
one by one, its many folds, and laying it before <lb/>
you, as a country is shewn in a map. This voluble tongue, <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="eaf033v4_0103" pid="uva-lib:350112"/>
and this prompt pen! what volumes have I talked to you on <lb/>
that bewitching theme myself?</p>
<p>And yet, loquacious as I am, I never interrupted you <lb/>
when you were talking. It was always such a favor when <lb/>
these rigid fibres of yours relaxed; and yet I praise myself <lb/>
for more forbearance than belongs to me. The little <reg orig="im-|pertinent">impertinent</reg> <lb/>
has often stopped your mouth; at times too when <lb/>
your talk charmed her most; but then it was not with <lb/>
words.</p>
<p>But have I not said this a score of times before? and why <lb/>
do I indulge this prate now?</p>
<p>To say truth, I am perplexed and unhappy. Your <lb/>
letter has made me so. My heart flutters too much to <lb/>
allow me to attend to the subject of your letter. I follow <lb/>
this rambling leader merely to escape from more arduous <lb/>
paths, and I send you this scribble because I must write to <lb/>
you. Adieu.</p>

back upon my former state of mind, as on something that <lb/>
passed when I was a lunatic or dreaming.</p>
<p>It is but a day since I determined to part with you; <lb/>
since a thousand tormenting images engrossed my <reg orig="imagina-|tion">imagination</reg>; <lb/>
yet now am I quite changed; I am bound to you by <lb/>
links stronger than ever. No, I will not part with you.</p>
<p>Yet how shall I excuse my noncompliance to my mother? <lb/>
I have told her that I would come to her, that I waited <lb/>
only for her directions as to the disposal of her property. <lb/>
What will be her disappointment when I tell her that I will <lb/>
not come; when she finds me, in spite of her remonstrances, <lb/>
still faithful to my engagements to thee.</p>
<p>Is there no method of removing this aversion? of <reg orig="out-|rooting">outrooting</reg> <lb/>
this deadly prejudice? And must I, in giving myself <lb/>
to thee, forfeit her affection?</p>
<p>And now this dreadful charge! no wonder that her <reg orig="affec-|tionate">affectionate</reg> <lb/>
heart was sorely wounded by such seeming proofs <lb/>
of my wickedness.</p>
<p>I thought at first&mdash;shame upon my inconsistent character! <lb/>
my incurable blindness! I should never have doubted the <lb/>
truth of my first thoughts, if you had not helped me to a <lb/>
more candid conjecture. I was unjust enough to load <hi rend="italic">him</hi> <lb/>
with the guilt of this plot against me, and imagined there <lb/>
was duty in forbearing to detect it.</p>
<p>Now, by thy means, do I judge otherwise. Yet how my <lb/>
friend shall I unravel this mystery? my heart is truly sad. <lb/>
How easily is my woman's courage lowered, and how prone <lb/>
am I to despond.</p>
<p>Lend me thy aid, thy helping hand, my beloved. Decide <lb/>
and act for me, and be my weakness fortified; my hope <reg orig="re-|stored">restored</reg> <lb/>
by thee. Let me lose all separate feelings, all <reg orig="sepa-|rate">separate</reg> <lb/>
existence, and let me know no principle of action, but <lb/>
the decision of your judgment; no motive or desire but to <lb/>
please; to gratify you.</p>
<p>Our marriage, you say, will facilitate reconcilement with <lb/>
my mother. Do you think so? Then let it take place, my <lb/>
dear Hal. Heaven permit that marriage may tend to <reg orig="recon-|cile">reconcile</reg>; <lb/>
but let it reconcile or not, if the wish be yours, it shall <lb/>
occupy the chief place in my heart. The time, the <reg orig="man-|ner">manner</reg>, <lb/>
be it yours to prescribe. My happiness, on that event, <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="eaf033v4_0105" pid="uva-lib:350114"/>
will surely want but little to complete it, and if you hid <lb/>
me not despair of my mother's acquiescence, I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> not <lb/>
despair.</p>
<p>I am to send your letter, after reading, to my mother, I <lb/>
suppose. I have read it, Hal, more than once. And for <lb/>
my sake thou declinest her offers. When you thus refuse <lb/>
no sacrifice on my account, shall I hesitate, when it becomes <lb/>
my turn? Shall I ever want gratitude, thinkest thou? Shall <lb/>
I ever imagine that I have done enough to evince my <lb/>
gratitude?</p>
<p>But how do I forget thy present situation. Thy dying <lb/>
friend has scarcely occurred to me. Thy afflictions, thy <lb/>
fatigues, are absorbed in my own selfish cares.</p>
<p>I am very often on the brink of hating myself. So much <lb/>
thoughtlessness of others; such callousness to sorrows not <lb/>
my own; my hard heart has often reproached thee for <lb/>
sparing a sigh or a wish from me; that every gloom has not <lb/>
been dispelled by my presence, was treason, forsooth, <lb/>
against my majesty, and the murmurs that delighted love <lb/>
should breathe, to welcome thy return, were changed into <lb/>
half vindictive reluctance; not quite a frown, and <reg orig="upbraid-|ings">upbraidings</reg>, <lb/>
in which tenderness was almost turned out of door by <lb/>
anger.</p>
<p>In the present case, for instance, I have scarcely thought <lb/>
of thy dying friend once. How much thy disquiets would <lb/>
be augmented by the letters which I sent thee, never <reg orig="enter-|ed">entered</reg> <lb/>
my thoughts. To hide our sorrows from those who love <lb/>
us, seems to be no more than generous. Yet I never hide <lb/>
any thing from thee. All was uttered that was felt. I <lb/>
considered not attending circumstances. The bird, as soon <lb/>
as it was scared, flew into the bosom that was nearest, and <lb/>
merely occupied with dangers of its own, was satisfied to <lb/>
find a refuge there.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">And yet,</hi>&mdash;See now, Vanity, the cunning advocate, <reg orig="enter-|ing">entering</reg> <lb/>
with his&mdash;<hi rend="italic">And yet.</hi> Would I listen to him, what a <lb/>
world of palliations and apologies would he furnish. How <lb/>
would he remind me of cases in which my sympathy was <lb/>
always awakened with attention. How often&mdash;But I will <lb/>
not listen to the flatterer.</p>
<p>And now I think of it, Hal, you differ from me very <lb/>
much in that respect. Every mournful secret must be <lb/>
<pb n="93" entity="eaf033v4_0106" pid="uva-lib:350115"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">9*</fw></pb>
wrung from you. You hoard up all your evil thoughts, and <lb/>
brood over them alone. Nothing but earnest importunity <lb/>
ever got from you any of your griefs.</p>
<p>Now this is cruel to yourself and unjust to me. It is <lb/>
denying my claim to confidence. It is holding back from <lb/>
me a part of yourself. It is setting light by my sympathy.</p>
<p>And yet&mdash;the prater Vanity once more, you see&mdash;but I <lb/>
will let him speak out this time. Here his apology is yours, <lb/>
and myself am only flattered indirectly.</p>
<p>And yet when I have extorted from you any secret <reg orig="sor-|row">sorrow</reg>, <lb/>
you have afterwards acknowledged that the disclosure <lb/>
was of use. That my sympathizing love was grateful to <lb/>
you, and my counsel of some value; that you drew from <lb/>
my conduct on those occasions new proofs of my strength <lb/>
of mind, and of my right, a right which my affection for <lb/>
you gave me, to share with you all your thoughts.</p>
<p>Yet on the next occasion that offers, you are sure to <reg orig="re-|lapse">relapse</reg> <lb/>
into your habitual taciturnity, and my labors to subdue <lb/>
it are again to be repeated. I have sometimes been tempted <lb/>
to retaliate and convince you, by the effects of my <reg orig="conceal-|ments">concealments</reg> <lb/>
upon you, of the error of your own scheme.</p>
<p>But I never could persist, in silence, for five minutes <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg>. <lb/>
Shut up as the temple of my heart is, to the rest <lb/>
of mankind, all its doors fly open of their own accord, <lb/>
when you approach.</p>
<p>Now am I got into my usual strain; in which I could <lb/>
persevere forever. No wonder it charms me so much, <lb/>
since, while thus pursuing it, I lose all my cares in a sweet <lb/>
oblivion, but I must stop, at last, and recall my thoughts to <lb/>
a less welcome subject.</p>
<p>Painful as it is, I must write to my mother. I will do it <lb/>
now, and send you my letter. I will endeavor, hereafter, <lb/>
to keep alive a salutary distrust of myself, and do nothing <lb/>
without your approbation and direction. Such submission <lb/>
becomes thy</p>

<head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">To Mrs. Fielder.</hi></head>
<opener>
<dateline><name type="place">Philadelphia,</name> November 4.</dateline>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I tremble</hi> thus to approach my honored mother, once <lb/>
more, since I cannot bring into her presence the heart that <lb/>
she wishes to find. Instead of acknowledgment of faults, <lb/>
and penitence suitable to their heinous nature, I must bring <lb/>
with me a bosom free from self-reproach, and a confidence <lb/>
which innocence only can give, that I shall be sometime <lb/>
able to disprove the charge brought against me.</p>
<p>Ah, my mother! could such guilt as this ever stain a <lb/>
heart, fashioned by your tenderest care! Did it never <lb/>
occur to you that possibly some mistake might have misled <lb/>
the witness against me!</p>
<p>The letter which you sent me is partly mine. All that <lb/>
is honest and laudable is mine, but that which confesses <lb/>
dishonor has been added by another hand. By whom <lb/>
my hand-writing was counterfeited, and for what end, I <lb/>
know not. I cannot name any one who deserves to be <lb/>
suspected.</p>
<p>I might proceed to explain the circumstances attending <lb/>
the writing and the loss of this letter, so fatal to me; but I <lb/>
forbear to attempt to justify myself by means which I know <lb/>
before hand, will effect nothing; unless it be to aggravate, <lb/>
in your eyes, my imaginary guilt.</p>
<p>If it were possible for you to suspend your judgment; if <lb/>
the most open, and earnest, and positive averments of my <lb/>
innocence could induce you, not to reverse, but merely to <lb/>
postpone your sentence, you would afford me unspeakable <lb/>
happiness.</p>
<p>You tell me that the loss of your present bounty will be <lb/>
the consequence of my marriage. My claims on you are <lb/>
long ago at an end. Indeed, I never had any claims. <lb/>
Your treatment of me has flown from your unconstrained <lb/>
benevolence. For what you have given; for the <reg orig="tender-|ness">tenderness</reg> <lb/>
which you continually bestowed on me, you have <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
only disappointment and affliction.</p>
<pb n="95" entity="eaf033v4_0108" pid="uva-lib:350117"/>
<p>For all your favors, I seem to you ungrateful; yet long <lb/>
after that conduct was known, which, to you, proves my <reg orig="un-|worthiness">unworthiness</reg>, <lb/>
your protection has continued, and you are so <lb/>
good as to assure me that it shall not be withdrawn as long <lb/>
as I have no protector but you.</p>
<p>Dear as my education has made the indulgences of <reg orig="com-|petence">competence</reg> <lb/>
to me, I hope, I shall relinquish them without a sigh. <lb/>
Had you done nothing more than screen my infancy and <lb/>
youth from hardship and poverty, than supplied the mere <lb/>
needs of nature, my debt to you could never be paid.</p>
<p>But how much more than this have you done for me? <lb/>
you have given me, by your instructions and example, an <lb/>
understanding and a heart. You have taught me to value <lb/>
a fair fame beyond every thing but the peace of virtue; you <lb/>
have made me capable of a generous affection for a <reg orig="bene-|factor">benefactor</reg> <lb/>
equal to yourself; capable of acting so as, at once, <lb/>
to <hi rend="italic">deserve,</hi> and to <hi rend="italic">lose</hi> your esteem; and enabled me to <reg orig="re-|linquish">relinquish</reg> <lb/>
cheerfully those comforts and luxuries which cannot <lb/>
be retained but at the price of my integrity.</p>
<p>I look forward to poverty without dismay. Perhaps I <lb/>
make light of its evils, because I have never tried them. I <lb/>
am indeed a weak and undiscerning creature. Yet nothing <lb/>
but experience will correct my error, if it be an error.</p>
<p>So sanguine am I that I even cherish the belief that the <lb/>
privation of much of that ease which I have hitherto <reg orig="enjoy-|ed">enjoyed</reg>, <lb/>
will strengthen my mind, and somewhat qualify me for <lb/>
enduring those evils which I cannot expect always to <lb/>
escape.</p>
<p>You know, my mother, that the loss of my present <reg orig="pro-|vision">provision</reg>, <lb/>
will not leave me destitute. If it did, I know your <lb/>
generosity too well, to imagine that you would withdraw from <lb/>
me all the means of support.</p>
<p>Indeed my own fund, slender as it is, in comparison with <lb/>
what your bounty supplies me, is adequate to all my <reg orig="person-|al">personal</reg> <lb/>
wants; I am sure it would prove so on the trial. So <lb/>
that I part with your gifts with less reluctance, though with <lb/>
no dimunition of my gratitude.</p>
<p>If I could bring to you, my faith unbroken, and were <lb/>
allowed to present to you my friend, I would instantly fly to <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="eaf033v4_0109" pid="uva-lib:350118"/>
your presence; but, that is a felicity too great for my hope. <lb/>

<head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">To Mrs. Talbot.</hi></head>
<opener>
<dateline><name type="place">Baltimore,</name> November 5.</dateline>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I highly</hi> approve of your letter. It far exceeded the <lb/>
expectations I had formed of you. You are, indeed, a <lb/>
surprising creature.</p>
<p>One cannot fail to be astonished at the differences of <reg orig="hu-|man">human</reg> <lb/>
characters; at the opposite principles by which the <lb/>
judgments of men are influenced.</p>
<p>Experience, however, is the antidote of wonder. There <lb/>
was a time when I should have reflected on the sentiments <lb/>
of your mother, with a firm belief that no human being <lb/>
could be practically influenced by them.</p>
<p>She offers, and surely with sincerity, to divide her large <lb/>
property with you; to give away half her estate during be <lb/>
own life, and while, indeed, she is yet in her prime; and so <lb/>
whom give it? To one who has no natural relation to her; <lb/>
who is merely an adopted child; who has acted for several <lb/>
years, in direct repugnance to her will; in a manner she <reg orig="re-|gards">regards</reg> <lb/>
as not only indiscreet, but flagrantly criminal. Whom <lb/>
one guilty act has (so it must appear to your mamma) <lb/>
involved her in a continued series of falsehoods and <lb/>
frauds.</p>
<p>She offers this immense gift to you, on no condition but <lb/>
a mere verbal promise to break off intercourse with the <lb/>
man you love, and with whom you have been actually <lb/>
criminal.</p>
<p>She seems not aware how easily promises are made that <lb/>
are not designed to be performed; how absurd it would be <lb/>
to rely upon your integrity in this respect, when you have <lb/>
shewn yourself (so, it must appear to her) grossly defective <lb/>
in others of infinitely greater moment. How easily might <lb/>
a heart like yours be persuaded to recall its promises; or <lb/>
<pb n="97" entity="eaf033v4_0110" pid="uva-lib:350119"/>
violate this condition, as soon as the performance of her <reg orig="con-|tract">contract</reg> <lb/>
has made you independent of her and of the world.</p>
<p>You promise;&mdash;it is done in half a dozen syllables&mdash;that <lb/>
you will see the hated Colden no more. All that you <lb/>
promise, you intend. Tomorrow she enriches you with <lb/>
half her fortune. Next day, the seducer comes, and may <lb/>
surely expect to prevail on you to forget this promise, since <lb/>
he has conquered your firmness in a case of unspeakably <lb/>
greater importance.</p>
<p>This offer of hers surely indicates, not only love for you <lb/>
but reverence, for your good faith inconsistent with the <reg orig="hor-|rid">horrid</reg> <lb/>
imputation she has urged against you.</p>
<p>As to me, what a portrait does her letter exhibit. And <lb/>
yet this scoffer at the obligation of a promise, is offered <lb/>
four or five thousand dollars on condition that he plights his <lb/>
word to embark for England, and to give up all his hopes <lb/>
of you.</p>
<p>Villain as he is; a villain not by habit or by passion, but <lb/>
by <hi rend="italic">principle;</hi> a cool blooded, systematic villain; yet she will <lb/>
give him affluence and the means of depraving thousands, <lb/>
by his example and his rhetoric, on condition that he <reg orig="re-|fuses">refuses</reg> <lb/>
to marry the woman whom he has made an adulteress. <lb/>
Who has imbibed, from the contagion of his discourse, all <lb/>
the practical and speculative turpitude which he has to <lb/>
impart.</p>
<p>This conduct might be considered only as proving her <lb/>
aversion to me. So strong is it, as to impel her to indiscreet <lb/>
and self-destructive expedients; and so I should likewise <lb/>
reason if these very expedients did not argue a confidence <lb/>
in my integrity somewhat inconsistent with the censure <lb/>
passed on my morals.</p>
<p>After all, is there not reason to question the sincerity of <lb/>
her hatred? Is not thy mother a dissembler, Jane? does <lb/>
she really credit the charge she makes against thee? does <lb/>
she really suppose me that insane philosopher which her <reg orig="let-|ter">letter</reg> <lb/>
describes?</p>
<p>Yet this is only leaping from a ditch into a quicksand. It <lb/>
is quite as hard to account for her dissimulation, as for her <lb/>
sincerity. Why should she pretend to suspect <hi rend="italic">you</hi> of so <lb/>
black a deed, or me of such abominable tenets?</p>
<pb n="98" entity="eaf033v4_0111" pid="uva-lib:350120"/>
<p>And yet, an observer might say, it is one thing to <reg orig="pro-|mise">promise</reg> <lb/>
and another to perform in her case as well as in ours. <lb/>
She tells us what she <hi rend="italic">will do,</hi> provided we enter into such <lb/>
engagements, but, if we should embrace her offers, is it <lb/>
certain that she would not hesitate, repent, and retract?</p>
<p>Passion may dictate large and vehement offers upon <reg orig="pa-|per">paper</reg>, <lb/>
which deliberating prudence would never allow to be <lb/>
literally adhered to.</p>
<p>Besides, may not these magnificent proposals be dictated <lb/>
by a knowledge of our characters, which assured her that <lb/>
they would never be accepted. But, with this belief, why <lb/>
should the offers be made?</p>
<p>The answer is easy. These offers, by the kindness and <lb/>
respect for us which they manifest, engage our esteem and <lb/>
gratitude, and by their magnitude, shew how deeply she <lb/>
abhors this connexion, and hence dispose us to do that, for <lb/>
pity's sake, which mere lucre would never recommend.</p>
<p>And here is a string of guesses to amuse thee, Jane. <lb/>
Their truth or falsehood is of little moment to us, since <lb/>
these offers ought not to influence our conduct.</p>
<p>One thing is sure; that is, thy mother's aversion to me. <lb/>
And yet I ought not to blame her. That I am an atheist <lb/>
in morals, the seducer of her daughter, she fully believes, <lb/>
and these are surely sufficient objections to me. Would she <lb/>
be a discerning friend; or virtuous mother if she did not <lb/>
with this belief remonstrate against your alliance with one <lb/>
so wicked.</p>
<p>The fault lies not with her. With whom then does it lie? <lb/>
Or, what only is important, where is the remedy? <reg orig="Ex-|postulation">Expostulation</reg> <lb/>
and remonstrance will avail nothing. I cannot <lb/>
be a hypocrite, I cannot dissemble that I have <hi rend="italic">once</hi> been <lb/>
criminal; and that I am, at present, conscious of a <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg> <lb/>
weaknesses and self distrusts. There is but one <reg orig="mea-|gre">meagre</reg> <lb/>
and equivocal merit that belongs to me. I stick to the <lb/>
truth; yet this is a virtue of late growth. It has not yet <lb/>
acquired firmness to resist the undermining waves of habit, <lb/>
or to be motionless amidst the hurricane of passions.</p>
<p>You offer me yourself. I love you. Shall I not then <lb/>
accept your offer? Shall my high conception of your <lb/>
merits, and my extreme contempt and distrust of myself, <lb/>
hinder me from receiving so precious a boon? Shall I not <lb/>
<pb n="99" entity="eaf033v4_0112" pid="uva-lib:350121"/>
make happy by being happy? Since you value me so <lb/>
much beyond my merits; since my faults though fully <reg orig="dis-|closed">disclosed</reg> <lb/>
to you, do not abate your esteem, do not change <lb/>
your views in my favor, shall I withhold my hand?</p>
<p>I am not obdurate. I am not ungrateful. With you I <lb/>
never was a hypocrite. With the rest of the world I have <lb/>
ceased to be so. If I look forward without confidence, I <lb/>
look back with humiliation and remorse. I have always <lb/>
wished to be good, but till I knew you, I despaired of ever <lb/>
being so, and even now my hopes are perpetually drooping.</p>
<p>I sometimes question, especially since your actual <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
is known, whether I should accept your offered hand; <lb/>
but mistake me not, my beloved creature. My distrust <lb/>
does not arise from any doubts of my own constancy. That <lb/>
I shall grow indifferent or forgetful or ungrateful to you, can <lb/>
never be.</p>
<p>All my doubts are connected with you. Can I <reg orig="compen-|sate">compensate</reg> <lb/>
you for those losses which will follow your marriage. <lb/>
The loss of your mother's affection; the exchange of all <lb/>
that splendor and abundance you have hitherto enjoyed for <lb/>
obscurity and indigence.</p>
<p>You say I <hi rend="italic">can.</hi> The image of myself in my own mind <lb/>
is a sorry compound of hateful or despicable qualities. I <lb/>
am even out of humor with my person, my face. So <reg orig="ab-|surd">absurd</reg> <lb/>
am I in my estimates of merit, that my homely <reg orig="fea-|tures">features</reg> <lb/>
and my scanty form, had their part in restraining me <lb/>
from aspiring to one supreme in loveliness, and in causing <lb/>
the surprise that followed the discovery of your passion.</p>
<p>In your eyes, however, this mind and this person are <lb/>
venerable and attractive. My affection, my company, are <lb/>
chief goods with you. The possession of all other goods <lb/>
cannot save you from misery, if this be wanting. The loss <lb/>
of all others will not bereave you of happiness if this be <reg orig="pos-|sessed">possessed</reg>.</p>
<p>Fain would I believe you. You decide but reasonably. <lb/>
Fortune's goods ought not to be so highly prized, as the <lb/>
reason of many prizes them, and as my habits, in spite of <lb/>
reason's dissent, and remonstrances compel me to prize <lb/>
them. They contribute less to your happiness, and that <lb/>
industry and frugality which supplies their place, you look <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="eaf033v4_0113" pid="uva-lib:350122"/>
upon without disgust; with even some degree of <reg orig="satisfac-|tion">satisfaction</reg>.</p>
<p>Not so I; I cannot labor for bread; I cannot work to live. <lb/>
In that respect I have no parallel. The world does not <reg orig="con-|tain">contain</reg> <lb/>
my likeness. My very nature unfits me for any <reg orig="profit-|able">profitable</reg> <lb/>
business. My dependence must ever be on others or <lb/>
on fortune.</p>
<p>As to the influence of some stronger motive to industry <lb/>
than has yet occurred; I am without hope. There can be <lb/>
no stronger ones to a generous mind, than have long been <lb/>
urgent with me; being proof against these, none will ever <lb/>
conquer my reluctance.</p>
<p>I am not indolent, but my activity is vague; profitless; <lb/>
capricious. No lucrative or noble purpose impels me. I <lb/>
aim at nothing but selfish gratification. I have no relish, <lb/>
indeed, for sensual indulgences. It is the intellectual taste <lb/>
that calls for such banquets as imagination and science can <lb/>
furnish; but though less sordid than the epicure, the <reg orig="volup-|tuary">voluptuary</reg>, <lb/>
or the sportsman, the principle that governs them and <lb/>
me is the same; equally limited to self; equally void of any <lb/>
basis in morals or religion.</p>
<p>Should you give yourself to me, and rely upon my <hi rend="italic">labor</hi> <lb/>
for shelter and food, deplorable and complete would be <lb/>
your disappointment. I know myself too well to trust <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg> <lb/>
with such an office. My love for you would not <lb/>
strengthen my heart or my hands. No; it would only <lb/>
sink me with more speed, into despair. Quickly, and <lb/>
by some fatal deed, should I abandon you, my children, and <lb/>
the world.</p>
<p>Possibly, I err. Possibly I underrate my strength of <lb/>
mind and the influence of habit, which makes easy to us, <lb/>
every path; but I will not trust to the <hi rend="italic">possible.</hi></p>
<p>Hence it is that, if by marriage you should become <lb/>
wholly dependent on me, it could never take place. Some <lb/>
freak of fortune may indeed place me above want, but my <lb/>
own efforts never will. Indeed, in this forbearance; in this <lb/>
self denial, there is no merit. While admitted to the <reg orig="privi-|leges">privileges</reg> <lb/>
of a betrothed man; your company, your confidence, <lb/>
every warrantable proof of love mine; I may surely <reg orig="dis-|pense">dispense</reg> <lb/>
with the privileges of wedlock. Secretly repine I <lb/>
might; occasionally I might murmur. But my days would <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="eaf033v4_0114" pid="uva-lib:350123"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">10</fw></pb>
glide along, with fewer obstacles, at least, than if I were <lb/>
that infirm and disconsolate wretch&mdash;<hi rend="italic">your husband.</hi></p>
<p>But this unhappy alternative is not ours. Thou hast <lb/>
something which thy mother cannot take away; sufficient <lb/>
for thy maintenance; thy frugal support. Meaner, and <lb/>
more limited indeed than thy present and former affluence; <lb/>
such as I, of my own motion, would never reduce thee to; <lb/>
such as I can object to only on thy own account.</p>
<p>How has the night run away! my friend's sister arrived <lb/>
here yesterday. They joined in beseeching me to go to a <lb/>
separate chamber and strive for some refreshment. I have <lb/>
slept a couple of hours, and that has sufficed. My mind, <lb/>
on waking, was thronged with so many images, connected <lb/>
with my Jane, that I started up, at last, and betook myself <lb/>
to the pen.</p>
<p>Yet how versatile and fleeting is thought! In this long <lb/>
letter I have not put down one thing that I intended. I <lb/>
meant not to repeat what has been so often said before, and <lb/>
especially I meant not to revolve, if I could help it, any <lb/>
gloomy ideas.</p>
<p>Thy letters gave me exquisite pleasure. They displayed <lb/>
all thy charming self to my view. I pressed every precious <lb/>
line to my lips with nearly as much rapture as I would have <lb/>

this tenderness instead of writing it.</p>
<p>I took up the pen that I might tell thee my thanks, yet <lb/>
rambled almost instantly into mournful repetitions. I have <lb/>
half a mind to burn the scribble, but I cannot write more <lb/>
just now, and this will show you, at least, that I am not <reg orig="un-|mindful">unmindful</reg> <lb/>
of you. Adieu.</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Let</hi> me see! this is the beginning of November. Yes; <lb/>
it was just a twelvemonth ago, that I was sitting at this silent <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="eaf033v4_0115" pid="uva-lib:350124"/>
hour, at a country fire just like this. My elbow, then as <lb/>
now, was leaning on a table, supplied with books and writing <lb/>
tools.</p>
<p>What shall I do, thought I, then, to pass away the time <lb/>
till ten. Can't think of going to bed till that hour, and if I <lb/>
sit here, idly basking in the beams of this cheerful blaze, I <lb/>
shall fall into a listless, uneasy doze, that without refreshing <lb/>
me, as sleep would do, will unfit me for sleep.</p>
<p>Shall I read? nothing here that is new. Enough that is of <lb/>
value, if I could but make myself inquisitive; treasures which, <lb/>
in a curious mood, I would eagerly rifle, but now the tedious <lb/>
page only adds new weight to my eyelids.</p>
<p>Shall I write? what? to whom? there are Sam and Tom, <lb/>
and brother Dick, and sister Sue&mdash;they all have epistolary <lb/>
claims upon me still unsatisfied. Twenty letters that I <lb/>
ought to answer. Come, let me briskly set about the <lb/>
task&mdash;</p>
<p>Not now; some other time. Tomorrow. What can I <lb/>
write about? hav'nt two ideas that hang together intelligibly. <lb/>
'Twill be commonplace trite stuff. Besides, writing always <lb/>
plants a thorn in my breast.</p>
<p>Let me try my hand at a reverie; a meditation&mdash;on that <lb/>
hearth-brush. Hair&mdash;what sort of hair? of a hog&mdash;and the <lb/>
wooden handle&mdash;of poplar or cedar or white oak. At one <lb/>
time a troop of swine munching mast in a grove of oaks, <lb/>
transformed by those magicians, carpenters and butchers, <lb/>
into hearth-brushes. A whimsical metamorphosis upon my <lb/>
faith.</p>
<p>Pish! what stupid musing! I see I must betake myself <lb/>
to bed at last, and throw away upon oblivion one more hour <lb/>
than is common.</p>
<p>So it once was, but how is it now? no wavering and <reg orig="de-|liberating">deliberating</reg> <lb/>
what I shall do&mdash;to lash the drowsy moments into <lb/>
speed. In my haste to set the table and its gear in order <lb/>
for scribble, I overturn the inkhorn, spill the ink, and stain <lb/>
the floor.</p>
<p>The damage is easily repaired, and I sit down, with <reg orig="un-|speakable">unspeakable</reg> <lb/>
alacrity, to a business that tires my muscles, sets a <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">gnawer</hi> at work upon my lungs, fatigues my brain and leaves <lb/>
me listless and spiritless.</p>
<p>How you have made yourself so absolute a mistress of <lb/>
<pb n="103" entity="eaf033v4_0116" pid="uva-lib:350125"/>
the goose quill, I can't imagine; how you can maintain the <lb/>
writing posture, and pursue the writing movement for ten <lb/>
hours together, without benumbed brain, or aching fingers, <lb/>
is beyond my comprehension.</p>
<p>But you see what zeal will do for me. It has enabled me <lb/>
to keep drowsiness, fatigue and languor at bay, during a long <lb/>
night. Converse with thee, heavenly maid, is an antidote <lb/>
even to sleep, the most general and inveterate of all <reg orig="mala-|dies">maladies</reg>.</p>
<p>By and by, I shall have as voluble a pen as thy own. <lb/>
And yet to <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> my crazy constitution says&mdash;nay. 'Twill <lb/>
never be to me other than an irksome, ache producing <reg orig="im-|plement">implement</reg>. <lb/>
It need give pleasure to others, not a little, to <lb/>
compensate for the pain it gives myself.</p>
<p>But this, thoul't say, is beside the purpose. It is, and I <lb/>
will lay aside the quill a moment to consider. I left off my <lb/>
last letter, with a head full of affecting images, which I have <lb/>
waited impatiently for the present opportunity of putting <lb/>
upon paper. Adieu then, for a moment, says thy</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Now</hi> let us take a view of what is to come. Too often <lb/>
I endeavor to escape from foresight when it presents to me <lb/>
nothing but evils, but now I must, for thy sake, be less a <lb/>
coward.</p>
<p>In six weeks Jane becomes mine. Till then, thy mother <lb/>
will not cast thee out of her protection, and will she <hi rend="italic">then?</hi> <lb/>
will she not allow of thy continuance in thy present <reg orig="dwell-|ing">dwelling</reg>? <lb/>
and though so much displeased as to refuse thee her <lb/>
countenance and correspondence, will she, <hi rend="italic">indeed,</hi> turn thee <lb/>
out of doors? She threatens it, we see, but, I suspect, it <lb/>
will never be more than a threat, employed, perhaps, only <lb/>
to intimidate and deter; not designed to be enforced; or, if <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="eaf033v4_0117" pid="uva-lib:350126"/>
made in earnest, yet, when the irrevocable deed is done, <lb/>
will she not hesitate to inflict the penalty? Will not her <lb/>
ancient affection; thy humility, thy sorrow, thy merits&mdash;such <lb/>
as, in spite of this instance of contumacy, she cannot deny <lb/>
thee&mdash;will not these effectually plead for thee?</p>
<p>More than ever will she see that thou needest her bounty; <lb/>
and since she cannot recall what is past, will she not relent <lb/>
and be willing to lessen the irremediable evil all she can.</p>
<p>There is one difficulty that I know not how to surmount. <lb/>
Giving to the wife will be only giving to the husband. Shall <lb/>
one whom she so much abhors, be luxuriously supplied from <lb/>
her bounty?</p>
<p>The wedded pair must live together, she will think; and <lb/>
shall this hated encroacher find refuge from beggary and <lb/>
vileness under <hi rend="italic">her</hi> roof? be lodged and banqueted at <hi rend="italic">her</hi> <lb/>
expense? <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> her indignant heart will never suffer.</p>
<p>Would to Heaven she would think of me with less <reg orig="abhor-|rence">abhorrence</reg>. <lb/>
I wish for treatment conformable to her assumed <lb/>
relation to thee, for all our sakes. As to me, I have no <lb/>
pride; no punctilio, that will stand in the way of <reg orig="reconcilia-|tion">reconciliation</reg>. <lb/>
At least there is no deliberate and steadfast sentiment <lb/>
of that kind. When I reason the matter with myself, I <reg orig="per-|ceive">perceive</reg> <lb/>
a sort of claim to arise from my poverty and relation <lb/>
to thee, on the one hand, and, on the other, from thy merit, <lb/>
thy affinity to her, and her capacity to benefit. Yet I will <lb/>
never supplicate&mdash;not meanly supplicate for an alms. I will <lb/>
not live, nor must thou, when thou art mine, in <hi rend="italic">her</hi> house. <lb/>
Whatever she will give thee, money, or furniture, or clothes, <lb/>
receive it promptly, and with gratitude; but let thy home <lb/>
be thy own. For lodging and food, be thou the payer.</p>
<p>And where shall <hi rend="italic">be</hi> thy home? You love the comforts, <lb/>
the ease, the independence of a household. Your own <lb/>
pittance will not suffice for this. All these you must <reg orig="relin-|quish">relinquish</reg> <lb/>
for my sake. You must go into a family of strangers. <lb/>
You must hire a chamber, and a plate of such food as is <lb/>
going. You must learn to bear the humors, and <reg orig="accommo-|date">accommodate</reg> <lb/>
yourself to the habits of your inmates.</p>
<p>Some frugal family and humble dwelling must content <lb/>
thee. A low roof, a narrow chamber and an obscure avenue, <lb/>
the reverse of all the specious, glossy and abundant that <reg orig="sur-|round">surround</reg> <lb/>
thee now, will be thy portion; all that thou must look <lb/>
<pb n="105" entity="eaf033v4_0118" pid="uva-lib:350127"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">10*</fw></pb>
for as <hi rend="italic">my</hi> wife. And how will this do, Jane? Is not the <lb/>
price too great?</p>
<p>And my company will not solace thee under these <reg orig="incon-|veniences">inconveniences</reg>. <lb/>
I must not live with thee; only an occasional <lb/>
visitor; one among a half dozen at a common fire; with <lb/>
witnesses of all we say. Thy pittance will do no more than <lb/>
support thyself. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> must house myself and feed elsewhere. <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Where,</hi> I know not. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> will depend upon the species of <lb/>
employment I shall be obliged to pursue for my subsistence. <lb/>
Scanty and irksome it will be, at best.</p>
<p>Once a day, I may see thee. Most of my evenings may <lb/>
possibly be devoted to thy company. A soul harassed by <lb/>
unwelcome toil, eyes dim with straining at tiresome or <reg orig="pain-|ful">painful</reg> <lb/>
objects, shall I bring to thee. If, now and then, we are <lb/>
alone, how can I contribute to thy entertainment. The day's <lb/>
task will furnish me with nothing new. Instead of <reg orig="allevia-|ting">alleviating</reg> <lb/>
by my cheerful talk, thy vexations and discomforts, I <lb/>
shall demand consolation from thee.</p>
<p>And yet imperious necessity may bereave us even of that <lb/>
joy. I may be obliged to encounter the perils of the seas <lb/>
once more. Three-fourths of the year, the ocean may <lb/>
divide us, thou in solitude, the while, pondering on the <reg orig="dan-|gers">dangers</reg> <lb/>
to which I may be exposed, and I, a prey to discontent, <lb/>
and tempted in some evil hour, to forget thee, myself and <lb/>
the world.</p>
<p>How my heart sinks at this prospect! Does not thine, <lb/>
Jane? Dost thou not fear to take such a wretched chance <lb/>
with me? I that know myself; my own imbecility; I <lb/>
ought surely to rescue thee from such a fate, by giving <lb/>
thee up.</p>
<p>I can write no more, just now. I wonder how I fell into <lb/>
this doleful strain. It was silly in me to indulge it. These <lb/>
images are not my customary inmates. Yet now that they <lb/>
occur to me, they seem but rational and just. I want, <reg orig="me-|thinks">methinks</reg>, <lb/>
to know how they appear to thee.</p>

<dateline><name type="place">Wilmington,</name> November 7.</dateline>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I have</hi> purposely avoided dwelling on the incidents that <lb/>
are passing here. They engross my thoughts at all times, <lb/>
but those devoted to the pen, and to write to thee is one <lb/>
expedient for loosening their hold.</p>
<p>An expedient not always successful. My mind wanders <lb/>
in spite of me, from my own concerns and from thine, to <lb/>
the sick bed of my friend. A reverie, painful and confused, <lb/>
invades me, now and then; my pen stops, and I am obliged <lb/>
to exert myself anew to shake off the spell.</p>
<p>Till now, I knew not how much I loved this young man. <lb/>
Strange beings we are! Separated as we have been, for <lb/>
many a year; estranged as much by difference of <reg orig="senti-|ments">sentiments</reg> <lb/>
as local distance, his image visiting my memory not <lb/>
once a month, and then a transitory, momentary visit; had <lb/>
he died a year ago, and I not known it, the stream of my <lb/>
thoughts would not have been ruffled by a single <reg orig="impedi-|ment">impediment</reg>. <lb/>
Yet now that I stand over him, and witness his <lb/>
decay&mdash;</p>
<p>Many affecting conversations we have had. I cannot <lb/>
repeat them now. After he is gone, I will put them all <lb/>
upon paper and muse upon them often.</p>
<p>His closing hour is serene. His piety now stands him in <lb/>
some stead. In calling me hither, he tells me that he <reg orig="design-|ed">designed</reg>, <lb/>
not his own gratification, but my good. He wished to urge <lb/>
upon me the truths of religion, at a time when his own <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg> <lb/>
might visibly attest their value. By their influence in <lb/>
making that gloomy path which leads to the grave, joyous <lb/>
and lightsome; he wishes me to judge of their excellence.</p>
<p>His pains are incessant and sharp. He can seldom <reg orig="ar-|ticulate">articulate</reg> <lb/>
without an effort that increases his pangs; yet he <lb/>
talks much; in cogent terms, and with accurate conceptions; <lb/>
and in all he says, evinces a pathetic earnestness for my <lb/>
conviction.</p>
<p>I listen to him with a beart as unbiassed as I can prevail <lb/>
on it to be; as free, I mean, from its customary bias; for I <lb/>
<pb n="107" entity="eaf033v4_0120" pid="uva-lib:350129"/>
strive to call up feelings and ideas similar to his. I know <lb/>
how pure to him would be the satisfaction of leaving the <lb/>
world, with the belief of a thorough change in me.</p>
<p>I argue not with him. I say nothing but to persuade him <lb/>
that I am far from being that contumacious enemy to his <lb/>
faith, which he is prone to imagine me to be.</p>
<p>Thy mother's letter has called up more vividly than usual, <lb/>
our ancient correspondence, and the effects of that <reg orig="disclo-|sure">disclosure</reg>. <lb/>
Yet I have not mentioned the subject to him. I <lb/>
never mentioned it. I could not trust myself to mention it. <lb/>
There was no need. The letters were written by me. I <lb/>
did not charge him to secrecy, and if I had, he would not <lb/>
have been bound to compliance. It was his duty to make <lb/>
that use of them which tended to prevent mischief; which <lb/>
appeared, to him, to have that tendency; and this he has <lb/>
done. His design, I have no doubt, was benevolent and <lb/>
just.</p>
<p>He saw not all the consequences that have followed, 'tis <lb/>
true; but that ignorance would justify him, even if these <lb/>
consequences were unpleasing to him; but they would not <lb/>
have displeased, had they been foreseen. They would <lb/>
only have made his efforts more vigorous; his disclosures <lb/>
more explicit.</p>
<p>His conduct, indeed, on that occasion, as far as we know <lb/>
it, seems irregular and injudicious. To lay before a <reg orig="stran-|ger">stranger</reg> <lb/>
private letters from his friend, in which opinions were <lb/>
avowed and defended, that he knew would render the writer <lb/>
detestable to her that read.</p>
<p>He imagined himself justified in imputing to me atrocious <lb/>
and infamous errors. He was grieved for my debasement, <lb/>
and endeavored, by his utmost zeal and eloquence, to <reg orig="rec-|tify">rectify</reg> <lb/>
these errors. This was generous and just; but needed <lb/>
he to proclaim these errors, and blazon this infamy?</p>
<p>Yet ought I to wish to pass upon the world for other than <lb/>
I am? Can I value that respect which is founded in <reg orig="igno-|rance">ignorance</reg>? <lb/>
Can I be satisfied with caresses from those, who, if <lb/>
they knew me fully, would execrate and avoid me?</p>
<p>For past faults and rectified errors, are not remorse and <lb/>
amendment adequate atonements? If any one despise me <lb/>
for what I <hi rend="italic">was,</hi> let me not shrink from the penalty. Let me <lb/>
not find pleasure in the praise of those whose approbation <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="eaf033v4_0121" pid="uva-lib:350130"/>
is founded in ignorance of what I <hi rend="italic">am.</hi> It is unjust to <reg orig="de-|mand">demand</reg>, <lb/>
it is sordid to retain praise that is not merited, either <lb/>
by our present conduct or our past. Why have I declined <lb/>
such praise? Because I value it not.</p>
<p>Thus have I endeavored to think in relation to Thomson. <lb/>
My endeavor has succeeded. My heart entirely acquits <lb/>
him. It even applauds him for his noble sincerity.</p>
<p>Yet I could never write to him, or talk to him on this <lb/>
subject. My tongue, my pen, will be sure to falter. I know <lb/>
that he will boldly justify his conduct, and I feel that he <lb/>
ought to justify, yet the attempt to justify would awaken&mdash; <lb/>
indignation, selfishness. In spite of the suggestions of my <lb/>
better reason, I know we should quarrel.</p>
<p>We should not quarrel <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> if the topic were mentioned. <lb/>
Of indignation against him, even for a real fault; much less <lb/>
for an imaginary one, I am, at this time, not capable; but <lb/>
it would be useless to mention it. There is nothing to <lb/>
explain; no misapprehensions to remove; no doubts to clear <lb/>
up. All that he did, I, in the same case, ought to have <lb/>
done.</p>
<p>But I told you, I wished not to fill my letters with the <lb/>
melancholy scene before me. This is a respite, a solace to <lb/>
me; and thus, and in reading thy letters, I employ all my <lb/>
spare moments.</p>
<p>Write to me, my love. Daily, hourly, and cheerfully, if <lb/>
possible. Borrow not; be not thy letters tinged with the <lb/>
melancholy hue of this.</p>

these letters, so full of dark forebodings, and rueful <reg orig="prog-|nostics">prognostics</reg>, <lb/>
had not come to damp my spirits.</p>
<p>And is the destiny that awaits us so very mournful? Is <lb/>
thy wife necessarily to lose so many comforts, and incur so <lb/>
many mortifications? are my funds so small, that they will <lb/>
not secure to me the privilege of a separate apartment, in <lb/>
which I may pass my time with whom, and in what manner <lb/>
I please?</p>
<p>Must I huddle with a dozen squalling children and their <lb/>
notably noisy, or sluttishly indolent dam, round a dirty <lb/>
hearth, and meagre winter's fire? must sooty rafters, a <reg orig="sor-|ry">sorry</reg> <lb/>
truckle bed, and a mud incumbered alley be my nuptial <lb/>
lot.</p>
<p>Out upon thee, thou egregious painter! Well for thee <lb/>
thou art not within my arm's length. I should certainly <reg orig="be-|stow">bestow</reg> <lb/>
upon thee a hearty&mdash;<hi rend="italic">kiss</hi> or two.&mdash;My blundering <lb/>
pen! I recall the word. I meant <hi rend="italic">cuff;</hi> but my saucy pen, <lb/>
pretending to know more of my mind than I did myself, <lb/>
turned (as its mistress, mayhap, would have done, hadst <lb/>
thou been near me, <hi rend="italic">indeed</hi>) her <hi rend="italic">cuff</hi> into a <hi rend="italic">kiss.</hi></p>
<p>What possessed thee, my beloved, to predict so ruefully. <lb/>
A very good beginning too! more vivacity than common! <lb/>
But I hardly had time to greet the sunny radiance&mdash;'tis a <lb/>
long time since my cell was gilded by so sweet a beam;&mdash; <lb/>
when a <hi rend="italic">black usurping mist</hi> stole it away, and all was dreary <lb/>
as it is wont to be.</p>
<p>Perhaps thy being in a house of mourning may account <lb/>
for it. Fitful and versatile, I know thee to be. Changeable <lb/>
with scene and circumstance. Thy views are just what any <lb/>
eloquent companion pleases to make them. She, thou <lb/>
lovest, is thy deity; her lips thy oracle. And hence my <lb/>
cheerful omens of the future; the confidence I have in the <lb/>
wholesome efficacy of my government. I that have the <hi rend="italic">will</hi> <lb/>
to make thee happy, have the power too. I know I have; <lb/>
and hence my promptitude to give away all for thy sake; <lb/>
to give myself a <hi rend="italic">wife's</hi> title to thy company; a conjugal <lb/>
share in thy concerns; and claim to reign over thee.</p>
<p>Make haste and atone, by the future brightness of thy <reg orig="epis-|tolary">epistolary</reg> <lb/>
emanations, for the pitchy cloud that overspreads <lb/>
these sick man's dreams.</p>
<p>How must thou have rummaged the cupboard of thy fancy <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="eaf033v4_0123" pid="uva-lib:350132"/>
for musty scraps and flinty crusts to feed thy spleen withal; <lb/>
inattentive to the dainties which a blue eyed Hebe had <lb/>
culled in the garden of Hope, and had poured from out her <lb/>
basket into thy ungrateful lap.</p>
<p>While thou wast mumbling these refractory and unsavory <lb/>
bits, I was banqueting on the rosy and delicious products of <lb/>
that Eden, which love, when not scared away by evil omens, <lb/>
is always sure (the poet says) to <hi rend="italic">plant</hi> around us. I have <lb/>
tasted nectarines of her raising, and I find her, let me tell <lb/>
thee, an admirable <hi rend="italic">Horticulturist.</hi></p>
<p>Thou art so far off, there is no sending thee a basket full, <lb/>
or I would do it. They would wilt and wither ere they <lb/>
reached thee; the atmosphere thou breathest would strike <lb/>
a deadly worm into their hearts before thou couldst get them <lb/>
to thy lips.</p>
<p>But to drop the basket and the bough, and take up a plain <lb/>
meaning&mdash;I will tell thee how I was employed when thy <lb/>
letter came; but first I must go back a little.</p>
<p>In the autumn of <hi rend="italic">ninety-seven,</hi> and when death had spent <lb/>
his shafts in my own family, I went to see how a family <lb/>
fared, the father and husband of which kept a shop in Front <lb/>
street, where every thing a lady wanted was sold, and <lb/>
where I had always been served with great despatch and <lb/>
affability.</p>
<p>Being one day (I am going to tell you how our <reg orig="acquaint-|ance">acquaintance</reg> <lb/>
began)&mdash;Being one day detained in the shop by a <lb/>
shower, I was requested to walk into the parlor. I chatted <lb/>
ten minutes with the good woman of the house, and found <lb/>
in her so much gentleness and good sense, that, afterwards, <lb/>
my shopping visits were always, in part, social ones. My <lb/>
business being finished at the compter, I usually went back, <lb/>
and found on every interview, new cause for esteeming the <lb/>
family. The treatment I met with was always cordial and <lb/>
frank, and though our meetings were thus merely casual, we <lb/>
seemed, in a short time, to have grown into a perfect <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
of each other.</p>
<p>This was in the summer you left us, and the malady <lb/>
breaking out a few months after, and all <hi rend="italic">shopping</hi> being at <lb/>
an end, and alarm and grief taking early possession of my <lb/>
heart, I thought but seldom of the Hennings'. A few weeks <lb/>
after death had bereaved me of my friend, I called these <lb/>
<pb n="111" entity="eaf033v4_0124" pid="uva-lib:350133"/>
and others, whose welfare was dear to me, to my <reg orig="remem-|brance">remembrance</reg>; <lb/>
and determined to pay them a visit and discover <lb/>
how it fared with them. I hoped they had left the city, <lb/>
yet Mrs. Henning had told me that her husband, who was <lb/>
a devout man, held it criminal to fly on such occasions, <lb/>
and that she, having passed safely through the pestilence of <lb/>
former years, had no apprehensions from staying.</p>
<p>Their house was inhabited, but I found the good woman <lb/>
in great affliction. Her husband had lately died after a <lb/>
tedious illness, and her distress was augmented by the <reg orig="soli-|tude">solitude</reg> <lb/>
in which the flight of all her neighbors and <reg orig="acquaint-|ances">acquaintances</reg> <lb/>
had left her. A friendly visit could at no time have <lb/>
been so acceptable to her, and my sympathy was not more <lb/>
needed to console her, than my counsel to assist her in the <lb/>
new state of her affairs.</p>
<p>Laying aside ceremony, I inquired freely into her <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg>, <lb/>
and offered her my poor services. She made me <lb/>
fully acquainted with her circumstances, and I was highly <lb/>
pleased at finding them so good. Her husband had always <lb/>
been industrious and thrifty, and his death left her enough <lb/>
to support her and her Sally in the way they wished.</p>
<p>Inquiring into their views and wishes, I found them <lb/>
limited to the privacy of a small but neat house, in some <lb/>
cleanly and retired corner of the city. Their stock in trade, <lb/>
I advised them to convert into money, and placing it in <lb/>
some public fund, live upon its produce. Mrs. Henning <lb/>
knew nothing of the world. Though an excellent manager <lb/>
within doors, any thing that might be called business was <lb/>
strange and arduous to her, and without my direct <reg orig="assist-|ance">assistance</reg> <lb/>
she could do nothing.</p>
<p>Happily, at this time, just such a cheap and humble, but <lb/>
neat, new and airy dwelling as my friend required, <reg orig="belong-|ing">belonging</reg> <lb/>
to Mrs. Fielder, was vacant. You know the house. <lb/>
'Tis that where the Frenchman Catineau lived. Is it not a <lb/>
charming abode? at a distance from noise, with a green <lb/>
field opposite, and a garden behind; of two stories; a <lb/>
couple of good rooms on each floor; with unspoilt water, <lb/>
and a kitchen, below the ground, indeed, but light, <reg orig="whole-|some">wholesome</reg> <lb/>
and warm.</p>
<p>Most fortunately too that incorrigible creole had deserted <lb/>
it. He was scared away by the fever, and no other had <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="eaf033v4_0125" pid="uva-lib:350134"/>
put in a claim. I made haste to write to my mother, who, <lb/>
though angry with me on my own account, could not reject <lb/>
my application in favor of my good widow.</p>
<p>I even prevailed on her to set the rent forty dollars lower <lb/>
than she might have gotten from another, and to give a <lb/>
lease of it at that rate for five years. You can't imagine <lb/>
my satisfaction in completing this affair, and in seeing my <lb/>
good woman quietly settled in her new abode, with her <lb/>
daughter Sally, and her servant <hi rend="italic">Alice,</hi> who had come with <lb/>
her from Europe, and had lived with her the dear knows <lb/>
how long.</p>
<p>Mrs. Henning is no common woman, I assure you. Her <lb/>
temper is the sweetest in the world. Not cultivated or <reg orig="en-|lightened">enlightened</reg> <lb/>
is her understanding, but naturally correct. Her <lb/>
life has always been spent under her own roof; and never <lb/>
saw I a scene of more quiet and order than her little <reg orig="home-|stead">homestead</reg> <lb/>
exhibits. Though humbly born, and perhaps, meanly <lb/>
brought up, her parlor and chamber add to the purest <reg orig="clean-|liness">cleanliness</reg>, <lb/>
somewhat that approaches to elegance.</p>
<p>The mistress and the maid are nearly of the same age, <lb/>
and though equally innocent and good humored, the former <lb/>
has more sedateness and reserve than the latter. She is <lb/>
devout in her way, which is methodism, and acquires from <lb/>
this source nothing but new motives to charity to her <reg orig="neigh-|bors">neighbors</reg>, <lb/>
and thankfulness to God.</p>
<p>Much; indeed, all these comforts she ascribes to me; <lb/>
yet her gratitude is not loquacious. It shews itself less in <lb/>
words than in the pleasure she manifests on my visits; the <lb/>
confidence with which she treats me; laying before me all <lb/>
her plans and arrangements, and entreating my advice in <lb/>
every thing. Yet she has brought with her, from her <reg orig="na-|tive">native</reg> <lb/>
country, notions of her inferiority to the better born and <lb/>
the better educated, but too soothing to my pride. Hence <lb/>
she is always diffident, and never makes advances to <reg orig="inti-|macy">intimacy</reg> <lb/>
but when expressly invited and encouraged.</p>
<p>It was a good while before all her new arrangements <lb/>
were completed. When they were, I told her, I would <lb/>
spend the day with her, for which she was extremely <reg orig="grate-|ful">grateful</reg>. <lb/>
She sent me word, as soon as she was ready to <reg orig="re-|ceive">receive</reg> <lb/>
me, and I went.</p>
<p>Artless and unceremonious was the good woman in the <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="eaf033v4_0126" pid="uva-lib:350135"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">11</fw></pb>
midst of all her anxiety to please. Affectionate, yet <reg orig="dis-|creet">discreet</reg> <lb/>
in her behaviour to her Sally and her Alice, and of <lb/>
me as tenderly observant as possible.</p>
<p>She shewed me all her rooms from cellar to garret, and <lb/>
every thing I saw delighted me. Two neat beds in the <lb/>
front room above, belong to her and Sally. The back <lb/>
room is decked in a more fanciful and costly manner.</p>
<p>Why this, my good friend, said I, on entering it, is quite <lb/>
superb. Here is carpet and coverlet and curtains that might <lb/>
satisfy a prince; you are quite prodigal; and for whose <reg orig="ac-|commodation">accommodation</reg> <lb/>
is all this?</p>
<p>O! any lady that will favor me with a visit. It is a spare <lb/>
room, and the only one I have, and I thought I would <lb/>
launch out a little for once. One wishes to set the best <lb/>
they have before a guest, though indeed, I don't expect <lb/>
many to visit me, but it is some comfort to think one has it <lb/>
in one's power to lodge a friend, when it happens so, in a <lb/>
manner that may not discredit one's intentions. I have no <lb/>
relations in this country, and the only friend I have in the <lb/>
world, besides God, is you, madam. But still, it may <lb/>
sometimes happen, you know, that one may have occasion to <lb/>
entertain somebody. God be thanked, I have enough, and <lb/>
what little I have to spare, I have no right to hoard up.</p>
<p>But might you not accommodate a good quiet kind of <lb/>
body in this room, at so much a year or week?</p>
<p>Why, Ma'am, if you think that's best; but I thought one <lb/>
might indulge one's self in living one's own way. I have <lb/>
never been used to strangers, and always have had a small <lb/>
family. It would be a very new thing to me, to have an <lb/>
inmate. I am afraid I should not please such a one. And <lb/>
then, ma'am, if this room's occupied, I have no decent place <lb/>
to put any accidental person in. It would go hard with me <lb/>
to be obliged to turn a good body away, that might be here <lb/>
on a visit, and might be caught by a rain or a snow storm.</p>
<p>Very true. I did not think of that; and yet it seems a <lb/>
pity that so good a room should be unemployed; perhaps for <lb/>
a year together.</p>
<p>So it does, ma'am, and I can't but say, if a proper person <lb/>
should offer, who wanted to be snug and quiet, I should <lb/>
have no great objection. One that could put up with our <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="eaf033v4_0127" pid="uva-lib:350136"/>
humble ways, and be satisfied with what I could do to make <lb/>
them comfortable. I think I should like such a one well <lb/>
enough.</p>
<p>One, said I, who would accept such accommodation as a <lb/>
favor. A single person for example. A woman; a young <lb/>
woman. A stranger in the country, and friendless like <reg orig="your-|self">yourself</reg>.</p>
<p>O! very true, madam, said the good woman, with <reg orig="spark-|ling">sparkling</reg> <lb/>
benignity, I should have no objection in the world to <lb/>
such a one. I should like it of all things. And I should <lb/>
not mind to be hard with such a one. I should not stickle <lb/>
about terms. Pray, ma'am, do you know any such. If <lb/>
you do, and will advise me to take her, I would be very <lb/>
glad to do it.</p>
<p>Now, Hal, what thinkest thou? cannot I light on such a <lb/>
young, single, slenderly provided woman as this. One whose <lb/>
heart pants for just such a snug retreat, as Mrs. Henning's <lb/>
roof would afford her.</p>
<p>This little chamber, set out with perfect neatness; looking <lb/>
out on a very pretty piece of verdure and a cleanly court <lb/>
yard; with such a good couple to provide for her; with <lb/>
her privacy unapproachable but at her own pleasure; Her <lb/>
quiet undisturbed by a prater, a scolder, a bustler or a <lb/>
whiner. No dirty children to offend the eye or squalling <lb/>
ones to wound the ear. With admitted claims to the <reg orig="grati-|tude">gratitude</reg>, <lb/>
confidence and affection of her hostess; might not <lb/>
these suffice to make a lowly, unambitious maiden happy?</p>
<p>One who, like Mrs. Henning, had only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> friend upon <lb/>
earth. Whom her former associates refused to commune <lb/>
with or look upon. Whose loneliness was uncheered, <reg orig="ex-|cept">except</reg> <lb/>
by her own thoughts, and by her books. Perhaps now <lb/>
and then at times when oceans did not sever her from him, <lb/>
by that one earthly friend.</p>
<p>Might she not afford him as many hours of her society <lb/>
as his engagements would allow him to claim. Might she <lb/>
not, as an extraordinary favor, admit him to partake with her <lb/>
the comforts of her own little fire, if winter it be; or, in <lb/>
summer time, to join her at her chamber window, and pass <lb/>
away the starlight hour in the unwitnessed community of <lb/>
fond hearts?</p>
<p>Suppose, to obviate unwelcome surmises and too <reg orig="scrupu-|lous">scrupulous</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="eaf033v4_0128" pid="uva-lib:350137"/>
objections, the girl makes herself a wife, but because <lb/>
their poverty will not enable them to live together, the girl <lb/>
merely admits the chosen youth on the footing of a visiter.</p>
<p>Suppose her hours are not embittered by the feelings of <lb/>
dependence. She pays an ample compensation for her <lb/>
entertainment, and by her occasional company, her superior <lb/>
strength of mind and knowledge of the world's ways, she <lb/>
materially contributes to the happiness and safety of her <lb/>
hostess.</p>
<p>Suppose, having only one visiter, and he sometimes wanting <lb/>
in zeal and punctuality, much of her time is spent alone. <lb/>
Happily she is exempt from the humiliating necessity of <lb/>
working to live; and is not obliged to demand a share of the <lb/>
earnings of her husband. Her task, therefore, will be to <lb/>
find amusement. Can she want the means, think'st thou.</p>
<p>The sweet quiet of her chamber; the wholesome airs <lb/>
from abroad; or the cheerful blaze of her hearth, will invite <lb/>
her to mental exercise. Perhaps, she has a taste for books, <lb/>
and besides that pure delight which knowledge on its own <lb/>
account affords her, it possesses tenfold attractions in her <lb/>
eyes, by its tendency to heighten the esteem of him whom <lb/>
she lives to please.</p>
<p>Perhaps, rich as she is in books, she is an economist of <lb/>
pleasure, and tears herself away from them, to enjoy the <lb/>
vernal breezes, or the landscape of autumn in a twilight <lb/>
ramble. Here she communes with bounteous nature, or <lb/>
lifts her soul in devotion to her God, to whose benignity she <lb/>
resigns herself as she used to do to the fond arms of that <lb/>
parent she has lost.</p>
<p>If these do not suffice to fill up her time, she may chance <lb/>
to reflect on the many ways in which she may be useful to <lb/>
herself. She may find delight in supplying her own wants; <lb/>
by maintaining cleanliness and order all about her; by <reg orig="ma-|king">making</reg> <lb/>
up her own dresses, especially as she disdains to be <reg orig="out-|done">outdone</reg> <lb/>
in taste and expertness at the needle by any female in <lb/>
the land.</p>
<p>By limiting in this way, and in every other, which her <lb/>
judgment may recommend, her own expenses, she will be <lb/>
able to contribute somewhat to relieve the toils of her <reg orig="be-|loved">beloved</reg>. <lb/>
The pleasure will be hers of reflecting, not only <lb/>
that her love adds nothing to his fatigues and cares; not <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="eaf033v4_0129" pid="uva-lib:350138"/>
only that her tender solicitudes and seasonable counsel, <lb/>
cherish his hopes and strengthen his courage, but that the <lb/>
employment of her hands makes his own separate subsistence <lb/>
an easier task. To work for herself will be no trivial <reg orig="gratifi-|cation">gratification</reg> <lb/>
to her honest pride, but to work for her beloved, will, <lb/>
indeed, be a cause of exultation.</p>
<p>Twenty things she may do for him which others must be <lb/>
paid for doing, not in caresses, but in money; and this <reg orig="ser-|vice">service</reg>, <lb/>
though not small, is not perhaps the greatest she is able <lb/>
to perform. She is active and intelligent, perhaps, and may <lb/>
even aspire to the profits of some trade. What is it that <lb/>
makes one calling more lucrative than another? Not <reg orig="supe-|rior">superior</reg> <lb/>
strength of shoulders or sleight of hand; not the greater <lb/>
quantity of brute matter that is reduced into form or set into <lb/>
motion? No. The difference lies in the mental powers <lb/>
of the artist, and the direction accidentally given to these <lb/>
powers.</p>
<p>What should hinder a girl like this from growing rich by <lb/>
her diligence and ingenuity. She has, perhaps, acquired <lb/>
many arts with no view but her own amusement. Not a <lb/>
little did her mother pay to those who taught her to draw <lb/>
and to sing. May she not levy the same tributes upon <lb/>
others that were levied on her, and make a business of her <lb/>
sports.</p>
<p>There is, indeed, a calling that may divert her from the <lb/>
thoughts of mere lucre. She may talk and sing for <lb/>
another and dedicate her best hours to a tutelage, for <lb/>
which there is a more precious requital than money can <lb/>
give.</p>
<p>Dost not see her, Hal. I do&mdash;as well as this gushing <lb/>
sensibility will let me&mdash;rocking in her arms and half stifling <lb/>
with her kisses, or delighting with her lullaby, a precious little <lb/>
creature&mdash;</p>
<p>Why, my friend, do I hesitate? do I not write for thy eye, <lb/>
and thine only? and what is there but pure and sacred in <lb/>
the anticipated transports of a mother.</p>
<p>The conscious heart might stifle its throbs in thy presence, <lb/>
but why not indulge them in thy absence, and tell thee its <lb/>
inmost breathings, not without a shame confessing glow, <lb/>
yet not without drops of the truest delight that were ever <lb/>
shed.</p>
<pb n="117" entity="eaf033v4_0130" pid="uva-lib:350139"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">11*</fw></pb>
<p>Why, how now, Jane? whence all this interest in the <lb/>
scene thou portrayest? one would fancy that this happy <lb/>
outcast, this self dependent wife was no other than <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="thy-|self">thyself</reg>.</hi></p>
<p>A shrewd conjecture truly. I suppose, Hal, thou wilt <lb/>
be fond enough to guess so too. By what penalty shall I <lb/>
deter thee from so rash a thing? yet thou art not here&mdash;I <lb/>
say it to my sorrow&mdash;to suffer the penalty which I might <lb/>
choose to inflict.</p>
<p>I will not say what it is, lest the <hi rend="italic">fear</hi> of it should keep <lb/>
thee away.</p>
<p>And now that I have finished the history of Mrs. <reg orig="Hen-|ning">Henning</reg> <lb/>

<opener>
<dateline><name type="place">Philadelphia,</name> Nov. 11.</dateline>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">How</hi> shall I tell you the strange&mdash;<hi rend="italic">strange</hi> incident! every <lb/>
fibre of my frame still trembles. I have endeavored, <lb/>
during the last hour, to gain tranquillity enough for writing, <lb/>
but without success; yet I can forbear no longer; I must <lb/>
begin.</p>
<p>I had just closed my last to you, when somebody <reg orig="knock-|ed">knocked</reg>. <lb/>
I heard footsteps below, as the girl ushered in the <lb/>
visitant, which were not quite unknown to me. The girl <lb/>
came up.&mdash;"A gentleman is waiting."</p>
<p>A gentleman! thought I. An odd hour this&mdash;it was past <lb/>
ten&mdash;for any man but one to visit <hi rend="italic">me.</hi> His business must <lb/>
be very urgent. So, indeed, he told the girl, it was, for she <lb/>
knew me averse to company at any time, and I had <reg orig="with-|drawn">withdrawn</reg> <lb/>
to my chamber for the night; but he would not be <lb/>
eluded. He must see me, he said, this night.</p>
<p>A tall and noble figure, in a foreign uniform, arose from <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="eaf033v4_0131" pid="uva-lib:350140"/>
the sofa at my entrance. The half extinct lamp on the <lb/>
mantel, could not conceal from me&mdash;<hi rend="italic">my brother!</hi></p>
<p>My surprise almost overpowered me. I should have <lb/>
sunk upon the floor, had he not stepped to me, and <reg orig="sustain-|ed">sustained</reg> <lb/>
me in his arms.</p>
<p>I see you are surprised, Jane, said he, in a tone not <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
affection in it. You did not expect, I suppose, ever to <lb/>
see me again. It was a mere chance brought me to <lb/>
America. I shall stay here a moment and then hie me <lb/>
back again. I could not pass through the city without an <lb/>
"How d'ye" to the little girl for whom I have still some <lb/>
regard.</p>
<p>The violence of my emotions found relief in a flood of <lb/>
tears. He was not unmoved, but embracing me with <reg orig="ten-|derness">tenderness</reg>, <lb/>
he seated me by him on the sofa.</p>
<p>When I had leisure to survey his features, I found that <lb/>
time had rather improved his looks. They were less <lb/>
austere; less contemptuous than they used to be; perhaps, <lb/>
indeed, it was only a momentary remission of his customary <lb/>
feelings.</p>
<p>To my rapid and half coherent questions, he replied;&mdash; <lb/>
I landed&mdash;you need not know where. My commission <reg orig="re-|quires">requires</reg> <lb/>
secrecy, and you know I have personal reasons for <lb/>
wishing to pass through this city without notice. My <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg> <lb/>
did not bring me further southward than New-London; <lb/>
but I heard your mother resided in New York, and could <lb/>
not leave the country without seeing you. I called on <lb/>
her yesterday, but she looked so grave and talked so <reg orig="ob-|scurely">obscurely</reg> <lb/>
about you, that I could not do less than come hither. <lb/>
She told me you were here. How have been affairs since I <lb/>
left you?</p>
<p>I answered this question vaguely.</p>
<p>Pray, with much earnestness, are you married yet?</p>
<p>The confusion with which I returned an answer to this, <lb/>
did not escape him.</p>
<p>I asked Mrs. Fielder the same question, and she talked <lb/>
as if it were a doubtful point. She could not tell, she said, <lb/>
with a rueful physiognomy. Very probable it might be <lb/>
so&mdash;I could not bring her to be more explicit. As I proposed <lb/>
to see you, she said, you were the fittest person to explain <lb/>
your own situation. This made me the more anxious to <lb/>
<pb n="119" entity="eaf033v4_0132" pid="uva-lib:350141"/>
see you. Pray, Jane, how do matters stand between you <lb/>
and Mrs. Fielder? are you not on as good terms as <lb/>
formerly?</p>
<p>I answered, that some difference had unhappily occurred <lb/>
between us, that I loved and revered her as much as ever, <lb/>
and hoped that we should soon be mother and daughter again.</p>
<p>But the cause&mdash;the cause, Jane. Is a lover the bone <lb/>
of contention between you? That's the rock on which <lb/>
family harmony is sure to be wrecked. But tell me, what <lb/>
have you quarrelled about?</p>
<p>How could I explain on such a subject, thus abruptly <reg orig="in-|troduced">introduced</reg>, <lb/>
to <hi rend="italic">him?</hi> I told him it was equally painful and <lb/>
useless to dwell on my contentions with my mother, or on <lb/>
my own affairs. Rather let me hear, said I, how it fares <lb/>
with you; what fortunes you have met with in this long <lb/>
absence.</p>
<p>Pretty well; pretty well. Many a jade's trick did <reg orig="for-|tune">fortune</reg> <lb/>
play me before I left this spot, but, ever since, it has <lb/>
been all smooth and bright with me&mdash;But this marriage&mdash; <lb/>
Art thou a wife or not? I heard, I think, some talk about <lb/>
a Talbot. What's become of him? They said you were <lb/>
engaged to him.</p>
<p>It is long since the common destiny has ended all <reg orig="Tal-|bot's">Talbot's</reg> <lb/>
engagements.</p>
<p>Dead, is he? Well; a new aspirer, I suppose, has <reg orig="suc-|ceeded">succeeded</reg>, <lb/>
and he is the bone of contention. Who's he?</p>
<p>I could not bear that a subject of such deep concern to <lb/>
me, should be discussed thus lightly, and, therefore, begged <lb/>
him to change the subject.</p>
<p>Change the subject? With all my heart, if we can find <lb/>
any more important; but that's impossible. So, we must <lb/>
even stick to this, a little longer. Come, what's his <reg orig="parent-|age">parentage</reg>; <lb/>
fortune; age; character; profession. 'Tis not likely <lb/>
I shall find fault where Mrs. Fielder does. Young men <lb/>
and old women seldom hit upon the same choice in a <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg>, <lb/>
and, for my part, I am easily pleased.</p>
<p>This is a subject, brother, on which it is impossible that <lb/>
we should think alike; nor is it necessary. Let us then <lb/>
talk of something in which we have a common concern; <lb/>
something that has a claim to interest you.</p>
<pb n="120" entity="eaf033v4_0133" pid="uva-lib:350142"/>
<p>What subject, girl, can have a stronger claim on my <reg orig="at-|tention">attention</reg> <lb/>
than the marriage of my sister?&mdash;I am not so giddy <lb/>
and unprincipled as to be unconcerned on that head. So <lb/>
make no more ado, but tell your <hi rend="italic">brother</hi> candidly what are <lb/>
your prospects?</p>
<p>After some hesitation&mdash;My real brother; one who had <lb/>
the tenderness becoming that relation, would certainly <reg orig="de-|serve">deserve</reg> <lb/>
my confidence. But&mdash;</p>
<p>But what? Come, never mince the matter. I have <lb/>
scarcely been half a brother hitherto, I grant you. More <lb/>
of an enemy, perhaps, than friend, but no reason why I <lb/>
should continue hostile or indifferent. So tell me who the <lb/>
lad is, and what are his pretensions?</p>
<p>I endeavored to draw him off to some other subject, but <lb/>
he would not be diverted from this. By dint of <reg orig="interrogato-|ries">interrogatories</reg> <lb/>
he at last, extorted from me a few hints respecting you. <lb/>
Finding that you were without fortune or profession, and <lb/>
that my regard for you had forfeited all favor with my <lb/>
mother, the inquiry was obvious; how we meant to live? <lb/>
It was impossible to answer this question in any manner <lb/>
satisfactory to him. He has no notion of existence <reg orig="uncon-|nected">unconnected</reg> <lb/>
with luxury and splendor.</p>
<p>Have you made any acquisitions, continued he, since I <lb/>
saw you? Has any good old aunt left you another legacy? <lb/>
&mdash;This was said with the utmost vivacity and self-<reg orig="posses-|sion">possession</reg>. <lb/>
A strange being is my brother. Could he have <lb/>
forgotten by whom I was robbed of my former legacy?</p>
<p>Come, come, I know thou art a romantic being. One <lb/>
accustomed to <hi rend="italic">feed on thoughts</hi> instead of pudding. <reg orig="Con-|tentment">Contentment</reg> <lb/>
and a cottage are roast beef and a palace to thee; <lb/>
but, take my word for it, this inamorata of thine will need a <lb/>
more substantial diet. By marrying him you will only <lb/>
saddle him with misery. So drop all thoughts of so silly a <lb/>
scheme; write him a "good by;" make up your little <reg orig="mat-|ters">matters</reg>, <lb/>
and come along with me. I will take you to my <lb/>
country; introduce you to a new world; and bring to your <lb/>
feet hundreds of generous souls, the least of whom is richer, <lb/>
wiser, handsomer, than this tame-spirited, droning animal&mdash; <lb/>
what's his name? But no matter. I suppose I know <reg orig="no-|thing">nothing</reg> <lb/>
of him.</p>
<pb n="121" entity="eaf033v4_0134" pid="uva-lib:350143"/>
<p>I was rash enough to tell him your name and abode, but I <lb/>
treated his proposal as a jest. I quickly found that he was <lb/>
serious. He soon became extremely urgent; recounted <lb/>
the advantages of his condition; the charming qualities of <lb/>
his wife; the security and splendor of his new rank. He <lb/>
endeavored to seduce my vanity by the prospect of the <lb/>
conquests I should make in that army of colonels, <reg orig="philoso-|phers">philosophers</reg>, <lb/>
and commissioners, that formed the circle of his <lb/>
friends. Any man but a brother, said he, must own that <lb/>
you are a charming creature. So you need only come and <lb/>
see, in order to conquer.</p>
<p>His importunities increased as my reluctance became <lb/>
more evident. Thoughtless as I supposed him to be, he <lb/>
said, the wish to find me out, carry me to France, and <lb/>
put me in fortune's way, was no inconsiderable inducement <lb/>
with him to accept the commission which brought him to <lb/>
America. He insinuated that brothership and eldership <lb/>
gave him something like a title to paternal authority, and <lb/>
insisted on obedience.</p>
<p>The contest became painful. Impatience and reproach <lb/>
on his side awakened the like sentiments in me, and it cost <lb/>
me many efforts to restrain my feelings. Alternately he <lb/>
commanded and persuaded; was willing to be governed by <lb/>
my mother's advice; would carry me forthwith to New <lb/>
York; would lay before her his proposal, and be governed <lb/>
by her decision. The public vessel that brought him, lay <lb/>
at Newport waiting his return. Every possible <reg orig="accommo-|dation">accommodation</reg> <lb/>
and convenience was possessed by the ship. It was <lb/>
nothing but a sailing palace, in which the other passengers <lb/>
were merely his guests, selected by himself.</p>
<p>I was a fool for refusing his offer. A simpleton. The <lb/>
child of caprice, whom no time could render steadfast <reg orig="ex-|cept">except</reg> <lb/>
in folly; into whom no counsel or example could <lb/>
instil an atom of common sense. He supposed <hi rend="italic">my man</hi> <lb/>
was equally obstinate and stupid, but he would soon see of <lb/>
what stuff <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was made. He would hurry to Baltimore, <lb/>
and take the boy to task for his presumption and insolence <lb/>
in aspiring to Jane Talbot without her brother's consent.</p>
<p>He snatched up his hat, but this intimation alarmed me. <lb/>
Pray, stay one moment, brother. Be more considerate. <lb/>
What right can you possibly have to interfere with Mr. <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="eaf033v4_0135" pid="uva-lib:350144"/>
Colden's concerns. Talk to me, as much and in what style <lb/>
you please, but I beseech you insult not a man who never <lb/>
offended you.</p>
<p>Perceiving my uneasiness on this head, he took advantage <lb/>
of it to renew his solicitations for my company to France. <lb/>
Swore solemnly that no man should have his sister without <lb/>
his consent, and that he would force the boy to give me up.</p>
<p>This distressing altercation ended by his going away, <reg orig="de-|claring">declaring</reg>, <lb/>
in spite of my entreaties, that he would see you, <lb/>
and teach your insolence a lesson not easily forgotten.</p>
<p>To sleep after this interview was impossible. I could <lb/>
hardly still my throbbing heart sufficiently to move the pen. <lb/>
You cannot hear from me in time to avoid this madman, or <lb/>
to fortify yourself against an interview. I cannot confute <lb/>
the false or cunning glosses he may make upon my conduct. <lb/>
He may represent me to you as willing to accompany him; <lb/>
as detained only by my obligation to you from which it is in <lb/>
your power to absolve me.</p>
<p>Till I hear from you I shall have no peace. Would to <lb/>
heaven there was some speedier conveyance.</p>

<note id="n2" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>Letter xxx.</p></note>
letter for the present, <lb/>
while I mention to you a most unexpected and surprising <lb/>
circumstance. It has just happened. I have parted with <lb/>
my visitant but this moment.</p>
<p>I had strolled to the bank of the river, and was leaning <lb/>
idly on a branch of an apple tree that hung pretty low, <lb/>
when I noticed some one coming hastily towards me; there <lb/>
was something striking and noble in the air and figure of the <lb/>
man.</p>
<pb n="123" entity="eaf033v4_0136" pid="uva-lib:350145"/>
<p>When he came up, he stopped. I was surprised to find <lb/>
myself the object of which he was in search. I found <reg orig="af-|terwards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
that he had inquired for me at my lodgings, and <lb/>
had been directed to look for me in this path. A distinct <lb/>
view of his features saved him the trouble of telling me <lb/>
that he was your brother. However, that was information <lb/>
that he thought proper immediately to communicate. He <lb/>
was your brother, he said; I was Colden; I had <reg orig="preten-|sions">pretensions</reg> <lb/>
to you, which your brother was entitled to know, to <lb/>
discuss, and to pronounce upon. Such, in about as many <lb/>
words, was his introduction to me, and he waited for my <lb/>
answer with much impatience.</p>
<p>I was greatly confused by these sudden and <reg orig="unceremo-|nious">unceremonious</reg> <lb/>
intimations; at last I told him that all that he had said <lb/>
respecting my connexion with his sister, was true. It was <lb/>
a fact that all the world was welcome to know. Of course <lb/>
I had no objection to her brother's knowing it.</p>
<p>But what were my claims; what my merits; my <reg orig="profes-|sion">profession</reg>; <lb/>
my fortune! On all these heads a brother would <reg orig="na-|turally">naturally</reg> <lb/>
require to be thoroughly informed.</p>
<p>As to my character, sir, you will hardly expect any <reg orig="satis-|factory">satisfactory</reg> <lb/>
information from <hi rend="italic">my</hi> own mouth. However, it may <lb/>
save you the trouble of applying to others, when I tell you, <lb/>
that my character has as many slurs and blots in it as any you <lb/>
ever met with. A more versatile, inconsistent, prejudiced <lb/>
and faulty person than myself, I do not believe the earth to <lb/>
contain. Profession, I have none, and am not acquiring <lb/>
any, nor expect ever to acquire. Of fortune I am wholly <lb/>
destitute; not a farthing have I, either in possession or <reg orig="re-|version">reversion</reg>.</p>
<p>Then pray, sir, on what are built your pretensions to my <lb/>
sister?</p>
<p>Really, sir, they are built on <hi rend="italic">nothing.</hi> I am, in every <lb/>
respect, immeasurably her inferior. I possess not a single <lb/>
merit that entitles me to grace from her.</p>
<p>I have surely not been misinformed. She tacitly <reg orig="ad-|mitted">admitted</reg> <lb/>
that she was engaged to be your wife.</p>
<p>'Tis very true. She is so.</p>
<p>But what, then, is the basis of this engagement.</p>
<p>Mutual affection, I believe, is the only basis. Nobody <lb/>
who knows Jane Talbot will need to ask why she is <reg orig="be-|loved">beloved</reg>? <lb/>
<pb n="124" entity="eaf033v4_0137" pid="uva-lib:350146"/>
Why she requites that passion in the present case is <lb/>
a question which she only can answer.</p>
<p>Her passion, sir, (contemptuously) is the freak of a child; <lb/>
of folly and caprice. By your own confession you are <reg orig="beg-|garly">beggarly</reg> <lb/>
and worthless, and therefore it becomes you to <reg orig="re-|linquish">relinquish</reg> <lb/>
your claim.</p>
<p>I have no claim to relinquish. I have urged no claims. <lb/>
On the contrary, I have fully disclosed to her every folly <lb/>
and vice that cleaves to my character.</p>
<p>You know, sir, what I mean.</p>
<p>I am afraid not perfectly. If you mean that I should <lb/>
profess myself unworthy of your sister's favor, 'tis done. <lb/>
It has been done a hundred times.</p>
<p>My meaning, sir, is simply this; that you, from this <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg>, <lb/>
give up every expectation of being the husband of <lb/>
Mrs. Talbot. That you return to her every letter, and <lb/>
paper that has passed between you; that you drop all <reg orig="in-|tercourse">intercourse</reg> <lb/>
and correspondence.</p>
<p>I was obliged to stifle a laugh which this whimsical <reg orig="pro-|posal">proposal</reg> <lb/>
excited. I continued, through this whole dialogue, to <lb/>
regard my companion with a steadfast, and cheerful gravity.</p>
<p>These are injunctions, said I, that will hardly meet with <lb/>
compliance, unless, indeed, they were imposed by the <lb/>
lady herself. I shall always have a supreme regard for her <lb/>
happiness, and whatever path she points out to me, I will <lb/>
walk in it.</p>
<p>But <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is the path in which her true interest requires <lb/>
you to walk.</p>
<p>I have not yet discovered that to be <hi rend="italic">her</hi> opinion; the <lb/>
moment I do, I will walk in it accordingly.</p>
<p>No matter what <hi rend="italic">her</hi> opinion is. She is froward and <reg orig="ob-|stinate">obstinate</reg>. <lb/>
It is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> opinion that her true happiness requires all <lb/>
connexion between you, to cease from this moment.</p>
<p>After all, sir, though, where judgments differ, one only <lb/>
can be right, yet each person must be permitted to follow <lb/>
his own. You would hardly, I imagine, allow your sister to <lb/>
prescribe to you in your marriage choice, and I fear she will <lb/>
lay claim to the same independence for herself. If you can <lb/>
convert her to your way of thinking, it is well. I solemnly <lb/>
engage to do whatever she directs.</p>
<pb n="125" entity="eaf033v4_0138" pid="uva-lib:350147"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">12</fw></pb>
<p>This is insolence. You trifle with me. You pretend to <lb/>
misconstrue my meaning.</p>
<p>When you charge me with insolence, I think you afford <lb/>
pretty strong proof that you mistake <hi rend="italic">my</hi> meaning. I have <lb/>
not the least intention to offend you.</p>
<p>Let me be explicit with you. Do you instantly and <reg orig="ab-|solutely">absolutely</reg> <lb/>
resign all pretensions to my sister?</p>
<p>I will endeavor to be explicit in my turn. Your sister, <lb/>
notwithstanding my defects and disadvantages, offers me <lb/>
her love; vows to be mine. I accept her love; she is <lb/>
mine; nor need we to discuss the matter any further.</p>
<p>This, however, by no means put an end to altercation. I <lb/>
told him I was willing to hear all that he had to say upon the <lb/>
subject. If truth were on his side, it was possible he might <lb/>
reason me into a concurrence with him. In compliance with <lb/>
this concession, he dwelt on the benefits which his sister <lb/>
would receive from accompanying him to France, and the <lb/>
mutual sorrow, debasement and perplexity likely to flow <lb/>
from a union between us, unsanctioned by the approbation <lb/>
of our common friends.</p>
<p>The purpose of all this is to prove, said I, that affluence <lb/>
and dignity without me, will be more conducive to your <lb/>
sister's happiness, than obscurity and indigence <hi rend="italic">with</hi> me.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>Happiness is mere matter of opinion; perhaps Jane thinks <lb/>
already as you do.</p>
<p>He allowed that he had talked with you ineffectually on <lb/>
that subject.</p>
<p>I think myself bound to believe her in a case where she <lb/>
is the proper judge, and shall eagerly consent to make her <lb/>
happy in her own way. <hi rend="italic">That,</hi> sir, is my decision.</p>
<p>I will not repeat the rest of our conversation. Your <reg orig="let-|ters">letters</reg> <lb/>
have given me some knowledge of your brother, and I <lb/>
endeavored by the mildness, sedateness and firmness of my <lb/>
carriage to elude those extremes to which his domineering <lb/>
passions were likely to carry him. I carefully avoided every <lb/>
thing that tended in the least to exasperate. He was prone <lb/>
enough to rage, but I quietly submitted to all that he could <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">say.</hi> I was sincerely rejoiced when the conference came <lb/>
to an end.</p>
<pb n="126" entity="eaf033v4_0139" pid="uva-lib:350148"/>
<p>Whence came your brother thus abruptly? Have you <lb/>
seen him? Yet he told me that you had. Alas! what must <lb/>
you have suffered from his impetuosity.</p>
<p>I look with impatience for your next letter, in which you <lb/>
will tell what has happened.</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I have</hi> just sent you a letter, but my restless spirit can <lb/>
find no relief but in writing.</p>
<p>I torment myself without end in imagining what took place <lb/>
at your meeting with my brother. I rely upon your <reg orig="equa-|nimity">equanimity</reg>, <lb/>
yet to what an insupportable test will my brother's <lb/>
passions subject you. In how many ways have I been the <lb/>
cause of pain and humiliation to you! Heaven, I hope, will <lb/>
some time grant me the power to compensate you for all <lb/>
that I have culpably or innocently made you suffer.&mdash;</p>
<p>What's this? A letter from my brother! The <reg orig="superscrip-|tion">superscription</reg> <lb/>
is his</p>
<ornament type="characters">*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*</ornament>
<p>Let me hasten, my friend, to give you a copy of this <lb/>
strange epistle. It has neither date nor signature.</p>
<p>"I have talked with the man whom you have chosen to <lb/>
play the fool with. I find him worthy of his mistress; a <lb/>
tame, coward-hearted, infatuated blockhead.</p>
<p>"It was silly to imagine that any arguments would have <lb/>
weight with you or with him. I have got my journey for <lb/>
my pains. Fain would I have believed that you were <reg orig="wor-|of">worof</reg> <lb/>
a different situation, but I dismiss that belief, and shall <lb/>
henceforth leave you to pursue your own dirty road, <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
interruption.</p>
<p>"Had you opened your eyes to your true interest, I think <lb/>
I could have made something of you. My wealth and my <lb/>
influence should not have been spared, in placing you in a <lb/>
station worthy of my sister. Every one, however, must <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="eaf033v4_0140" pid="uva-lib:350149"/>
take his own way&mdash;though it lead him into a slough or <lb/>
a ditch.</p>
<p>"I intended to have virtually divided my fortune with you; <lb/>
to have raised you to princely grandeur; but no; you are <lb/>
enamored of the dirt, and may cling to it as closely as you <lb/>
please.</p>
<p>"It is but justice, however, to pay what I owe you. I <reg orig="re-|member">remember</reg> <lb/>
I borrowed several sums of you; the whole <lb/>
amounted to fifteen hundred dollars. <hi rend="italic">There</hi> they are, and <lb/>
much good may they do you. That sum and the remnant <lb/>
which I left you may perhaps set the good man up in a <lb/>
village shop; may purchase an assortment of tapes, <reg orig="porrin-|gers">porringers</reg> <lb/>
and twelve-to-the-pound candles. The gleanings of the <lb/>
year may find you in skimmed milk and hasty pudding three <lb/>
times a day, and you may enjoy between whiles the <reg orig="delec-|table">delectable</reg> <lb/>
amusements of mending your husband's stockings at <lb/>
at one time, and serving a neighbor with a penny-worth <lb/>
of snuff at another.</p>
<p>"Fare thee well, Jane. Farewell forever; for it must be <lb/>
a stronger inducement than can possibly happen, that shall <lb/>
ever bring me back to this land. I would see you ere I go, <lb/>
but we shall only scold; so, once more, farewell, <reg orig="sim-|pleton">simpleton</reg>."</p>
<p>What think you of this letter? The enclosed bills were <lb/>
most unexpected and acceptable presents. I am now twice <lb/>
as rich as I was. This visit of my brother I was disposed <lb/>
to regret, but on the whole I ought, I think, to regard it with <lb/>
satisfaction. By thus completely repairing the breach made <lb/>
in my little patrimony, it has placed me in as good a <reg orig="situa-|tion">situation</reg> <lb/>
as I ever hoped to enjoy; besides, it has removed from <lb/>
my brother's character some of the stains which used to <lb/>
discolor it. Ought I not to believe him sincere in his <lb/>
wishes to do me service. We cannot agree exactly in our <lb/>
notion of duty or happiness, but that difference takes not <lb/>
away from him the merit of a generous intention. He <lb/>
would have done me good in his way.</p>
<p>Methinks, I am sorry he is gone. I would fain have <reg orig="part-|ed">parted</reg> <lb/>
with him as a sister ought. A few tears and a few <reg orig="bles-|sings">blessings</reg> <lb/>
were not unworthy such an occasion. Most fervently <lb/>
should I have poured my blessings upon him. I wish he <lb/>
had indulged me with another visit; especially as we were <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="eaf033v4_0141" pid="uva-lib:350150"/>
to part, it seems, forever. One more visit and a kind <reg orig="em-|brace">embrace</reg> <lb/>
from my only brother would have been kept in <reg orig="me-|lancholy">melancholy</reg>, <lb/>
sweet remembrance.</p>
<p>Perhaps we shall meet again. Perhaps, some day, thou <lb/>
and I shall go to France. We will visit him together, and <lb/>
witness, with our own eyes, his good fortune. Time may <lb/>
make him gentle; kind; considerate; brotherly. Time <lb/>
has effected greater wonders than that; for I will always <lb/>
maintain that my brother has a noble nature; stifled and <lb/>
obscured it may be, but not extinguished.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">How</hi> little is the equanimity or patience that nature has <lb/>
allotted me? thy entrance now would find me quite peevish. <lb/>
Yet I do not fear thy entrance. Always anxious as I am <lb/>
to be amiable in your eyes, I am at no pains to conceal from <lb/>
you that impatience which now vexes my soul, because it <lb/>
is your absence that occasions it.</p>
<p>I sat alone on the sofa below, for a whole hour. Not <lb/>
once was the bell rung&mdash;not once did my fluttering heart <lb/>
answer to footsteps in the passage. I had no need to start <lb/>
up at the opening of the parlor door, and to greet, as <reg orig="dis-|tinctly">distinctly</reg> <lb/>
as the joyous tumult of my bosom would suffer me, <lb/>
the much loved, long expected visitant.</p>
<p>Yet deceived, by my fond heart, into momentary <reg orig="forget-|fulness">forgetfulness</reg> <lb/>
of the interval of a hundred miles that lies between <lb/>
us, more than once cast I a glance behind me, and started, <lb/>
as if the hoped-for peal had actually been rung.</p>
<p>Tired, at length, of my solitude, where I had enjoyed <lb/>
your company so often, I covered up the coals, and <reg orig="with-|drew">withdrew</reg> <lb/>
to my chamber. And here, said I, though I cannot <lb/>
talk to him, yet I can write.</p>
<p>But first, I read over again this cruel letter of my <reg orig="mo-|ther">mother</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="eaf033v4_0142" pid="uva-lib:350151"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">12*</fw></pb>
I weighed all the contents, and especially those <lb/>
heavy charges against you.</p>
<p>How does it fall out that the same object is viewed by <lb/>
two observers with such opposite sensations. That what <lb/>
one hates, the other should doat upon? two of the same <lb/>
sex; one cherished from infancy; reared; modelled; <lb/>
taught to think; feel, and even to speak, by the other; <lb/>
acting till now, and even now, acting, in all respects bu <lb/>
one, in inviolable harmony; that two such should jar and <lb/>
thwart each other, in a point, too, in respect to which, the <lb/>
whole tendency and scope of the daughter's education was <lb/>
to produce a fellow feeling with the mother. How hard to <lb/>
be accounted for! how deeply to be rued!</p>
<p>I sometimes catch myself trembling with solicitude lest I <lb/>
should have erred. Am I not betrayed by passion? can I <lb/>
claim the respect due to that discernment which I once <lb/>
boasted?</p>
<p>I cannot blame my mother. She acts and determines, <lb/>
as I sometimes believe, without the benefits of my <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>. <lb/>
Did she know as much as I know, surely she would <lb/>
think as I do.</p>
<p>In general, this conclusion seems to be just; but there <lb/>
are moments when doubts insinuate themselves. I cannot <lb/>
help remembering the time when I reasoned like my <reg orig="mo-|ther">mother</reg>; <lb/>
when the belief of a christian seemed essential to <lb/>
every human excellence. All qualities, without that belief, <lb/>
were not to be despised as useless, but to be abhorred as <lb/>
pernicious. There would be no virtue, no merit, divorced <lb/>
from religion. In proportion to the speciousness of his <lb/>
qualities was he to be dreaded. The fruit, whatever form <lb/>
it should assume, was nothing within but bane, and was to <lb/>
be detested and shunned in proportion as the form was fair <lb/>
and its promises delicious.</p>
<p>I seldom trusted myself to inquire how it was my duty to <lb/>
act towards one whom I loved, but who was destitute of this <lb/>
grace, for of such moment was the question to me, that I <lb/>
imagined the decision would necessarily precede all others. <lb/>
I could not love, till I had investigated this point, and no <lb/>
force could oblige me to hold communion with a soul, whom <lb/>
this defect despoiled of all beauty and devoted to perdition.</p>
<pb n="130" entity="eaf033v4_0143" pid="uva-lib:350152"/>
<p>But what now is the change that time and passion have <lb/>
wrought. I have found a man without religion. What I <lb/>
supposed impossible, has happened. I love the man. I <lb/>
cannot give him up. The mist that is before my eyes, does <lb/>
not change what was once vice into virtue. I do not cease <lb/>
to regard unbelief as the blackest stain; as the most <reg orig="de-|plorable">deplorable</reg> <lb/>
calamity that can befall a human creature, but still <lb/>
I <hi rend="italic">love</hi> the man, and that fills me with unconquerable zeal <lb/>
to rescue him from this calamity.</p>
<p>But my mother interferes. She reminds me of the <reg orig="hor-|ror">horror</reg> <lb/>
which I once entertained for men of your tenets. She <lb/>
enjoins me to hate you, or to abhor myself for loving one <lb/>
worthy of nothing but hatred.</p>
<p>I cannot do either. My heart is still yours, and it is a <lb/>
voluntary captive. I would not free it from its thraldom, if <lb/>
I could. Neither do I think its captivity dishonors it. <lb/>
Time, therefore, has wrought some change. I can now <reg orig="dis-|cover">discover</reg> <lb/>
some merit; something to revere and to love, even <lb/>
in a man without religion. I find my whole soul penetrated <lb/>
with zeal for his welfare. There is no scheme which I <lb/>
muse upon with half the constancy or pleasure, as that of <lb/>
curing his errors, and I am confident of curing them.</p>
<p>"Ah Jane!" says my mother; "rash and presumptuous <lb/>
girl! What a signal punishment hangs over thee. Thou wilt <lb/>
trust thyself within the toils of the grand deceiver. Thou <lb/>
wilt enter the list with his subtleties. Vain and arrogant, <lb/>
thou fearest not thy own weakness. Thou wilt stake thy <lb/>
eternal lot upon thy triumph in argument against one, who, <lb/>
in spite of all his candor and humility, has his pride and his <lb/>
passions engaged on the side of his opinions.</p>
<p>"Subtle wretch!" does she exclaim, "accomplished <reg orig="vil-|lain">villain</reg>! <lb/>
How nicely does he select; how adroitly manage his <lb/>
tools! He will oppose, only to yield more gracefully. He <lb/>
will argue, only that the rash simpleton may the more <reg orig="con-|gratulate">congratulate</reg> <lb/>
herself upon her seeming victory! How easy is <lb/>
the verbal assent! the equivocating accent. The hesitating <lb/>
air! These he will assume whenever it is convenient to lull <lb/>
your fears and gratify your vanity, and nothing but the <reg orig="uni-|formity">uniformity</reg> <lb/>
of his conduct, his continuance in the same <reg orig="igno-|minious">ignominious</reg> <lb/>
and criminal path, will open your eyes, and shew <lb/>
<pb n="131" entity="eaf033v4_0144" pid="uva-lib:350153"/>
you that only grace from above can reach his obdurate <lb/>
heart, or dart a ray into his benighted faculties."</p>
<p>Will you be surprised that I shudder when my mother <lb/>
urges me in this strain, with her customary energy. Always <lb/>
wont to be obsequious to the very turn of her eye, and to <lb/>
make her will, not only the regulator of my actions, but the <lb/>
criterion of my understanding; it is impossible not to <reg orig="hesi-|tate">hesitate</reg>; <lb/>
to review all that has passed between us, and <reg orig="recon-|sider">reconsider</reg> <lb/>
anew the motives that have made me act as I have <lb/>
acted.</p>
<p>Yet the review always confirms me in my first opinion. <lb/>
You err, but are not obstinate in error. If your opinions be <lb/>
adverse to religion, your affections are not wholly estranged <lb/>
from it. Your understanding dissents, but your heart is <lb/>
not yet persuaded to refuse. You have powers, irresistible <lb/>
in whatever direction they are bent; capable of giving the <lb/>
highest degree of misery or happiness to yourself and to <lb/>
others. At present they are misdirected or inactive. They <lb/>
are either pernicious or useless.</p>
<p>How can I, who have had ample opportunities of <reg orig="know-|ing">knowing</reg> <lb/>
you, stand by with indifference while such is your state? <lb/>
I love you, it is true. All your felicity and all your woe <lb/>
become mine. I have a selfish interest in your welfare. I <lb/>
cannot bear the thought of passing through <hi rend="italic">this</hi> world, or of <lb/>
entering any future world, without you. My heart has tried <lb/>
in vain to create a separate interest; to draw consolation <lb/>
from a different source. Hence indifference to your <reg orig="wel-|fare">welfare</reg> <lb/>
is impossible. But would not indifference, even if no <lb/>
extraordinary tie subsisted between us, be criminal? What <lb/>
becomes of our obligation to do good to others, if we do not <lb/>
exert ourselves, when all the means are in our power, to <reg orig="con-|fer">confer</reg> <lb/>
the most valuable of all benefits; to remove the greatest <lb/>
of all ills?</p>
<p>Of what stuff must that heart be made which can behold, <lb/>
unmoved, genius and worth, destitute of the joys and <reg orig="ener-|gies">energies</reg> <lb/>
of religion; wandering in a maze of passions and <lb/>
doubts; devoured by fantastic repinings and vague regrets. <lb/>
Drearily conscious of wanting a foundation whereon to <reg orig="re-|pose">repose</reg>; <lb/>
a guide in whom to trust. What heart can gaze at <lb/>
such a spectacle without unspeakable compassion.</p>
<p>Not to have our pity and our zeal awakened, seems to <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="eaf033v4_0145" pid="uva-lib:350154"/>
me to argue the utmost depravity of heart. No stronger <lb/>
proof can be given that we ourselves are destitute of true <lb/>
religion. The faith or the practice must be totally wanting. <lb/>
We may talk devoutly; we may hie, in due season, to the <lb/>
house of prayer; while there, we may put on solemn visages <lb/>
and mutter holy names. We may abstain from profane <lb/>
amusements, or unauthorized words; we may shun, as <reg orig="in-|fectious">infectious</reg>, <lb/>
the company of unbelievers. We may study <reg orig="hom-|ilies">homilies</reg> <lb/>
and creeds; but all this, without <hi rend="italic">rational</hi> activity for <lb/>
others' good, is not religion. I see, in all this, nothing that <lb/>
I am accustomed to call by that name.</p>
<p>I see nothing but a narrow selfishness; sentiments of fear <lb/>
degrading to the Deity; a bigotry that contracts the view; <lb/>
that freezes the heart; that shuts up the avenues to <reg orig="benevo-|lent">benevolent</reg> <lb/>
and generous feeling. This buckram stiffness does not <lb/>
suit me. Out upon such monastic parade. I will have <lb/>
none of it.</p>
<p>But then, it seems, there is danger to ourselves from <lb/>
such attempts. In trying to save another from drowning, <lb/>
may we not sometimes be drawn in ourselves? Are we <lb/>
not taught to deprecate, not only evil, but temptation to <lb/>
evil?</p>
<p>What madness to trust our convictions, in a point of such <lb/>
immense importance, to the contest of argument with one of <lb/>
superior subtlety and knowledge. Is there not presumption <lb/>
in such a trust?</p>
<p>Excellent advice is this to the mass of women; to those <lb/>
to whom habit or childish fear or parental authority has <lb/>
given their faith; who never doubted or inquired or <reg orig="reason-|ed">reasoned</reg> <lb/>
for themselves. How easily is such a fabric to be <reg orig="over-|turned">overturned</reg>. <lb/>
It can only stand by being never blown upon. <lb/>
The least breath disperses it in air; the first tide washes it <lb/>
away.</p>
<p>Now, I entertain no reverence for such a bubble. In <lb/>
some sense, the religion of the timorous and uninquisitive, is <lb/>
true. In another sense it is false. Considering the proofs <lb/>
on which it reposes, it is false, since it merely originates in <lb/>
deference to the opinions of others, wrought into belief by <lb/>
means of habit. It is on a level, as to the proof which <lb/>
supports it, with the wildest dreams of savage superstition, <lb/>
or the fumes of a dervise's fanaticism.</p>
<pb n="133" entity="eaf033v4_0146" pid="uva-lib:350155"/>
<p>As to me, I was once just such a pretty fool in this respect, <lb/>
as the rest of my sex. I was easily taught to regard <reg orig="relig-|ion">religion</reg> <lb/>
not only as the safeguard of every virtue, but even as the <lb/>
test of a good understanding. The name of <hi rend="italic">infidel</hi> was <lb/>
never mentioned but with abhorrence or contempt. None <lb/>
but a profligate, a sensualist, a ruffian, could disbelieve. <lb/>
Unbelief was a mere suggestion of the grand deceiver, to <lb/>
palliate or reconcile us to the unlimited indulgence of our <lb/>
appetites, and the breach of every moral duty. Hence it <lb/>
was never steadfast or sincere. An adverse fortune or a <lb/>
death-bed, usually put an end to the illusion.</p>
<p>Thus I grew up, never beset by any doubts; never <reg orig="ven-|turing">venturing</reg> <lb/>
on inquiry. My knowledge of you, put an end to <lb/>
this state of superstitious ignorance. In you I found, not <lb/>
one that disbelieved, but one that doubted. In all your <reg orig="de-|meanor">demeanor</reg> <lb/>
there was simplicity and frankness. You <reg orig="conceal-|ed">concealed</reg> <lb/>
not your sentiments; you obtruded them not upon my <lb/>
hearing. When called upon to state the history of your <lb/>
opinions, it was candidly detailed; with no view of gaining <lb/>
my concurrence, but merely to gratify my curiosity.</p>
<p>From my remonstrances you never averted your ear. <lb/>
Every proof of an unprejudiced attention, and even of a <lb/>
bias favorable to my opinions, was manifest. Your own <reg orig="ex-|perience">experience</reg> <lb/>
had half converted you already. Your good sense <lb/>
was for a time the sport of a specious theory. You became <lb/>
the ardent and bold champion of what you deemed truth. <lb/>
But a closer and longer view insensibly detected flaws and <lb/>
discords where all had formerly been glossy smoothness and <lb/>
ravishing harmony. Diffidence and caution, worthy of your <lb/>
youth and inexperience, had resumed their place; and those <lb/>
errors, of which your own experience of their consequences <lb/>
had furnished the antidote, which your own reflections had <lb/>
partly divested of illusion, had only been propitious to your <lb/>
advancement in true wisdom.</p>
<p>What had I to fear from such an adversary? What might <lb/>
I not hope from perseverence? What expect but new <reg orig="clear-|ness">clearness</reg> <lb/>
to my own convictions; new and more accurate views <lb/>
of my powers and habits?</p>
<p>In order to benefit you, I was obliged to scrutinize the <lb/>
foundation of my own principles. I found nothing but a <lb/>
void. I was astonished and alarmed; and instantly set <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="134" entity="eaf033v4_0147" pid="uva-lib:350156"/>
to the business of inquiry. How could I hope to work <lb/>
on your convictions without a suitable foundation for my <lb/>
own?</p>
<p>And see now my friend the blindness of our judgments. <lb/>
I who am imagined to incur such formidable perils from <reg orig="in-|tercourse">intercourse</reg> <lb/>
with you, am, in truth, indebted to you alone for <lb/>
all my piety; all of it that is permanent and rational. <reg orig="With-|out">Without</reg> <lb/>
those apprehensions which your example inspired, <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
that zeal for your conversion which my attachment to <lb/>
you has produced, what would now have been my claims to <lb/>
religious knowledge?</p>
<p>Had I never extorted from you your doubts, and the <lb/>
occasion of these doubts; had I never known the most <reg orig="pow-|erful">powerful</reg> <lb/>
objections to religion from your lips, I should have been <lb/>
no less ignorant of the topics and arguments favorable to it.</p>
<p>And I think I may venture to ascribe to myself no less a <lb/>
progress in candor than in knowledge. My belief is stronger <lb/>
than it ever was, but, I no longer hold in scorn or abhorrence <lb/>
those who differ from me. I perceive the speciousness of <lb/>
those fallacies by which they are deluded. I find it possible <lb/>
for men to disbelieve and yet retain their claims to our <reg orig="reve-|rence">reverence</reg>, <lb/>
our affection, and especially our good offices.</p>
<p>Those whom I once thought were only to be hated and <lb/>
shunned, I now find worthy of compassionate efforts for their <lb/>
good. Those whom I once imagined sunk beneath the <lb/>
reach of all succor, and to merit scarcely the tribute of a <lb/>
sigh for their lost estate, now appear to be easily raised to <lb/>
tranquillity and virtue, and to have irresistible claims to our <lb/>
help.</p>
<p>In no respect has your company made me a worse, in <lb/>
every respect it has made me a better woman. Not only <lb/>
my piety has become more rational and fervent, but a new <lb/>
spring has been imparted to my languishing curiosity. To <lb/>
find a soul, to whom my improvement will give delight; <lb/>
eager to direct and assist my inquiries; delicately liberal no <lb/>
less of censure when merited, than of praise where praise is <lb/>
due; entering, almost without the help of language from me, <lb/>
into my inmost thoughts; assisting me, if I may so speak, <lb/>
to comprehend myself; and raising to a steadfast and bright <lb/>
flame, the spark that my wayward fancy, left to itself, would <lb/>
have instantaneously emitted and lost.&mdash;</p>
<pb n="135" entity="eaf033v4_0148" pid="uva-lib:350157"/>
<p>But why do I again attempt this impossible theme. While <lb/>
reflecting on my debt to thee, my heart becomes too big for <lb/>
its mansion. My hand falters, and the characters it traces, <lb/>
run into an illegible scrawl.</p>
<p>My tongue only is fitted for such an office; and Heaven <lb/>
grant that you may speedily return to me, and put an end <lb/>
to a solitude, which every hour makes more irksome.</p>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">How</hi> truly did my angel say, that she whom I love is my <lb/>
deity, and her lips my oracle, and that to her pertains not <lb/>
only the will to make me happy, by giving me steadfastness <lb/>
and virtue, but the power also!</p>
<p>I have read your letter oftener than a dozen times already, <lb/>
and at every reading my heart burns more and more. That <lb/>
weight of humiliation and despondency, which, without your <lb/>
arm to sustain me, would assuredly sink me to the grave, <lb/>
becomes light as a feather, and while I crush your <reg orig="testimo-|nies">testimonies</reg> <lb/>
of love in my hand, I seem to have hold of a stay of <lb/>
which no storm can bereave me.</p>
<p>One of my faults, thou sayest, is a propensity to reason. <lb/>
Not satisfied with looking at that side of the post that <lb/>
chances to be near me, I move round and round it, and <lb/>
pause and scrutinize till those whose ill fate it is to wait upon <lb/>
my motions, are out of patience with me.</p>
<p>Every one has ways of his own. A transient glance at <lb/>
the post, satisfies the mob of passengers. 'Tis my choice <lb/>
to stand awhile and gaze.</p>
<p>The only post, indeed, which I closely examine, is <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg>, <lb/>
because my station is most convenient for inspecting <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">that.</hi> Yet though I have a fuller view of myself than any <lb/>
other can have of me, my imperfect <hi rend="italic">sight,</hi> that is, my erring <lb/>
judgment, is continually blundering.</p>
<pb n="136" entity="eaf033v4_0149" pid="uva-lib:350158"/>
<p>If all my knowledge relate to my own character, and <lb/>
that knowledge is egregiously defective, how profound must <lb/>
be my ignorance of others, and especially of her, whom I <lb/>
presume to call mine?</p>
<p>No paradox ever puzzled me so much as your conduct. <lb/>
On my first interview with you I loved you, yet what kind <lb/>
of passion was that, which knew only your features and the <lb/>
sound of your voice. Every successive interview has <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg>, <lb/>
not only something new or unexpected, but <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
in seeming contradiction to my previous knowledge.</p>
<p>She will act, said I, in such and such circumstances, as <lb/>
those of her delicate and indulgent education must always <lb/>
act. That wit, that eloquence, that knowledge, must only <lb/>
make her despise such a witless, unendowed, <reg orig="unaccom-|plished">unaccomplished</reg>, <lb/>
wavering, and feeble wretch as I am.</p>
<p>To be called your friend; to be your occasional <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg>; <lb/>
to be a tolerated visiter was more than I expected. <lb/>
When I found all this anxiously sought and eagerly <reg orig="ac-|cepted">accepted</reg>, <lb/>
I was lost in astonishment. At times, may I <lb/>
venture to confess, that your regard for me brought your <lb/>
judgment into question! It failed to inspire me with more <lb/>
respect for myself, and not to look at me with my own eyes, <lb/>
degraded you in my opinion.</p>
<p>How have you labored to bestow on me that inestimable <lb/>
gift, self-confidence! And some success has attended your <lb/>
efforts. My deliverance from my chains is less desperate <lb/>
than once it was. I may judge of the future, perhaps, by <lb/>
the past. Since I have already made such progress in <reg orig="ex-|changing">exchanging</reg> <lb/>
distant veneration for familiar tenderness, and in <lb/>
persuading myself that he must possess some merit, whom <lb/>
a soul like thine idolizes, I may venture to anticipate the <lb/>
time when all my humiliation may vanish, and I shall <lb/>
come to be thought worthy of thy love, not only by thee, <lb/>
but by myself.</p>
<p>What a picture is this thou drawest? Yet such is my <lb/>
weakness, Jane, that I must shudder at the prospect. To <lb/>
tear thee from thy present dwelling and its comforts; to <lb/>
make thee a tenant of thy good widow, and a seamstress <lb/>
for me!</p>
<p>Yet what, (thou sayest,) is a fine house, and a train of <lb/>
servants, music and pictures? What silly prejudice, to <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="eaf033v4_0150" pid="uva-lib:350159"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">13</fw></pb>
connect dignity and happiness with high ceilings and damask <lb/>
canopies, and golden superfluity.</p>
<p>Yet so silly am I, when reason deserts the helm, and <lb/>
habit assumes it. The change thou hast painted, deceives <lb/>
me for a moment, or rather is rightly judged of, while I <lb/>
look at nothing but thy coloring, but when I withdraw my <lb/>
eye from that, and the scene rises before me in the hues it <lb/>
is accustomed to derive from my own fancy, my soul droops, <lb/>
and I pray heaven to avert such a destiny.</p>
<p>I tell thee all my follies, Jane. Art thou not my sweet <lb/>
physician, and how canst thou cure the malady, when thou <lb/>
knowest not all its symptoms?</p>
<p>I love to regard myself in this light. As one owing his <lb/>
virtue, his existence, his happiness, his every thing to thee, <lb/>
and as proposing no end to himself, but thy happiness <lb/>
in turn; but the discharge of an endless debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>On my account, Jane, I cannot bear you should lose any <lb/>
thing. It must not be. Yet what remedy? How is thy <lb/>
mother's aversion to be subdued&mdash;how can she be made to <lb/>
reason on my actions as you reason? yet not so, neither. <lb/>
None but she that loves me, can make such constructions <lb/>
and allowances as you do.</p>
<p>Why may she not be induced to give up the hope of <reg orig="dis-|uniting">disuniting</reg> <lb/>
us, and while she hates me, continue her affection <lb/>
for thee. Why rob thee of those bounties hitherto <reg orig="dis-|pensed">dispensed</reg> <lb/>
to thee, merely because <hi rend="italic">I</hi> must share in them. My <lb/>
partaking with thee contributes indispensably to thy <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg>. <lb/>
Not for my own sake, then, but merely for thine, <lb/>
ought competence to be secured to thee.</p>
<p>But is there no method of excluding me from all <reg orig="parti-|cipation">participation</reg>. <lb/>
She may withhold from me all power of a <reg orig="land-|lord">landlord</reg>, <lb/>
but she cannot prevent me from subsisting on thy <lb/>
bounty.</p>
<p>Yet why does she now allow you to possess what you <lb/>
do? Can she imagine that my happiness is not as dear to <lb/>
you now, as it will be in consequence of any change? If I <lb/>
share nothing with you now, it is not from any want of <reg orig="be-|nevolent">benevolent</reg> <lb/>
importunity in you.</p>
<p>There is a strange inconsistency and contradiction in thy <lb/>
mother's conduct.</p>
<pb n="138" entity="eaf033v4_0151" pid="uva-lib:350160"/>
<p>But something may surely be done to lighten her <reg orig="antipa-|thies">antipathies</reg>. <lb/>
I may surely confute a false charge. I may <reg orig="con-|vince">convince</reg> <lb/>
her of my innocence in one respect.</p>
<p>Yet see, my friend, the evils of which one error is the <lb/>
parent. My conduct towards the poor Jessy appears to <lb/>
your mother a more enormous wickedness than this imputed <lb/>
injustice to Talbot. The frantic indiscretion of my <reg orig="corres-|pondence">correspondence</reg> <lb/>
with Thompson, has ruined me, for he that will <lb/>
commit the greater crime, will not be thought to scruple <lb/>
the less.</p>
<p>And then there is such an irresistible crowd of <reg orig="evi-|dence">evidence</reg> <lb/>
in favor of the accusation! When I first read <lb/>
Mrs. Fielder's letter, the consciousness of my innocence <lb/>
gave me courage, but the longer I reflect upon the subject, <lb/>
the more deeply I despond. My own errors will always <lb/>
be powerful pleaders against me, at the bar of this austere <lb/>
judge.</p>
<p>Would to heaven I had not yielded to your urgency. <lb/>
The indecorum of compliance stared me in the face at the <lb/>
time. Too easily I yielded to the enchantments of those <lb/>
eyes, and the pleadings of that melting voice.</p>
<p>The charms of your conversation; the midnight hour <lb/>
whose security was heightened by the storm that raged <lb/>
without; so perfectly screened from every interruption; <lb/>
and the subject we had been talking on so affecting and <lb/>
attractive to me, and so far from being exhausted; and you <lb/>
so pathetically earnest in entreaty, so absolutely forbidding <lb/>
my departure.</p>
<p>And was I such a shortsighted fool as not to insist on <lb/>
your retiring at the usual hour! The only thing that could <lb/>
make the expedient suggested by me effectual, was that. <lb/>
Your Molly lying with you, could avail you nothing, unless <lb/>
you actually passed the night in your chamber.</p>
<p>As it was, no contrivance could be more unfortunate, <lb/>
since it merely enabled her the more distinctly to remark <lb/>
the hour when you came up. Was it <hi rend="italic">three or four</hi> when <lb/>
you left the parlor?</p>
<p>The unbosoming of souls which that night witnessed, so <lb/>
sweetly as it dwelt upon my memory, I now regard with <lb/>
horror, since it has involved you in such evil.</p>
<pb n="139" entity="eaf033v4_0152" pid="uva-lib:350161"/>
<p>But the letter&mdash;that was a most disastrous accident. I <lb/>
had read very frequently this fatal billet. Who is it that <lb/>
could imitate your hand so exactly? The same fashion in <lb/>
the letters, the same color in the ink, the same style, and <lb/>
the sentiments expressed, so fully and accurately coalescing <lb/>
with the preceding and genuine passages&mdash;no wonder that <lb/>
your mother, being so well acquainted with your pen, should <lb/>
have no doubt as to your guilt, after such testimony.</p>
<p>There must be a perpetrator of this iniquity. Talbot it <lb/>
could not be; for where lay the letter in the interval <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
its disappearance and his return; and what motive <lb/>
could influence him to commit or to countenance such a <lb/>
forgery?</p>
<p>Without doubt there was some deceiver.&mdash;Some one <lb/>
stole the letter, and by his hand was this vile conclusion <lb/>
added, and by him was it communicated to Talbot. But <lb/>
hast thou such an enemy in the world? Whom have you <lb/>
offended, capable of harboring such deadly vengeance?</p>
<p>Pray, my friend, sit down to the recollection of your past <lb/>
life, and inquire who it was that possessed your husband's <lb/>
confidence; who were his intimate companions, endeavor <lb/>
to discover; tell me the names and characters of all those <lb/>
who were accustomed to visit your house, either on your <lb/>
account or his. Strange, if among all these, there is no <lb/>
foundation for some conjecture, however shadowy.</p>
<p>Thompson is no better, yet grows worse, hardly <reg orig="percep-|tibly">perceptibly</reg>. <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">You</hi> impose on me a painful task. Persuaded that <reg orig="re-|flection">reflection</reg> <lb/>
was useless, I have endeavored to forget this fatal <lb/>
letter and all its consequences. I see you will not allow <lb/>
me to forget it; but I must own it is weakness to endeavor <lb/>
to shun the scrutiny.</p>
<pb n="140" entity="eaf033v4_0153" pid="uva-lib:350162"/>
<p>Some one, my friend, must be in fault; and what fault <lb/>
can be more atrocious than this. To defraud, by forgery, <lb/>
your neighbor of a few dollars, is a crime which nothing <lb/>
but a public and ignominious death will expiate; yet how <lb/>
trivial is that offence, compared with a fraud like this, which <lb/>
robs a helpless woman of her reputation; introduces <reg orig="mor-|tal">mortal</reg> <lb/>
enmity between her and those whose affection is <reg orig="necessa-|ry">necessary</reg> <lb/>
to render life tolerable.</p>
<p>Whenever I think of this charge, an exquisite pain seizes <lb/>
my heart. There must be the blackest perfidy somewhere. <lb/>
I cannot bear to think that any human creature is capable <lb/>
of such a deed. A deed which the purest malice must <lb/>
have dictated, since there is none surely in the world, whom <lb/>
I have ever intentionally injured.</p>
<p>I cannot deal in conjectures. The subject, I find, by my <lb/>
feelings since I began this letter, is too agonizing&mdash;too <reg orig="be-|wildering">bewildering</reg>. <lb/>
It carries back my thoughts to a time of misery, <lb/>
to which distance, instead of smoothing it into apathy, only <lb/>
adds a new sting.</p>
<p>A spotless reputation was once dear to me, but have I <lb/>
now torn the passion from my heart. I am weary of <reg orig="pur-|suing">pursuing</reg> <lb/>
a phantom. No one has pursued it with more <reg orig="eager-|ness">eagerness</reg> <lb/>
and perseverance than I; and what has been the fruit <lb/>
of my labor but reiterated mortification and <reg orig="disappoint-|ment">disappointment</reg>?</p>
<p>An upright demeanor, a self-acquitting conscience, are not <lb/>
sufficient for our safety. Calumny and misapprehension <lb/>
have no bounds to their rage and their activity.</p>
<p>How little did my thoughtless heart imagine the horrid <lb/>
images which beset the minds of my mother and my <reg orig="hus-|band">husband</reg>. <lb/>
Happy ignorance! Would to Heaven it had <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg>! <lb/>
Since knowledge puts it not in my power to <lb/>
remove the error, it ought to be avoided as the greatest <lb/>
evil.</p>
<p>While I know my own motives, and am convinced of <lb/>
their purity, let me hold in contempt the opinions of the <lb/>
world respecting me. They can never have a basis in <lb/>
truth. Be they favorable or otherwise, they cannot fail to <lb/>
be built on imperfect knowledge. The praise of others <lb/>
is therefore as little to be sought or prized as their censure <lb/>
to be dreaded or shunned.</p>
<pb n="141" entity="eaf033v4_0154" pid="uva-lib:350163"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">13*</fw></pb>
<p>Heaven knows how much I value the favor and affection <lb/>
of my mother, but dear as it is, I must give it up. How <lb/>
can I retain it? I cannot confute the charge. I must not <lb/>
acknowledge a guilt that does not belong to me. Added, <lb/>
therefore, to her belief of my guilt, must be the persuasion <lb/>
of my being a hardened and obdurate criminal.</p>
<p>What will she think of my two last letters? The former <lb/>
tacitly confessing my unworthiness, and promising <reg orig="compli-|ance">compliance</reg> <lb/>
with all her wishes; the next asserting my innocence, <lb/>
and refusing her generous offers. My first, she will <reg orig="proba-|bly">probably</reg> <lb/>
ascribe to an honorable compunction, left to operate <lb/>
without your control. In the second she will trace your <lb/>
influence. Left to myself, she will imagine me capable of <lb/>
acting as she wishes; but guided by you, she will lose all <lb/>
hopes of me, and resign me to my fate.</p>
<p>Indeed I have given up my mother. There is no other <lb/>
alternative but that of giving up you; and in this case I can <lb/>
hesitate, indeed, but I cannot decide against you.</p>
<p>I am placed in a very painful situation. I feel as if every <lb/>
hour spent under this roof was an encroachment on another's <lb/>
rights. My mother's bounty is not withheld, merely because <lb/>
my rebellion against her will is not completed; but I that <lb/>
feel no doubt, and whom mere consideration of her pleasure, <lb/>
important as it is, will never make swerve from my purpose; <lb/>
ought I to enjoy goods to which I have forfeited all title? <lb/>
Ought I to wait for an express command to be gone from <lb/>
her doors? Ought I to lay her under the necessity of <reg orig="de-|claring">declaring</reg> <lb/>
her will?</p>
<p>Yet if I change my lodgings immediately, without waiting <lb/>
her directions, will she not regard my conduct as <reg orig="contemp-|tuous">contemptuous</reg>? <lb/>
Shall I not then be a rebel indeed; one that scorns <lb/>
her favor, and is eager to get rid of all my obligations?</p>
<p>How painful is such a situation; yet there is no escaping <lb/>
from it that I can see. I must, per force, remain as I am. <lb/>
But perhaps her next letter will throw some light upon my <lb/>
destiny. I suppose my positive assertions will shew her that <lb/>
a change of purpose cannot be hoped for from me.</p>
<p>The bell rings. Perhaps it is the postman, and the <reg orig="intel-|ligence">intelligence</reg> <lb/>
I wish for has arrived&mdash;Adieu.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">What</hi> shall I say to thee, my friend. How shall I <reg orig="com-|municate">communicate</reg> <lb/>
a resolution fatal, as thy tenderness will deem it, <lb/>
to thy peace; yet a resolution suggested by a heart which <lb/>
has, at length, permitted all selfish regards to be swallowed <lb/>

<p>Why did you conceal from me your father's treatment of <lb/>

<p>How much misery would your forbearance have laid up <lb/>
in store for my future life. When fate had put it out of my <lb/>

<p>But, thanks to Heaven, I am apprized in time of the truth. <lb/>
Instead of the bearer of a letter from my mother, whose <lb/>

mother herself.</p>
<p>Dear and welcome as those features and that voice once <lb/>
were, now would I rather have encountered the eyes of a <lb/>
basalisk and the notes of the ill-boding raven.</p>
<p>She hastened with all this expedition to thank me; to <lb/>
urge me to execute; to assist me in performing the promises <lb/>
of my first letter. The second, in which these promises <lb/>
were recalled, never reached her hand. She left New York, <lb/>
as it now appeared, before its arrival. The interval had <lb/>
been spent on the road, where she had been detained by <lb/>
untoward and dangerous accidents.</p>
<p>Think, my friend, of the embarrassments attending this <lb/>
unlooked for and inauspicious meeting. Joy at my supposed <lb/>
compliance with her wishes, wishes that imaged to <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="eaf033v4_0156" pid="uva-lib:350165"/>
my happiness, and only mine, enabled her to support <lb/>
the hardships of this journey. Fatigue and exposure, likely <lb/>
to be fatal to one of so delicate, so infirm a constitution, so <lb/>
lately and imperfectly recovered from a dangerous malady, <lb/>
could not deter her.</p>
<p>Fondly, rapturously did she fold to her bosom, the long <lb/>
lost and late recovered child. Tears of joy she shed over <lb/>
me, and thanked me for the tranquil and serene close which <lb/>
my return to virtue, as she called my acquiescence, had <lb/>
secured to her life. That life would at all events be short, <lb/>
but my compliances, if they could not much protract it, <lb/>
would at least render its approaching end peaceful.</p>
<p>All attempts to reason with my mother were fruitless. <lb/>
She fell into alarming agonies when she discovered the full <lb/>
import of that coldness and dejection which my demeanor <lb/>
betrayed. Fatigued and indisposed as she was, she made <lb/>
preparation to depart; she refused to pass one night under <lb/>
the same roof; her <hi rend="italic">own</hi> roof; and determined to be gone, <lb/>
on her return home, the very next morning.</p>
<p>Will not your heart comprehend the greatness of this trial, <lb/>
and pity and excuse a momentary wavering; a yielding <lb/>
irresolution? Yet it was but momentary. An hour's <reg orig="soli-|tude">solitude</reg> <lb/>
and deep reflection fortified my heart against the grief <lb/>
and supplication even of my mother.</p>
<p>Next day she was more calm. She condescended to <lb/>
reason, to expostulate. She carefully shunned the mention <lb/>
of atrocious charges. She dwelt only on the proofs which <lb/>
your past life and your own confessions had afforded, of <reg orig="un-|steady">unsteady</reg> <lb/>
courage and unwarrantable principles; your treatment <lb/>
of the Woodbury girl; your correspondence with Thomson; <lb/>
your ignoble sloth; your dependence upon others; your <lb/>
helplessness.</p>
<p>From these accusations, I defended you in silence. My <lb/>
heart was your secret advocate. I did not verbally repel <lb/>
any of these charges. That of inglorious dependence for <lb/>
subsistence upon others, I admitted; but I could not forbear <lb/>
urging that this dependence was on a father. A father who <lb/>
was rich; who had no other child than yourself; whose <lb/>
own treatment of you, had planted and reared in you this <lb/>
indisposition to labor; to whose property, your title, <reg orig="ulti-|mately">ultimately</reg>, <lb/>
could not be denied.</p>
<pb n="144" entity="eaf033v4_0157" pid="uva-lib:350166"/>
<p>And has he then, she exclaimed, deceived you in that <lb/>
particular? Has he concealed from you his father's <reg orig="resolu-|tions">resolutions</reg>? <lb/>
That his engagement with you, has already drawn <lb/>
down his father's anger, and even his curses. On his <reg orig="per-|sisting">persisting</reg> <lb/>
to maintain an inviolable faith to you, he was <reg orig="igno-|miniously">ignominiously</reg> <lb/>
banished from his father's roof. All kindred and <lb/>
succor were disclaimed, and on you depends the <reg orig="con-|tinuance">continuance</reg> <lb/>
of that decree, and whether that protection and <lb/>
subsistence which he has hitherto enjoyed, and of which his <lb/>
character stands in so much need, shall be lost to him <reg orig="for-|ever">forever</reg>.</p>
<p>You did not tell me <hi rend="italic">this,</hi> my friend. In claiming your <lb/>
love, far was I from imagining that I tore you from your <lb/>
father's house, and plunged you into that indigence which <lb/>
your character and education so totally unfit you for <reg orig="sus-|taining">sustaining</reg> <lb/>
or escaping from.</p>
<p>My mother removed all doubt which could not but attend <lb/>
such unwelcome tidings, by shewing me her own letter to <lb/>
your father, and his answer to it.</p>
<p>Well do I recollect your behavior on the evening when <lb/>
my mother's letter was received by your father. At that <lb/>
time, your deep dejection was inexplicable. And did you <lb/>
not&mdash;my heart bleeds to think how much my love has cost <lb/>
you&mdash;Did you not talk of a fall on the ice when I pointed <lb/>
to a bruise on your forehead. That bruise, and every token <lb/>
of dismay, your endeavors at eluding or diverting my <reg orig="at-|tention">attention</reg> <lb/>
from your sorrow and solemnity, are now explained.</p>
<p>Good Heaven! and was I indeed the cause of that <reg orig="vio-|lence">violence</reg>, <lb/>
that contumely; the rage, and even curses of a <reg orig="fa-|ther">father</reg>? <lb/>
And why concealed you these maledictions and this <lb/>
violence from me? Was it not because you well knew <lb/>
that I would never consent to subject you to such a penalty?</p>
<p>Hasten then, I beseech you, to your father; lay this <reg orig="let-|ter">letter</reg> <lb/>
before him; let it inform him of my solemn and <reg orig="irre-|vocable">irrevocable</reg> <lb/>
resolution to sever myself from you forever.</p>
<p>But this I will, myself, do. I will acquaint him with my <lb/>
resignation to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> will and that of my mother, and beseech <lb/>
him to restore you to his favor.</p>
<p>Farewell, my friend. By that name, at least, I may <lb/>
continue to call you. Yet no. I must never see you <lb/>
<pb n="145" entity="eaf033v4_0158" pid="uva-lib:350167"/>
nor hear from you again; unless it be in answer to this <lb/>
letter.</p>
<p>Let your pity stifle the emotions of indignation or grief, <lb/>
and return me such an answer as may tend to reconcile me <lb/>
to the vow, which, whether difficult or easy, must not be <lb/>
broken.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I was</hi> not informed till to day, of the correspondence <lb/>
that has passed between you and my mother, nor of your <lb/>
aversion to the alliance which was designed to take place <lb/>
between your son and me.</p>
<p>It is my duty to inform you that, in my opinion, your <reg orig="ap-|probation">approbation</reg> <lb/>
was absolutely necessary to such a union; and <lb/>
consequently, since your concurrence is withheld, it will <lb/>
never take place. Every tie or engagement between us, is, <lb/>
from this moment dissolved, and all intercourse, by letter <lb/>
or otherwise, will here end.</p>
<p>Your son, in opposing your wishes, imagined himself <lb/>
consulting my happiness. In that he was mistaken; and I <lb/>
have now removed his error, by acquainting him with my <lb/>
present determination.</p>
<p>I am deeply grieved that his attachment to me has <reg orig="for-|feited">forfeited</reg> <lb/>
your favor. I hope that there is no other obstacle to <lb/>
reconcilement, and that the termination of all intercourse <lb/>

<p>I join my daughter in assuring you that the alliance, for <lb/>
which a mutual aversion was entertained, cannot take place; <lb/>
and that all her engagements with your son are dissolved. <lb/>
I join her likewise in entreating you to forget his <reg orig="disobe-|dience">disobedience</reg>, <lb/>

</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> becomes me to submit without a murmur to a <reg orig="resolu-|tion">resolution</reg> <lb/>
dictated by a disinterested regard to my happiness.</p>
<p>That you may find in that persuasion; in your mother's <lb/>
tenderness and gratitude; in the affluence and honor, which <lb/>
this determination has secured to you, abundant consolation <lb/>
for every evil that may befall yourself or pursue me, are <lb/>
my only wishes.</p>
<p>Far was I from designing to conceal from you entirely <lb/>
my father's aversion to our views. I frequently apprized <lb/>
you of the inferences to be naturally drawn from his known <lb/>
character, but I trusted to his generosity, to the steadiness <lb/>
of my own deportment&mdash;to your own merits, when he should <lb/>
become personally acquainted with you; to his good sense, <lb/>
when reflecting on an evil in his power to lessen, though not <lb/>
wholly to remove&mdash;for a change in his opinions; or, at <lb/>
least, in his conduct.</p>
<p>There was sufficient resemblance in the characters of <lb/>
both our parents to make me rely on the influence of time <lb/>
and reflection in our favor. Your mother could not cease <lb/>
to love you. I could not by any accident be wholly <reg orig="be-|reaved">bereaved</reg> <lb/>
of my father's affection. No conduct of theirs had <lb/>
robbed them of my esteem. Why then did I persist in <lb/>
thwarting their wishes? Why encourage you in your <reg orig="oppo-|sition">opposition</reg>? <lb/>
because I imagined that, in thwarting their present <lb/>
views, which were founded in error, I consulted their lasting <lb/>
happiness, and made myself a title to their future gratitude, <lb/>
by challenging their present rebukes.</p>
<p>I told you not of my father's passionate violences, <reg orig="dis-|graceful">disgraceful</reg> <lb/>
to himself and productive of unspeakable anguish <lb/>
to me. Why should I revive the scene? why be the <reg orig="histo-|rian">historian</reg> <lb/>
of my father's dishonor? why needlessly add to my own <lb/>
and to your affliction?</p>
<p>My concealments arose not from the fear that the <reg orig="dis-|closure">disclosure</reg> <lb/>
would estrange you from me. I supposed you <reg orig="will-|ing">willing</reg> <lb/>
to grant me the same independence of a parent's <reg orig="con-|trol">control</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="eaf033v4_0160" pid="uva-lib:350169"/>
which you claimed for yourself. I saw no difference <lb/>
between forbearing to consult a parent, in a case where we <lb/>
know that his answer will condemn us, and slighting his <reg orig="ex-|press">express</reg> <lb/>
forbidding.</p>
<p>I say thus much to account for, and, if possible, excuse <lb/>
that concealment with which you reproach me. Tender <lb/>
and reluctant, indeed, are these reproaches, but as I deem <lb/>
it a sacred duty to reveal to you the utmost of my follies, <lb/>
what but in justice to you would be the tacit admission of <reg orig="in-|jurious">injurious</reg> <lb/>
but groundless charges.</p>
<p>My actual faults are of too deep a dye to allow me to <lb/>
sport with your good opinion, or permit me to be worse <lb/>
thought of by you than I deserve.</p>
<p>You exhort me to seek reconcilement with my father. <lb/>
What mean you? I have not been the injurer. Not an <reg orig="an-|gry">angry</reg> <lb/>
word, accusing look, or vengeful thought has come from <lb/>
me. I have exercised the privilege of a rational and moral <lb/>
being. I have loved, not according to another's estimate of <lb/>
merit, but my own. Of what then am I to repent? where <lb/>
lies my transgression! if his treatment of me be occasioned <lb/>
by antipathy for you, must I adopt his antipathy, and thus <lb/>
creep again into favor? Impossible! if it arise from my <reg orig="re-|fusing">refusing</reg> <lb/>
to give up an alliance which his heart abhors, your <lb/>
letter to him, which you tell me you mean to write, and <lb/>
which will inform him that every view of that kind is at an <lb/>
end, will remove the evil.</p>
<p>Fear not for me, my friend. Whatever be my lot, be <lb/>
assured that I never can taste pure misery while the thought <lb/>
abides with me that you are not happy.</p>
<p>And what now remains but to leave with you the blessing <lb/>
of a grateful and devoted heart, and to submit with what <reg orig="hu-|mility">humility</reg> <lb/>
I can, to the destiny which you have prescribed.</p>
<p>I should not deserve your love, if I did not now <reg orig="re-|linquish">relinquish</reg> <lb/>
it with an anguish next to despair; neither should I <lb/>
have merit in my own eyes, if I did not end this letter with <lb/>
acquitting you, the author of my loss, of all shadow of <lb/>
blame.</p>

<dateline>November 28.</dateline>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I told</hi> you of your brother Stephen's talk with me about <lb/>
accompanying him on his northwest voyage. I mentioned <lb/>
to you what were my objections to the scheme. It was a <lb/>
desperate adventure; a sort of forlorn hope; to be pursued <lb/>
in case my wishes in relation to Jane should be crossed. <lb/>
I had not then any, or much apprehension of change in her <lb/>
resolutions. So many proofs of a fervent and invincible <reg orig="at-|tachment">attachment</reg> <lb/>
to me had she lately given, that I could not <reg orig="ima-|gine">imagine</reg> <lb/>
any motive strong enough to change her purpose. <lb/>
Yet now, my friend, have I arranged matters with your <reg orig="bro-|ther">brother</reg>, <lb/>
and expect to bid an everlasting farewell to my native <lb/>
shore some day within the ensuing fortnight.</p>
<p>I call it an everlasting farewell, for I have, at present, <lb/>
neither expectation nor desire of returning. A three years <lb/>
wandering among boisterous seas and through various <reg orig="cli-|mates">climates</reg>, <lb/>
added to that inward care, that spiritless, dejected <lb/>
heart which I shall ever bear about me, would surely never <lb/>
let me return, even if I had the wish; but I have not the <lb/>
wish. If I live at all, it must be in a scene far different and <lb/>
distant from that in which I have been hitherto reluctantly <lb/>
detained.</p>
<p>And why have I embraced this scheme? There can be <lb/>
but one cause.</p>
<p>Having just returned from following Thomson's remains <lb/>
to the grave, I received a letter from Jane. Her mother <lb/>
had just arrived. She came, it seems, in consequence <lb/>
of her daughter's apparent compliance with her wishes. <lb/>
The letter, retracting my friend's precipitate promise, had <lb/>
miscarried or had lingered by the way. What I little <reg orig="sus-|pected">suspected</reg>, <lb/>
my father had acquainted Mrs. Fielder with his <lb/>
conduct towards me, and this, together with her mother's <lb/>
importunities, had prevailed on Jane once more to <reg orig="re-|nounce">renounce</reg> <lb/>
me.</p>
<p>There never occurred an event in my life which did not, <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="eaf033v4_0162" pid="uva-lib:350171"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">14</fw></pb>
some way, bear testimony to the usefulness and value of <lb/>
sincerity. Had I fully disclosed all that passed between my <lb/>
father and me, should I not easily have diverted Jane from <lb/>
these extremities. Alone; at a distance from me; and <lb/>
with her mother's eloquence at hand, to confirm every <reg orig="way-|ward">wayward</reg> <lb/>
sentiment, and fortify her in every hostile resolution, <lb/>
she is easily driven into paths, and perhaps kept steadily in <lb/>
them, from which proper explanations and pathetic <reg orig="argu-|ments">arguments</reg>, <lb/>
had they been early and seasonably employed by <lb/>
me, would have led her easily away.</p>
<p>I begin to think it is vain to strive against maternal <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg>. <lb/>
What but momentary victory can I hope to attain? <lb/>
What but poverty, dependence, ignominy, will she share <lb/>
with me? And if her strenuous spirit set nought by these, <lb/>
and I know she is capable of rising above them, how will <lb/>
she support her mother's indignation and grief.</p>
<p>I have now, indeed, no hope of even momentary victory. <lb/>
There are but two persons in the world, who command her <lb/>
affections. Either, when present, (the other absent or <lb/>
silent) has absolute dominion over her. Her mother, no <lb/>
doubt, is apprized of this, and has now pursued the only <lb/>
effectual method of securing submission.</p>
<p>I have already written an answer; I hope such a one <lb/>
as, when the present tumults of passion have subsided, <lb/>
when the eye sedately scrutinizes, and the heart beats in an <lb/>
even tenor, may be read without shame or remorse.</p>
<p>I shall also write to her mother. In doing this, I must <lb/>
keep down the swelling bitterness. It may occupy my <lb/>
solitude, torment my feelings, but why should it infect my <lb/>
pen?</p>
<p>I have sometimes given myself credit for impartiality in <lb/>
judging of others. Indeed I am inclined to think myself <lb/>
no blind or perverse judge even of my own actions. Hence, <lb/>
indeed, the greater part of my unhappiness. If my <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg> <lb/>
had always conformed, instead of being adverse, to <lb/>
my principles, I should have moved on tranquilly and <reg orig="self-|satisfied">selfsatisfied</reg>, <lb/>
at least; but, in truth, the being that goes by my <lb/>
name, was never more thoroughly contemned by another <lb/>
than by myself.&mdash;But this is falling into the old strain; <reg orig="irk-|some">irksome</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="eaf033v4_0163" pid="uva-lib:350172"/>
tiresome, and useless to you as to me. Yet I cannot <lb/>
write just now in any other; therefore I will stop.</p>
<p>Adieu, my friend. There will be time enough to hear <lb/>
from you ere my departure. Let me hear then from you.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">My</hi> daughter informs me that the letter she has just <reg orig="des-|patched">despatched</reg> <lb/>

a reply from you, in which, she doubts not, you will <lb/>

<p>You, no doubt, regard me as your worst enemy. No <lb/>

<p>In my treatment of you, I shall not pretend any direct <lb/>

or not, merely by views to the true interest of <lb/>
Mrs. Talbot, which, in my opinion, forbids her to unite <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>

If you consider the matter rightly, therefore, instead of <reg orig="ac-|counting">accounting</reg> <lb/>

<p>You have shewn yourself, in some instances, not destitute <lb/>

expected, and makes me disposed to trust your candor to <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I pretend</hi> not to be raised above any of the infirmities <lb/>

past conduct, and the defects which will ever cleave to my <lb/>
character, to be either surprised or indignant at the <reg orig="disap-|probation">disapprobation</reg> <lb/>
of a virtuous mind. So far from harboring <reg orig="re-|sentment">resentment</reg> <lb/>
against you, it is with reluctance I decline the <lb/>
acceptance of your bill. I cannot consider it in any other <lb/>
light than as an alms which my situation is far from making <lb/>
necessary, and by receiving which I should defraud those <lb/>
whose poverty may plead a superior title.</p>
<p>I hasten to give you pleasure by informing you of my <lb/>
intention to leave America immediately. My destiny is far <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="eaf033v4_0165" pid="uva-lib:350174"/>
from being certain, but, at present, I both desire and expect <lb/>
never to revisit my native land.</p>
<p>I design not to solicit another interview with Mrs. Talbot. <lb/>
You dissuade me from making any reply to her letter, from <lb/>
the fear, no doubt, that my influence will be exerted to <lb/>
change her resolution. Dismiss, I entreat you, madam, <lb/>
every apprehension of that kind. Your daughter has <reg orig="de-|liberately">deliberately</reg> <lb/>
made her election. If no advantage be taken <lb/>
of her tenderness and pity, she will be happy in her new <lb/>
scheme. Shall I, who pretend to love her, subject her to <lb/>
new trials and mortifications? Am I able to reward her, by <lb/>
my affection, for the loss of every other comfort. What <lb/>
can I say in favor of my own attachment to her, which <lb/>
may not be urged in favor of her attachment to her mother. <lb/>
The happiness of one or the other must be sacrificed, and <lb/>
shall I not rather offer, than demand the sacrifice? and <lb/>
how poor and selfish should I be if I did not strive to lessen <lb/>
the difficulties of her choice, and persuade her that in <reg orig="grati-|fying">gratifying</reg> <lb/>
her mother, she inflicts no lasting misery on me?</p>
<p>I regard, in its true light, what you can say with respect <lb/>
to reconcilement with my father, and am always ready to <lb/>
comply with your wishes in the only way that a conviction <lb/>
of my own rectitude will permit. I have patiently endured <lb/>
revilings and blows, but I shall not needlessly expose myself <lb/>
to new insults. Though willing to accept apology and <lb/>
grant an oblivion of the past, I will never avow a penitence <lb/>
which I do not feel, or confess that I deserved the treatment <lb/>
I received.</p>
<p>Truly can I affirm that your daughter's happiness is of <lb/>
all earthly things most dear to me. I fervently thank Heaven <lb/>
that I leave her exempt from all the hardships of poverty, <lb/>
and in the bosom of one who will guard her safety with a <lb/>
zeal equal to my own. All that I fear is, that your efforts <lb/>
to console her will fail. I know the heart, which, if you <lb/>
thought me worthy of the honor, I should account it my <lb/>
supreme felicity to call mine. Let it be a precious deposit <lb/>
in your hands.</p>
<p>And now, Madam, permit me to conclude with a solemn <lb/>
blessing on your head, and on her's, and with an eternal <lb/>
farewell to you both.</p>

of mankind is, at this moment, insupportable. Of all <lb/>
places in the world, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is the most hateful to my soul. I <lb/>
should not have entered the city, I should not abide in it a <lb/>
moment, were it not for a thought that occurred just before <lb/>
I left Baltimore.</p>
<p>You know the mysterious and inexplicable calumny <lb/>
which has heightened Mrs. Fielder's antipathy against me. <lb/>
Of late, I have been continually ruminating on it, and <reg orig="es-|pecially">especially</reg> <lb/>
since Mrs. Talbot's last letter. Methinks it is <lb/>
impossible for me to leave the country till I have cleared <lb/>
her character of this horrid aspersion. Can there be any <lb/>
harmony between mother and child; must not suspicion <lb/>
and mistrust perpetually rankle in their bosoms, while this <lb/>
imposture is believed?</p>
<p>Yet how to detect the fraud&mdash;Some clue must be <reg orig="discern-|ible">discernible</reg>; <lb/>
perseverance must light on it, at last. The agent in <lb/>
this sordid iniquity must be human; must be influenced <lb/>
by the ordinary motives; must be capable of remorse or <lb/>
of error; must have moments of repentance or of <reg orig="negli-|gence">negligence</reg>.</p>
<p>My mind was particularly full of this subject in a <reg orig="mid-|night">midnight</reg> <lb/>
ramble which I took just before I left Baltimore. <reg orig="Some-|thing">Something</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="154" entity="eaf033v4_0167" pid="uva-lib:350176"/>
I know not what, recalled to mind a conversation which <lb/>
I had with the poor washwoman at Wilmington. Miss <lb/>
Jessup, whom you well know by my report, passed through <lb/>
Wilmington just as I left the sick woman's house, and <reg orig="stop-|ped">stopped</reg> <lb/>
a moment just to give me an "How'de'ye" and to <lb/>
drop some railleries, founded on my visits to Miss Secker, a <lb/>
single and solitary lady. On reaching Philadelphia she <lb/>
amused herself with perplexing Jane, by jesting <reg orig="exaggera-|tions">exaggerations</reg> <lb/>
on the same subject, in a way that seemed to argue <lb/>
somewhat of malignity; yet I thought nothing of it at the <lb/>
time.</p>
<p>On my next visit to the sick woman, it occurred to me, <lb/>
for want of other topics of conversation, to introduce Miss <lb/>
Jessup. Did she know any thing, I asked, of that lady.</p>
<p>O yes, was the answer. A great deal. She lived a long <lb/>
time in the family. She remembered her well, and was a <lb/>
sufferer by many of her freaks.</p>
<p>It was always disagreeable to me to listen to the <reg orig="slander-|ous">slanderous</reg> <lb/>
prate of servants; I am careful, whenever it intrudes <lb/>
itself, to discourage and rebuke it; but just at this time I <lb/>
felt some resentment against this lady, and hardly supposed <lb/>
it possible for any slanderer to exaggerate her contemptible <lb/>
qualities. I suffered her therefore to run on in a tedious <lb/>
and minute detail of the capricious, peevish and captious <lb/>
deportment of Miss Jessup.</p>
<p>After the rhetoric of half an hour, all was wound up, in <lb/>
a kind of satirical apology, with&mdash;No wonder, for the girl <lb/>
was over head and ears in love, and her man would have <lb/>
nothing to say to her. A hundred times has she begged <lb/>
and prayed him to be kind, but he slighted all her <reg orig="ad-|vances">advances</reg>, <lb/>
and always after they had been shut up together, <lb/>
she wreaked her disappointment and ill humor upon us.</p>
<p>Pray, said I, who was this ungrateful person?</p>
<p>His name was Talbot. Miss Jessup would not give him <lb/>
up, but teazed him with letters and prayers till the man at <lb/>
last, got married, ten to one for no other reason than to get <lb/>
rid of her.</p>
<p>This intelligence was new. Much as I had heard of <lb/>
Miss Jessup, a story like this had never reached my ears. <lb/>
I quickly ascertained that the Talbot spoken of was the late <lb/>
husband of my friend.</p>
<pb n="155" entity="eaf033v4_0168" pid="uva-lib:350177"/>
<p>Some incident interrupted the conversation here. The <lb/>
image of Miss Jessup was displaced to give room to more <lb/>
important reveries, and I thought no more of her till this <lb/>
night's ramble. I now likewise recollected that the only <lb/>
person suspected of having entered the apartment where <lb/>
lay Mrs. Talbot's unfinished letter, was no other than Miss <lb/>
Jessup herself, who was always gadding at unseasonable <lb/>
hours. How was this suspicion removed? By Miss Jessup <lb/>
herself, who, on being charged with the theft, asserted that <lb/>
she was elsewhere engaged at the time.</p>
<p>It was, indeed, exceedingly improbable that Miss Jessup <lb/>
had any agency in this affair. A volatile, giddy, <reg orig="thought-|less">thoughtless</reg> <lb/>
character, who betrayed her purposes on all occasions, <lb/>
from a natural incapacity to keep a secret; and yet had <lb/>
not this person succeeded in keeping her attachment to Mr. <lb/>
Talbot from the knowledge, and even the suspicion of his <lb/>
wife? Their intercourse had been very frequent since her <lb/>
marriage, and all her sentiments appeared to be expressed <lb/>
with a rash and fearless confidence. Yet, if Hannah <reg orig="Sec-|ker's">Secker's</reg> <lb/>
story deserved credit, she had exerted a wonderful <lb/>
degree of circumspection, and had placed on her lips a <lb/>
guard that had never once slept.</p>
<p>I determined to stop at Wilmington next day, on my <lb/>
journey to you, and glean what further information Hannah <lb/>
could give. I ran to her lodgings as soon as I alighted at <lb/>
the inn.</p>
<p>I inquired how long and in what years she lived with <lb/>
Miss Jessup; what reason she had for suspecting her <reg orig="mis-|tress">mistress</reg> <lb/>
of an attachment to Talbot; what proofs Talbot gave <lb/>
of aversion to her wishes.</p>
<p>On each of these heads, her story was tediously minute <lb/>
and circumstantial. She lived with Miss Jessup and her <lb/>
mother, before Talbot's marriage with my friend; after the <lb/>
marriage, and during his absence on the voyage which <reg orig="oc-|casioned">occasioned</reg> <lb/>
his death.</p>
<p>The proofs of Miss Jessup's passion were continually <reg orig="oc-|curring">occurring</reg> <lb/>
in her own family, where she suffered the ill humor, <lb/>
occasioned by her disappointment, to display itself without <lb/>
control. Hannah's curiosity was not chastised by much <lb/>
reflection, and some things were overheard which verified <lb/>
the old maxim, that "walls have ears." In short, it <reg orig="ap-|pears">appears</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="156" entity="eaf033v4_0169" pid="uva-lib:350178"/>
that this poor lady doated on Talbot; that she <reg orig="re-|versed">reversed</reg> <lb/>
the usual methods of proceeding and submitted to <lb/>
his mercy; that she met with nothing but scorn and <reg orig="ne-|glect">neglect</reg>; <lb/>
that even after his marriage with Jane, she sought his <lb/>
society, pestered him with invitations and letters, and <reg orig="di-|rected">directed</reg> <lb/>
her walks in such a way as to make their meeting <lb/>
in the street occur as if by accident.</p>
<p>While Talbot was absent she visited his wife very <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg>, <lb/>
but the subjects of their conversation and the <reg orig="de-|gree">degree</reg> <lb/>
of intimacy between the two ladies were better known <lb/>
to me than to Hannah.</p>
<p>You may think it strange that my friend never suspected <lb/>
or discovered the state of Miss Jessup's feelings. But, in <lb/>
truth, Jane is the least suspicious or inquisitive of mortals. <lb/>
Her neighbor was regarded with no particular affection; her <lb/>
conversation is usually a vein of impertinence or levity; her <lb/>
visits were always unsought and eluded as often as <reg orig="de-|corum">decorum</reg> <lb/>
would permit; her talk was seldom listened to, and <lb/>
she and all belonging to her were dismissed from recollection <lb/>
as soon as politeness gave leave. Miss Jessup's <reg orig="deficien-|cies">deficiencies</reg> <lb/>
in personal and mental graces, and Talbot's <reg orig="undis-|guised">undisguised</reg> <lb/>
contempt for her, precluded every sentiment like <lb/>
jealousy.</p>
<p>Jane's life, since the commencement of her acquaintance <lb/>
with Miss Jessup, was lonely and secluded. Her friends <lb/>
were not of her neighbor's cast, and these tattlers who <lb/>
knew any thing of Miss Jessup's follies were quite unknown <lb/>
to her. No wonder, then, that the troublesome <reg orig="imperti-|nence">impertinence</reg> <lb/>
of this poor woman had never betrayed her to so <reg orig="in-|attentive">inattentive</reg> <lb/>
an observer as Jane.</p>
<p>After many vague and fruitless inquiries, I asked Hannah <lb/>
if Miss Jessup was much addicted to the pen.</p>
<p>Very much. Was always scribbling. Was never by <lb/>
herself three minutes but the pen was taken up; would <lb/>
write on any pieces of paper that offered; was frequently <lb/>
rebuked by her mother for wasting so much time in this <lb/>
way; the cause of a great many quarrels between them; <lb/>
the old lady spent the whole day knitting; supplied herself <lb/>
in this way, with all the stockings she herself used; knit <lb/>
nothing but worsted, which she wore all the year round; <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="eaf033v4_0170" pid="uva-lib:350179"/>
all the surplus beyond what she needed for her own use, she <lb/>
sold at a good price to a Market street shopkeeper; <reg orig="Han-|nah">Hannah</reg> <lb/>
used to be charged with the commission; always <reg orig="exe-|cuted">executed</reg> <lb/>
it grumblingly; the old lady had stipulated with a Mr. <lb/>
H&mdash; to take at a certain price, all she made; Hannah <lb/>
was despatched with the stockings, but was charged to go <lb/>
beforehand to twenty other dealers, and try to get more. <lb/>
Used to go directly to Mr. H&mdash;, and call on her friends <lb/>
by the way, persuading the old lady that her detention was <lb/>
occasioned by the number and perseverance of her <reg orig="ap-|plications">applications</reg> <lb/>
to the dealers in hose; till, at last, she fell under <lb/>
suspicion; was once followed by the odl lady, detected in <lb/>
her fraud, and dismissed from the house with ignominy. <lb/>
The quondam mistress endeavored to injure Hannah's <reg orig="cha-|racter">character</reg> <lb/>
by reporting that her agent had actually got a higher <lb/>
price for the stockings than she thought proper to account <lb/>
for to her employer; had gained, by this artifice, not less <lb/>
than three farthings a pair, on twenty-three pairs; all a base <lb/>
lie as ever was told&mdash;</p>
<p>You say that Miss Jessup was a great scribbler. Did she <lb/>
write well; fast; neatly?</p>
<p>They say she did; very well. For her part, she could <lb/>
not write; and was therefore no judge, but Tom, the waiter <lb/>
and coachman, was very fond of reading and writing, and <lb/>
used to say that Miss Hetty would make a good clerk. Tom <lb/>
used to carry all her messages and letters; was a cunning <lb/>
and insinuating fellow; cajoled his mistress by flatteries and <lb/>
assiduities; got many a smile; many a bounty and gratuity, <lb/>
for which the fellow only laughed at her behind her back.</p>
<p>What has become of this Tom?</p>
<p>He lives with her still, and was in as high favor as ever. <lb/>
Tom had paid her a visit, the day before, being in <reg orig="atten-|dance">attendance</reg> <lb/>
on his mistress on her late journey. From him she <lb/>
supposed that Miss Hetty had gained intelligence of <reg orig="Han-|nah's">Hannah's</reg> <lb/>
situation, and of her being succored, in her distress, <lb/>
by me.</p>
<p>Tom, you say, was her letter carrier. Did you ever <lb/>
hear from him with whom she corresponded? did she ever <lb/>
write to Talbot?</p>
<p>O yes. Just before Talbot's marriage, she often wrote <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="eaf033v4_0171" pid="uva-lib:350180"/>
to him. Tom used to talk very freely in the kitchen about <lb/>
his mistress' attachment, and always told us, what <reg orig="recep-|tion">reception</reg> <lb/>
he met with. Mr. Talbot seldom condescended to <lb/>
write any answer.</p>
<p>I suppose, Hannah, I need hardly ask whether you have <lb/>
any specimen of Miss Jessup's writing in your possession?</p>
<p>This question considerably disconcerted the poor <reg orig="wo-|man">woman</reg>. <lb/>
She did not answer me till I had repeated the <reg orig="ques-|tion">question</reg>.</p>
<p>Why&mdash;yes&mdash;she had&mdash;something&mdash;she believed.</p>
<p>I presume it is nothing improper to be disclosed; if so, I <lb/>
should be glad to have a sight of it.</p>
<p>She hesitated; was very much perplexed. Denied and <lb/>
confessed alternately that she possessed some of Miss <reg orig="Jes-|sup's">Jessup's</reg> <lb/>
writing; at length began to weep very bitterly.</p>
<p>After some solicitation on my part, to be explicit, she <lb/>
consented to disclose what she acknowledged to be a great <lb/>
fault. The substance of her story was this:</p>
<p>Miss Jessup, on a certain occasion, locked herself up for <lb/>
several hours in her chamber. At length, she came out, <lb/>
and went to the street door, apparently with an intention of <lb/>
going abroad. Just then a heavy rain began to fall. This <lb/>
incident produced a great deal of impatience, and after <lb/>
waiting some time, in hopes of the shower's ceasing, and <lb/>
frequently looking at her watch, she called for an umbrella. <lb/>
Unhappily, as poor Hannah afterwards thought, no <reg orig="um-|brella">umbrella</reg> <lb/>
could be found. Her own had been lent to a friend <lb/>
the preceding evening, and the mother would have held <lb/>
herself most culpably extravagant to uncase hers, without a <lb/>
most palpable necessity. Miss Hetty was preparing to go out <lb/>
unsheltered, when the officious Tom interfered, and asked <lb/>
her if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> could do what she wanted. At first, she refused <lb/>
his offer, but the mother's importunities to stay at home <reg orig="be-|coming">becoming</reg> <lb/>
more clamorous, she consented to commission Tom <lb/>
to drop a letter at the post-office. This he was to do with <lb/>
the utmost despatch, and promised that not a moment <lb/>
should be lost. He received the letter, but instead of <reg orig="run-|ning">running</reg> <lb/>
off with it immediately, he slipped into the kitchen, <lb/>
just to arm himself against the storm by a hearty draught <lb/>
of strong beer.</p>
<p>While quaffing his nectar, and chattering with his usual <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="eaf033v4_0172" pid="uva-lib:350181"/>
gaiety, Hannah, who had long owed a grudge both to <reg orig="mis-|tress">mistress</reg> <lb/>
and man, was tempted to convey the letter from Tom's <lb/>
pocket, where it was but half deposited, into her own. Her <lb/>
only motive was to vex and disappoint those whose chief <lb/>
pleasure it had always been to vex and disappoint her. <lb/>
The tankard being hastily emptied, he hastened away to the <lb/>
post-office. When he arrived there, he felt for the letter. <lb/>
It was gone; dropped, as he supposed, in the street. In <lb/>
great confusion he returned, examining very carefully the <lb/>
gutters and porches, by the way. He entered the kitchen <lb/>
in great perplexity, and inquired of Hannah if a letter had <lb/>
not fallen from his pocket before he went out.</p>
<p>Hannah, according to her own statements, was incapable <lb/>
of inveterate malice, she was preparing to rid Tom of his <lb/>
uneasiness, when he was summoned to the presence of his <lb/>
lady. He thought proper to extricate himself from all <reg orig="diffi-|culties">difficulties</reg> <lb/>
by boldly affirming that the letter had been left <lb/>
according to direction, and he afterwards endeavored to <lb/>
persuade Hannah that it had been found in the bottom of his <lb/>
pocket.</p>
<p>Every day increased the difficulty of disclosing the truth. <lb/>
Tom and Miss Jessup, talked no more on the subject, and <lb/>
time, and new provocations from her mistress, confirmed <lb/>
Hannah in her resolution of retaining the paper.</p>
<p>She could not read, and was afraid of trusting any body <lb/>
else with the contents of this epistle. Several times she <lb/>
was about to burn it, but forbore from the persuasion that a <lb/>
day might arrive when the possession would be of some <reg orig="im-|portance">importance</reg> <lb/>
to her. It had laid, till almost forgotten, in the <lb/>
bottom of her crazy chest.</p>
<p>I rebuked her, with great severity, for her conduct, and <lb/>
insisted on her making all the atonement in her power, by <lb/>
delivering up the letter to the writer. I consented to take <lb/>
charge of it for that purpose.</p>
<p>You will judge my surprise, when I received a letter, <lb/>
with the seal unbroken, directed to Mrs. Fielder, of New <lb/>
York. Jane and I had often been astonished at the minute <lb/>
intelligence which her mother received of our proceedings; <lb/>
at the dexterity this secret informant had displayed in <reg orig="mis-|representing">misrepresenting</reg> <lb/>
and falsely construing our actions. The <reg orig="in-|former">informer</reg> <lb/>
was anonymous, and one of the letters had been <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="eaf033v4_0173" pid="uva-lib:350182"/>
extorted from her mother by Jane's urgent solicitations. <lb/>
This I had frequently perused, and the penmanship was still <lb/>
familiar to my recollection. It bore a striking resemblance <lb/>
to the superscription of this letter, and was equally remote <lb/>
from Miss Jessup's ordinary hand-writing. Was it rash to <lb/>
infer from these circumstances that the secret enemy, whose <lb/>
malice had been so active and successful, was at length <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg>?</p>
<p>What was I to do? Should I present myself before Miss <lb/>
Jessup, with this letter in my hand, and lay before her my <lb/>
suspicions, or should I carry it to Mrs. Fielder, to whom it <lb/>
was directed? My curiosity was defeated by the careful <lb/>
manner in which it was folded, and this was not a case in <lb/>
which I deemed myself authorized to break a seal.</p>
<p>After much reflection, I determined to call upon Miss <reg orig="Jes-|sup">Jessup</reg>. <lb/>
I meant not to restore her the letter, unless the course <lb/>
our conversation should take, made it proper. I have <reg orig="al-|ready">already</reg> <lb/>
been at her house. She was not at home. I am to <lb/>
call again at eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
<p>In my way thither I passed Mrs. Talbot's house. There <lb/>
were scarcely any tokens of its being inhabited. No doubt, <lb/>
the mother and child have returned together to New York. <lb/>
On approaching the house, my heart, too heavy before, <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
a burthen almost insupportable. I hastened my pace, <lb/>
and averted my eyes.</p>
<p>I am now shut up in my chamber at an inn. I feel as if <lb/>
in a wilderness of savages, where all my safety consisted in <lb/>
solitude. I was glad not to meet with a human being whom <lb/>
I knew.</p>
<p>What shall I say to Miss Jessup when I see her, I know <lb/>
not. I have reason to believe her the author of many <lb/>
slanders, but look for no relief from the mischiefs they have <lb/>
occasioned, in accusing or upbraiding the slanderer. She <lb/>
has likewise disclosed many instances of guilty conduct, <lb/>
which I supposed impossible to be discovered. I never <lb/>
concealed them from Mrs. Talbot, to whom a thorough <lb/>
knowledge of my character was indispensable, but I was <lb/>
unwilling to make any other my confessor. In this, I <reg orig="can-|not">cannot</reg> <lb/>
suppose her motives to have been very benevolent, but, <lb/>
since she adhered to the truth, it is not for me to arraign her <lb/>
motives.</p>
<pb n="161" entity="eaf033v4_0174" pid="uva-lib:350183"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">15</fw></pb>
<p>May I not suspect that she had some hand in the forgery <lb/>
lately come to light. A mind like hers must hate a <reg orig="suc-|cessful">successful</reg> <lb/>
rival. To persuade Talbot of his wife's perfidy, <lb/>
was at least to dissolve his alliance with another; and since <lb/>
she took so much pains to gain his favor, even after his <lb/>
marriage, is it not allowable to question the delicacy and <lb/>
punctiliousness, at least, of her virtue?</p>
<p>Mrs. Fielder's aversion to me, is chiefly founded on a <lb/>
knowledge of my past errors. She thinks them too flagrant <lb/>
to be atoned for, and too inveterate to be cured. I can <lb/>
never hope to subdue perfectly that aversion, and though <lb/>
Jane can never be happy without me, <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> alone, cannot make <lb/>
her happy. On my own account, therefore, it is of little <lb/>
moment what she believes. But her own happiness is <lb/>
deeply concerned in clearing her daughter's character of <lb/>
this blackest of all stains.</p>
<p>Here is some one coming up the stairs, towards my <lb/>
apartment. Surely it cannot be to me that this visit is <lb/>
intended&mdash;</p>
<ornament type="characters">*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*</ornament>
<p>Good Heaven! What shall I do?</p>
<p>It was Molly that has just left me.</p>
<p>My heart sunk at her appearance. I had made up my <lb/>
mind to separate my evil destiny from that of Jane; and <lb/>
could only portend new trials and difficulties from the <reg orig="ap-|pearance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
of one whom I supposed her messenger.</p>
<p>The poor girl, as soon as she saw me, began to sob <reg orig="bitter-|ly">bitterly</reg>, <lb/>
and could only exclaim&mdash;O, sir! O, Mr. Colden.</p>
<p>This behavior was enough to terrify me. I trembled in <lb/>
every joint while I faltered out&mdash;I hope your mistress is <lb/>
well.</p>
<p>After many efforts, I prevailed in gaining a distinct <reg orig="ac-|count">account</reg> <lb/>
of my friend's situation. This good girl, by the <reg orig="sym-|pathy">sympathy</reg> <lb/>
she always expressed in her mistress's fortunes; by <lb/>
her silent assiduities and constant proofs of discretion and <lb/>
affection, had gained Mrs. Talbot's confidence; yet no <reg orig="far-|ther">farther</reg> <lb/>
than to indulge her feelings with less restraint in Molly's <lb/>
presence than in that of any other person.</p>
<p>I learned that the night after Mrs. Fielder's arrival, was <lb/>
spent by my friend in sighs and restlessness. Molly lay in <lb/>
<pb n="162" entity="eaf033v4_0175" pid="uva-lib:350184"/>
the same chamber, and her affectionate heart was as much <lb/>
a stranger to repose as that of her mistress. She frequently <lb/>
endeavored to comfort Mrs. Talbot, but in vain.</p>
<p>Next day she did not rise as early as usual. Her <reg orig="moth-|er">mother</reg> <lb/>
came to her bedside, and inquired affectionately after her <lb/>
health. The visit was received with smiling and <reg orig="affection-|ate">affectionate</reg> <lb/>
complacency. Her indisposition was disguised, and she <lb/>
studied to persuade Mrs. Fielder that she enjoyed her usual <lb/>
tranquillity. She rose, and attempted to eat, but quickly <lb/>
desisted, and after a little while retired and locked herself <lb/>
up in her chamber. Even Molly was not allowed to follow <lb/>
her.</p>
<p>In this way, that and the ensuing day passed. She wore an <lb/>
air of constrained cheerfulness in her mother's presence; <lb/>
affected interest in common topics; and retired at every <lb/>
convenient interval to her chamber, where she wept <reg orig="inces-|santly">incessantly</reg>.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fielder's eye was watchful and anxious. She <reg orig="ad-|dressed">addressed</reg> <lb/>
Mrs. Talbot in a tender and maternal accent; <reg orig="seem-|ed">seemed</reg> <lb/>
solicitous to divert her attention by anecdotes of New <lb/>
York friends; and carefully eluded every subject likely to <lb/>
recall images which were already too intimately present. <lb/>
The daughter seemed grateful for these solicitudes, and <lb/>
appeared to fight with her feelings the more resolutely <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
they gave pain to her mother.</p>
<p>All this was I compelled to hear from the communicative <lb/>
Molly.</p>
<p>My heart bled at this recital. Too well did I predict <lb/>
what effect her compliance would have on her peace.</p>
<p>I asked if Jane had not received a letter from me.</p>
<p>Yes&mdash;two letters had come to the door at once, this <lb/>
morning; one for Mrs. Fielder and the other for her <reg orig="daugh-|ter">daughter</reg>. <lb/>
Jane expected its arrival, and shewed the utmost <reg orig="im-|patience">impatience</reg> <lb/>
when the hour approached. She walked about <lb/>
her chamber, listened, with a start, to every sound; <reg orig="con-|tinually">continually</reg> <lb/>
glanced from her window at the passengers.</p>
<p>She did not conceal from Molly the object of her <reg orig="solici-|tude">solicitude</reg>. <lb/>
The good girl endeavored to sooth her, but she <reg orig="check-|ed">checked</reg> <lb/>
her with vehemence. Talk not to me, Molly. On this <lb/>
hour depends my happiness&mdash;my life. The sacrifice my <lb/>
mother asks, is too much or too little. In bereaving me of <lb/>
<pb n="163" entity="eaf033v4_0176" pid="uva-lib:350185"/>
my love she must be content to take my existence also. <lb/>
They never shall be separated.</p>
<p>The weeping girl timorously suggested that she had <lb/>
already given me up.</p>
<p>True, Molly, in a rash moment, I told him that we meet <lb/>
no more; but two days of misery has convinced me that it <lb/>
cannot be. His answer will decide my fate as to this world. <lb/>
If he accept my dismissal, I am thenceforth undone. I will <lb/>
die. Blessing my mother, and wishing her a less stubborn <lb/>
child, <hi rend="italic">I will die.</hi></p>
<p>These last words were uttered with an air the most <reg orig="des-|perate">desperate</reg>, <lb/>
and an emphasis the most solemn. They chilled <lb/>
me to the heart, and I was unable longer to keep my seat. <lb/>
Molly, unbidden, went on.</p>
<p>Your letter at last came. I ran down to receive it. Mrs. <lb/>
Fielder was at the street door before me, but she suffered <lb/>
me to carry my mistress' letter to her. Poor lady! She <lb/>
met me at the stair-head, snatched the paper eagerly, but <lb/>
trembled so she could not open it. At last she threw <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
on the bed, and ordered me to read it to her. I did <lb/>
so. At every sentence she poured forth fresh tears, and <lb/>
exclaimed, wringing her hands&mdash;O! what&mdash;what a heart <lb/>
have I madly cast away.</p>
<p>The girl told me much more, which I am unable to <reg orig="re-|peat">repeat</reg>. <lb/>
Her visit was self-prompted. She had caught a <lb/>
glimpse of me as I passed the door, and without <reg orig="mention-|ing">mentioning</reg> <lb/>
her purpose to her mistress, set out as soon as it was <lb/>
dusk.</p>
<p>Cannot you do something, Mr. Colden, for my mistress? <lb/>
continued the girl. She will surely die if she has not her <lb/>
own way; and to judge from your appearance, it is as great <lb/>
a cross to you as to her.</p>
<p>Heaven knows, that, with me, it is nothing but the choice <lb/>
of dreadful evils. Jane is the mistress of her own destiny. <lb/>
It is not I that have renounced her, but she that has <reg orig="banish-|ed">banished</reg> <lb/>
me. She has only to recall the sentence, which she <reg orig="con-|fesses">confesses</reg> <lb/>
to have been hastily and thoughtlessly pronounced&mdash; <lb/>
and no power on earth shall sever me from her side.</p>
<p>Molly asked my permission to inform her mistress of my <lb/>
being in the city, and conjured me not to leave it, during <lb/>
the next day, at least. I readily consented, and requested <lb/>
<pb n="164" entity="eaf033v4_0177" pid="uva-lib:350186"/>
her to bring me word in the morning in what state things <lb/>
were.</p>
<p>She offered to conduct me to her then. It was easy to <lb/>
effect an interview without Mrs. Fielder's knowledge; but I <lb/>
was sick of all clandestine proceedings, and had promised <lb/>
Mrs. Fielder not to seek another meeting with her daughter. <lb/>
I was likewise anxious to visit Miss Jessup, and ascertain <lb/>
what was to be done by means of the letter in my pocket.</p>
<p>Can I, my friend, can I, without unappeasable <reg orig="re-|morse">remorse</reg>, <lb/>
pursue this scheme of a distant voyage. Suppose <lb/>
some fatal despair should seize my friend. Suppose&mdash;it is <lb/>
impossible. I will not stir till she has had time to <reg orig="delibe-|rate">deliberate</reg>; <lb/>
till resignation to her mother's will, shall prove a task <lb/>
that is practicable.</p>
<p>Should I not be the most flagrant of villains if I deserted <lb/>
one that loved me. My own happiness is not a question. <lb/>
I cannot be a selfish being and a true lover. Happiness, <lb/>
without her, is indeed a chimerical thought, but my exile <lb/>
would be far from miserable, while assured of her <reg orig="tranquilli-|ty">tranquillity</reg>, <lb/>
and possession would confer no peace, if her whom I <lb/>
possessed, were not happier than a different destiny would <lb/>
make her.</p>
<p>Why have all these thoughts been suspended for the last <lb/>
two days. I had wrought myself up to a firm persuasion <lb/>
that marriage was the only remedy for all evils; that our <lb/>
efforts to regain the favor of her mother would be most <lb/>
likely to succeed, when that which she endeavored to <reg orig="pre-|vent">prevent</reg>, <lb/>
was irretrievable. Yet that persuasion was dissipated <lb/>
by her last letter. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> convinced me that her lot would <lb/>
only be made miserable by being united to mine. Yet <lb/>
now&mdash;is it not evident that our fates must be inseparable?</p>
<p>What a fantastic impediment is this aversion of her <reg orig="mo-|ther">mother</reg>? <lb/>
And yet, can I safely and deliberately call it <reg orig="fan-|tastic">fantastic</reg>? <lb/>
Let me sever myself <hi rend="italic">from</hi> myself, and judge <reg orig="im-|partially">impartially</reg>. <lb/>
Be my heart called upon to urge its claims to <lb/>
such affluence, such love, such treasures of personal and <lb/>
mental excellence as Jane has to bestow. Would it not be <lb/>
dumb. It is not so absurd as to plead its devotion to her, <lb/>
as an atonement for every past guilt, and as affording <reg orig="secu-|rity">security</reg> <lb/>
for future uprightness.</p>
<p>On my own merit I am, and ever have been mute. I <lb/>
<pb n="165" entity="eaf033v4_0178" pid="uva-lib:350187"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">15*</fw></pb>
have plead with Mrs. Fielder not for myself but for Jane. <lb/>
It is her happiness that forms the object of my supreme <reg orig="re-|gard">regard</reg>. <lb/>
I am eager to become hers, because <hi rend="italic">her,</hi> not because <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">my</hi> happiness, though my happiness certainly <hi rend="italic">does,</hi> demand <lb/>
it.</p>
<p>I am then resolved. Jane's decision shall be deliberate. <lb/>
I will not bias her by prayers or blandishments. Her <reg orig="reso-|lution">resolution</reg> <lb/>
shall spring from her own judgment, and shall <reg orig="abso-|lutely">absolutely</reg> <lb/>
govern me. I will rivet myself to her side, or vanish <lb/>
forever according to her pleasure.</p>
<p>I wish I had written a few words to her by Molly, <reg orig="assur-|ing">assuring</reg> <lb/>
her of my devotion to her will. And yet, stands she in <lb/>
need of any new assurances. She has banished me. I <lb/>
am preparing to fly. She recalls me, and it is impossible <lb/>
to depart.</p>
<p>I must go to Miss Jessup's. I will take up the pen ('tis <lb/>
my sole amusement&mdash;) when I return&mdash;</p>
<ornament type="characters">*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*</ornament>
<p>I went to Miss Jessup's; her still sealed letter in my <lb/>
pocket; my mind confused; perplexed; sorrowful; wholly <lb/>
undetermined as to the manner of addressing her, or the <lb/>
use to be made of this important paper. I <reg orig="designed-|ly">designedly</reg> <lb/>
prolonged my walk in hopes of forming some distinct <lb/>
conception of the purpose for which I was going, but only <lb/>
found myself each moment, sinking into new perplexities. <lb/>
Once I had taken the resolution of opening her letter and <lb/>
turned my steps towards the fields, that I might examine it <lb/>
at leisure, but there was something disgraceful in the <reg orig="viola-|tion">violation</reg> <lb/>
of a seal, which scared me away from this scheme.</p>
<p>At length, reproaching myself for this indecision and <lb/>
leaving my conduct to be determined by circumstances; I <lb/>
went directly to her house.</p>
<p>Miss Jessup was unwell; was unfit to see company; <reg orig="de-|sired">desired</reg> <lb/>
me to send up my name. I did not mention my name <lb/>
to the servant, but replied I had urgent business, which a <lb/>
few minutes conversation would despatch. I was admitted.</p>
<p>I found the lady, in a careless garb, reclining on a sofa, <lb/>
wan, pale and of a sickly aspect. On recognising me, she <reg orig="as-|sumed">assumed</reg> <lb/>
a languidly smiling air, and received me with much <lb/>
civility. I took my seat near her. She began to talk.</p>
<pb n="166" entity="eaf033v4_0179" pid="uva-lib:350188"/>
<p>I am very unwell; got a terrible cold, coming from <reg orig="Do-|ver">Dover</reg>; <lb/>
been laid up ever since; a teazing cough; no <reg orig="appe-|tite">appetite</reg>; <lb/>
and worse spirits than I ever suffered. Glad you've <lb/>
come to relieve my solitude; not a single soul to see me; <lb/>
Mrs. Talbot never favors a body with a visit. Pray <lb/>
how's the dear girl? Hear her mother's come; heard, it <lb/>
seems, of your intimacy with Miss Secker; determined to <lb/>
revenge your treason to her goddess! vows she shall, <reg orig="hence-|forth">henceforth</reg>, <lb/>
have no more to say to you.</p>
<p>While waiting for admission, I formed hastily the <reg orig="resolu-|tion">resolution</reg> <lb/>
in what manner to conduct this interview. My <reg orig="deport-|ment">deportment</reg> <lb/>
was so solemn, that the chatterer glancing at my face in <lb/>
the course of her introductory harangue, felt herself <reg orig="sudden-|ly">suddenly</reg> <lb/>
chilled and restrained.</p>
<p>Why, what now? Colden. You are mighty grave <reg orig="me-|thinks">methinks</reg>. <lb/>
Do you repent already of your new attachment? <lb/>
Has the atmosphere of Philadelphia, reinstated Jane in all <lb/>
her original rights?</p>
<p>Proceed, madam. When you are tired of raillery, I <lb/>
shall beg your attention to a subject in which your honor is <lb/>
deeply concerned; to a subject which allows not of a jest.</p>
<p>Nay, said she, in some little trepidation, if you have any <lb/>
thing to communicate, I am already prepared to receive it.</p>
<p>Indeed, Miss Jessup, I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> something to communicate. <lb/>
A man of more refinement and address than I can pretend <lb/>
to, would make this communication in a more circuitous and <lb/>
artful manner; and a man, less deeply interested in the <reg orig="es-|tablishment">establishment</reg> <lb/>
of truth, would act with more caution and <reg orig="for-|bearance">forbearance</reg>. <lb/>
I have no excuse to plead; no forgiveness to <lb/>
ask, for what I am now going to disclose. I demand <lb/>
nothing from you, but your patient attention, while I lay <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
you the motives of my present visit.</p>
<p>You are no stranger to my attachment to Mrs. Talbot. <lb/>
That my passion is requited is likewise known to you. <lb/>
That her mother objects to her union with me, and <lb/>
raises her objections on certain improprieties in my <reg orig="charac-|ter">character</reg> <lb/>
and conduct, I suppose, has already come to your <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>.</p>
<p>You may naturally suppose that I am desirous of gaining <lb/>
her favor, but it is not by the practice of fraud and iniquity, <lb/>
and therefore I have not begun with denying or concealing <lb/>
<pb n="167" entity="eaf033v4_0180" pid="uva-lib:350189"/>
my faults. Very faulty; very criminal have I been; to <lb/>
deny that, would be adding to the number of my <reg orig="trangress-|ions">trangressions</reg>, <lb/>
but I assure you, Miss Jessup, there have been limits to <lb/>
my follies; there is a boundary beyond which I have never <lb/>
gone. Mrs. Fielder imagines me much more criminal than <lb/>
I really am, and her opinion of me, which, if limited, in <lb/>
the strictest manner by my merits, would amply justify her <lb/>
aversion to my marriage with her daughter, is, however, <lb/>
carried further than justice allows.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fielder has been somewhat deceived with regard to <lb/>
me. She thinks me capable of a guilt, of which, vicious <lb/>
as I am, I am yet incapable. Nay, she imagines I have <lb/>
actually committed a crime of which I am wholly innocent.</p>
<p>What think you, madam (taking her hand, and eying her <lb/>
with steadfastness) she thinks me at once so artful and so <lb/>
wicked that I have made the wife unfaithful to the husband; <lb/>
I have persuaded Mrs. Talbot to forget what was due to <lb/>
herself, her fame, and to trample on her marriage vow.</p>
<p>This opinion is not a vague conjecture on suspicion. It <lb/>
is founded in what seems to be the most infallible of all <reg orig="evi-|dence">evidence</reg>; <lb/>
the written confession of her daughter. The paper <lb/>
appears to be a letter which was addressed to the seducer <lb/>
soon after the guilty interview. This paper came indirectly <lb/>
into Mrs. Fielder's hands. To justify her charge, against <lb/>
us, she has shewn it to us. Now, madam, the guilt <reg orig="im-|puted">imputed</reg> <lb/>
to us, is a stranger to our hearts. The crime which <lb/>
this letter confesses, never was committed, and the letter <lb/>
which contains the confession, never was written by Jane. <lb/>
It is a forgery.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fielder's misapprehension, so far as it relates to me, <lb/>
is of very little moment. I can hope for nothing from the <lb/>
removal of this error, while so many instances of real <reg orig="mis-|conduct">misconduct</reg> <lb/>
continue to plead against me, but her daughter's <lb/>
happiness is materially affected by it, and for her sake I am <lb/>
anxious to vindicate her fame from this reproach.</p>
<p>No doubt, Miss Jessup, you have often asked me in <lb/>
your heart, since I began to speak, why I have stated <lb/>
this transaction to you. What interest have you in our <lb/>
concerns? What proofs of affection or esteem have you <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
from us, that should make you zealous in our <reg orig="be-|half">behalf</reg>? <lb/>
Or, what relation has your interest in any respect to <lb/>
<pb n="168" entity="eaf033v4_0181" pid="uva-lib:350190"/>
<hi rend="italic">our</hi> weal or wo. Why should you be called upon as a <lb/>
counsellor or umpire, in the little family dissensions of Mrs. <lb/>
Talbot and her mother?</p>
<p>And do indeed these questions rise in your heart, Miss <lb/>
Jessup? Does not memory enable you to account for <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg> <lb/>
which, to the distant and casual observer, to those <lb/>
who know not what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know, would appear strange and <lb/>
absurd.</p>
<p>Recollect yourself. I will give you a moment to recall <lb/>
the past. Think over all that has occurred since your <reg orig="ori-|ginal">original</reg> <lb/>
acquaintance with Mrs. Talbot or her husband, and <lb/>
tell me solemnly and truly, whether you discern not the <lb/>
cause of his mistake. Tell me whether you know not the <lb/>
unhappy person, whom some delusive prospect of <reg orig="advan-|tage">advantage</reg>, <lb/>
some fatal passion has tempted to belie the innocent.</p>
<p>I am no reader of faces my friend. I drew no <reg orig="inferen-|ces">inferences</reg> <lb/>
from the confusion sufficiently visible in Miss Jessup. <lb/>
She made no attempt to interrupt me, but quickly <reg orig="with-|drew">withdrew</reg> <lb/>
her eye from my gaze; hung her head upon her <reg orig="bo-|som">bosom</reg>; <lb/>
a hectic flush now and then shot across her cheek. <lb/>
But these would have been produced by a similar address, <lb/>
delivered with much solemnity and emphasis, in any one <lb/>
however innocent.</p>
<p>I believe there there was no anger in my looks. <reg orig="Sup-|posing">Supposing</reg> <lb/>
her to have been the author of this stratagem, it <lb/>
awakened in me not resentment but pity. I paused; but <lb/>
she made no answer to my expostulation. At length, I <reg orig="re-|sumed">resumed</reg> <lb/>
with augmented earnestness, grasping her hand.</p>
<p>Tell me, I conjure you, what you know. Be not <reg orig="de-|terred">deterred</reg> <lb/>
by any self regard&mdash;but, indeed, how can your <lb/>
interest be affected by clearing up a mistake so fatal to the <lb/>
happiness of one for whom you have always possessed a <lb/>
friendly regard.</p>
<p>Will your own integrity or reputation be brought into <lb/>
question. In order to exculpate your friend, will it be <lb/>
necessary to accuse yourself? Have you been guilty in <lb/>
withholding the discovery? Have you been guilty in <reg orig="con-|triving">contriving</reg> <lb/>
the fraud? Did your own hand pen the fatal letter <lb/>
which is now brought in evidence against my friend? Were <lb/>
you, yourself, guilty of counterfeiting hands, in order to <lb/>
drive the husband into a belief of his wife's perfidy?"</p>
<pb n="169" entity="eaf033v4_0182" pid="uva-lib:350191"/>
<p>A deadly paleness overspread her countenance at these <lb/>
words. I pitied her distress and confusion, and waited not <lb/>
for an answer, which she was unable to give.</p>
<p>Yes, Miss Jessup, I well know your concern in this <lb/>
transaction. I mean not to distress you; I mean not to <lb/>
put you to unnecessary shame; I have no indignation <lb/>
or enmity against you. I came hither not to injure or <lb/>
disgrace you, but to confer on you a great and real benefit; <lb/>
to enable you to repair the evil which your infatuation has <lb/>
occasioned. I want to relieve your conscience from the <lb/>
sense of having wronged one that never wronged you.</p>
<p>Do not imagine that in all this, I am aiming at my own <lb/>
selfish advantage. This is not the mother's only objection <lb/>
to me, or only proof of that frailty she justly ascribes to <lb/>
me. To prove me innocent of this charge, will not <reg orig="recon-|cile">reconcile</reg> <lb/>
her to her daughter's marriage. It will only remove <lb/>
one insuperable impediment to her reconciliation with her <lb/>
daughter.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fielder is, at this moment, not many steps from this <lb/>
spot. Permit me to attend you to her. I will introduce <lb/>
the subject. I will tell her that you come to clear her <reg orig="daugh-|ter">daughter</reg> <lb/>
from an unmerited charge, to confess that the unfinished <lb/>
letter was taken by you, and that, by additions in a feigned <lb/>
hand, you succeeded in making that an avowal of <reg orig="abandon-|ed">abandoned</reg> <lb/>
wickedness, which was originally innocent, at least, <lb/>
though, perhaps, indiscreet.</p>
<p>All this was uttered in a very rapid, but solemn accent. <lb/>
I gave her no time to recollect herself; no leisure for denial <lb/>
or evasion. I talked as if her agency was already <reg orig="ascer-|tained">ascertained</reg>, <lb/>
and the feelings she betrayed at this abrupt and <reg orig="un-|aware">unaware</reg> <lb/>
attack, confirmed my suspicions.</p>
<p>After a long pause, and a struggle, as it were, for <reg orig="utter-|ance">utterance</reg>, <lb/>
she faltered out&mdash;Mr. Colden&mdash;you see, I am very <lb/>
sick&mdash;this conduct has been very strange&mdash;nothing&mdash;I know <lb/>
nothing of what you have been saying. I wonder at your <lb/>
talking to me in this manner&mdash;you might as well address <lb/>
yourself, in this style, to one you never saw. What grounds <lb/>
can you have for suspecting me of any concern in this <reg orig="trans-|action">transaction</reg>!</p>
<p>Ah! madam! replied I, I see you have not strength of <lb/>
mind to confess a fault. Why will you compel me to <reg orig="pro-|duce">produce</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="eaf033v4_0183" pid="uva-lib:350192"/>
the proof that you have taken an unauthorized part in <lb/>
Mrs. Talbot's concerns. Do you imagine that the love you <lb/>
bore her husband, even after his marriage; the efforts you <lb/>
used to gain his favor; his contemptuous rejection of your <lb/>
advances;&mdash;can you imagine that these things are not <lb/>
known?</p>
<p>Why you should endeavor to defraud the wife of her <lb/>
husband's esteem, is a question which your own heart only <lb/>
can answer. Why you should watch Mrs. Talbot's conduct, <lb/>
and communicate your discoveries in anonymous letters and <lb/>
a hand disguised, to her mother, I pretend not to say. I <lb/>
came not to inveigh against the folly or malignity of such <lb/>
conduct. I came not even to censure it. I am not entitled <lb/>
to sit in judgment over you. My regard for mother and <lb/>
daughter makes me anxious to rectify an error fatal to their <lb/>
peace. There is but one way of doing this effectually, with <lb/>
the least injury to your character. I would not be driven <lb/>
to the necessity of employing <hi rend="italic">public</hi> means to convince the <lb/>
mother that the charge is false, and that you were the <reg orig="calum-|niator">calumniator</reg>; <lb/>
means that will humble and disgrace you infinitely <lb/>
more than a secret interview and frank confession from your <lb/>
own lips.</p>
<p>To deny and to prevaricate in a case like this is to be <reg orig="ex-|pected">expected</reg> <lb/>
from one capable of acting as you have acted, but it <lb/>
will avail you nothing. It will merely compel me to have <lb/>
recourse to means less favorable to you. My reluctance to <lb/>
employ them arises from regard to you, for I repeat that I <lb/>
have no enmity for you, and propose, in reality, not only <lb/>
Mrs. Talbot's advantage, but your own.</p>
<p>I cannot paint the alarm and embarrassment which these <lb/>
words occasioned. Tears afforded her some relief, but <lb/>
shame had deprived her of all utterance.</p>
<p>Let me conjure you, resumed I, to go with me this moment <lb/>
to Mrs. Fielder. In ten minutes all may be over. I will <lb/>
save you the pain of speaking. Only be present, while I <lb/>
explain the matter. Your silent acquiescence will be all <lb/>
that I shall demand.</p>
<p>Impossible! she exclaimed, in a kind of agony, I am <lb/>
already sick to death. I cannot move a step on such a <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg>. <lb/>
I don't know Mrs. Fielder, and can never look her <lb/>
in the face.</p>
<pb n="171" entity="eaf033v4_0184" pid="uva-lib:350193"/>
<p>A letter, then, replied I, will do, perhaps, as well. Here <lb/>
are pen and paper. Send to her, by me, a few lines. <reg orig="De-|fer">Defer</reg> <lb/>
all circumstance and comment, and merely inform her <lb/>
who the author of this forgery was. Here, continued I, <lb/>
producing the letter which Talbot had shewn to Mrs. <reg orig="Field-|er">Fielder</reg>, <lb/>
here is the letter in which my friend's hand is <reg orig="counter-|feited">counterfeited</reg>, <lb/>
and she is made to confess a guilt, to the very thought <lb/>
of which she has ever been a stranger. Enclose it in a <lb/>
paper, acknowledging the stratagem to be yours. It is done <lb/>
in a few words, and in half a minute.</p>
<p>My impetuosity overpowered all opposition and <reg orig="remon-|strance">remonstrance</reg>. <lb/>
The paper was before her; the pen in her <reg orig="reluc-|tant">reluctant</reg> <lb/>
fingers; but that was all.</p>
<p>There may never be a future opportunity of repairing <lb/>
your misconduct. You are sick, you say, and indeed your <lb/>
countenance bespeaks some deeply rooted malady. You <lb/>
cannot be certain but that this is the last opportunity you <lb/>
may ever enjoy. When sunk upon the bed of death, and <lb/>
unable to articulate your sentiments, you may unavailingly <lb/>
regret the delay of this confession. You may die with the <lb/>
excruciating thought of having blasted the fame of an <reg orig="inno-|cent">innocent</reg> <lb/>
woman, and of having sown eternal discord between <lb/>
mother and child.</p>
<p>I said a good deal more in this strain, by which she was <lb/>
deeply affected, but she demanded time to reflect. She <lb/>
would do nothing then; she would do all I wished <reg orig="to-|morrow">to-morrow</reg>. <lb/>
She was too unwell to see any body, to hold a <lb/>
pen, at present.</p>
<p>All I want, said I, are but few words. You cannot be <lb/>
at a loss for these. I will hold; I will guide your hand; I <lb/>
will write what you dictate. Will you put your hand to <lb/>
something which I will write this moment in your presence, <lb/>
and subject to your revision.</p>
<p>I did not stay for her consent, but seizing the pen, put <lb/>
down hastily these words.</p>
<p>"Madam; the enclosed letter has led you into mistake. <lb/>
It has persuaded you that your daughter was unfaithful to <lb/>
her vows; but know, madam, that the concluding paragraph <lb/>
was written by me. I found the letter unfinished on Mrs. <lb/>
Talbot's desk. I took it thence without her knowledge, <lb/>
and added the concluding paragraph, in a hand as much <lb/>
<pb n="172" entity="eaf033v4_0185" pid="uva-lib:350194"/>
resembling hers as possible, and conveyed it to the hands <lb/>
of her husband."</p>
<p>This hasty scribble I read to her, and urged her by every <lb/>
consideration my invention could suggest, to sign it. But <lb/>
no; she did not deny the truth of the statement it contained, <lb/>
but she must have time to recollect herself. Her head was <lb/>
rent to pieces by pain. She was in too much confusion to <lb/>
allow her to do any thing just now deliberately.</p>
<p>I now produced the letter I received from Hannah Secker, <lb/>
and said, I see, madam, you will compel me to preserve no <lb/>
measures with you. <hi rend="italic">There</hi> is a letter which you wrote to <lb/>
Mrs. Fielder. Its contents were so important that you <lb/>
would not at first trust a servant with the delivery of it at <lb/>
the office. This however you were finally compelled to do. <lb/>
A fellow servant, however, stole it from your messenger, and <lb/>
instead of being delivered according to its address, it has <lb/>
lately come into my hands.</p>
<p>No doubt (shewing the superscription, but not permitting <lb/>
her to see that the seal was unbroken) no doubt you <reg orig="recog-|nise">recognise</reg> <lb/>
the hand; the hand of that anonymous detractor <lb/>
who had previously taken so much pains to convince the <lb/>
husband that his wife was an adulteress and a prostitute.</p>
<p>Had I foreseen the effect which this disclosure would <lb/>
have had, I should have hesitated. After a few convulsive <lb/>
breathings, she fainted. I was greatly alarmed, and calling <lb/>
in a female servant, I staid till she revived. I thought it <lb/>
but mercy to leave her alone, and giving directions to the <lb/>
servant where I might be found, and requesting her to tell <lb/>
her mistress that I would call again early in the morning, I <lb/>
left the house.</p>
<p>I returned hither, and am once more shut up in my solitary <lb/>
chamber. I am in want of sleep, but my thoughts must be <lb/>
less tumultuous before that blessing can be hoped for. All <lb/>
is still in the house and in the city, and the "cloudy <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg>" <lb/>
of the watchman tells me that midnight is past. I have <lb/>
already written much, but must write on.</p>
<p>What, my friend, can this letter contain? the belief that <lb/>
the contents are known and the true writer discovered, <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg> <lb/>
strange effects. I am afraid there was some duplicity <lb/>
in my conduct. But the concealment of the unbroken <lb/>
seal, was little more than chance. Had she inquired <lb/>
<pb n="173" entity="eaf033v4_0186" pid="uva-lib:350195"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">16</fw></pb>
whether the letter was opened I should not have deceived <lb/>
her.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, I ascribe too much to this discovery. <lb/>
Miss Jessup was evidently very ill. The previous <reg orig="conver-|sation">conversation</reg> <lb/>
had put her fortitude to a severe test. The tide was <lb/>
already so high, that the smallest increase sufficed to <reg orig="over-|whelm">overwhelm</reg> <lb/>
her. Methinks I might have gained my purpose <lb/>
with less injury to her.</p>
<p>But what purpose have I gained? I have effected nothing, <lb/>
I am as far, perhaps farther than ever from vanquishing her <lb/>
reluctance. A night's reflection may fortify her pride, may <lb/>
furnish some expedient for eluding my request. Nay, she <lb/>
may refuse to see me, when I call on the morrow, and I <lb/>
cannot force myself into her presence.</p>
<p>If all this should happen, what will be left for me to do? <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">that</hi> deserves some consideration. This letter of Miss <reg orig="Jes-|sup's">Jessup's</reg> <lb/>
may possibly contain the remedy for many evils. <lb/>
What use shall I make of it? How shall I get at its <reg orig="con-|tents">contents</reg>?</p>
<p>There is but one way. I must carry it to Mrs. Fielder, <lb/>
and deliver it to her, to whom it is addressed. Carry it <lb/>
myself? Venture into her presence, by whom I am so <lb/>
much detested? She will tremble with mingled indignation <lb/>
and terror, at the sight of me. I cannot hope a patient <lb/>
audience. And can I, in such circumstances, rely on my <lb/>
own equanimity? How can I endure the looks of one to <lb/>
whom I am a viper; a demon; who, not content with <lb/>
hating me for that which really merits hatred, imputes to me <lb/>
a thousand imaginary crimes.</p>
<p>Such is the lot of one that has forfeited his reputation. <lb/>
Having once been guilty, the returning path to rectitude is <lb/>
forever barred against him. His conduct will almost always <lb/>
be liable to a double construction; and who will suppose <lb/>
the influence of good motives, when experience has proved <lb/>
the influence, in former cases, of evil ones?</p>
<p>Jane Talbot is young, lovely, and the heiress, provided <lb/>
she retain the favor of her adopted mother, of a splendid <lb/>
fortune. I am poor, indolent, devoted, not to sensual, but <lb/>
to visionary and to costly luxuries. How shall such a man <lb/>
escape the imputation of sordid and selfish motives?</p>
<pb n="174" entity="eaf033v4_0187" pid="uva-lib:350196"/>
<p>How shall he prove that he counterfeits no passion; <reg orig="em-|ploys">employs</reg> <lb/>
no clandestine or illicit means to retain the affections <lb/>
of such a woman. Will his averments of disinterested <lb/>
motives be believed? Why should they be believed? How <lb/>
easily are assertions made, and how silly to credit <reg orig="declara-|tions">declarations</reg> <lb/>
contradicted by the tenor of a man's whole conduct.</p>
<p>But I can truly aver that my motives are disinterested. <lb/>
Does not my character make a plentiful and independent <lb/>
provision, of more value to me, more necessary to my <reg orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
than to that of most other men? Can I place my <lb/>
hand upon my heart, and affirm that her fortune has <hi rend="italic">no part</hi> <lb/>
in the zeal with which I have cultivated Jane's affections. <lb/>
There are few tenants of this globe, to whom wealth is <lb/>
wholly undesirable, and very few whose actual poverty, <lb/>
whose indolent habits, and whose relish for expensive <lb/>
pleasure, make it <hi rend="italic">more</hi> desirable than to me.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fielder is averse to her daughter's wishes. While <lb/>
this aversion endures, marriage, instead of enriching me, <lb/>
will merely reduce my wife to my own destitute condition. <lb/>
How are impartial observers, how is Mrs. Fielder to <reg orig="con-|strue">construe</reg> <lb/>
my endeavors to subdue this aversion, and my declining <lb/>
marriage, till this obstacle is overcome? Will they ascribe it <lb/>
merely to reluctance to bereave the object of my love of that <lb/>
affluence, and those comforts, without which, in my opinion, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">she</hi> would not be happy? Yet this is true. My own <reg orig="expe-|rience">experience</reg> <lb/>
has taught me in what degree a luxurious education <lb/>
endears to us the means of an easy and elegant subsistence. <lb/>
Shall I be deaf to this lesson? Shall I rather listen to the <lb/>
splendid visions of my friend, who thinks my love will <lb/>
sufficiently compensate her for every suffering; who seems <lb/>
to hold these enjoyments in contempt, and describes an <lb/>
humble and industrious life, as teeming with happiness and <lb/>
dignity.</p>
<p>These are charming visions. My heart is frequently <lb/>
credulous, and is almost raised by her bewitching eloquence, <lb/>
to the belief that, by bereaving her of friends and property, <lb/>
I confer on her a benefit. I place her in a sphere where all <lb/>
the resources of her fortitude and ingenuity will be brought <lb/>
into use.</p>
<p>But this, with me, is only a momentary elevation. More <lb/>
sober views are sure to succeed. Yet why have I <reg orig="delibe-|rately">deliberately</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="175" entity="eaf033v4_0188" pid="uva-lib:350197"/>
exhorted Jane to become mine? Because I trust to <lb/>
the tenderness of her mother. That tenderness will not <lb/>
allow her wholly to abandon her beloved child, who has <lb/>
hitherto had no rival, and is likely to have no successor in <lb/>
her love. The evil, she will think, cannot be repaired; but <lb/>
some of its consequences may be obviated or lightened. <lb/>
Intercession and submission shall not be wanting. Jane will <lb/>
never suffer her heart to be estranged from her mother. <lb/>
Reverence and gratitude will always maintain their place. <lb/>
And yet, confidence is sometimes shaken; doubts insinuate <lb/>
themselves. Is not Mrs. Fielder's temper ardent and <lb/>
inflexible? Will her anger be so easily appeased? In a <reg orig="con-|test">contest</reg> <lb/>
like this, will she allow herself to be vanquished? And <lb/>
shall I, indeed, sever hearts so excellent? Shall I be the <lb/>
author of such exquisite and lasting misery to a woman like <lb/>
Mrs. Fielder; and shall I find that misery compensated by <lb/>
the happiness of her daughter? What pure and unmingled <lb/>
joy will the daughter taste, while conscious of having <reg orig="de-|stroyed">destroyed</reg> <lb/>
the peace, and perhaps hastened the end of one, <lb/>
who, with regard to her, has always deserved and always <lb/>
possessed a gratitude and veneration without bounds. And <lb/>
for whom is the tranquillity and affection of the mother to <lb/>
be sacrificed? For <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> a poor unworthy wretch; <reg orig="deserv-|edly">deservedly</reg> <lb/>
despised by every strenuous and upright mind; a <lb/>
fickle, inconsiderate, frail mortal, whose perverse habits no <lb/>
magic can dissolve.</p>
<p>No. My whole heart implores Jane to forget and abandon <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">me;</hi> to adhere to her mother; since no earthly power and <lb/>
no length of time will change Mrs. Fielder's feelings with <lb/>
regard to me; since I shall never obtain, as I shall never <lb/>
deserve, her regard, and since her mother's happiness is, <lb/>
and ought to be dearer to Jane than her own personal and <lb/>
exclusive gratification. God grant that she may be able to <lb/>
perform and cheerfully perform her duty.</p>
<p>But how often my friend, have I harped on this string&mdash; <lb/>
Yet I must write, and I must put down my present thoughts, <lb/>
and these are the sentiments eternally present.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I said</hi> I would not write to you again; I would <reg orig="en-|courage">encourage</reg>, <lb/>
I would allow of no intercourse between us. This <lb/>
was my solemn resolution and my voluntary and no less <lb/>
solemn promise, yet I sit down to abjure this vow, to break <lb/>
this promise.</p>
<p>What a wretch am I! Feeble and selfish beyond all <reg orig="ex-|ample">example</reg> <lb/>
among women; Why, why was I born, or why <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
I breath in a world and at a period, with whose <reg orig="in-|habitants">inhabitants</reg> <lb/>
I can have no sympathy, whose notions of rectitude <lb/>
and decency find no answering chord in my heart?</p>
<p>Never was creature so bereft of all dignity; all <reg orig="stead-|fastness">steadfastness</reg>. <lb/>
The slave of every impulse; blown about by the <lb/>
predominant gale; a scene of eternal fluctuation.</p>
<p>Yesterday my mother pleaded. Her tears dropped fast <lb/>
into my bosom, and I vowed to be all she wished; not <lb/>
merely to discard you from my presence, but to banish even <lb/>
your image from my thoughts. To act agreeably to her <lb/>
wishes was not sufficient. I must <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> as she would have <lb/>
me feel. My actions must flow, not merely from a sense <lb/>
of duty, but from fervent inclination.</p>
<p>I promised every thing. My whole soul was in the <reg orig="pro-|mise">promise</reg>. <lb/>
I retired to pen a last letter to you, and to say <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
to your father. My heart was firm; my hand steady. <lb/>
My mother read and approved.&mdash;Dearest Jane! Now, <lb/>
indeed, are you my child. After this I will not doubt your <lb/>
constancy. Make me happy, by finding happiness in this <lb/>
resolution.</p>
<p>O, thought I, as I paced my chamber alone, what an <reg orig="am-|ple">ample</reg> <lb/>
recompense for every self-denial, for every sacrifice, <lb/>
are thy smiles, my maternal friend. I will live smilingly <lb/>
for thy sake, while <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> livest. I will live only to close thy <lb/>
eyes, and then, as every earthly good has been sacrificed at <lb/>
thy bidding, will I take the pillow that sustained thee when <lb/>
dead, and quickly breathe out upon it my last sigh.</p>
<pb n="177" entity="eaf033v4_0190" pid="uva-lib:350199"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">16*</fw></pb>
<p>My thoughts were all lightsome and serene. I had laid <lb/>
down, methought, no life, no joy but my own. My mother's <lb/>
peace, and your peace, for the safety of either of whom I <lb/>
would cheerfully die, had been purchased by the same act.</p>
<p>How did I delight to view you restored to your father's <lb/>
house. I was still your friend, though invisible. I <reg orig="watch-|ed">watched</reg> <lb/>
over you, in quality of guardian angel. I etherealized <lb/>
myself from all corporeal passions. I even set spiritual <lb/>
ministers to work to find one worthy of succeeding me, in <lb/>
the sacred task of making you happy. I was determined <lb/>
to raise you to affluence, by employing, in a way unseen <lb/>
and unsuspected by you, those superfluities which a blind <lb/>
and erring destiny had heaped upon me.</p>
<p>And whither have these visions flown? Am I once more <lb/>
sunk to a level with my former self? Once I thought that <lb/>
religion was a substance with me; not a shadow, to flit, to <lb/>
mock, and to vanish when its succor was most needed; yet <lb/>
now does my heart sink.</p>
<p>O comfort me, my friend! plead against yourself; <lb/>
against me. Be my mother's advocate. Fly away from these <lb/>
arms that clasp you, and escape from me, even if your flight <lb/>
be my death. Think not of me but of my mother, and <reg orig="se-|cure">secure</reg> <lb/>
to her the consolation of following my unwedded corse <lb/>
to the grave, by disclaiming, by hating, by forgetting the <reg orig="un-|fortunate">unfortunate</reg></p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Ah</hi>! my friend! in what school have you acquired such <lb/>
fatal skill in tearing the heart of an offender? Why, under <lb/>
an appearance of self-reproach, do you coney the bitterest <lb/>
maledictions. Why with looks of idolatry, and accents of <lb/>
compassion, do you aim the deadliest contempts, and hurl <lb/>
the keenest censures against me.</p>
<pb n="178" entity="eaf033v4_0191" pid="uva-lib:350200"/>
<p>"You acquit me of all shadow of blame." What! in <lb/>
proving me fickle, inconsistent, insensible to all your merit, <lb/>
ungrateful for your generosity; your love. How have I <lb/>
rewarded your reluctance to give me pain; your readiness <lb/>
to sacrifice every personal good for my sake? By <reg orig="reproach-|ing">reproaching</reg> <lb/>
you with dissimulation. By violating all those vows, <lb/>
which no legal ceremony could make more solemn or <reg orig="bind-|ing">binding</reg>, <lb/>
and which the highest, earliest, and most sacred voice <lb/>
of heaven has ordained shall supersede all other bonds. <lb/>
By dooming you to feel "an anguish next to despair." <lb/>
Thus have I requited your unsullied truth; your unlimited <lb/>
devotion to me!</p>
<p>By what degrading standard do you measure my <reg orig="enjoy-|ments">enjoyments</reg>! <lb/>
"In my mother's tenderness and gratitude; in the <lb/>
affluence and honor which her regard will secure to me" am <lb/>
I to find consolation for unfaithfulness to my engagements; <lb/>
for every evil that may befall you. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> whom every <reg orig="hal-|lowed">hallowed</reg> <lb/>
obligation, every principle of human nature has placed <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">next</hi> to myself; whom it has become, not a fickle inclination, <lb/>
but a sacred duty, to prefer to all others; whose happiness <lb/>
ought to be my first and chief care, and from whose side <lb/>
I cannot sever myself without a guilt inexpiable.</p>
<p>Ah, cruel friend! You ascribe my resolution to a <reg orig="disin-|terested">disinterested</reg> <lb/>
regard to your good. You wish me to find <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg> <lb/>
in that persuasion. Yet you leave me not that phantom <lb/>
for a comforter. You convict me, in every line of your <reg orig="let-|ter">letter</reg>, <lb/>
of selfishness and folly. The only consideration that <lb/>
had irresistible weight with me, the restoration of your <reg orig="fa-|ther's">father's</reg> <lb/>
kindness, you prove to be a mere delusion, and <reg orig="de-|stroy">destroy</reg> <lb/>
it without mercy!</p>
<p>Can you forgive me, Henry? Best of men! Will you be <lb/>
soothed by my penitence for one more rash and <reg orig="inconside-|rate">inconsiderate</reg> <lb/>
act?&mdash;But alas! My penitence is rapid and sincere, <lb/>
but where is the merit of compunction that affords no <reg orig="secu-|rity">security</reg> <lb/>
against the repetition of the fault. And where is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> <lb/>
safety?</p>
<p>Fly to me. Save me from my mother's irresistible <reg orig="ex-|postulations">expostulations</reg>. <lb/>
I cannot&mdash;<hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> withstand her tears. Let <lb/>
me find in your arms a refuge from them. Let me no more <lb/>
trust a resolution which is sure to fail. By making the tie <lb/>
between us such as even she will allow to be irrevocable; <lb/>
<pb n="179" entity="eaf033v4_0192" pid="uva-lib:350201"/>
by depriving me of the power of compliance, only can I be <lb/>
safe.</p>
<p>Fly to me, therefore. Be at the front door at <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> this <lb/>
night. My Molly will be my only companion. Be the <lb/>
necessary measures previously taken, that no delay or <reg orig="dis-|appointment">disappointment</reg> <lb/>
may occur. One half hour and the solemn <lb/>
rite may be performed. My absence will not be missed, as <lb/>
I return immediately. Then will there be an end to <reg orig="fluc-|tuation">fluctuation</reg>, <lb/>
for repentance cannot <hi rend="italic">undo.</hi> Already in the sight <lb/>
of heaven, at the tribunal of my own conscience, am I <hi rend="italic">thy <lb/>
wife,</hi> but somewhat more is requisite to make the compact <lb/>
universally acknowledged. This is <hi rend="italic">now</hi> my resolve. I <lb/>
shall keep it secret from the rest of the world. Nothing but <lb/>
the compulsion of persuasion, can make me waver, and <reg orig="con-|cealment">concealment</reg> <lb/>
will save me from that, and <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi> remonstrance <lb/>
and entreaty will avail nothing.</p>
<p>My girl has told me of her interview with you; and <lb/>
where you are to be found. The dawn is not far distant, <lb/>
and at sunrise she carries you this. I shall expect an <reg orig="im-|mediate">immediate</reg>, <lb/>
and (need I add, when I recollect the invariable <lb/>
counsel you have given me,) a compliant answer.</p>
<p>And shall I!&mdash;Let me, while the sun lingers, still pour <lb/>
out my soul on this paper&mdash;Let me indulge a <hi rend="italic">pleasing, <lb/>
dreadful thought</hi>&mdash;Shall I, ere circling time bring back <hi rend="italic">this</hi> <lb/>
hour, become thy&mdash;</p>
<p>And shall my heart, after its dreadful languors, its <reg orig="excru-|ciating">excruciating</reg> <lb/>
agonies, know once more, a rapturous emotion? So <lb/>
lately sunk into despondency; so lately pondering on <reg orig="obsta-|cles">obstacles</reg> <lb/>
that rose before me like Alps, and menaced eternal <reg orig="op-|position">opposition</reg> <lb/>
to my darling projects; so lately the prey of the <lb/>
deepest anguish; what spell diffuses through my frame this <lb/>
ravishing tranquillity?</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Tranquillity,</hi> said I? <hi rend="italic">That</hi> my throbbing heart gainsays. <lb/>
You cannot see me just now, but the palpitating heart <reg orig="in-|fects">infects</reg> <lb/>
my fingers, and the unsteady pen will speak to you <reg orig="elo-|quently">eloquently</reg>.</p>
<p>I wonder how far sympathy possesses you. No doubt&mdash; <lb/>
let me see&mdash;<hi rend="italic">ten minutes after four</hi>&mdash;No doubt you are sound <lb/>
asleep. Care has fled away to some other head. Those <lb/>
invisible communicants; those aerial heralds whose <reg orig="exist-|ence">existence</reg>, <lb/>
benignity and seasonable succor are parts, thou <reg orig="know-|est">knowest</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="180" entity="eaf033v4_0193" pid="uva-lib:350202"/>
of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> creed, are busy in the weaving of some beatific <lb/>
dream. At their bidding, the world of thy fancy is <reg orig="circum-|scribed">circumscribed</reg> <lb/>
by four white walls, a Turkey-carpeted floor, and a <lb/>
stuccoed ceiling. Didst ever see such before? was't ever, <lb/>
in thy wakeful season, in the same apartment? Never. <lb/>
And what is more, and which I desire thee to note well, <lb/>
thou art not hereafter to enter it except in dreams.</p>
<p>A poor taper burns upon the toilet; just bright enough to <lb/>
give the cognizance of something in woman's shape, and <lb/>
in negligent attire scribbling near it. Thou needst not tap <lb/>
her on the shoulder; she need not look up and smile a <reg orig="wel-|come">welcome</reg> <lb/>
to the friendly vision. She knows that thou art <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> <lb/>
for is not thy hand already in hers, and is not thy cheek <reg orig="al-|ready">already</reg> <lb/>
wet with her tears? for thy poor girl's eyes are as <lb/>
sure to overflow with joy, as with sorrow.</p>
<p>And will it be always thus, my dear friend? will thy love <lb/>
screen me forever from remorse? will my mother's <reg orig="re-|proaches">reproaches</reg> <lb/>
never intrude amidst the reptures of fondness and <lb/>
poison my tranquillity?</p>
<p>What will she say when she discovers the truth? my <reg orig="con-|science">conscience</reg> <lb/>
will not allow me to dissemble. It will not disavow <lb/>
the name, or withhold the duties of a wife. Too well do <lb/>
I conceive what she will say; <hi rend="italic">how</hi> she will act.</p>
<p>I need not apprehend expulsion from her house. Exile <lb/>
will be a voluntary act.&mdash;"You shall eat, drink, lodge, and <lb/>
dress as well as ever. I will not sever husband from wife, <lb/>
and I find no pleasure in seeing those whom I most hate, <lb/>
perishing with want. I threatened to abandon you, merely <lb/>
because I would employ <hi rend="italic">every</hi> means of preventing your <lb/>
destruction, but my revenge is not so sordid as to multiply <lb/>
unnecessary evils on your head. I shall take from you <lb/>
nothing but my esteem; my affection; my society. I shall <lb/>
never see you but with agony; I shall never think of you <lb/>
without pain. I part with you forever, and prepare myself <lb/>
for that grave which your folly and ingratitude have dug for <lb/>
me.</p>
<p>"You have said, Jane, that having lost my favor, you will <lb/>
never live upon my bounty. That will be an act of <reg orig="need-|less">needless</reg> <lb/>
and perverse cruelty in you. It will be wantonly adding <lb/>
to that weight with which you have already sunk me to the <lb/>
grave. Besides, I will not leave you an option. While I <lb/>
<pb n="181" entity="eaf033v4_0194" pid="uva-lib:350203"/>
live, my watchful care shall screen you from penury in spite <lb/>
of yourself. When I die, my testament shall make you <lb/>
my sole successor. What I have shall be yours, at least, <lb/>
while <hi rend="italic">you</hi> live.</p>
<p>"I have deeply regretted the folly of threatening you with <lb/>
loss of property. I should have known you better than to <lb/>
think that a romantic head like yours would find any thing <lb/>
formidable in such deprivations. If other considerations <lb/>
were feeble, this would be chimerical.</p>
<p>"Fare you well, Jane, and when you become a mother, <lb/>
may your tenderness never be requited by the folly and <reg orig="in-|gratitude">ingratitude</reg> <lb/>
which it has been my lot to meet with, in the <lb/>
child of my affections."</p>
<p>Something like this has my mother already said to me, in <lb/>
the course of an affecting conversation, in which I ventured <lb/>
to plead for you. And have I then resolved to trample on <lb/>
such goodness?</p>
<p>Whither, my friend, shall I fly from a scene like this? <lb/>
into thy arms? and shall I find comfort <hi rend="italic">there?</hi> can I <reg orig="en-|dure">endure</reg> <lb/>
life, with the burthen of remorse, which generosity <lb/>
like this will lay upon me?</p>
<p>But I tell you, Henry, I am resolved. I have nothing <lb/>
but evil to choose. There is but one calamity greater than <lb/>
my mother's anger. I cannot mangle my own vitals. I <lb/>
cannot put an impious and violent end to my own life. Will <lb/>
it be mercy to make <hi rend="italic">her</hi> witness my death, and can I live <lb/>
without you? if I must be an ingrate, be her and not you <lb/>
the victim. If I must requite benevolence with malice, <lb/>
and tenderness with hatred, be it <hi rend="italic">her</hi> benevolence and <reg orig="ten-|derness">tenderness</reg>, <lb/>
and not <hi rend="italic">yours</hi> that are thus requited.</p>
<p>Once more, then, note well. The hour of <hi rend="italic">ten;</hi> the <lb/>
station near the door; a duly qualified officiator previously <lb/>
engaged;&mdash;and my destiny in this life fixed beyond the <lb/>
power of recall&mdash;the bearer of this will bring back your <lb/>
answer. Farewell; <hi rend="italic">remember.</hi></p>

<opener>
<dateline>December 9.</dateline>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Once</hi> more, after a night of painful musing or troubled <lb/>
repose, I am at the pen. I am plunged into greater <reg orig="diffi-|culties">difficulties</reg> <lb/>
and embarrassments than ever.</p>
<p>It was scarcely daylight, when a slumber, into which I <lb/>
had just fallen, was interrupted by a servant of the inn. A <lb/>
girl was below, who wanted to see me. The description <lb/>
quickly proved it to be Molly. I rose and directed her to <lb/>
be admitted.</p>
<p>She brought two letters from her mistress, and was told <lb/>
to wait for an answer. Jane traversed her room, half <lb/>
distracted and sleepless during most of the night. Towards <lb/>
morning she sat down to her desk, and finished a letter, <lb/>
which, together with one written a couple of days before, <lb/>
was despatched to me.</p>
<p>My heart throbbed&mdash;I was going to say with transport; <lb/>
but I am at a loss to say whether anguish or delight was <lb/>
uppermost, on reading these letters. She recalls every <lb/>
promise of eternal separation; she consents to immediate <lb/>
marriage as the only wise expedient; proposes ten o'clock <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">this night,</hi> to join our hands; will conceal her purpose from <lb/>
her mother, and resigns to me the providing of suitable <lb/>
means.</p>
<p>I was overwhelmed with surprise, and&mdash;shall I not say? <lb/>
&mdash;delight at this unexpected concession. An immediate <lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">consenting</hi> answer was required. I hurried to give <lb/>
this answer, but my tumultuous feelings would not let me <lb/>
write coherently. I was obliged to lay down the pen, and <lb/>
take a turn across the room, to calm my tremors. This <lb/>
gave me time to reflect.</p>
<p>What, thought I, am I going to do? To take advantage <lb/>
of a momentary impulse in my favor. To violate my <reg orig="pro-|mises">promises</reg> <lb/>
to Mrs. Fielder&mdash;my letter to her may be construed <lb/>
into promises not to seek another interview with Jane, and <lb/>
to leave the country forever. And shall I betray this <reg orig="impe-|tuous">impetuous</reg> <lb/>
woman into an irrevocable act, which her whole <reg orig="fu-|ture">future</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="183" entity="eaf033v4_0196" pid="uva-lib:350205"/>
life may be unavailingly consumed in repenting. Some <lb/>
delay, some deliberation cannot be injurious.</p>
<p>And yet this has always been my advice. Shall I reject <lb/>
the hand that is now offered me? How will she regard <lb/>
these new-born scruples, this drawing back, when the door <lb/>
spontaneously opens and solicits my entrance?</p>
<p>Is it in my power to make Jane Talbot <hi rend="italic">mine?</hi> my wife? <lb/>
And shall I hesitate? Ah! would to Heaven it were a <reg orig="des-|tiny">destiny</reg> <lb/>
as fortunate for her as for me; that no tears, no <reg orig="re-|pinings">repinings</reg>, <lb/>
no compunctions would follow. Should I not curse <lb/>
the hour of our union when I heard her sighs, and instead <lb/>
of affording consolation under the distress produced by her <lb/>
mother's displeasure, should I not need that consolation <lb/>
as much as she?</p>
<p>These reflections had no other effect than to make me <lb/>
irresolute. I could not return my assent to her scheme. I <lb/>
could not reject so bewitching an offer. This offer was the <lb/>
child of a passionate, a desperate moment. Whither, <reg orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg>, <lb/>
should she fly for refuge from a scene like that which <lb/>
she describes?</p>
<p>Molly urged me to come to some determination, as her <lb/>
mistress would impatiently wait her return. Finding it <reg orig="in-|dispensable">indispensable</reg> <lb/>
to say something, I at length wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have detected the author of the forgery which has <lb/>
given us so much disquiet. I propose to visit your <reg orig="mo-|ther">mother</reg> <lb/>
this morning, when I shall claim admission to you. <lb/>
In that interview may our future destiny be discussed and <lb/>
settled.&mdash;Meanwhile, still regard me as ever ready to <reg orig="pur-|chase">purchase</reg> <lb/>
your true happiness by every sacrifice."</p>
<p>With this billet Molly hastened away. What cold, <reg orig="re-|pulsive">repulsive</reg> <lb/>
terms were these! My conscience smote me as she <lb/>
shut the door. But what could I do?</p>
<p>I had but half determined to seek an interview with <lb/>
Mrs. Fielder. What purpose would it answer while <lb/>
the truth, respecting the counterfeit letter, still remained <reg orig="im-|perfectly">imperfectly</reg> <lb/>
discovered? And why should I seek an <reg orig="inter-|view">interview</reg> <lb/>
with Jane? Would her mother permit it; and should <lb/>
I employ my influence to win her from her mother's side or <lb/>
rivet her more closely to it?</p>
<p>What, my friend, shall I do? You are too far off to <lb/>
<pb n="184" entity="eaf033v4_0197" pid="uva-lib:350206"/>
answer me, and you leave me to my own destiny. You <lb/>
hear not, and will not seasonably hear what I say. To day <lb/>
will surely settle all difficulties, one way or another. This <lb/>
night, if I will, I may be the husband of this angel, or I <lb/>
may raise obstacles insuperable between us. Our interests <lb/>
and persons may be united forever, or we may start out <lb/>
into separate paths, and never meet again.</p>
<p>Another messenger! with a letter for me! Miss Jessup's <lb/>
servant&mdash;it is, perhaps&mdash;but let me read it.</p>

<head type="main">LETTER XLVIII.</head>
<head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">To Mrs. Fielder.</hi></head>
<opener>
<dateline>December 8.</dateline>
<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Madam,</hi></salute>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">This</hi> comes from a very unfortunate and culpable hand. <lb/>
A hand that hardly knows how to sign its own <reg orig="condemna-|tion">condemnation</reg>, <lb/>
and which sickness no less than irresolution, almost <lb/>
deprives of the power to hold the pen.</p>
<p>Yet I call Heaven to witness, that I expected not the evil <lb/>
from my infatuation, which, it seems, has followed it. I <lb/>
meant to influence none but Mr. Talbot's belief. I had the <lb/>
misfortune to see and to love him long before his <reg orig="engage-|ment">engagement</reg> <lb/>
with your daughter. I overstepped the limits of my <lb/>
sex, and met with no return to my generous offers, and my <lb/>
weak entreaties, but sternness and contempt.</p>
<p>You, Madam, are perhaps raised above the weakness of <lb/>
a heart like mine. You will not comprehend how an <reg orig="unre-|quited">unrequited</reg> <lb/>
passion can ever give place to rage and revenge, and <lb/>
how the merits of the object preferred to me, should only <lb/>
embitter that revenge.</p>
<p>Jane Talbot never loved the man, whom I would have <lb/>
made happy. Her ingenuous temper easily disclosed her <lb/>
indifference, and she married not to please herself, but to <lb/>
please others. Her husband's infatuation in marrying on <lb/>
such terms, could be exceeded by nothing but his folly in <lb/>
refusing one who would have lived for no other end than to <lb/>
please him.</p>
<p>I observed the progress of the intimacy between Mr. <reg orig="Col-|den">Colden</reg> <lb/>
and her, in Talbot's absence, and can you not conceive, <lb/>
madam, that my heart was disposed to exult in every event <lb/>
that verified my own predictions, and would convince Talbot <lb/>
of the folly of his choice? Hence I was a jealous observer. <lb/>
The worst construction was put upon your daughter's <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg>. <lb/>
That open, impetuous temper of hers, confident of <reg orig="in-|nocence">innocence</reg>, <lb/>
and fearless of ungenerous or malignant <reg orig="construc-|tions">constructions</reg>, <lb/>
easily put her into my power. Unrequited love made <lb/>
me <hi rend="italic">her</hi> enemy as well as that of her husband, and I even <lb/>
<pb n="186" entity="eaf033v4_0199" pid="uva-lib:350208"/>
saw, in her unguarded deportment, and in the reputed <lb/>
licentiousness of Mr. Colden's principles, some reason, <lb/>
some probability in my surmises.</p>
<p>Several anonymous letters were written to you. I thank <lb/>
heaven that I was seldom guilty of direct falsehoods in these <lb/>
letters. I told you little more than what a jealous eye, and <lb/>
a prying disposition easily discovered; and I never saw any <lb/>
thing in their intercourse that argued more than a temper <lb/>
thoughtless and indiscreet. To distinguish minutely between <lb/>
truths and exaggerations, in the letters which I sent you, <lb/>
would be a painful, and I trust, a needless task, since I now <lb/>
solemnly declare that, on an impartial review of all that I <lb/>
ever witnessed in the conduct of your daughter, I remember <lb/>
nothing that can justify the imputation of guilt. I believe <lb/>
her conduct to Colden was not always limited by a due <lb/>
regard to appearances; that she trusted her fame too much <lb/>
to her consciousness of innocence, and set too lightly by the <lb/>
malignity of those who would be glad to find her in fault, <lb/>
and the ignorance of others, who naturally judged of her <lb/>
by themselves. And this, I now solemnly take Heaven to <lb/>
witness, is the only charge that can truly be brought against <lb/>
her.</p>
<p>There is still another confession to make&mdash;if suffering <lb/>
and penitence can atone for any offence, surely mine has <lb/>
been atoned for! But it still remains that I should, as far <lb/>
as my power goes, repair the mischief.</p>
<p>It is no adequate apology, I well know, that the <reg orig="conse-|quences">consequences</reg> <lb/>
of my crime were more extensive and durable <lb/>
than I expected; but is it not justice to myself to say, that <lb/>
this confession would have been made earlier, if I had <reg orig="ear-|lier">earlier</reg> <lb/>
known the extent of the evil? I never suspected but <lb/>
that the belief of his wife's infidelity, was buried with <lb/>
Talbot.</p>
<p>Alas! wicked and malignant as I was, I meant not to <lb/>
persuade the mother of her child's profligacy. Why should <lb/>
I have aimed at this? I had no reason to disesteem or hate <lb/>
you. I was always impressed with reverence for your <lb/>
character. In the letters sent directly to you, I aimed at <lb/>
nothing but to procure your interference, and make maternal <lb/>
authority declare itself against that intercourse which was <lb/>
<pb n="187" entity="eaf033v4_0200" pid="uva-lib:350209"/>
essential to your daughter's happiness. It was not you, but <lb/>
her, that I wished to vex and distress.</p>
<p>I called at Mrs. Talbot's at a time when visitants are least <lb/>
expected. Nobody saw me enter. Her parlor was <reg orig="de-|serted">deserted</reg>; <lb/>
her writing-desk was open; an unfinished letter <lb/>
caught my eye. A sentiment half inquisitive and half <reg orig="mis-|chievous">mischievous</reg>, <lb/>
made me snatch it up, and withdraw as abruptly <lb/>
as I entered.</p>
<p>On reading this billet, it was easy to guess for whom it <lb/>
was designed. It was frank and affectionate; consistent <lb/>
with her conjugal duty, but not such as a very circumspect <lb/>
and wary temper would have allowed itself to write.</p>
<p>How shall I describe the suggestions that led me to make <lb/>
a most nefarious use of this paper? Circumstances most <lb/>
unhappily concurred to make my artifice easy and plausible. <lb/>
I discovered that Colden had spent most of the preceding <lb/>
night with your daughter. It is true a most heavy storm <lb/>
had raged during the evening, and the moment it remitted, <lb/>
which was not till three o'clock, he was seen to come out. <lb/>
His detention, therefore, candor would ascribe to the storm; <lb/>
but this letter, with such a conclusion as was too easily made, <lb/>
might fix a construction on it that no time could remove, <lb/>
and innocence could never confute.</p>
<p>I had not resolved in what way I should employ this <reg orig="let-|ter">letter</reg>, <lb/>
as I had eked it out, before Mr. Talbot's return. <lb/>
When that event took place, my old infatuation revived. I <lb/>
again sought his company, and the indifference, and even <lb/>
contempt with which I was treated, filled me anew with <reg orig="re-|sentment">resentment</reg>. <lb/>
To persuade him of his wife's guilt was, I <lb/>
thought, an effectual way of destroying whatever remained <lb/>
of matrimonial happiness; and the means were fully in my <lb/>
power.</p>
<p>Here I was again favored by accident. Fortune seemed <lb/>
determined to accomplish my ruin. My own ingenuity in <lb/>
vain attempted to fall on a <hi rend="italic">safe</hi> mode of putting this letter <lb/>
in Talbot's way, and this had never been done if chance <lb/>
had not surprisingly befriended my purpose.</p>
<p>One evening I dropped familiarly in upon your daughter. <lb/>
Nobody was there but Mr. Talbot and she. She was <lb/>
writing at her desk as usual, for she seemed never at ease <lb/>
but with a pen in her fingers; and Mr. Talbot seemed <lb/>
<pb n="188" entity="eaf033v4_0201" pid="uva-lib:350210"/>
thoughtful and uneasy. At my entrance the desk was <lb/>
hastily closed and locked. But first she took out some <lb/>
papers, and mentioning her design of going up stairs to put <lb/>
them away, she tripped to the door. Looking back, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
she perceived she had dropped one. This she took <lb/>
up, in some hurry, and withdrew.</p>
<p>Instead of conversing with me, Talbot walked about the <lb/>
room in a peevish and gloomy humor. A thought just <lb/>
then rushed into my mind. While Talbot had his back <lb/>
towards me, and was at a distance, I dropped the <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="counter-|feit">counterfeit</reg>,</hi> <lb/>
at the spot where Jane had just before dropped her <lb/>
paper, and with little ceremony took my leave. Jane had <lb/>
excused her absence to me, and promised to return within <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">five minutes.</hi> It was not possible, I thought, that Talbot's <lb/>
eye, as he walked backward and forward during that <reg orig="inter-|val">interval</reg>, <lb/>
could miss the paper, which would not fail to appear as <lb/>
if dropped by his wife.</p>
<p>My timidity and conscious guilt hindered me from <reg orig="at-|tempting">attempting</reg> <lb/>
to discover by any direct means, the effects of my <lb/>
artifice. I was mortified extremely in finding no <reg orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
difference in their deportment to each other. <reg orig="Some-|times">Sometimes</reg> <lb/>
I feared I had betrayed myself; but no alteration ever <lb/>
afterwards appeared in their behaviour to me.</p>
<p>I know how little I deserve to be forgiven. Nothing can <lb/>
palliate the baseness of this action. I acknowledge it with <lb/>
the deepest remorse, and nothing, especially since the death <lb/>
of Mr. Talbot, has lessened my grief; but the hope that <lb/>
some unknown cause prevented the full effect of this forgery <lb/>
on his peace, and that the secret, carefully locked up in his <lb/>
own breast, expired with him. All my enmities and <reg orig="rest-|less">restless</reg> <lb/>
jealousy found their repose in the same grave.</p>
<p>You have come to the knowledge of this letter, and I now <lb/>
find that the fraud was attended with even more success <lb/>
than I wished it to have.</p>
<p>Let me now, though late, put an end to the illusion, and <lb/>
again assure you, Madam, that the concluding paragraphs <lb/>
were <hi rend="italic">written by me,</hi> and that those parts of it which truly <lb/>
belong to your daughter, are perfectly innocent.</p>
<p>If it were possible for you to forgive my misconduct&mdash; <lb/>
<pb n="189" entity="eaf033v4_0202" pid="uva-lib:350211"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">17*</fw></pb>
and to suffer this confession to go no farther than the evil <lb/>
has gone&mdash;you will confer as great a comfort as can now be <lb/>
conferred on the unhappy.</p>

 <lb/>
which I have hastily transcribed. I will not stop to tell you <lb/>
my reflections upon it, but shall hasten with this letter to Mrs. <lb/>
Fielder. I might send it; but I have grown desperate.</p>
<p>A final effort must be made for my own happiness and <lb/>
that of Jane. From their own lips will I know my destiny. <lb/>
I have conversed too long at a distance, with this austere <lb/>
lady. I will mark with my own eyes, the effect of this <reg orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg>. <lb/>
Perhaps the moment may prove a yielding one. <lb/>
Finding me innocent in one respect, in which her <reg orig="persua-|sion">persuasion</reg> <lb/>

<p>I have complied with Miss Jessup's wish in one particular. <lb/>
I have sent her the letter which I got from Hannah, <reg orig="unopen-|ed">unopened</reg>; <lb/>

<p>And now, my friend, lay I down the pen, for a few hours; <lb/>
hours the most important, perhaps, in my eventful life. <lb/>
<pb n="190" entity="eaf033v4_0203" pid="uva-lib:350212"/>
Surely this interview with Mrs. Fielder will decide my <reg orig="des-|tiny">destiny</reg>. <lb/>
After it, I shall have nothing to hope.</p>
<p>I prepare for it with awe and trembling. The more <lb/>
nearly it approaches, the more my heart falters. I summon <lb/>
up in vain a tranquil and steadfast spirit; but perhaps, a <lb/>
walk in the clear air will be more conducive to this end, <lb/>
than a day's ruminations in my chamber.</p>
<p>I will take a walk&mdash;</p>
<ornament type="characters">*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*</ornament>
<p>And am I then&mdash;but I will not anticipate. Let me lead <lb/>
you to the present state of things without confusion.</p>
<p>With what different emotions did I use to approach this <lb/>
house! It still contains, thought I, as my wavering steps <lb/>
brought me in sight of it, all that I love, but I enter not <lb/>
uncerimoniously now. I find her not on the accustomed <lb/>
sofa, eager to welcome my coming with smiling affability <lb/>
and arms outstretched. No longer is it <hi rend="italic">home</hi> to me, nor <lb/>
she, assiduous to please; familiarly tender and anxiously <lb/>
fond; already assuming the conjugal privilege of studying <lb/>
my domestic case.</p>
<p>I knocked, somewhat timorously at the door; a ceremony <lb/>
which I had long been in the habit of omitting&mdash;but times are <lb/>
changed. I was afraid the melancholy which was fast <reg orig="over-|shadowing">overshadowing</reg> <lb/>
me, would still more unfit me for what was <reg orig="com-|ing">coming</reg>, <lb/>
but, instead of dispelling it, this very apprehension <reg orig="deep-|ened">deepened</reg> <lb/>
my gloom.</p>
<p>Molly came to the door. She silently led me into a <reg orig="par-|lor">parlor</reg>. <lb/>
The poor girl was in tears. My questions as to the <lb/>
cause of her distress drew from her a very indistinct and <lb/>
sobbing confession that Mrs. Fielder had been made uneasy <lb/>
by Molly's going out so early in the morning; had taken <lb/>
her daughter to task; and by employing entreaties and <reg orig="re-|monstrances">remonstrances</reg> <lb/>
in turn, had drawn from her the contents of <lb/>
her letter to me and of my answer.</p>
<p>A strange, affecting scene had followed; indignation and <lb/>
grief on the mother's part; obstinacy, irresolution, <reg orig="sorrow-|ful">sorrowful</reg>, <lb/>
reluctant, penitence and acquiescence on the side of the <lb/>
daughter; a determination, tacitly concurred in by Jane, of <lb/>
leaving the city immediately. Orders were already issued <lb/>
for that purpose.</p>
<pb n="191" entity="eaf033v4_0204" pid="uva-lib:350213"/>
<p>Is Mrs. Fielder at home?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Tell her, a gentleman would see her.</p>
<p>She will ask, perhaps&mdash;Shall I tell her, <hi rend="italic">who?</hi></p>
<p>No&mdash;Yes; Tell her, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> wish to see her.</p>
<p>The poor girl looked very mournfully&mdash;She has seen <lb/>
your answer which talks of your intention to visit her. She <lb/>
vows she will not see you, if you come.</p>
<p>Go, then to Jane, and tell her I would see her for five <lb/>
minutes&mdash;Tell her openly; before her mother.</p>
<p>This message, as I expected, brought down Mrs. Fielder <lb/>
alone. I never saw this lady before. There was a struggle <lb/>
in her countenance between anger and patience; an awful <lb/>
and severe solemnity; a slight and tacit notice of me as she <lb/>
entered. We both took chairs without speaking. After a <lb/>
moment's pause&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Colden, I presume.</p>
<p>Yes, madam.</p>
<p>You wish to see my daughter?</p>
<p>I was anxious, madam, to see you. My business here <lb/>
chiefly lies with <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">her.</hi></p>
<p>With me, sir? And pray, what have you to propose to <lb/>
me?</p>
<p>I have nothing to solicit madam, but your patient <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg>. <lb/>
(I saw the rising vehemence could scarcely be <reg orig="re-|strained.)">restrained.)</reg> <lb/>
I dare not hope for your favorable ear; all I <lb/>
ask is an audience from you of a few minutes.</p>
<p>This preface, sir, (her motions less and less controlable) <lb/>
is needless. I have very few minutes to spare at present. <lb/>
This roof is hateful to me while you are under it. Say <lb/>
what you will, sir, and briefly as possible.</p>
<p>No, madam, <hi rend="italic">thus</hi> received, I have not fortitude enough <lb/>
to say what I came to say. I merely entreat you to peruse <lb/>
this letter.</p>
<p>'Tis well, sir, (taking it, with some reluctance, and after <lb/>
eying the direction, putting it aside.) And this is all your <lb/>
business?</p>
<p>Let me entreat you, madam, to read it in my presence. <lb/>
Its contents nearly concern your happiness, and will not <lb/>
leave mine unaffected.</p>
<p>She did not seem, at first, disposed to compliance, but at <lb/>
<pb n="192" entity="eaf033v4_0205" pid="uva-lib:350214"/>
length opened and read. What noble features has this lady! <lb/>
I watched them as she read, with great solicitude, but <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg> <lb/>
in them nothing that could cherish my hope. All <lb/>
was stern and inflexible. No wonder at the ascendancy <lb/>
this spirit possesses over the tender and flexible Jane!</p>
<p>She read with visible eagerness. The varying emotion <lb/>
played with augmented rapidity over her face. Its <reg orig="expres-|sion">expression</reg> <lb/>
became less severe, and some degree of softness, I <lb/>
thought, mixed itself with those glances which reflection <lb/>
sometimes diverted from the letter. These tokens <reg orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg> <lb/>
revived my languishing courage.</p>
<p>After having gone through it she returned; read again <lb/>
and pondered over particular passages. At length, after <lb/>
some pause, she spoke, but her indignant eye scarcely <reg orig="con-|descended">condescended</reg> <lb/>
to point the address to me.</p>
<p>As a mother and a woman I cannot but rejoice at this <lb/>
discovery. To find my daughter <hi rend="italic">less</hi> guilty, than <reg orig="appear-|ances">appearances</reg> <lb/>
led me to believe, cannot but console me under the <lb/>
conviction of her numerous errors. Would to heaven she <lb/>
would stop here, in her career of folly and imprudence.</p>
<p>I cannot but regard <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> sir, as the author of much misery. <lb/>
Still it is in your power to act, as this deluded woman, Miss <lb/>
Jessup, has acted. You may desist from any future <reg orig="per-|secution">persecution</reg>. <lb/>
Your letter to me gave me no reason to expect <lb/>
the honor of this visit, and contained something like a <reg orig="pro-|mise">promise</reg> <lb/>
to shun any farther intercourse with Mrs. Talbot.</p>
<p>I hope, madam, the contents of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> letter will justify me, <lb/>
in bringing it to you.&mdash;</p>
<p>Perhaps it has, but that commission is performed. That, <lb/>
I hope, is all you proposed by coming hither, and, you will <lb/>
pardon me, if I plead an engagement for not detaining you <lb/>
longer in this house.</p>
<p>I had no apology for prolonging my stay, yet I was <reg orig="irre-|solute">irresolute</reg>. <lb/>
She seemed impatient at my lingering; again urged <lb/>
her engagements; I rose; took my hat; moved a few <lb/>
steps towards the door; hesitated.</p>
<p>At length, I stammered out&mdash;Since it is the last&mdash;the last <lb/>
interview&mdash;if I were allowed&mdash;but one moment.</p>
<p>No, no, no&mdash;what but needless torment to herself and to <lb/>
you can follow? What do you expect from an interview?</p>
<pb n="193" entity="eaf033v4_0206" pid="uva-lib:350215"/>
<p>I would see, for a moment, the face of one, whom&mdash; <lb/>
whatever be <hi rend="italic">my</hi> faults, and whatever be <hi rend="italic">hers,</hi> I <hi rend="italic">love.</hi></p>
<p>Yes. You would profit, no doubt, by your power over <lb/>
this infatuated girl. I know what a rash proposal she has <lb/>
made you, and you seek her presence to insure her <reg orig="adhe-|rence">adherence</reg> <lb/>
to it.</p>
<p>Her vehemence tended more to bereave me of courage <lb/>
than of temper, but I could not forbear (mildly however) <lb/>
reminding her that if I had sought to take advantage of her <lb/>
daughter's offer, the easiest and most obvious method was <lb/>
different from that which I had taken.</p>
<p>True, (said she, her eyes flashing fire,) a secret marriage <lb/>
would have given you the <hi rend="italic">destitute</hi> and <hi rend="italic">portionless</hi> girl, but <lb/>
your views are far more solid and substantial. You know <lb/>
your power over her; and aim at extorting from compassion <lb/>
for my child what&mdash;but why do I exchange a word with <lb/>
you? Mrs. Talbot knows not that you are here. She has <lb/>
just given me the strongest proof of compunction for <hi rend="italic">every</hi> <lb/>
past folly, and especially the <hi rend="italic">last.</hi> She has bound herself <lb/>
to go along with me. If your professions of regard for her <lb/>
be sincere, you will not increase her difficulties. I command <lb/>
you, I implore you to leave the house.</p>
<p>I should not have resisted these entreaties on my own <lb/>
account. Yet to desert her&mdash;to be thought by her to have <lb/>
coldly and inhumanly rejected her offers!</p>
<p>In your presence, madam&mdash;I ask not privacy&mdash;let her <lb/>
own lips confirm the sentence&mdash;be renunciation her own <lb/>
act&mdash;for the sake of her peace of mind.&mdash;</p>
<p>God give me patience, said the exasperated lady. How <lb/>
securely do you build on her infatuation. But you shall <lb/>
not see her. If she consents to see you, I never will forgive <lb/>
her. If she once more relapses, she is undone. She shall <lb/>
write her mind to you&mdash;let that serve&mdash;I will permit her&mdash; <lb/>
I will urge her to write to you&mdash;let that serve.</p>
<p>I went to this house with a confused perception that this <lb/>
visit would terminate my suspense. One more interview <lb/>
with Jane, thought I, and no more fluctuations or uncertainty. <lb/>
Yet I was now as far as ever from certainty. <reg orig="Expostula-|tion">Expostulation</reg> <lb/>
was vain. She would not hear me. All my courage, <lb/>
even my words were overwhelmed by her vehemence.</p>
<pb n="194" entity="eaf033v4_0207" pid="uva-lib:350216"/>
<p>After much hesitation, and several efforts to gain even a <lb/>
hearing of my pleas, I yielded to the tide. With a <reg orig="droop-|ing">drooping</reg> <lb/>
heart, I consented to withdraw, with my dearest hope <lb/>
unaccomplished.</p>
<p>My steps involuntarily brought me back to my lodgings. <lb/>
Here am I again at my pen. Never were my spirits lower, <lb/>
my prospects more obscure, my hopes nearer to extinction.</p>
<p>I am afraid to allow you too near a view of my heart, <lb/>
at this moment of despondency. My present feelings are <lb/>
new even to myself. They terrify me. I must not trust <lb/>
myself longer alone. I must shake off, or try to shake off <lb/>
this excruciating&mdash;this direful melancholy. Heavy, heavy <lb/>
is my soul; comfortless and friendless my condition. <reg orig="No-|thing">Nothing</reg> <lb/>
is sweet but the prospect of oblivion.</p>
<p>But, again I say, these thoughts must not lead me. <lb/>
Dreadful and downward is the course to which they point. <lb/>
I must relinquish the pen. I must sally forth into the fields. <lb/>
Naked and bleak is the face of nature at this inclement <lb/>
season&mdash;but what of that? Dark and desolate will ever be <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">my</hi> world&mdash;but I will not write another word&mdash;</p>
<ornament type="characters">*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*</ornament>
<p>So, my friend, I have returned from my walk with a <lb/>
mind more a stranger to tranquillity than when I sallied <lb/>
forth. On my table lay the letter, which, ere I seal this, I <lb/>
will enclose to you. Read it here.</p>

<p>If any thing can exceed your depravity, Sir, it is your <lb/>

<p>I would not leave the city without apprizing you of this <lb/>

would seek a just revenge for so atrocious a slander.</p>
<p>I need not tell you that I have seen her; laid the letter <lb/>

tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi> what her anger and amazement were on finding her <lb/>

<p>I pity you, Sir; I grieve for you; you have talents of a <lb/>

perverse, have made you act on most occasions like an idiot. <lb/>
Their iniquity was not sufficient to deter you from <reg orig="impos-|tures">impostures</reg> <lb/>

<p>My daughter is a monument of the success of your <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Is</hi> not this strange, my friend! Miss Jessup, it seems, <lb/>
has denied her own letter. Surely there was no mistake&mdash; <lb/>
no mystery. Let me look again at the words in the cover.</p>
<p>Let me awake! Let me disabuse my senses! Yes. It <lb/>
is plain. Miss Jessup repented her of her confession. <lb/>
Something in that unopened letter&mdash;believing the contents <lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> known, there were inducements to sincerity which <lb/>
the recovery of that letter, and the finding it unopened, <lb/>
perhaps annihilated. Pride resumed its power. Before so <lb/>

<pb n="196" entity="eaf033v4_0209" pid="uva-lib:350218"/>
worthy of discredit as I, how easy, how obvious to deny&mdash; <lb/>
and to impute to me the imposture charged on herself?</p>
<p>Well, and what is now to be done? I will once more <lb/>
return to Miss Jessup. I will force myself into her <reg orig="pre-|sence">presence</reg>, <lb/>
and then&mdash;but I have not a moment to lose&mdash;</p>

<p>And this was the night, this was the hour that was to see <lb/>
my Jane's hand wedded to mine. That event providence, <lb/>
or fate, or fortune stepped in to forbid. And must it then <lb/>
pass away like any vulgar hour?</p>
<p>It deserves to be signalized, to be made memorable. <lb/>
What forbids but sordid, despicable cowardice! Not <reg orig="vir-|tue">virtue</reg>; <lb/>
not the love of universal happiness; not piety; not <lb/>
sense of duty to my God or my fellow creatures. These <lb/>
sentiments, alas! burn feebly or not at all within my <reg orig="bo-|som">bosom</reg>.</p>
<p>It is not hope that restrains my hand. For what is my <lb/>
hope? Independence, dignity, a life of activity and <reg orig="use-|fulness">usefulness</reg>, <lb/>
are not within my reach&mdash;and why not? What <lb/>
obstacles arise in the way.</p>
<p>Have I not youth, health, knowledge, talents? Twenty <lb/>
professional roads are open before me, and solicit me to <lb/>
enter them&mdash;but no. I shall never enter any of them. Be <lb/>
all earthly powers combined to force me into the right path <lb/>
&mdash;the path of duty, honor and interest&mdash;they strive in vain.</p>
<p>And whence this incurable folly? This rooted <reg orig="inca-|pacity">incapacity</reg> <lb/>
of acting as every motive, generous and selfish, <reg orig="com-|bine">combine</reg> <lb/>
to recommend? Constitution; habit; insanity; the <lb/>
dominion of some evil spirit, who insinuates his baneful <lb/>
power between the <hi rend="italic">will</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">act.</hi></p>
<p>And this more congenial good; this feminine excellence; <lb/>
this secondary and more valuable self; this woman who <lb/>
has appropriated to herself every desire, every emotion of <lb/>
my soul&mdash;what hope remains with regard to her? Shall I <lb/>
live for her sake?</p>
<p>No. Her happiness requires me to be blotted out of <lb/>
existence. Let me unfold myself <hi rend="italic">to</hi> myself; let me ask my <lb/>
soul&mdash;can'st thou wish to be rejected, renounced, and <reg orig="for-|gotten">forgotten</reg> <lb/>
by Jane? Does it please thee that her happiness <lb/>
should be placed upon a basis absolutely independent of <lb/>
<pb n="197" entity="eaf033v4_0210" pid="uva-lib:350219"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">18</fw></pb>
thy lot. Can'st thou, with a true and fervent zeal, resign <lb/>
her to her mother.</p>
<p>I can. I do.</p>
<ornament type="characters">*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*&emsp;*</ornament>
<p>I wish I had words, my friend&mdash;yet why do I wish for <lb/>
them. Why sit I here, endeavoring to give form, substance, <lb/>
and duration to images, to which it is guilty and opprobrious <lb/>
to allow momentary place in my mind? Why do I thus lay <lb/>
up for the few that love me, causes of affliction?</p>
<p>Yet, perhaps, I accuse myself too soon. The persuasion <lb/>
that I have one friend, is sweet. I fancy myself talking to <lb/>
<unclear id="u3">oe</unclear> who is interested in my happiness, but this shall satisfy <lb/>
me. If fate impel me to any rash and irretrievable act, I <lb/>
will take care that no legacy of sorrow shall be left to my <lb/>
survivors. My fate shall be buried in oblivion. No busy <lb/>
curiosity, no affectionate zeal shall trace the way that I have <lb/>
gone. No mourning footsteps shall haunt my grave.</p>
<p>I am, indeed, my friend&mdash;never, never before, spiritless, <lb/>
and even hopeless as I have sometimes been, have my <lb/>
thoughts been thus gloomy. Never felt I so enamored of <lb/>
that which seems to be the cure-all.</p>
<p>Often have I wished to slide obscurely and quietly into <lb/>
the grave; but this wish, while it saddened my bosom, <lb/>
never raised my hand against my life. It made me <reg orig="will-|ingly">willingly</reg> <lb/>
expose my safety to the blasts of pestilence; it made <lb/>
me court disease, but it never set my imagination in search <lb/>
after more certain and speedy means.</p>
<p>Yet I am wonderfully calm. I can still reason on the <lb/>
folly of despair. I know that a few days; perhaps a few <lb/>
hours, will bring me some degree of comfort and courage; <lb/>
will make life, with all its disappointments and vexations, <lb/>
endurable at least.</p>
<p>Would to heaven I were not quite alone. Left thus to <lb/>
my greatest enemy, myself, I feel that I am capable of <lb/>
deeds which I fear to name.</p>
<p>A few minutes ago I was anxious to find Miss Jessup; <lb/>
to gain another interview with Mrs. Fielder. Both the one <lb/>
and the other have left the city. Jane's dwelling is deserted. <lb/>
Shortly after I left it, they set out upon their journey, and <lb/>
<pb n="198" entity="eaf033v4_0211" pid="uva-lib:350220"/>
Miss Jessup, no doubt, to avoid another interview with me, <lb/>
has precipitately withdrawn into the country.</p>
<p>I shall not pursue their steps. Let things take their <lb/>
course. No doubt, a lasting and effectual remorse will, <lb/>
sometime or other, reach the heart of Miss Jessup, and this <lb/>
fatal error will be rectified. I need not live, I need not <lb/>
exert myself, to hasten the discovery. I can do nothing.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> is not improbable that as soon as you recognise the <lb/>
hand that wrote this letter, you will throw it unread into the <lb/>
fire, yet it comes not to sooth resentment, or to supplicate <lb/>
for mercy. It seeks not a favorable audience. It wishes <lb/>
not, because the wish would be chimerical, to have its <reg orig="as-|sertions">assertions</reg> <lb/>
believed. It expects not even to be read. All I <lb/>
hope is, that, though neglected, despised, and discredited <lb/>
for the present, it may not be precipitately destroyed or <lb/>
utterly forgotten. The time will come, when it will be read <lb/>
with a different spirit.</p>
<p>You inform me, that Miss Jessup has denied her letter, <lb/>
and imputes to me the wickedness of forging her name to a <lb/>
false confession. You are justly astonished at the iniquity <lb/>
and folly of what you deem my artifice. This astonishment, <lb/>
when you look back upon my past misconduct, is turned <lb/>
from me to yourself; from <hi rend="italic">my</hi> folly to your own credulity, <lb/>
that was, for a moment, made the dupe of my <reg orig="contri-|vances">contrivances</reg>.</p>
<p>I can say nothing that <hi rend="italic">will</hi> or that <hi rend="italic">ought</hi>&mdash;that is my <reg orig="pe-|culiar">peculiar</reg> <lb/>
misery;&mdash;that ought, considering the measure of my <lb/>
real guilt, to screen me from this charge. There is but one <lb/>
event that can shake your opinion. An event that is barely <lb/>
possible; that may not happen, if it happen at all, till the <lb/>
lapse of years; and from which, even if I were alive, I <lb/>
could not hope to derive advantage. Miss Jessup's <reg orig="con-|science">conscience</reg> <lb/>

fraud.</p>
<p>If that event ever takes place, perhaps this letter may <lb/>
still exist to bear testimony to my rectitude. Thrown aside <lb/>
and long forgotten, or never read, chance may put it in your <lb/>
way, once more. Time, that soother of resentment as well <lb/>
as lessener of love, and the perseverance of your daughter <lb/>
in the way you prescribe, may soften your asperities even <lb/>
towards me. A generous heart like yours, will feel an <reg orig="emo-|tion">emotion</reg> <lb/>
of joy that I have not been quite as guilty as you had <lb/>
reason to believe.</p>
<p>Give me leave, Madam, to anticipate that moment. The <lb/>
number of my consolations are few. Your enmity I rank <lb/>
among my chief misfortunes, and the more so because I <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I sought</hi> relief a second time, to my drooping heart, by <lb/>
a walk in the fields. Returning, I met Harriet Thomson <lb/>
in the street. The meeting was somewhat unexpected. <lb/>
Since we parted at Baltimore, I imagined she had returned <lb/>
to her old habitation in Jersey. I knew she was pretty much <lb/>
a stranger in this city. Night had already come on, and <lb/>
she was alone. She greeted me with visible satisfaction; <lb/>
and though I was very little fit for society, especially of those <lb/>
who loved me not, I thought common civility required me <lb/>
to attend her home.</p>
<pb n="200" entity="eaf033v4_0213" pid="uva-lib:350222"/>
<p>I never saw this woman till I met her lately at her <reg orig="bro-|ther's">brother's</reg> <lb/>
bedside. Her opinions of me were all derived from <lb/>
unfavorable sources, and I knew from good authority, that <lb/>
she regarded me as a dangerous and hateful character. <lb/>
I had even, accidentally, heard her opinion of the affair <lb/>
between Jane and me. Jane was severely censured for <lb/>
credulity and indiscretion, but some excuse was allowed to <lb/>
her on the score of the greater guilt that was placed to my <lb/>
account.</p>
<p>Her behavior when we first met, was somewhat <reg orig="conform-|able">conformable</reg> <lb/>
to these impressions. A good deal of coldness and <lb/>
reserve in her deportment, which I was sometimes sorry for, <lb/>
as she seems an estimable creature; meek, affectionate, <lb/>
tender, passionately loving her brother; convinced from the <lb/>
hour of her first arrival, that his disease was a hopeless one, <lb/>
yet exerting a surprising command over her feelings, and <lb/>
performing every office of a nurse with skill and firmness.</p>
<p>Insensibly the distance between us grew less. A <reg orig="parti-|cipation">participation</reg> <lb/>
in the same calamity, and the counsel and aid which <lb/>
her situation demanded, forced her to lay aside some of <lb/>
her reserve. Still, however, it seemed but a submission to <lb/>
necessity; and all advances were made with an ill grace.</p>
<p>She was often present when her brother turned the <reg orig="dis-|course">discourse</reg> <lb/>
upon religious subjects. I have long since abjured <lb/>
the vanity of disputation. There is no road to truth, but by <lb/>
meditation; severe, intense, candid and dispassionate.&mdash; <lb/>
What others say on doubtful subjects, I shall henceforth lay <lb/>
up as materials for meditation.</p>
<p>I listened to my dying friend's arguments and <reg orig="admoni-|tions">admonitions</reg>, <lb/>
I think I may venture to say, with a suitable spirit. <lb/>
The arrogant or disputatious passions could not possibly find <lb/>
place in a scene like this. Even if I thought him in the <lb/>
wrong, what but brutal depravity could lead me to endeavor <lb/>
to shake his belief at a time when sickness had made his <lb/>
judgment infirm, and when his opinion supplied his sinking <lb/>
heart with confidence and joy?</p>
<p>But, in truth, I was far from thinking him in the wrong. <lb/>
At any time I should have allowed infinite plausibility and <lb/>
subtilty to his reasonings, and at this time, I confessed them <lb/>
to be weighty. Whether they were <hi rend="italic">most</hi> weighty in the <lb/>
scale, could be only known by a more ample and deliberate <lb/>
<pb n="201" entity="eaf033v4_0214" pid="uva-lib:350223"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">18*</fw></pb>
view and comparison, than it was possible, with the <reg orig="specta-|cle">spectacle</reg> <lb/>
of a dying friend before me, and with so many <reg orig="solici-|tudes">solicitudes</reg> <lb/>
and suspenses about me respecting Jane, to bestow on <lb/>
them. Meanwhile I treasured them up, and determined, <lb/>
as I told him, that his generous efforts for my good, should <lb/>
not be thrown away.</p>
<p>At first, his sister was very uneasy when her brother <reg orig="en-|tered">entered</reg> <lb/>
on the theme nearest to his friendly heart. She <reg orig="seem-|ed">seemed</reg> <lb/>
apprehensive of dispute and contradiction. This <reg orig="appre-|hension">apprehension</reg> <lb/>
was quickly removed, and she thenceforth <reg orig="encour-|aged">encouraged</reg> <lb/>
the discourse. She listened with delight and eagerness, <lb/>
and her eye, frequently, when my friend's eloquence was <lb/>
most affecting, appealed to me. It sometimes conveyed a <lb/>
meaning far more powerful than her brother's lips, and <reg orig="ex-|pressed">expressed</reg>, <lb/>
at once, the strongest conviction of the truth of his <lb/>
words, and the most fervent desire that they might convince <lb/>
me. Her natural modesty, joined, no doubt to her <reg orig="dises-|teem">disesteem</reg> <lb/>
of my character, prevented her from mixing in <reg orig="dis-|course">discourse</reg>.</p>
<p>She greeted me at this meeting, with a frankness which <lb/>
I did not expect. A disposition to converse, and <reg orig="attentive-|ness">attentiveness</reg> <lb/>
to the few words that I had occasion to say, were <lb/>
very evident. I was just then in the most dejected and <lb/>
forlorn state imaginable. My heart panted for some <reg orig="friend-|ly">friendly</reg> <lb/>
bosom, into which I might pour my cares. I had reason <lb/>
to esteem the purity, sweetness, and amiable qualities of this <lb/>
good girl. Her aversion to me naturally flowed from these <lb/>
qualities, while an abatement of that aversion was flattering <lb/>
to me, as the triumph of feeling over judgment.</p>
<p>I should have left her at the door of her lodgings, but she <lb/>
besought me to go in so earnestly, that my facility, rather <lb/>
than my inclination, complied. She saw that I was absent <lb/>
and disturbed. I never read compassion and, (shall I say,) <lb/>
good will, in any eye more distinctly than in hers.</p>
<p>The conversation for a time was vague and trite. <reg orig="In-|sensibly">Insensibly</reg>, <lb/>
the scenes lately witnessed were recalled, not <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
many an half stifled sigh and ill disguised tear on her <lb/>
part. Some arrangements as to the letters and papers of <lb/>
her brother were suggested. I expressed a wish to have <lb/>
my letters restored to me; I alluded to those letters written <lb/>
<pb n="202" entity="eaf033v4_0215" pid="uva-lib:350224"/>
in the sanguine insolence of youth and with the dogmatic <lb/>
rage upon me, that have done me so much mischief with <lb/>
Mrs. Fielder. I had not thought of them before, but now <lb/>
it occurred to me that they might as well be destroyed.</p>
<p>This insensibly led the conversation into more interesting <lb/>
topics. I could not suppress my regret that I had ever <lb/>
written some things in those letters, and informed her that <lb/>
my view in taking them back was to doom them to that <lb/>
oblivion from which it would have been happy for me if <lb/>
they never had been called.</p>
<p>After many tacit intimations; much reluctance and <reg orig="tim-|idity">timidity</reg> <lb/>
to inquire and communicate, I was greatly surprised <lb/>
to discover that these letters had been seen by her; that <lb/>
Mrs. Fielder's character was not unknown to her; that she <lb/>
was no stranger to her brother's disclosures to that lady.</p>
<p>Without directly expressing her thoughts, it was easy to <lb/>
perceive that her mind was full of ideas produced by these <lb/>
letters; by her brother's discourse; and by curiosity as to <lb/>
my present opinions. Her modesty laid restraint on her lips. <lb/>
She was fearful, I supposed, of being thought forward and <lb/>
impertinent.</p>
<p>I endeavored to dissipate these apprehensions. All about <lb/>
this girl was, on this occasion, remarkably attractive. I <lb/>
loved her brother, and his features still survive in her. The <lb/>
only relation she has left is a distant one, on whose regard <lb/>
and protection she has therefore but slender claims. Her <lb/>
mind is rich in all the graces of ingenuousness and modesty. <lb/>
The curiosity she felt respecting me, made me grateful as <lb/>
for a token of regard. I was therefore not backward to <lb/>
unfold the true state of my mind.</p>
<p>Now and then she made seasonable and judicious <reg orig="com-|ments">comments</reg> <lb/>
on what I said. Was there any subject of inquiry more <lb/>
momentous than the truth of religion? If my doubts and <lb/>
heresies had involved me in difficulties, was not the remedy <lb/>
obvious and easy? why not enter on regular discussions, and <lb/>
having candidly and deliberately formed my creed, adhere <lb/>
to it frankly, firmly and consistently. A state of doubt and <lb/>
indecision was in every view, hurtful, criminal and <reg orig="ignomini-|ous">ignominious</reg>. <lb/>
Conviction, if it were in favor of religion, would insure <lb/>
me every kind of happiness. It would forward even those <lb/>
schemes of temporal advantage on which I might be intent. <lb/>
<pb n="203" entity="eaf033v4_0216" pid="uva-lib:350225"/>
It would reconcile those whose aversion arose from difference <lb/>
of opinion; and in cases where it failed to benefit my <reg orig="world-|ly">worldly</reg> <lb/>
views, it would console me for my disappointment.</p>
<p>If my inquiries should establish an irreligious conviction, <lb/>
still any form of certainty was better than doubt. The love <lb/>
of truth and the consciousness of that certainty would raise <lb/>
me above hatred and slander. I should then have some <lb/>
kind of principle by which to regulate my conduct; I should <lb/>
then know on what foundation to build. To fluctuate, <lb/>
to waver, to postpone inquiry, was more criminal than any <lb/>
kind of opinion, candidly investigated and firmly adopted; <lb/>
and would more effectually debar me from happiness. At <lb/>
my age, with my talents and inducements it was sordid; it <lb/>
was ignoble; it was culpable to allow indifference or <reg orig="indo-|lence">indolence</reg> <lb/>
to slacken my zeal.</p>
<p>These sentiments were conveyed in various broken hints, <lb/>
and modest interrogatories. While they mortified, they <lb/>
charmed me: they enlightened me while they perplexed. I <lb/>
came away with my soul roused by a new impulse. I have <lb/>
emerged from a dreary torpor, not indeed to tranquillity or <lb/>
happiness, but to something less fatal, less dreadful.</p>
<p>Would you think that a ray of hope has broken in upon <lb/>
me? Am I not still, in some degree, the maker of my <reg orig="for-|tune">fortune</reg>? <lb/>
Why mournfully ruminate on the past, instead of <reg orig="look-|ing">looking</reg> <lb/>
to the future? How wretched, how crimimal, how <reg orig="in-|famous">infamous</reg> <lb/>
are my doubts!</p>
<p>Alas! and is this the first time that I have been visited <lb/>
by such thoughts! How often has this transient hope, this <lb/>
momentary zeal, started into being, hovered in my fancy, <lb/>
and vanished. Thus will it ever be.</p>
<p>Need I mention&mdash;but I will not look back. To what <lb/>
end? Shall I grieve or rejoice at that power of now and <lb/>
then escaping from the past? Could it operate to my <lb/>
amendment, memory should be ever busy, but I fear that <lb/>
it would only drive me to desperation or madness.</p>

<head>LETTER LIV.</head>
<opener>
<dateline><name type="place">Philadelphia,</name> Dec. 19.</dateline>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I have</hi> just returned from a visit to my new friend. I <lb/>
begin to think that if I had time to cultivate her good opinion <lb/>
I should gain as much of it as I deserve. Her good will; <lb/>
her sympathy at least might be awakened in my favor.</p>
<p>We have had a long conversation. Her distance and <reg orig="re-|serve">reserve</reg> <lb/>
are much less than they were. She blames, yet <lb/>
pities me. I have been very communicative, and have <lb/>
offered her the perusal of all the letters that I have lately <lb/>
received from Mrs. Talbot as vouchers for my sincerity.</p>
<p>She listened favorably to my account of the unhappy <lb/>
misapprehension into which Mrs. Fielder had fallen. She <lb/>
was disposed to be more severe on Miss Jessup's imposture, <lb/>
than even my irritated passions had been.</p>
<p>She would not admit that Mrs. Fielder's antipathy to my <lb/>
alliance with her daughter, was without just grounds. She <lb/>
thought that everlasting separation was best for us both. A <lb/>
total change of my opinions on moral subjects, might, <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg>, <lb/>
in time, subdue the mother's aversion to me, but this <lb/>
change must necessarily be slow and gradual. I was <reg orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg> <lb/>
already, from my own account, far from being <reg orig="princi-|pled">principled</reg> <lb/>
against religion, but this was only a basis whereon to <lb/>
build the hope of future amendment. No present merit <lb/>
could be founded on my doubts.</p>
<p>I spared not myself in my account of former follies. <lb/>
The recital made her very solemn. I had&mdash;I had, indeed, <lb/>
been very faulty; my present embarrassments were the <reg orig="na-|tural">natural</reg> <lb/>
and just consequences of my misconduct. I had not <lb/>
merited a different destiny. I was unworthy of the love of <lb/>
such a woman as Jane. I was not qualified to make her <lb/>
happy. I ought to submit to banishment, not only as to a <lb/>
punishment justly incurred, but in gratitude to one whose <lb/>
genuine happiness, taking into view her mother's character <lb/>
and the sacrifices to which her choice of me would subject <lb/>
her, would be most effectually consulted by my exile.</p>
<p>This was an irksome lesson. She had the candor not to <lb/>
expect my cordial concurrence in such sentiments, yet <reg orig="en-|deavored">endeavored</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="205" entity="eaf033v4_0218" pid="uva-lib:350227"/>
in her artless manner to enforce them. She did <lb/>
not content herself with placing the matter in this light. <lb/>
She still continued to commend the design of a distant <lb/>
voyage, even should I intend one day to return. The <lb/>
scheme was likely to produce health and pleasure to me. <lb/>
It offered objects which a rational curiosity must hold dear. <lb/>
The interval might not pass away unpropitiously to me. <lb/>
Time might effect desirable changes in Mrs. Fielder's <reg orig="sen-|timents">sentiments</reg> <lb/>
and views. A thousand accidents might occur to <lb/>
level those obstacles which were now insuperable. Pity <lb/>
and complacency might succeed to abhorrence and scorn. <lb/>
Gratitude and admiration for the patience, meekness and <lb/>
self-sacrifices of the daughter, might gradually bring about <lb/>
the voluntary surrender of her enmities; besides that event <lb/>
must one day come, which will place her above the <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg> <lb/>
of all mortal cares and passions.</p>
<p>These conversations have not been without their <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg>. <lb/>
Yes, my friend, my mind is less gloomy and <reg orig="tu-|multuous">tumultuous</reg> <lb/>
than it was. I look forward to this voyage with <lb/>
stronger hopes.</p>
<p>Methinks, I would hear once more from Jane. Could <lb/>
she be persuaded cheerfully to acquiesce in her mother's <lb/>
will; reserve herself for fortunate contingencies; confide in <lb/>
my fidelity; and find her content in the improvement of <lb/>
her time and fortune; in befriending the destitute; relieving, <lb/>
by her superfluities, the needy; and consoling the afflicted <lb/>
by her sympathy, advice, and succor&mdash;would she not <reg orig="de-|rive">derive</reg> <lb/>
happiness from these sources, though disappointed in <lb/>
the wish nearest her heart.</p>
<p>Might I not have expected a letter ere this? But she <lb/>
knows not where I am&mdash;probably imagines me at my <reg orig="fa-|ther's">father's</reg> <lb/>
house. Shall I not venture to write? a last and long <lb/>
farewell? Yet have I not said already all that the occasion <lb/>
will justify? But, if I would write I know not how to <reg orig="ad-|dress">address</reg> <lb/>
her. It seems she has not gone to New York. Her <lb/>
mother has a friend in Jersey, whither she prevailed on <lb/>
Jane to accompany her. I suppose it would be no arduous <lb/>
undertaking to trace her footsteps and gain an interview, <lb/>
and perhaps, I shall find the temptation irresistible.</p>
<p>Stephen has just now told me, by letter, that he sails in ten <lb/>
days. There will be time enough to comply with your <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="eaf033v4_0219" pid="uva-lib:350228"/>
friendly invitation. My sister and you may expect to see <lb/>
me by Saturday night. In the arms of my true friends, I <lb/>
will endeavor to forget the vexations that at present prey <lb/>
upon the peace of</p>

<p>Alas! how vainly do I boast my inflexibility. My safety <lb/>

proof of your affection for me.</p>
<p>It would greatly console me to know that you are once <lb/>

persuade you to return to him; to beseech his favor. I hope <lb/>
the way to reconcilement has already been paved by the <lb/>

more solicitous for your happiness, and more desirous to <lb/>
answer any inquiries in a manner agreeable to you.</p>
<p>Mr. Colden has made no secret to us of the relation in <lb/>
which he stood to you. We are well acquainted with the <lb/>
cause of your late separation. Will you excuse me for <reg orig="ex-|pressing">expressing</reg> <lb/>
the deep regret which that event gave me? That <lb/>
regret is the deeper, since the measures which he <reg orig="imme-|diately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
adopted, has put it out of his power to profit by any <lb/>
change in your views.</p>
<p>My husband's brother being on the point of embarking in <lb/>
a voyage to the western coast of America and to China, Mr. <lb/>
Colden prevailed upon his friends to permit him to embark <lb/>
also, as a joint adventurer in the voyage. They have been <lb/>
gone already upwards of a year. We have not heard of <lb/>
them since their touching at Tobago and Brazil.</p>
<p>The voyage will be very tedious, but as it will open <lb/>
scenes of great novelty to the mind of our friend, and as it <lb/>
may not be unprofitable to him, we were the more easily <lb/>
disposed to acquiesce.</p>
<p>Permit me, madam, to proffer you my warmest esteem <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">How</hi> shall I thank you for the kind and delicate manner <lb/>
in which you have complied with my request. You will <lb/>
not be surprised, nor, I hope, offended, that I am <reg orig="embolden-|ed">emboldened</reg> <lb/>
to address you once more.</p>
<pb n="209" entity="eaf033v4_0222" pid="uva-lib:350231"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">19</fw></pb>
<p>I see that I need not practise towards you a reserve, at <lb/>
all times foreign to my nature, and now more painful than <lb/>
at any other time, as my soul is torn with emotions, which <lb/>
I am at liberty to disclose to no other human creature. <lb/>
Will you be my friend? Will you permit me to claim your <lb/>
sympathy and consolation? As I told you before, I am <reg orig="tho-|roughly">thoroughly</reg> <lb/>
acquainted with your merits, and one of the <reg orig="felici-|ties">felicities</reg> <lb/>
which I promised myself from a nearer alliance with <lb/>
Mr. Colden, was that of numbering myself among your <lb/>
friends.</p>
<p>You have deprived me of some hope, by the information <lb/>
you give; but you have at least put an end to a suspense <lb/>
more painful than the most dreadful certainty could be.</p>
<p>You say that you know all our concerns. In pity to my <lb/>
weakness, will you give me some particulars of my friend. <lb/>
I am extremely anxious to know many things in your power <lb/>
to communicate.</p>
<p>Perhaps you know the contents of my last letter to him, <lb/>
and of his answer. I know you condemn me. You think <lb/>
me inconsiderate and cruel in writing such a letter, and my <lb/>
heart does not deny the charge. Yet my motives were <lb/>
not utterly ungenerous. I could not bear to reduce the <lb/>
man I loved to poverty. I could not bear that he should <lb/>
incur the violence and curses of his father. I fondly <lb/>
thought <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> the only obstacle to reconcilement, and was <lb/>
willing, whatever it cost me, to remove that obstacle.</p>
<p>What will become of me, if my fears should now be <reg orig="real-|ized">realized</reg>, <lb/>
if the means which I used, with no other view than <lb/>
to reconcile him to his family, should have driven him away <lb/>
from them and from his country forever? I thank my God <lb/>
that I was capable of abandoning him on no selfish or <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg> <lb/>
account. The maledictions of my own mother; the <lb/>
scorn of the world; the loss of friends, reputation and <reg orig="for-|tune">fortune</reg>, <lb/>
weighed nothing with me. Great as these evils were, <lb/>
I could have cheerfully sustained them for his sake. What <lb/>
I did, was in oblivion of self; was from a dutious regard to <lb/>
his genuine and lasting happiness. Alas! I have, perhaps, <lb/>
mistaken the means, and cruel will, I fear, be the penalty <lb/>
of my error.</p>
<p>Tell me, my dear friend, was not Colden reconciled to <lb/>
<pb n="210" entity="eaf033v4_0223" pid="uva-lib:350232"/>
his father before he went? When does he mean to return? <lb/>
What said he, what thought he of my conduct? Did he <lb/>
call me ungrateful and capricious? Did he vow never to <lb/>
see or think of me more?</p>
<p>I have regarded the promise that I made to the elder <lb/>
Colden and to my mother, as sacred. The decease of the <lb/>
latter has, in my own opinion, absolved me from any <reg orig="obliga-|tion">obligation</reg>, <lb/>
except that of promoting my own happiness, and that <lb/>
of him whom I love. I shall not <hi rend="italic">now</hi> reduce him to <reg orig="indi-|gence">indigence</reg>, <lb/>
and that consequence being precluded, I cannot <lb/>
doubt of his father's acquiescence.</p>
<p>Ah! dear Madam! I should not have been so long <reg orig="pa-|tient">patient</reg>, <lb/>
had I not, as it now appears, been lulled into a fatal <lb/>
mistake. I could not taste repose till I was, as I thought, <lb/>
certainly informed that he continued to reside in his father's <lb/>
house. This proof of reconciliation, and the silence which, <lb/>
though so near him, he maintained towards me, both <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
and subsequently to my mother's death, contributed to <lb/>
persuade me that his condition was not unhappy, and <reg orig="es-|pecially">especially</reg>, <lb/>
that either his resentment or his prudence had made <lb/>
him dismiss me from his thoughts.</p>
<p>I have lately, to my utter astonishment, discovered that <lb/>
Colden, immediately after his last letter to me, went upon <lb/>
some distant voyage, whence, though a twelvemonth has <lb/>
since passed, he has not yet returned. Hence the boldness <lb/>
of this address to you, whom I know only by rumor.</p>
<p>You will, I doubt not, easily imagine to yourself my <reg orig="feel-|ings">feelings</reg>, <lb/>
and will be good enough to answer my inquiries, if you <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I hasten,</hi> my dear madam, to reply to your letter. The <lb/>
part you have assigned me, I will most cheerfully perform <lb/>
to the utmost of my power; but very much regret that I <lb/>
have not more agreeable tidings to communicate.</p>
<pb n="211" entity="eaf033v4_0224" pid="uva-lib:350233"/>
<p>Having said that all the transactions between you and my <lb/>
brother are known to me, I need not apologize for alluding <lb/>
to events, which I could not excuse myself for doing without <lb/>
being encouraged by the frankness and solicitude which your <lb/>
own pen has expressed.</p>
<p>Immediately after the determination of his fate, in regard <lb/>
to you, he came to this city. He favored us with the <reg orig="peru-|sal">perusal</reg> <lb/>
of your letters. We entirely agreed with him in <reg orig="applaud-|ing">applauding</reg> <lb/>
the motives which influenced your conduct. We had <lb/>
no right to accuse you of precipitation or inconsistency. <lb/>
That heart must, indeed, be selfish and cold, which could <lb/>
not comprehend the horror which must have seized you, on <lb/>
hearing of his father's treatment. You acted in the first <lb/>
tumults of your feelings, as every woman would have acted. <lb/>
That you did not immediately perceive the little prospect <lb/>
there was, that a breach of this nature would be repaired; <lb/>
or that Colden would make use of your undesired and <reg orig="un-|sought">unsought</reg> <lb/>
for renunciation, as a means of reconcilement with <lb/>
his father, was no subject of surprise or blame. These <lb/>
reflections could not occur to you but in consequence of <lb/>
some intimations from others.</p>
<p>Henry Colden was no indolent or mercenary creature. <lb/>
No one more cordially detested the life of dependence than <lb/>
he. He always thought that his father had discharged all <lb/>
the duties of that relation, in nourishing his childhood and <lb/>
giving him a good education. Whatever has been since <reg orig="be-|stowed">bestowed</reg>, <lb/>
he considered as voluntary and unrequited bounty; <lb/>
has received it with irksomeness and compunction, and <lb/>
whatever you may think of the horrors of indigence, it was <lb/>
impossible to have placed him in a more painful situation <lb/>
than under his father's roof.</p>
<p>We could not but deeply regret the particular <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg> <lb/>
under which he left his father's house, but the mere <lb/>
leaving it, and the necessity which thence arose of finding <lb/>
employment and subsistence for himself, was not at all to be <lb/>
regretted.</p>
<p>The consequences of your mother's letter to the father <lb/>
produced no resentment in the son. He had refused what <lb/>
he had a right to refuse, and what had been pressed upon <lb/>
the giver, rather than sought by him. The mere <reg orig="separa-|tion">separation</reg> <lb/>
was agreeable to Colden, and the rage that <reg orig="accom-|panied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="212" entity="eaf033v4_0225" pid="uva-lib:350234"/>
it, was excited by the young man's steadiness in his <lb/>
fidelity to you.</p>
<p>You were not aware that this cause of anger could not be <lb/>
removed by any thing done by you. Colden was not <reg orig="sen-|sible">sensible</reg> <lb/>
of any fault. There was nothing, therefore, for which <lb/>
he could crave pardon. Blows and revilings had been <reg orig="pa-|tiently">patiently</reg> <lb/>
endured, but he was actuated by no tame or servile <lb/>
spirit. He never would expose himself to new insults. <lb/>
Though always ready to accept apology and grant an <reg orig="ob-|livion">oblivion</reg> <lb/>
of the past, he never would avow compunction which <lb/>
he did not feel, or confess that he had deserved the <reg orig="treat-|ment">treatment</reg> <lb/>
which he had received.</p>
<p>All this it was easy to suggest to your reflections, and I <lb/>
endeavored to persuade him to write a second letter; but <lb/>
he would not. No, said he, she has made her election. If <lb/>
no advantage is taken of her tenderness and pity, she will be <lb/>
happy in her new scheme. Shall I subject her to new <lb/>
trials; new mortifications? Can I flatter myself with being <lb/>
able to reward her by my love for the loss of every other <lb/>
comfort? No. Whatever she feels for me, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am not her <lb/>
supreme passion. Her mother is preferred to me. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> <lb/>
her present resolution puts out of all doubt. All upbraiding <lb/>
and repining from me would be absurd. What can I say <lb/>
in favor of my attachment to her, which she may not, with <lb/>
equal reason, urge in favor of her attachment to her mother? <lb/>
The happiness of one or other must be forfeited. Shall I not <lb/>
rather offer, than demand the sacrifice? And what are my <lb/>
boasts of magnanimity if I do not strive to lessen the <reg orig="diffi-|culties">difficulties</reg> <lb/>
of her choice, and persuade her that, in gratifying her <lb/>
mother she inflicts no exquisite or lasting misery on me?</p>
<p>I am not so blind but that I can foresee the effects on <lb/>
my tranquillity of time and variety of object. If I go this <lb/>
voyage, I may hope to acquire resignation much sooner than <lb/>
by staying at home. To leave these shores is, in every <lb/>
view, best for me. I can do nothing while here, for my own <lb/>
profit, and every eye I meet humbles and distresses me. <lb/>
At present, I do not wish ever to return; but, I suppose the <lb/>
absence and adventures of a couple of years, may change <lb/>
my feelings in that respect. My condition, too, by some <lb/>
chance, may be bettered. I may come back, and offer <lb/>
myself to her, without offering poverty and contempt at the <lb/>
<pb n="213" entity="eaf033v4_0226" pid="uva-lib:350235"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">19*</fw></pb>
same time. Time, or some good fortune, may remove the <lb/>
mother's prejudices. All this is possible, but, if it never <lb/>
takes place, if my condition never improves, I will never <lb/>
return home.</p>
<p>When we urged to him the propriety of apprizing you of <lb/>
his views, not only for your sake, but for his own&mdash;"what <lb/>
need is there? Has she not prohibited all intercourse between <lb/>
us? Have I not written the last letter she will consent to <reg orig="re-|ceive">receive</reg>? <lb/>
On my own account, I have nothing to hope. I <lb/>
have stated my return as a mere possibility. I do not <reg orig="be-|lieve">believe</reg> <lb/>
I shall ever return. If I did expect it, I know Jane <lb/>
too well to have any fears of her fidelity. While I am <reg orig="liv-|ing">living</reg>, <lb/>
or as long as my death is uncertain, her heart will be <lb/>
mine, and she will reserve herself for me."</p>
<p>I know you will excuse me, madam, for being thus <reg orig="parti-|cular">particular</reg>. <lb/>
I thought it best to state the views of our friend in <lb/>
his own words. From these your judgment will enable you <lb/>
to form the truest conclusions.</p>
<p>The event that has since happened has probably removed <lb/>
the only obstacle to your mutual happiness; nor am I <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
the hope of seeing him one day return to be made happy <lb/>
by your favor. As several passages were expected to be <lb/>
made between China and Nootka, that desirable event <reg orig="can-|not">cannot</reg> <lb/>
be expected to be very near.</p>

<p>You have then some hope of his return; but, you say, <lb/>

Do not think me forward or capricious. I will not deny <lb/>
that you owe your place in my affections <hi rend="italic">chiefly</hi> to your <reg orig="re-|lation">relation</reg> <lb/>
to the wanderer; but no matter whence my <reg orig="attach-|ment">attachment</reg> <lb/>
proceeds. I feel that it is strong; merely selfish, <lb/>
perhaps; the child of a distracted fancy; the prop on which <lb/>
a sinking heart relies in its uttermost extremity.</p>
<p>Reflection stings me to the quick, but it does not deny <lb/>
me some consolation. The memory of my mother calls <lb/>
forth tears, but they are not tears of bitterness. To her, at <lb/>
least, I have not been deficient in dutiful observance. I <lb/>
have sacrificed my friend and myself, but it was to her <lb/>
peace. The melancholy of her dying scene will ever be <lb/>
cheered in my remembrance, by her gratitude and blessing. <lb/>
Her last words were these;&mdash;</p>
<p>"Thou hast done much for me, my child. I begin to <lb/>
fear that I have exacted too much. Your sweetness, your <lb/>
patience have wrung my heart with compunction.</p>
<p>"I have wronged thee, Jane. I have wronged the <reg orig="ab-|sent">absent</reg>. <lb/>
I greatly fear, I have. Forgive me. If you ever <lb/>
meet, entreat <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to forgive me, and recompense yourself <lb/>
and him, for all your mutual sufferings.</p>
<p>"I hope all, though sorrowful, has been for the best. I <lb/>
hope that angelic sweetness, which I have witnessed, will <lb/>
continue when I am gone. That belief only can make my <lb/>
grave peaceful.</p>
<p>"I leave you affluence and honor at least. I leave you <lb/>
the means of repairing <hi rend="italic">my</hi> injury. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> is my comfort; but <lb/>
forgive me, Jane. Say, my child, you forgive me for what <lb/>
has past."&mdash;</p>
<p>She stretched her hand to me, which I bathed with my <lb/>
tears&mdash;But this subject afflicts me too much.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Be</hi> not anxious for me, Mary. I hope to experience <lb/>
very speedy relief from the wholesome airs that perpetually <lb/>
fan this spot. Your apprehension from the influence of <lb/>
these scenes on my fancy are groundless. They breathe <lb/>
nothing over my soul but delicious melancholy. I have <lb/>
done expecting and repining, you know. Four years have <lb/>
passed since I was here; since I met your brother under <lb/>
these shades.</p>
<p>I have already visited every spot which has been <reg orig="conse-|crated">consecrated</reg> <lb/>
by our interviews. I have found the very rail which, <lb/>
as I well remember, we disposed into a bench, at the skirt <lb/>
<pb n="216" entity="eaf033v4_0229" pid="uva-lib:350238"/>
of a wood, bordering a stubble field. The same pathway <lb/>
through the thicket, where I have often walked with him, I <lb/>
now traverse morning and night.</p>
<p>Be not uneasy, I repeat, on my account. My present <lb/>
situation is happier than the rest of the world can afford. I <lb/>
tell you I have done repining. I have done sending forth <lb/>
my views into an earthly futurity. Anxiety, I hope, is now <lb/>
at an end with me.</p>
<p>What do you think I design to do? I assure you it is no <lb/>
new scheme. Ever since my mother's death, I have <lb/>
thought of it at times. It has been my chief consolation. I <lb/>
never mentioned it to you because I knew you would not <lb/>
approve it. It is this.</p>
<p>To purchase this farm, and take up my abode upon it for <lb/>
the rest of my life. I need not become farmer, you know. <lb/>
I can let the ground to some industrious person, upon easy <lb/>
terms. I can add all the furniture and appendages to this <lb/>
mansion, which my convenience requires. Luckily <reg orig="Sand-|ford">Sandford</reg> <lb/>
has for some time, entertained thoughts of parting with <lb/>
it, and I believe he could not find a more favorable <reg orig="pur-|chaser">purchaser</reg>.</p>
<p>You will tell me that the fields are sterile, the barn small, <lb/>
the stable crazy, the woods scanty. These would be <reg orig="pow-|erful">powerful</reg> <lb/>
objections to a mere tiller of the earth, but they are <lb/>
none to me.</p>
<p>'Tis true, it is washed by a tide-water. The bank is low, <lb/>
and the surrounding country sandy and flat, and you may <lb/>
think I ought rather to prefer the beautiful variety of hill <lb/>
and dale, luxuriant groves and fertile pastures which abound <lb/>
in other parts of the country. But you know, my friend, <lb/>
the mere arrangement of inanimate objects, wood, grass, <lb/>
and rock, is nothing. It owes its power of bewitching us to <lb/>
the memory, the fancy and the heart. No spot of earth <lb/>
can possibly teem with as many affecting images as this; <lb/>
for here it was&mdash;</p>
<p>But my eyes already overflow. In the midst of these <lb/>
scenes, remembrance is too vivid to allow me thus to <reg orig="des-|cant">descant</reg> <lb/>
on them. At a distance I could talk of them without <lb/>
that painful emotion, and now it would be useless repetition, <lb/>
Have I not, more than once, related to you every dialogue; <lb/>
described every interview?</p>
<pb n="217" entity="eaf033v4_0230" pid="uva-lib:350239"/>
<p>God bless you, dear Mary, and continue to you all your <lb/>
present happiness.</p>
<p>Don't forget to write to me. Perhaps some tidings may <lb/>
reach you&mdash;down! thou flattering hope! thou throbbing <lb/>
heart, peace! He is gone. These eyes will never see him <lb/>
more. Had an angel whispered the fatal news in my <reg orig="wake-|ful">wakeful</reg> <lb/>
ear, I should not more firmly believe it.</p>
<p>And yet&mdash;but I must not heap up disappointments for <lb/>
myself. Would to heaven there was no room for the <lb/>
least doubt; that, one way or the other, his destiny was <lb/>
ascertained.</p>
<p>How agreeable is your intelligence, that Mr. Cartwright <lb/>
has embarked, after taking cheerful leave of you. It grieves <lb/>
me, my friend, that you do not entirely approve of my <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg> <lb/>
towards that man. I never formally attempted to justify <lb/>
myself. 'Twas a subject on which I could not give <reg orig="utter-|ance">utterance</reg> <lb/>
to my thoughts. How irksome is blame from those <lb/>
we love! there is instantly suspicion that blame is merited. <lb/>
A new process of self-defence is to be gone over, and ten to <lb/>
one, but that after all our efforts, there are some dregs at the <lb/>
bottom of the cup.</p>
<p>I was half willing to found my excuse on the hope of <lb/>
the wanderer's return; but I am too honest to urge a false <lb/>
plea. Besides, I know that certainty, in that respect, would <lb/>
make no difference, and would it not be fostering in him <lb/>
a hope that my mind might be changed in consequence of <lb/>
being truly informed respecting your brother's fate?</p>
<p>I persuade myself that a man of Cartwright's integrity <lb/>
and generosity cannot be made lastingly unhappy by me. <lb/>
I know but of one human being more excellent. Though <lb/>
his sensibility be keen, I trust to his fortitude.</p>
<p>It is true, Mary, what you have heard. Cartwright was <lb/>
my school-fellow. When we grew to an age, that made it <lb/>
proper to frequent separate schools, he did not forget me. <lb/>
The schools adjoined each other, and he used to resist all <lb/>
the enticements of prison-bass and cricket, for the sake of <lb/>
waiting at the door of our school, till it broke up, and then <lb/>
accompanying me home.</p>
<p>These little gallant offices made him quite singular among <lb/>
his compeers, and drew on him and on me, a good deal of <lb/>
ridicule. But he did not mind it. I thought him, and <lb/>
<pb n="218" entity="eaf033v4_0231" pid="uva-lib:350240"/>
every body else thought him, a most amiable and engaging <lb/>
youth, though only twelve or thirteen years old.</p>
<p>'Tis impossible to say what might have happened, had <lb/>
he not gone with his mother to Europe; or rather, it is <lb/>
likely, I think, that our fates, had he stayed among us, would <lb/>
in time have been united. But he went away when I was <lb/>
scarcely fourteen. At parting, I remember, we shed a <lb/>
great many tears and exchanged a great many kisses; and <lb/>
promises <hi rend="italic">not to forget.</hi> And that promise never was broken <lb/>
by me. He was always dear to my remembrance.</p>
<p>Time has only improved all the graces of the boy. I <lb/>
will not conceal from <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> Mary, that nothing but a <reg orig="preoc-|cupied">preoccupied</reg> <lb/>
heart has been an obstacle to his wishes. If that <lb/>
impediment had not existed, my reverence for his worth, <lb/>
my gratitude for his tenderness would have made me <reg orig="com-|ply">comply</reg>. <lb/>
I will even go further; I will say <hi rend="italic">to you,</hi> though my <lb/>
regard to his happiness will never suffer me to say it to him, <lb/>
that if three years more pass away, and I am fully assured <lb/>
that your brother's absence will be perpetual, and <reg orig="Cart-|wright's">Cartwright's</reg> <lb/>
happiness is still in my hands&mdash;that then&mdash;I possibly <lb/>
may&mdash;but I am sure that, before that time, his hand and his <lb/>
heart will be otherwise disposed of. Most sincerely shall I <lb/>
rejoice at the last event.</p>
<p>All are well here. My friend is as good natured and <lb/>
affectionate as ever; and sings as delightfully, and plays as <lb/>
adroitly. She humors me with all my favorite airs, twice <lb/>
a day. We have no strangers; no impertinents to <reg orig="inter-|meddle">intermeddle</reg> <lb/>
in our conversations and mar our enjoyments.</p>
<p>You know what turn my studies have taken, and what <lb/>
books I have brought with me. 'Tis remarkable what <reg orig="un-|looked">unlooked</reg> <lb/>
for harvests arise from small and insignificant germs. <lb/>
My affections have been the stimulants to my curiosity. <lb/>
What was it induced me to procure maps and charts, and <lb/>
explore the course of the voyager over seas and round <lb/>
capes? There was a time when these objects were wholly <lb/>
frivolous and unmeaning in my eyes, but now they gain my <lb/>
whole attention.</p>
<p>When I found that my happiness was embarked with <lb/>
your brother in a tedious and perilous voyage, was it <reg orig="possi-|ble">possible</reg> <lb/>
to forbear collecting all the information attainable <reg orig="re-|specting">respecting</reg> <lb/>
his route, and the incidents likely to attend it? I <lb/>
<pb n="219" entity="eaf033v4_0232" pid="uva-lib:350241"/>
got maps, and charts, and books of voyages, and found a <lb/>
melancholy enjoyment in connecting the incidents and <reg orig="ob-|jects">objects</reg> <lb/>
which they presented, with the destiny of my friend. <lb/>
The pursuit of this chief and most interesting object, has <lb/>
brought within view, and prompted me to examine a <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg> <lb/>
others, on which, without this original inducement, I <lb/>
should never have bestowed a thought.</p>
<p>The map of the world exists in my fancy in a most vivid <lb/>
and accurate manner. Repeated meditation on displays of <lb/>
shoal, sand-bank, and water, has created a sort of <reg orig="attach-|ment">attachment</reg> <lb/>
to geography for its own sake. I have often reflected <lb/>
on the innumerable links in the chain of my ideas between <lb/>
my first eager examination of the route by sea between <lb/>
New York and Tobago, and yesterday's employment, when <lb/>
I was closely engaged in measuring the marches of <reg orig="Frede-|rick">Frederick</reg> <lb/>
across the mountains of Bohemia.</p>
<p>How freakish and perverse are the rovings of human <reg orig="cu-|riosity">curiosity</reg>! <lb/>
The surprise which Miss Betterton betrayed, when, <lb/>
in answer to her inquiries, as to what study and what book <lb/>
I prized the most, you told her that I thought of little else <lb/>
than of the art of moving from shore to shore across the <lb/>
water, and that I pored over Cook's voyages so much, that <lb/>
I had gotten the best part of them by rote, was very natural. <lb/>
She must have been puzzled to conjecture what charms <lb/>
one of my sex could find in the study of maps and voyages. <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Once</hi> I should have been just as much puzzled myself. <lb/>
Adieu.</p>

more abruptly and with false or exaggerated <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg>, <lb/>
induces me to write to you.</p>
<p>Yesterday week, a ship arrived in this port from <reg orig="Bata-|via">Batavia</reg>, <lb/>
in which my husband's brother, Stephen Montford, came <lb/>
passenger.</p>
<p>You will be terrified at these words; but calm your <reg orig="ap-|prehensions">apprehensions</reg>. <lb/>
Harry does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> accompany him, it is true, <lb/>
nor are we acquainted with his present situation.</p>
<p>The story of their unfortunate voyage cannot be minutely <lb/>
related now. Suffice it to say that a wicked and turbulent <lb/>
wretch, whom they shipped in the West Indies as mate, the <lb/>
former dying on the voyage thither, gave rise, by his <reg orig="in-|trigues">intrigues</reg> <lb/>
among the crew, to a mutiny.</p>
<p>After a prosperous navigation and some stay at Nootka, <lb/>
they prepared to cross the ocean to Asia. They pursued <lb/>
the usual route of former traders, and after touching at the <lb/>
Sandwich Islands, they made the land of Japan.</p>
<p>At this period the mutiny which had long been hatching, <lb/>
broke out. The whole crew including the mate, joined the <lb/>
conspiracy. Montford and my brother were the objects of <lb/>
this conspiracy.</p>
<p>The original design was to murder them both and throw <lb/>
their bodies into the sea, but this cruel proposal was thwarted <lb/>
<pb n="223" entity="eaf033v4_0236" pid="uva-lib:350245"/>
both by compassion and by policy, and it was resolved to <lb/>
set my brother ashore on the first inhospitable land they <lb/>
should meet, and retain Montford to assist them in the <reg orig="naviga-|tion">navigation</reg> <lb/>
of the vessel, designing to destroy him when his <reg orig="ser-|vices">services</reg> <lb/>
should no longer be necessary.</p>
<p>This scheme was executed as soon as they came in sight <lb/>
of an out-lying isle or dry sand bank, on the eastern coast <lb/>
of Japan. Here they seized the two unsuspecting youths, <lb/>
at day-break, while asleep in their <hi rend="italic">births,</hi> and immediately <lb/>
putting out their boat landed my brother on the shore, <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
clothing or provisions of any kind. Montford petitioned <lb/>
to share the fate of his friend, but they would not listen <lb/>
to it.</p>
<p>Six days afterwards, they lighted on a Spanish ship <lb/>
bound to Manilla, who was in want of water. A party of <lb/>
the Spaniards came on board in search of some supply of <lb/>
that necessary article.</p>
<p>On their coming, Montford was driven below and <reg orig="dis-|abled">disabled</reg> <lb/>
from giving, by his cries, any alarm. The sentinel who <lb/>
guarded him, had received orders to keep him in that <reg orig="situa-|tion">situation</reg> <lb/>
till the visitants had departed. From some impulse of <lb/>
humanity, or mistake of orders, the sentinel freed him <lb/>
from restraint a few minutes earlier than had been intended, <lb/>
and he got on deck before the departing strangers had gone <lb/>
to any considerable distance from the ship. He <reg orig="imme-|diately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
leapt into the sea and made for the boat, to which, <lb/>
being a very vigorous swimmer, he arrived in safety.</p>
<p>The mutineers, finding their victim had escaped, <reg orig="endea-|vored">endeavored</reg> <lb/>
to make the best of their way, but were soon <reg orig="over-|taken">overtaken</reg> <lb/>
by the Spanish vessel, to whose officers Montford <lb/>
made haste to explain the true state of affairs. They were <lb/>
carried to Manilla, where Montford sold his vessel and cargo <lb/>
on very advantageous terms. From thence, after many <reg orig="de-|lays">delays</reg>, <lb/>
he got to Batavia, and from thence returned home.</p>
<p>I have thus given you, my friend, an imperfect account <lb/>
of their misfortunes. I need not add that no tidings has <lb/>
been received, or can reasonably be hoped ever to be <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
of my brother.</p>
<p>I could not write on such a subject sooner. For some <lb/>
days I had thoughts of being wholly silent on this news. <lb/>
Indeed my emotions would not immediately permit me to <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="eaf033v4_0237" pid="uva-lib:350246"/>
use the pen, but I have concluded, and it is my husband's <lb/>
earnest advice, to tell you the whole truth.</p>
<p>Be not too much distressed, my sister, my friend. Fain <lb/>
would I give you that consolation which I myself want. I <lb/>
entreat you, let me hear from you soon, and tell me that <lb/>
you are not very much afflicted. Yet I could not believe <lb/>
you if you did. Write to me speedily, however.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I beseech</hi> you, dear Mrs. Montford, take some <reg orig="mea-|sures">measures</reg> <lb/>
for drawing our dear Jane from this place. There is <lb/>
no remedy but absence from this spot, cheerful company <lb/>
and amusing engagements, for the sullen grief which has <lb/>
seized her. Ever since the arrival of your letter, giving us <lb/>
the fatal tidings of your brother's misfortune, she has been <lb/>
&mdash;in a strange way&mdash;I am almost afraid to tell you; I know <lb/>
how much you love her; but indeed, indeed, unless <reg orig="some-|body">somebody</reg> <lb/>
with more spirit and skill than I possess, will <reg orig="under-|take">undertake</reg> <lb/>
to console and divert her, I am fearful we shall lose <lb/>
her forever.</p>
<p>I can do nothing for her relief. You know what a poor <lb/>
creature I am. Instead of summoning up courage to <reg orig="as-|sist">assist</reg> <lb/>
another in distress, the sight of it confuses and frightens <lb/>
me. Never, I believe, was there such another helpless <lb/>
good for nothing creature in existence. Poor Jane's <reg orig="affect-|ing">affecting</reg> <lb/>
ways only make me miserable, and instead of my being <lb/>
of any use to her, her presence deprives me of all power <lb/>
to attend to my family and friends. I endeavor to avoid <lb/>
her, though, indeed, that requires but little pains to effect, <lb/>
since she will not be seen but when she cannot choose, for <lb/>
whenever she looks at me steadily, there is such expression <lb/>
in her features, something so woful, so wild, that I am <lb/>
struck with terror. It never fails to make me cry heartily.</p>
<p>Come hither yourself, or send somebody immediately. <lb/>
If you do not, I dread the consequence.</p>

<dateline><name type="place">New Haven,</name> February 10.</dateline>
<salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear friend.</hi></salute>
</opener>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">This</hi> letter is written in extreme pain; yet no pain that I <lb/>
ever felt, no external pain possible for me to feel, is equal <lb/>
to the torment I derive from suspense. Good heaven! <lb/>
what an untoward accident! to be forcibly immured in a <lb/>
tavern chamber; when the distance is so small between me <lb/>
and that certainty after which my soul pants!</p>
<p>I ought not thus to alarm my beloved friends, but I know <lb/>
not what I write&mdash;my head is in confusion; my heart in <lb/>
tumults; a delirium, more the effect of a mind stretched <lb/>
upon the rack of impatience, than of limbs shattered and <lb/>
broken, whirls me out of myself.</p>
<p>Not a moment of undisturbed repose have I enjoyed for <lb/>
the last two months. If awake, omens and conjectures, <lb/>
menacing fears, and half-formed hopes have haunted and <lb/>
harassed me. If asleep, dreams of agonizing forms and <lb/>
ever varying hues, have thronged my fancy and driven away <lb/>
peace.</p>
<p>In less than an hour after landing at Boston, I placed <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg> <lb/>
in the swiftest stage, and have travelled night and day, <lb/>
till within a mile of this town, when the carriage was <reg orig="over-|turned">overturned</reg> <lb/>
and my left arm terribly shattered. I was drawn <lb/>
with difficulty hither, and my only hope of being once more <lb/>
well is founded on my continuance, for i know not how <lb/>
long, in one spot and one posture.</p>
<p>By this time, the well known hand has told you who it <lb/>
is that writes this&mdash;the exile; the fugitive; whom four long <lb/>
years of absence and silence have not, I hope, erased from <lb/>
your remembrance, banished from your love, or even <reg orig="total-|ly">totally</reg> <lb/>
excluded from the hope of being seen again.</p>
<p>Yet that hope, surely, must have been long ago <reg orig="dis-|missed">dismissed</reg>. <lb/>
Acquainted as you are with some part of my <lb/>
destiny; of my being left on the desert shore of Japan; on <lb/>
the borders of a new world; a world, civilized, indeed, <lb/>
<pb n="227" entity="eaf033v4_0240" pid="uva-lib:350249"/>
and peopled by men, but existing in almost total separation <lb/>
from the other families of mankind; with language, <reg orig="man-|ners">manners</reg>, <lb/>
and policy almost incompatible with the existence of a <lb/>
stranger among them; all entrance, or egress from which, <lb/>
being commonly supposed to be prohibited by iron laws and <lb/>
inflexible despotism; that I, a stranger, naked, forlorn, <lb/>
cast upon a sandy beach; frequented, but at rare <reg orig="inter-|vals">intervals</reg>, <lb/>
and by savage fishermen, should find my way into the <lb/>
heart of this wonderful empire, and finally explore my way <lb/>
back to my native shore, are surely most strange and <reg orig="incred-|ible">incredible</reg> <lb/>
achievements&mdash;yet all this, my friend, has been endured <lb/>
and performed by your Colden.</p>
<p>Finding it impossible to move immediately from this <lb/>
place, and this day's post having gone out before my arrival, <lb/>
I employed a man to carry you these assurances of my <reg orig="ex-|istence">existence</reg> <lb/>
and return, and to bring me back intelligence of <lb/>
your welfare; and some news concerning&mdash;may I perish <lb/>
if I can, at this moment, write her name. Every moment, <lb/>
every mile that has brought me nearer to <hi rend="italic">her,</hi> or rather <reg orig="near-|er">nearer</reg> <lb/>
to certainty of her life or death, her happiness or misery, <lb/>
has increased my trepidation; added new tremors to my <lb/>
heart.</p>
<p>I have some time to spare. In spite of my impatience, <lb/>
my messenger cannot start within a few hours. I am little <lb/>
fitted, in my present state of pain and suspense, to write <lb/>
intelligibly. Yet what else can I do but write, and will you <lb/>
not, in your turn, be impatient to know by what means I <lb/>
have once more set my foot in my native land.</p>
<p>I will fill up the interval, till my messenger is ready, by <lb/>
writing. I will give you some hints of my adventures. <lb/>
All particulars must be deferred till I see you. Heaven <lb/>
grant that I may once more see you and my sister. Four <lb/>
months ago you were well, but that interval is large enough <lb/>
to breed ten thousand disasters. Expect not a distinct or <lb/>
regular story. That, I repeat, must be deferred till we <lb/>
meet. Many a long day would be consumed in the telling, <lb/>
and that which was hazard or hardship in the encounter and <lb/>
the sufferance, will be pleasant to remembrance, and <reg orig="delight-|ful">delightful</reg> <lb/>
in narration.</p>
<p>You know by what accident, and in what remote and <reg orig="in-|hospitable">inhospitable</reg> <lb/>
region, Stephen and I were separated. How did <lb/>
<pb n="228" entity="eaf033v4_0241" pid="uva-lib:350250"/>
I know, you will, perhaps, ask, the extent of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg>? <lb/>
By strange and unexpected means; but have <reg orig="pa-|tience">patience</reg>, <lb/>
and, in due time, I will tell you.</p>
<p>What a scene did I pass through! what uncouth forms, <lb/>
strange accents, and ferocious demeanor presented <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
in the fishermen that found me, half famished, on a <lb/>
sand bank! My fate, whether death or servitude, depended <lb/>
on the momentary impulse of untutored hearts; perhaps, <lb/>
on some adroitness and dexterity in myself.</p>
<p>They carried me from the solitary shore, into the heart <lb/>
of a cultivated island. Rumor became instantly busy, and <lb/>
at length reached the ears of a sort of feudal or territorial <lb/>
lord. By his orders, I was brought into his rustic palace. <lb/>
I found humanity and curiosity in this man. I passed <reg orig="seve-|ral">several</reg> <lb/>
months in his house, acquiring gradually a smattering of <lb/>
the language, and some insight into the policy and manners <lb/>
of the people.</p>
<p>I endeavored to better my condition, and gain respect to <lb/>
my person by the display of all the accomplishments of <lb/>
which I was master. These, alas, were but few; yet some <lb/>
of them were not altogether useless; und the humane <reg orig="tem-|per">temper</reg> <lb/>
of one whom I may call my patron, secured me gentle <lb/>
and even respectful treatment.</p>
<p>After some months this lord, whose name was Tekehatsin, <lb/>
left his island, and set out on a journey to the metropolis. <lb/>
He left me with promises of the continuance of his favor and <lb/>
protection, and urged his regard for my safety as a reason <lb/>
for not taking me along with him. I heard nothing of him <lb/>
for six weeks after his departure. Then a messenger <lb/>
arrived, with orders to bring me up to his master.</p>
<p>The incidents of this journey; the aspects of the country; <lb/>
of the cities, of the villages through which I passed, will <lb/>
afford an inexhaustible theme for future conversations. I <lb/>
reached, at length, the residence of Tekehatsin, in the <lb/>
chief city of the kingdom, the name of which is <hi rend="italic">Jedho.</hi> <lb/>
Shortly after I was introduced to one in whom I recognised <lb/>
a native of Europe; and therefore, in some respects, a <lb/>
countryman.</p>
<p>This person's name was Holtz. He was the agent of the <lb/>
Dutch East India company in Japan. He was then at court <lb/>
in a sort of diplomatic character. He was likewise a <reg orig="phy-|sician">physician</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="229" entity="eaf033v4_0242" pid="uva-lib:350251"/>
and man of science. He had even been in America, <lb/>
and found no difficulty in conversing with me in my native <lb/>
language.</p>
<p>You will easily imagine the surprise and pleasure which <lb/>
such a meeting afforded me. It likewise opened a door to <lb/>
my return to Europe, as a large trade is regularly maintained <lb/>
between Java and Japan.</p>
<p>Many obstacles, however, in the views which Tekehatsin <lb/>
had formed, of profit and amusement, from my remaining <lb/>
in his service, and in the personal interests and wishes of <lb/>
my friend Holtz, opposed this design; nor was I able to <reg orig="ac-|complish">accomplish</reg> <lb/>
it, but on condition of returning.</p>
<p>I confess to you, my friend, my heart was not extremely <lb/>
averse to this condition.</p>
<p>I left America with very faint hopes, and no expectation <lb/>
of ever returning. The longer I resided among this race <lb/>
of men, the melancholy and forlornness of my feelings <reg orig="de-|clined">declined</reg>. <lb/>
Prospects of satisfaction from the novelty and <reg orig="gran-|deur">grandeur</reg> <lb/>
of the scene into which I had entered, began to open <lb/>
upon me; sentiments of affection and gratitude for Holtz, and <lb/>
even for the Japanese lord, took root in my heart. Still, <lb/>
however, happiness was bound to scenes and to persons very <lb/>
distant from my new country, and a restlessness forever <lb/>
haunted me, which nothing could appease but some direct <lb/>
intelligence from you and from Jane Talbot. By returning <lb/>
to Europe, I could likewise be of essential service to Holtz, <lb/>
whose family were Saxons, and whose commercial interests <lb/>
required the presence of a trusty agent for a few months at <lb/>
Hamburg.</p>
<p>Let me carry you, in few words, through the difficulties of <lb/>
my embarkation, and the incidents of a short stay at Batavia, <lb/>
and a long voyage over half the world to Hamburg.</p>
<p>Shortly after my return to Hamburg, from an excursion <lb/>
into Saxony to see Holtz's friends, I met with Mr. <reg orig="Cart-|wright">Cartwright</reg>, <lb/>
an American. After much fluctuation I had <reg orig="pre-|viously">previously</reg> <lb/>
resolved to content myself with-writing to you, of <lb/>
whom I received such verbal information from several of <lb/>
our countrymen, as removed my anxiety on your account. <lb/>
A very plausible tale, told me by some one that pretended <lb/>
to know of Mrs. Talbot's marriage with a Mr. Cartwright, <lb/>
extinguished every new-born wish to revisit my native land, <lb/>
<pb n="230" entity="eaf033v4_0243" pid="uva-lib:350252"/>
and I expected to set sail on my return to India, before it <lb/>
could be possible to hear from you.</p>
<p>I was on the eve of my departure, when the name of <lb/>
Cartwright, an American, then at Hamburg, reached my <lb/>
ears. The similarity of his name to that of the happy man <lb/>
who had supplanted the poor wanderer in the affections of <lb/>
Jane, and a suspicion that they might possibly be akin, and <lb/>
consequently, that <hi rend="italic">this,</hi> might afford me some information, <lb/>
as to the character or merits of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> Cartwright, made me <lb/>
throw myself in his way.</p>
<p>You may easily imagine, what I shall defer relating, the <lb/>
steps which led us to a knowledge of each other, and by <lb/>
which I discovered that this Cartwright was the one <reg orig="mention-|ed">mentioned</reg> <lb/>
to me, and that, instead of being already the husband of <lb/>
my Jane, his hopes of her favor depended on the certain <lb/>
proof of my death.</p>
<p>Cartwright's behavior was, in the highest degree, <reg orig="disin-|terested">disinterested</reg>. <lb/>
He might easily have left me in my original <lb/>
error, and a very few days would have sent me on a voyage, <lb/>
which would have been equivalent to my death. On the <lb/>
contrary, his voluntary information and a letter which he <lb/>
shewed me, written in Jane's hand, created a new soul in <lb/>
my breast. Every foreign object vanished, and every ancient <lb/>
sentiment, connected with our unfortunate loves, was <reg orig="in-|stantly">instantly</reg> <lb/>
revived. Ineffable tenderness, and an impatience, <lb/>
next to rage, to see her, reigned in my heart.</p>
<p>Yet, my friend, with all my confidence of a favorable <reg orig="re-|ception">reception</reg> <lb/>
from Jane; her conduct now exempt from the <reg orig="irre-|sistible">irresistible</reg> <lb/>
control of her mother and her tenderness for me as <lb/>
fervent as ever; yet, since so excellent a man as <reg orig="Cart-|wright">Cartwright</reg> <lb/>
existed; since his claims were, in truth, antecedent <lb/>
to mine; since my death or everlasting absence would <reg orig="final-|ly">finally</reg> <lb/>
insure success to these claims; since his character was <lb/>
blemished by none of those momentous errors with which <lb/>
mine was loaded; since that harmony of opinions on <reg orig="reli-|gious">religious</reg> <lb/>
subjects, without which marriage can never be a source <lb/>
of happiness to hearts touched by a true and immortal passion, <lb/>
was perfect in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> case; never should mere passion have <lb/>
seduced me to her feet. If my reflections and experience <lb/>
had not changed my character; if all <hi rend="italic">her</hi> views, as to the <lb/>
final destiny and present obligations of human beings, had <lb/>
<pb n="231" entity="eaf033v4_0244" pid="uva-lib:350253"/>
not become <hi rend="italic">mine,</hi> I should have deliberately ratified the act <lb/>
of my eternal banishment.</p>
<p>Yes, my friend; this weather-beaten form and sunburnt <lb/>
face, are not more unlike what you once knew, than my <lb/>
habits and opinions now and formerly. The incidents of a <lb/>
long voyage, the vicissitudes through which I have passed, <lb/>
have given strength to my frame, while the opportunities <lb/>
and occasions for wisdom, which these have afforded me, <lb/>
have made <hi rend="italic">my mind whole.</hi> I have awakened from my <lb/>
dreams of doubt and misery, not to the cold and vague <lb/>
belief, but to the living and delightful consciousness of every <lb/>
tie that can bind man to his divine parent and judge.</p>
<p>Again I must refer you to our future interviews. A <lb/>
broken and obscure tale it would be, which I could now <reg orig="re-|late">relate</reg>. <lb/>
I am hurried, by my fears and suspenses&mdash;yet it <lb/>
would give you pleasure to know every thing as soon as <lb/>
possible&mdash;some time likewise must elapse&mdash;<hi rend="italic">You</hi> and my <reg orig="sis-|ter">sister</reg> <lb/>
have always been wise. The lessons of true piety it is <lb/>
the business of your lives to exemplify and to teach. <lb/>
Henceforth, if that principle, which has been my stay, and <lb/>
my comfort in all the slippery paths and unlooked for perils <lb/>
from which I have just been delivered, desert not my <reg orig="fu-|ture">future</reg> <lb/>
steps, I hope to be no mean example and no feeble <lb/>
teacher of the same lessons. Indefatigable zeal and <reg orig="strenu-|ous">strenuous</reg> <lb/>
efforts are indeed incumbent on me in proportion to the <lb/>
extent of my past misconduct, the depth of my former <reg orig="de-|generacy">degeneracy</reg>.</p>
<p>By what process of reflection I became thus, you shall <lb/>
speedily know; yet can you be at a loss to imagine it? <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">You,</hi> who have passed through somewhat similar changes; <lb/>
who always made allowances for the temerity of youth; <lb/>
the fascinations of novelty; who always predicted that a few <lb/>
more years; the events of my peculiar destiny; the leisure <lb/>
of my long voyage; and that goodness of intention to which <lb/>
you were ever kind enough to admit my claims, would <reg orig="ul-|timately">ultimately</reg> <lb/>
provide the remedy for all errors and evils, and <lb/>
make me worthy of the undivided love of all good men;&mdash; <lb/>
You, who have had this experience, and who have always <lb/>
regarded me in this light, will not wonder that reflection has, <lb/>
at length, raised me to the tranquil and steadfast height of <lb/>
simple and true piety.</p>
<pb n="232" entity="eaf033v4_0245" pid="uva-lib:350254"/>
<p>Such, my friend, were my inducements to return; but <lb/>
first, it was necessary to explain, by letter, to Holtz&mdash;but <lb/>
my messenger is at the door, eager to be gone. Take <lb/>
this, my friend. Bring yourself or send back by the same <lb/>
messenger, without a moment's delay, tidings of her, and <lb/>
of your safety. As to me, be not much concerned on <lb/>
my account. I am solemnly assured by my surgeon, that <lb/>
nothing but time, and a tranquil mind are necessary to <reg orig="re-|store">restore</reg> <lb/>
me to health. The last boon no hand but yours can <lb/>
confer on your</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">And</hi> are you then alive? Are you then returned? Still <lb/>
do you remember, still love the ungrateful and capricious <lb/>
Jane? Have you indeed come back to sooth her almost <lb/>
broken heart; to rescue her from the grave; to cheer her <lb/>
with the prospect of peaceful and bright days yet to come?</p>
<p>O my full heart! Sorrow has not hitherto been able quite <lb/>
to burst this frail tenement. I almost fear that joy,&mdash;so <lb/>
strange to me <hi rend="italic">is</hi> joy, and so far, so <hi rend="italic">very</hi> far, beyond my <reg orig="no-|tions">notions</reg> <lb/>
of possibility was your return&mdash;I almost fear that joy <lb/>
will do what sorrow was unable to do.</p>
<p>Can it be that Colden&mdash;that self-same, dear, pensive face; <lb/>
those eyes, benignly and sweetly mild; and that heart-<reg orig="dis-|solving">dissolving</reg> <lb/>
voice, have escaped so many storms; so many <reg orig="dan-|gers">dangers</reg>? <lb/>
Was it love for me that led you from the extremity <lb/>
of the world, and have you, indeed, brought back with you <lb/>
a heart full of "ineffable tenderness" for <hi rend="italic">me?</hi></p>
<p>Unspeakably unworthy am I of your love. Time and <lb/>
grief, dear Hal, have bereft me of the glossy hues, the <lb/>
laughing graces which your doating judgment once <reg orig="as-|cribed">ascribed</reg> <lb/>
to me. But what will not the joy of your return <lb/>
effect? I already feel lightsome and buoyant as a bird. My <lb/>
head is giddy; but, alas, you are not well. Yet, you <lb/>
<pb n="233" entity="eaf033v4_0246" pid="uva-lib:350255"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">21</fw></pb>
assure us, not dangerously sick. Nothing, did you not say, <lb/>
but time and repose necessary to heal you? Will not my <lb/>
presence, my nursing, hasten thy restoration? Tuesday <reg orig="eve-|ning&mdash;they">evening&mdash;they</reg> <lb/>
say it can't possibly be sooner&mdash;I am with you. <lb/>
No supporters shall you have but my arms; no pillow but <lb/>
my breast. Every holy rite shall instantly be called in <lb/>
to make us one. And when once united, nothing but death <lb/>
shall ever part us again. What did I say? Death itself, at <lb/>
least <hi rend="italic">thy</hi> death, shall never dissever that bond.</p>
<p>Your brother will take this. Your sister&mdash;she is the most <lb/>
excellent of women, and worthy to be your sister&mdash;She and <lb/>
I will follow him tomorrow. He will tell you much, which <lb/>
my hurried spirits will not allow me to tell you in this letter. <lb/>
He knows every thing. He has been a brother, since my <lb/>
mother's death&mdash;She is dead, Henry. She died in my arms; <lb/>
and will it not give you pleasure to know, that her dying <lb/>
lips blessed me, and expressed the hope that you would <lb/>
one day return to find, in my authorized love, some <reg orig="re-|compense">recompense</reg> <lb/>
for all the evils, to which her antipathies subjected <lb/>
you? She hoped, indeed, that observation and experience <lb/>
would detect the fallacy of your former tenets; that you <lb/>
would become wise, not in speculation only, but in practice, <lb/>
and be, in every respect, deserving of the happiness and <lb/>
honor which would attend the gift of her daughter's hand <lb/>
and heart.</p>
<p>My words cannot utter, but thy own heart perhaps can <lb/>
conceive the rapture, which thy confession of a change in <lb/>
thy opinions has afforded me. <hi rend="italic">All</hi> my prayers, Henry, have <lb/>
not been <hi rend="italic">merely</hi> for your return. Indeed, whatever might <lb/>
have been the dictates, however absolute the dominion of <lb/>
passion, union with you would have been <hi rend="italic">very</hi> far from <reg orig="com-|pleting">completing</reg> <lb/>
my felicity, unless our hopes and opinions, as well <lb/>
as our persons and hearts were united. Now can I look <lb/>
up with confidence and exultation to the shade of my <lb/>
revered and beloved mother. Now can I safely invoke her <lb/>
presence and her blessing on a union, which death will <lb/>
have no power to dissolve. O, what sweet peace, what <lb/>
serene transport is there in the persuasion, that the selected <lb/>
soul will continue forever to commune with <hi rend="italic">my</hi> soul, mingle <lb/>
with mine in its adoration of the same divine parent, and <reg orig="par-|take">partake</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="234" entity="eaf033v4_0247" pid="uva-lib:350256"/>
with me in every thought, in every emotion, both <hi rend="italic">here</hi> <lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">hereafter!</hi></p>
<p>Never, my friend, without <hi rend="italic">this</hi> persuasion, <hi rend="italic">never</hi> should I <lb/>
have known one moment of true happiness. Marriage, <reg orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg>, <lb/>
instead of losing its attractions, in consequence of <lb/>
your errors, drew thence only new recommendations. Since, <lb/>
with a zeal, a tenderness, and a faith like mine, my efforts <lb/>
to restore such a heart and such a reason as yours, could <lb/>
not fail of success, but <hi rend="italic">till</hi> that restoration were <reg orig="accomplish-|ed">accomplished</reg>, <lb/>
never, I repeat, should I have tasted repose even in <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">your</hi> arms.</p>
<p>Poor Miss Jessup! She is dead, Henry; yet not before <lb/>
she did thee and me poor justice. Her death-bed <reg orig="confes-|sion">confession</reg> <lb/>
removed my mother's fatal suspicions. This confession, <lb/>
and the perusal of all thy letters, and thy exile, which I <lb/>
afterwards discovered was known to her very early, though <lb/>
unsuspected by me till after her decease, brought her to <reg orig="re-|gard">regard</reg> <lb/>
thee with some compassion and some respect.</p>
<p>I can write no more; but must not conclude till I have <lb/>
offered thee the tenderest, most fervent vows of a heart that <lb/>
ever was and always will be <hi rend="italic">thine own.</hi> Witness,</p>
