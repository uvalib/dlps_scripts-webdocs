                        Legislation was approved – and signed by the Governor – which will exempt
                        the Medical Center from centralized information technology and
                        telecommunications procurement, planning, and oversight. Another bill which

                        for health insurance to part-time employees under certain conditions. Still

                    <p>In general, the President said, there was a recognition that
                        the long-term economic welfare of the state depends on having an educated
                        workforce. </p>
