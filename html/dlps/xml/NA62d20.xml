                <p>Addie discusses the use of pet names in the letters. She explains her decision to
                    begin teaching in East Claridon, Ohio. She thanks Charles for his recent gifts
                    to her and urges him to continue to write to Laura after Addie leaves for East
                    Claridon. Finally, Addie mentions the visit of Laura and the receipt of a letter
                    from John Chaffee.</p>

                <p> Do not think dear one<lb/> that I address you thus merely as a salutation for I
                    feel<lb/> that you <hi rend="underline">are precious</hi> to me. The reason<lb/>
                    that I write the word <q>"precious"</q> as I do,, your<lb/> apologies for
                        addressing <hi rend="underline">me</hi> by endearing <add place="inline"

                    was surprised<lb/> darling. almost pained when I read your letter<lb/> I had not
                    thought of confining myself to<lb/> the rules of etiquette when writing to you.
                    nor<lb/> do I think I ought: I always speak as I feel<lb/> and generally obey
                    the dictations of my heart;<lb/> Have I not done right? those that I loved <pb
                        n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0120"/> I always have my own form of addressing
                    them<lb/> by irrespective of etiquette. I love to be called<lb/> by pet names,,
                    shall I tell you what Hal and<lb/> papa used to call me: Hal's pet name<lb/> for
                    me was<q>"Birdie"</q> and father's (dont laugh<lb/> now)
                    was<q>"Whip-stalk,,"</q> When a child I was<lb/> very slender and quite tall,
                    hence papa called<lb/> me by that<q>"tender"</q> expression. I just asked<lb/>
                    father (he is here at aunties) if he remembers<lb/> what he used to call me. He
                    replied that he<lb/> did,, but does not think I am much of a<lb/> whip stalk
                    now. that I am now more of a chub. Ha ha<lb/> you say that not more than a week
                    passes<lb/> without writing to me. How strange! Last week I<lb/> received two
                    letters from you the first time I<lb/> have received one from you oftener
                    than<lb/> in ten days and sometimes much longer<lb/> for two months I
                    guess.<lb/> Charlie dear, would you <add place="inline" hand="h1">have</add>
                    thought me doing<lb/> right if I had engaged a school and<lb/> gone on -
                    commenced teaching &amp;c, without<lb/> speaking to you in regard to any
                    future<lb/> occupations? Truly you would not have <pb n="3"
                        entity="DSSR_000000766_0121"/> wished me to. You say "you found the
                    bitter<lb/> with <add place="inline" hand="h1">the</add> sweet" while teaching. I
                    have considered all<lb/> this but is it not always so in life; and should<lb/> I
                    not teach because I will find perhaps a few<lb/> unpleasant days? I think I
                    shall love teaching.</p>

                <p>Going to church prevented me from finishing<lb/> this last evening.
                        therefore<q>"monday morning"</q> has<lb/> to<q>"suffer"</q> Not a very
                    lovely morning either. for<lb/>
                    <q>"heaven is weeping"</q> and I tend to think quite sad.<lb/> Great drops
                    trickled down on the window panes, and<lb/> this<q>"romantic little stream"</q>
                    is rising swelling as<lb/> if anxious to escape from the bed which was made<lb/>
                    for it. The thought<q>"I pity the brave soldiers<lb/> to day"</q> was the first
                    that entered my mind<lb/> after awakening from a sweet and gentle sleep
                    this<lb/> morning. Bless God for sleep. Last night I was very<lb/> tired and
                    felt more than<q>"half sick"</q> but I feel<lb/> as well as ever this morning. I
                    scarcely know<lb/> which had the greatest effect in restoring me<lb/> my sleep
                    or my <hi rend="underline">dreams</hi>. Both took an active part<lb/>
                    <q>"I reckon"</q> Oh how sweet are dreams, but at<lb/> times they are horrific,
                    not often though <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0122"/> Dearest. I am again
                    called to thank you for<lb/> your splendid gift the Cross Lanes battle.<ref

                    <orig reg="beautiful">How beaut</orig>-<lb/> iful! and how
                    kind<unclear>[in]</unclear> you to send it. Thanks seem<lb/> almost as insults
                    now. you have presented me with<lb/> so many gifts but may God spare you my
                    own<lb/> and I will strive to reward you. I love gifts!<lb/> Now do not think
                    dearest that I love you<lb/> for your gifts far from it dear. I love you
                    for<lb/> yourself alone. for your true and noble heart.<lb/> Oh Charlie when I
                    listen to Hallie's remarks of you<lb/> and hear him mention some of your noble
                    acts how<lb/> my heart warms with love and - may Heaven<lb/> forgive me - pride.
                    It is then I feel how unworthy<lb/> I am of you and then I wonder if it is
                    right<lb/> for me to love you as I do love. Darling<lb/> strange thoughts enter
                    my mind at times. Emblematic of<lb/> the<q>"strange girl"</q>of whom I have
                    heretofore written.<lb/> Do you not think so. But I will tire you if I<lb/>
                    write thus. Laura is here in front of me and<lb/> on the floor with her back
                    supported by the wall.<lb/> Sober little Deacon! Charlie I wish you were
                    here<lb/> to "shore her up" My fear is getting to rundown<lb/> to affect her and
                    I do not like to see her so<lb/> sad. When I go to Claridon you must write
                    her<lb/> great long letters and cheerful ones too. She loves<lb/> your letters
                    very much. Who would not.<lb/> Auntie wishes me to ask you if have had your
                    revenge<lb/> for the Cross Lanes defeat. John Chafee<ref target="n2" n="2"
                    >2</ref> wrote home<lb/> that he had. But time forbids that I should<lb/> write
                    longer. Regards to the boys, &amp;c Write real<lb/> often. I think I told
                    you<lb/> to write to East Claridon did I not? </p>
