<p>WRITTEN ORIGINALLY WITH NO VIEW to publication, but merely in
answer to "a paper containing sundry inquiries" received in 1781
from M. de Barb&eacute;-Marbois, secretary of the French Legation in
Philadelphia, Thomas Jefferson's <hi rend="italic">Notes on Virginia</hi> (1785)
contained a frank exposition of his views in favor of the revision
of the constitution of that state and the abolition of slavery. The
author was fully aware that these views differed radically from
those held by many of his American contemporaries and might provoke
to no useful purpose bitter controversy, if freely advocated in
print.<ref target="f001.01.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>  For this reason, the
<hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>, which were first printed in Paris during the latter
part of 1784 and the first months of 1785,
<ref target="f001.01.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>  came off

<pb n="001.006"/>

the press in a limited edition of 200 copies bearing no author's
name and intended strictly for private distribution. Jefferson took
great care to write on the fly leaf of every copy presented to
friends a note enjoining them not to communicate the book to anyone
who could not be relied upon to protect it against publication. Yet
it was not long before he made the painful discovery that, at the
death of one of the recipients, a copy had fallen into the hands of
the bookseller Barrois, who was now planning to publish "a
surreptitious translation." "This," Jefferson wrote to C. W. F.
Dumas on February 2, 1786, "has induced me to yield to a friendly
proposition from the Abb&eacute; Morellet, to translate and publish
them, submitting the sheets previously to my inspection. As a
translation by so able a hand will lessen the faults of the
original, instead of their being multiplied by a hireling
translator, I shall add to it a map and such other advantages as
may prevent the mortification of my
seeing it in the injurious form threatened."<ref
target="f001.01.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> </p>




<p>From a letter which Jefferson wrote to his friend Madison a few
days later, we not only learn that Morellet had owned a copy of the
<hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> which had been presented to him by their author, but
also that he had already translated "some passages for a particular
purpose" before anything was known about Barrois's plan.<ref
target="f001.01.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref>  It was therefore natural that he should
have agreed with the bookseller to prepare for him a translation of
the entire book if he would refuse to publish the other version. As
for Jefferson, he really had no choice but to accept such an
arrangement, although he had never intended to have his work
translated into French. He lived in an age when authors enjoyed no
effective protection against unscrupulous printers.</p>


<p>The fact that Jefferson had given Morellet a copy of the

<pb n="001.007"/>

<hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> shows that he held him in very high esteem. Morellet
and Franklin were habitu&eacute;s of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'Auteuil
composed of men of letters who met at the home of Mme.
Helv&eacute;tius.<ref target="f001.01.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>  Jefferson
probably
met the Abb&eacute; through Franklin, who, as we know, introduced his
American colleague to many prominent literary personages in the
French capital.<ref target="f001.01.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref>  Morellet enjoyed
great prestige in intellectual circles. His sharp wit led Voltaire
to make a pun on his name and call him "l'Abb&eacute; Mord-les,"
"Abb&eacute; Bites-Them." In 1785, he was elected to the French
Academy, the highest honor to which a man of letters could aspire.
Jefferson knew, of course, that he had not only published in 1766
a translation of Beccaria's famous treatise <hi rend="italic">Dei Delitti e delle
Pene</hi>, for which Voltaire had written an anonymous preface, but
that he had also translated in 1774 John Gregory's highly popular
book, <hi rend="italic">A Father's Legacy to his
Daughters</hi>, and revised a French version of William Robertson's
<hi rend="italic">History of Scotland</hi> published in Paris in 1764.<ref
target="f001.01.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref>  Since Jefferson was uninformed about
the careless way in which the delicate art of translation was
generally practised at that time and took it for granted that
others set for themselves the same high standards which he always
imposed upon himself, it is not surprising that he should have
fallen into the error of believing Morellet eminently qualified to
render the <hi rend="italic">Notes on Virginia</hi> into French.</p>




<p>One should like to follow the progress of the translation from
the time it was begun for Barrois until it was completed.
Unfortunately, we have little documentation on this subject. Our
information has to be derived almost entirely from six

<pb n="001.008"/>

letters dated only by days of the week and all of them from
Morellet to Jefferson.<ref target="f001.01.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref>  From these,
we gather, however, a few details which are not without interest.
On one occasion, Morellet sends Jefferson a few pages of his French
text to find out from him whether he has understood well the trend
of his thought.<ref target="f001.01.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref>  At some other
time, he returns pages which have been of help to him in correcting
his translation. Although the context is vague, he is apparently
referring to notes or comments which Jefferson had transmitted to
him on specific details of translation.<ref
target="f001.01.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref>  In another letter,
Morellet tries to
justify the way he had rendered the phrase "a knowledge of the
first order.<ref target="f001.01.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> " On three different
occasions, he comes back to the subject of the printing and
engraving of the map of Virginia which both he and Jefferson
considered an indispensable supplement to the
book.<ref target="f001.01.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref>  From remarks to be found
in
Morellet's letters, it seems clear that he did not first translate
the entire book before transmitting his manuscript to the printer,
but sent him from time to time a certain number of pages, which had
been previously submitted to Jefferson for his examination.</p>






<p>The translation of the <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> appeared with the
following
title page: Observations| sur | La Virginie, | Par M. J***. |
Traduites de L'Anglois. | A Paris, | Chez Barrois, l'a&icirc;n&eacute;,
Libraire, rue du | Hurepoix, pr&egrave;s le pont Saint-Michel. | 1786.
It should be noted that the title-page did not bear the name of the
translator, and carried only the initial of Jefferson's name. The
book was published with a new map of Virginia prepared by the
author.<ref target="f001.01.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> </p>


<p>Although the translation appeared with the imprint of

<pb n="001.009"/>

1786, and this date has been accepted as that of publication by
bibliographers as well as students of Jefferson, actually it was
not published until the following year. In a letter to the English
bookseller, John Stockdale, dated February 1, 1787, and dealing
with the publication of an edition of the <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> in London,
Jefferson wrote: "I never did intend to have made them public,
because they are little interesting to the rest of the world, but
as a translation of them is coming out, I have concluded to let the
original appear also."<ref target="f001.01.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref>  While we
cannot determine the exact week or month Morellet's translation was
actually published, we know that it came out during the first part
of 1787, since the <hi rend="italic">Mercure de France</hi> published a long
review
of it in its issues of June 2 and 9 of that year.<ref
target="f001.01.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> </p>



<p>The book as it appeared in print, with the exception of the map,
had little which could appeal to a man of such exacting taste and
high literary standards as Jefferson. It was printed on paper of
mediocre quality; the type was not attractive; there were numerous
misprints and errors of translation, and the order of the material
had been changed.</p>

<p>In the <hi rend="italic">Avertissement</hi>, Morellet explained the reason
which
had induced him to transpose parts of the text from the place where
they occurred in the original to a different one in the
translation. He wrote:

<q>"L'Ouvrage qu'on donne ici au Public a &eacute;t&eacute;
imprim&eacute; en
1782 [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], sous le titre de <hi rend="italic">Notes on Virginia</hi>,
&amp;
n'est en effet qu'un recueil de Notes, ou Observations
d&eacute;tach&eacute;es, servant de r&eacute;ponse aux Questions d'un
ami de
l'Auteur, Europ&eacute;en qui cherchoit &agrave; connoitre cette partie
des
&Eacute;tats-Unis; mais on ne craint pas d'annoncer que sous un titre
si modeste, le Lecteur trouvera des connoissances approfondies &amp;
des id&eacute;es &eacute;tendues.</q>

<q>"L'Ouvrage n'ayant d'autre plan que celui qu'a donn&eacute; l'ordre
des Questions, qui n'est pas toujours le plus naturel

<pb n="001.010"/>

qu'on p&ucirc;t suivre, le Traducteur a pris la libert&eacute;, avec
l'agr&eacute;ment de l'Auteur, de transposer quelques morceaux."<ref
target="f001.01.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> </q></p>


<p>Morellet's explanation contains factual errors which must have
irked the author considerably. The <hi rend="italic">Notes on Virginia</hi> were
not published in 1782 as stated by the translator, but in 1785,
even if the title-page of the Paris edition bore the imprint of
1782. Jefferson and Barb&eacute;-Marbois exchanged letters, but the
relationship which existed between them was not such that they can
be called friends. Moreover, if Jefferson ever agreed to the
changes made in the order of the text of the <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>, it must
have been most reluctantly and only under very great pressure since
he later expressed unequivocal disapproval of the transpositions
made by the translator.<ref target="f001.01.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> </p>


<p>Morellet lists the most important of these changes and adds that
nothing has been omitted from the original. The seventh query of
the original devoted to the study of the climate has become the
second chapter of the translation.<ref target="f001.01.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref>
The ninth and tenth queries of the English text dealing with
military forces on land<ref target="f001.01.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref>  and
sea<ref target="f001.01.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref>  have been placed towards the
end of the book after the last paragraph of the part concerning
public income and expenses. The proposal for the emancipation of
the Negroes, which, in the original, came under the heading "Plan
for the revision of our constitution"<ref target="f001.01.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref>
has been transferred
to the section
devoted to the slaves.<ref target="f001.01.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref>  The
observations

<pb n="001.011"/>

communicated to Jefferson by his friend Charles Thomson after
reading the manuscript no longer appear in an appendix at the end
of the book, but are printed in the text after the passages to
which they refer. They are set off from Jefferson's text by square
brackets. Jefferson's notes have been removed from the bottom of
the page and printed also in the text. The translator justifies
this change by saying that Thomson's notes are comments on those of
Jefferson, which seem to be related closely enough to the text to
form a connected sequence with it. "This is," Morellet adds, "the
way notes should always be, if by following this rule, one were not
dispensed from writing any."</p>






<p>However objectionable all these changes were to Jefferson, the
presence of numerous misprints and errors in the translation was
undoubtedly a still greater source of disappointment to him. As is
well known to bibliographers, not one, but two errata lists
entirely different in their contents were printed, the second as a
cancellans after the sheets had been impressed. One of these lists
is only nine lines long, while the other covers approximately two
pages and a half.<ref target="f001.01.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref> </p>


<p>Among its rich collections of Jeffersoniana, the Alderman
Library of the University of Virginia possesses two copies of the
French translation of the <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>; one of these, in the Byrd
collection, contains the short errata list, the other, in the
McGregor collection, the long one. An interesting feature of the
Byrd copy is that a large number of manuscript corrections in ink
and in an eighteenth-century hand are to be found in its text.<ref
target="f001.01.24" n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref>  None of the corrections in the short
errata list appears

<pb n="001.012"/>

among the notations in ink which are to be seen in this copy. An
examination of these manuscript corrections and the long errata
list shows, on the other hand, that all passages corrected in that
list&mdash;and eleven others not to be found there&mdash;have also been
corrected in the Byrd copy. Except in three cases, the French word
or phrase written in ink in the text as a correction of an error of
translation is the same as the one given at the corresponding place
in the long errata list.</p>


<p>On the basis of the information which we have used up to this
point, if it were not for the bibliographical evidence of the
cancellation made in the final gathering in order to substitute the
longer form, one might conclude that the long errata list was
printed first, the shorter one later to supplement it.<ref
target="f001.01.25" n="25"><hi rend="super">25</hi></ref>  As
for the notations in ink, we might
argue that they were written into the Byrd copy by some
contemporary who had access to the long list. The presence of
corrections in ink not to be found in the long list might be
explained as the result of a very careful examination of the
original and the translation, although it would be difficult to
explain why none of the errata indicated in the short list are
corrected in the notations in ink.</p>


<p>There exists, however, a little known document which throws a
vivid light on the history of the errata lists and the manuscript
notations in the Byrd copy, and which illuminates the
bibliographical evidence. In the Jefferson Papers at the Library of
Congress, is to be found a seven-page letter press copy of a
memorandum written in Jefferson's hand, which is

<pb n="001.013"/>

dated January 19, 1787, and entitled "Errors in the Abb&eacute;
Morellet's translation of the Notes on Virginia the correction of

<p>In this memorandum, the English passages containing
typographical errors, or words or phrases the translation of which
Jefferson questioned, and the corresponding passage of the French
text are presented in parallel columns. The English word or phrase
which he considered wrongly translated and its French equivalent
are in many cases underlined. A comparison of the contents of this
document with those of the two errata lists provides an interesting
revelation. Whereas none of the six errata in the short list is to
be found in the memorandum, every one of the forty-five in the long
list is included among the seventy errors which Jefferson recorded.
It is clear that his memorandum was prepared after the short errata
list had been printed. It would be indeed difficult to explain how
Jefferson would have failed to notice and write down any of the
errata indicated in it, if his list had been intended to supplement
it. The fact that the person who prepared the long errata list did
not find anything to correct which is not also found in Jefferson's
memorandum points to an interesting conclusion.</p>

<p>Since a comparison of the original and the translation of the
<hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> shows many errors which Jefferson did not record, it
seems impossible that the translator could have failed to discover
at least a few misprints or evident errors of translation not
listed in the memorandum, if he had made even a half-hearted
attempt at preparing as accurate as possible an errata list. One is
forced to conclude that whoever prepared the second errata list had
at his disposal the original of Jefferson's memorandum and relied
exclusively on it. The absence from that list of twenty-five
corrections requested by the author in his memorandum does not
invalidate that conclusion. In some instances, Morellet may have
been convinced that his translation was

<pb n="001.014"/>

correct. In others, he may have considered the error not important
enough to warrant a correction, or he may have been unable to find
an adequate substitute for what he had originally written.
Moreover, he would naturally be inclined to shorten as much as
possible a long list of errata which could only raise doubts as to
the value of his translation. Finally, he may have failed to make
all suggested corrections through sheer carelessness or
indifference. In this connection, it should be pointed out that,
when preparing the first errata list&mdash;the short one&mdash;he did not
read proof much beyond page 99, since the last erratum which he
recorded occurs on that page.<ref target="f001.01.27" n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref>  It
can be taken for granted that, if it had not been for Jefferson, no
other list would have ever appeared. One should not fail to add,
however, that if Jefferson was most unfortunate in having Morellet
as a translator, Morellet was equally unfortunate in choosing to
translate the <hi rend="italic">Notes on Virginia</hi>. It was not customary for
authors to be in a position to exercise such close supervision over their
translators.</p>


<p>There is still another interesting problem connected with the
long errata list. Of the fifty-six manuscript notations in the Byrd
copy, all without a single exception are corrections requested by
Jefferson in his memorandum, and, as already stated, only in three
cases does the wording of these notations vary from that of the
corresponding entry in the long errata list. It is again clear that
the writer of these notations had access to Jefferson's list.
Morellet's name comes at once to one's mind as the probable writer
of the manuscript notations. Unfortunately, we have no means of
tracing the history of the Byrd copy. Moreover, with the exception
of three notations, the longest of which is three lines, the
corrections written on the various pages all consist of three or
four words at the most. Their briefness makes it impossible for one
who is not an expert

<pb n="001.015"/>

in handwriting to draw any valid conclusion from a comparison of
the hand in which they are written and that of the Morellet letters
in the Jefferson Papers. Yet, to me, they present a number of
common characteristics. But whether the corrections in the Byrd
copy were written by Morellet or someone else, there can be no
doubt that whoever wrote them had access to Jefferson's list.</p>

<p>Because of the interest of this list and its inaccessibility to
the average student, it is printed here in full. Peculiarities of
spelling and punctuation found in the letter press copy have been
retained, with the exception, however, of Jefferson's spelling of
the French preposition <hi rend="italic">&agrave;</hi> as <hi rend="italic">&aacute;</hi>,
which has been

on June 7, 1785, in which he gives the French author permission to
translate for the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Physique</hi> sections of the
<hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> which might be of interest to the editors, but adds:
"The strictures on slavery and on the constitution of Virginia are
not of that kind, and they are parts which I do not want to have
made public, at least till I know whether their publication would
do most harm or good. It is possible that in my own country these
strictures might produce an irritation which would indispose the
people towards the two great objects I have in view, that is the
emancipation of their slaves &amp; the settlement of their
constitution on a firmer &amp; more permanent basis. If I learn from
thence, that they will not produce that effect, I have printed &amp;
reserved just copies enough to be able to give one to every young
man at the College. It is to them I look, the rising generation,
and not to the one in
power, for these great reformations." <hi rend="italic">The Writings of Thomas

of a 2-leaf fold. Leaf Bb4, the original list, was cancelled, and

Public Printers</name>
<hi rend="italic">Transcribed, with a Foreword, by</hi>

</head>
  <div2 id="vol001.02.01" type="section" n="1">

<p>THE DEARTH OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE early public
printers of the
United States has been commented on often enough; and, were it not
for the pioneer listing of Greely,<ref target="f001.02.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
the historian and the bibliographer alike would be lost in the
morass of miscellaneous official and semi-official leaves and
pamphlets which poured from the American presses during the first
fourteen Congresses.</p>


<p>Since the following heretofore unpublished letters shed
considerable light on the printing practices of the first days of
the Republic, they are transcribed in full. They have not been
burdened with notes concerning the writers, since such information
is readily available in standard reference works.<ref
target="f001.02.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>  They
comprise the earliest group of a
collection of letters in the Executive and Foreign Affairs section
of the National Archives, entitled "Laws of the United States and
Related Papers 1789-1923," and are contained in a portfolio of
letters to the Secretaries of State, concerning the printing of
laws, 1789-1822. In

<pb n="001.028"/>

addition to fourteen letters to Jefferson, eleven of which are from
printers, presented here are a letter from the printing
establishment of Childs and to Remsen, chief clerk at the State
Department for two years under Jefferson, and a document, signed by
Jefferson, to the Department of State, which confers his official
approval on an edition of the "Laws of the United States of
America," printed by Andrew Brown in Philadelphia, 1792. The
remaining three letters to Jefferson recommend printers; one, from
Jabez Bowen, recommends Bennett Wheeler; another, from William
Bingham, recommends Andrew Brown; and the third, from David Sewall,
recommends Benjamin Titcomb, Jr. One other unpublished Jefferson
letter from the Library of Congress collection is printed in a
footnote, because it supplements the correspondence with Benjamin
Russell.</p>


<p>This group is of special interest because of the information
contained therein concerning printing prices current, and the
indication, evinced by the letters of application and the letters
"recommendatory," that much competition was called forth by the
prestige accruing to those printers who were fortunate enough to
obtain the coveted privilege of printing the federal laws. David
Sewall's effort to get some political patronage for the State of
Maine is also worthy of note.</p>

Discouragements, particularly in the Countenance afforded and
continued to an antifederal Competitor (who obtruded himself with
a printing Apparatus sold by me, <hi rend="italic">under an express Stipulation

relinquish my typographical Concern, and adopt, if within the
Compass of my Power, some other Line of Business, more adequate to
the Support of a

surrender to my said Competitor the Remains of a small Business,
established with much Toil, Care and Expence; but should the
Measure eventually take Place, your Excellency will be enabled to
account for my Paper not arriving at your Office.</p>

<p>With the highest Consideration for your Excellency's Character

in which you hold so distinguished a Station, I have the Honour to
be, very respectfully, your Excellency's obedient and devoted

publisher of the laws of the United States,<ref

<p>This is considerably under what I have hitherto had from the

<p>In compliance with your request communicated by
M<hi rend="super">r</hi>. Remsen,
that I would furnish you with an estimate of the expense that will
attend the publication of the laws of the United States in my
paper; and the lowest price for which I will perform the work; I
beg permission to inform your Honour, that the Laws of the second
session inserted by your order amount to Three Hundred and
Seventy-two<ref target="f001.02.00" n="*"><hi rend="super">*</hi></ref>  <hi rend="italic">Squares</hi>

of
Long-Primer. These at <hi rend="italic">half a dollar</hi> a square, amount to One
Hundred and Eighty-six dollars. The price paid for publishing the
Laws of this Commonwealth, in Long-Primer squares, has been
reduced, on account of the competition of the Printers for the
Printing work of government, which in some of its branches, is
lucrative, from One Dollar to Half a Dollar&mdash;The price, therefore,
that I have inserted, is regulated by the price given by this
State&mdash;Your Honour's information will enable you to judge whether
it is too high or not
high enough.</p>


<p>With me, Sir, compensation is &lt;not the&gt; first object, in the
publication of the La&lt;ws&gt; of the United States; and while I
earnestly solicit the continuation of your patronage; I shall rest
satisfied, should I be so fortunate as to obtain it, with such
allowance as you shall think just to make.</p>

customs of the United States, to receive, on my behalf, such sum as
shall be allowed for my services.</p>

<p>BIBLIOGRAPHERS OF THE PERIOD OF THE English Restoration
have for
years associated the imprint phrase "In the Savoy" with presswork
issuing from the King's Printing House. They have not, however,
recognized the value of the phrase in identifying the printers of
a large number of proclamations and books, especially plays, whose
title-page imprints carry "In the Savoy" but fail to name the
printer. Consequently they have not attempted what this note tries
tentatively to do; that is, to set down the history of the phrase
and to distinguish among the seventeenth and early
eighteenth-century printers who used it.</p>

<p>The Savoy was a large, sprawling structure situated in the
Strand next to Somerset House and almost directly opposite the New
Exchange. It was built originally in 1245 by Peter, Earl of Savoy,
from whom it received its name. In the Restoration its ample
apartments served as quarters for not only the King's Printing
Press but also a prison; a parish church; religious assembly halls
for the English dissenters, the French, Dutch, High Germans, and
Lutherans; and a hospital harboring the poor. The Savoy fell into
disuse and ruin late in the eighteenth century and was razed early
in the nineteenth to clear the approach to Waterloo Bridge.</p>

<p>The location in the Savoy of the King's Printing Office

<pb n="001.042"/>

dates probably from the early weeks of September, 1666, when the
great fire of London destroyed along with Baynard's Castle the
neighboring shop of Thomas Newcombe, the printer of the <hi rend="italic">London
Gazette</hi> and the more active of the two printers working for the
King under the patent held by the assigns of John Bill and
Christopher Barker. The last extant issue of the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>
which Newcombe signed with his Baynard Castle address is dated
August 30, 1666; the issue of September 3, Number 84, is lacking in
files of the news-sheet and was presumably destroyed by the fire.
If we are to believe J. G. Muddiman, the next issue of the
<hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> to appear, that of September 10, "Newcombe was
compelled to print . . . in the open air, in the evil-smelling
churchyard of the Savoy, choked with the bodies of the dead from
the plague."<ref target="f001.03.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>  The imprint of this
issue, however, reads simply "London, Printed by Tho. Newcomb."</p>


<p>The exact date on which the King's Printing Office was moved to
the Savoy, therefore, remains in doubt, but there can be no
question about the fact that by November 8, 1666, Newcombe and the
patentees of the King's Press had decided to make the Savoy their
permanent quarters; for on that date Newcombe first used the
imprint phrase "In the Savoy" on two different publications printed
in his shop. One was the issue of the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi> dated
November 8, 1666; the other was the King's proclamation
"prohibiting the importation of all sorts of manufactures" printed
"By the Assigns of John Bill and Christopher Barker" and likewise
dated November 8, 1666.<ref target="f001.03.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> </p>


<p>From November 8, 1666, to July 19, 1688, the imprints on issues
of the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi> run in an unbroken succession:
"Printed by Tho. Newcomb in the Savoy." The forty-four entries in
vol. 1 of Wing's <hi rend="italic">S.T.C.</hi> bearing the imprint "In the Savoy by

Thomas Newcombe . . ." are similarly distributed

<pb n="001.043"/>

through the years from 1667 to 1688. No imprint containing "In the
Savoy" is linked with any printer's name other than Newcombe's
during those years, and no imprint bearing the name of Thomas
Newcombe or the Assigns of Thomas Newcombe after 1688 contains the
phrase "In the Savoy." The later Wing volumes will, of course, have
to be checked in order to verify these findings, but in the light
of the specific corroborative evidence furnished by the <hi rend="italic">London
Gazette</hi> imprints, there is little likelihood that any
additional data uncovered will change the terminal dates of
Newcombe's printing activity in the Savoy. Further, an examination
of a substantial number of the publications bearing Savoy imprints
without Newcombe's name printed between those terminal dates
reveals the presence of ornaments and decorative capitals clearly
identifiable as Newcombe's. Those books lacking ornaments present
a typography in no way inconsistent with the assumption that
Newcombe was the printer.
Thus one may conclude with reasonable certainty that any
proclamation or book with a Savoy imprint published between
November 8, 1666, and July 19, 1688, came from the presses of
Thomas Newcombe.</p>

<p>That conclusion, however, needs one qualification. Sometime
between December 21, 1681, and January 11, 1681/2, Thomas Newcombe,
Sr., died, and his son, Thomas Newcombe, Jr., also free of the
Stationers' Company and presumably working with his father,
inherited the business and assumed his father's
responsibilities.<ref target="f001.03.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref>  Although the
clerk of the Stationers' Company was making a distinction between
father and son in <hi rend="italic">Stationers' Register</hi> entries as early as
October 27, 1677, no Newcombe imprint either in the <hi rend="italic">London
Gazette</hi> or in vol. 1 of Wing's <hi rend="italic">S.T.C.</hi> makes the
differentiation. Further, Thomas Newcombe, Sr., appears to have
been actively engaged in his work almost to the end of his life,
for his last entry in the <hi rend="italic">Stationers' Register</hi> occurred on
December 5, 1681. Therefore it

<pb n="001.044"/>

seems safe to conclude, finally, that all material containing the
imprint phrase "In the Savoy" printed between November 8, 1666, and
December, 1681, was issued by Thomas Newcombe, Sr., and all
material signed "In the Savoy" and printed between January, 1681/2
and July 19, 1688, came from the presses of Thomas Newcombe, Jr.
Only a check of Wing's later volumes will determine whether the
second Thomas Newcombe or any succeeding Savoy printer issued
imprints carrying the phrase "In the Savoy" without his name. All
eighty-seven imprint citations of this special sort gathered so far
fall within the dates assigned exclusively to Thomas Newcombe,
Sr.</p>


<p>The imprint of the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi> for July 23, 1688,
links the Savoy phrase for the first time with a printer named
Edward Jones. The explanation for his replacing the younger Thomas
Newcombe as the King's Printer midway during the year of the
"Bloodless Revolution" is almost certainly political. Plomer states
that Bill, Hills, and Newcombe were obliged to retire in favor of
Jones "on the accession of William" because they had printed the
declaration made by James 11 against the Prince of Orange.<ref
 target="f001.03.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref>  Plomer's argument may be sound, but the
date of the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi> first bearing Jones' name
indicates clearly that Jones had taken over the duties of the
King's Printer some months before William's Tor Bay landing on
November 5, 1688.</p>


<p>Whatever the political maneuvering was that led finally to
Jones' gaining the patent as printer to the King, the fact is that
from July 23, 1688, until February 18, 1705/6, two days after
Jones' death, the imprints on issues of the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi>
read without deviation: "Printed by Edw. Jones, in the Savoy." And
thirty-two of the thirty-three entries in the first volume of
Wing's <hi rend="italic">S.T.C.</hi> containing the Savoy phrase dated from 1688
to
1700 are signed by Edward Jones.</p>

<p>The single Wing entry (C6729) linking the phrase "In the

<pb n="001.045"/>

Savoy" with another printer's name is Thomas Coxe's <hi rend="italic">A
Topographical, Ecclesiastical and Natural History of Great
Britain</hi>. In the Savoy: by Eliz. Nutt: and sold by M. Nutt . .
. and J. Morphew . . ., 1700. 4&deg; O[xford: Bodleian]. Further
investigation of this volume has revealed that Wing's imprint
citation is accurate; the difficulty rests with the patently
incorrect date "MDCC", which occurred as a result either of a
typesetter's error or of someone's deliberate attempt at false
dating. The text following this title-page in the Bodleian copy and
in others similarly dated<ref target="f001.03.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>  is
typographically in the same style as portions of the text of Thomas
Coxe's <hi rend="italic">Magna Britannia</hi> (6 vols.) printed in the Savoy by
Eliz. Nutt some twenty years later in 1720-1731.</p>


<p>Following Edward Jones' death, "M. Jones," apparently Jones'
widow, undertook to manage the Queen's Press and to print the
<hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi>. The news-sheet imprints indicate that her
tenure of office extended from February 21, 1705/6, until February
26, 1707/8, after which Jacob Tonson, Jr., assumed the publication
of the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi> at his Gray's Inn shop, and J. Nutt,
who had served Edward Jones in 1700 and 1703 as the retail
bookseller for two of Jones' publications,<ref
 target="f001.03.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref>  began
operating the Savoy presses. Thus
one may conclude that all publications containing the imprint
phrase "In the Savoy" printed between July 23, 1688, and February
18, 1705/6, were the presswork of Edward Jones, and all material
bearing the Savoy phrase between February 23, 1705/6, and February
26, 1707/8, came from the presses of M. Jones.</p>


<p>The evidence for determining the Savoy printers after 1708 is
too sketchy to warrant any definite conclusions. The history
reconstructed from scattered statements in Plomer's
 <hi rend="italic">Dictionaries</hi><ref target="f001.03.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref>

<pb n="001.046"/>

reveals that the Office of Queen's or King's Printer passed
successively from one member of the Nutt family to another. After
J. Nutt's death in 1710(?), Benjamin Nutt seems to have held office
in the Savoy. He was followed in 1720 by Elizabeth Nutt, whom
Plomer conjectures to be J. Nutt's widow. Sometime in 1724 she, in
turn, joined Richard Nutt in a partnership which lasted until 1738.
Thereafter, until his death in 1780 when the King's Printing Office
was moved from the Savoy to new quarters, Richard Nutt appears to
have signed all imprints bearing the phrase "In the Savoy" with his
name.</p>

<p>DURING SOME PERIODS IN THE EIGHTEENTH century it is
difficult to
decide just what constituted a piracy. The established, prosperous
members of the Trade, who owned the most valuable literary
properties, such as Shakespeare and Milton, were loudly insisting
that the copyright statute of 1709 had had no adverse effect upon
their perpetual rights in these properties. This view was strongly
contested by the small fry among publishers, who took the position
that the Act had put an end to perpetual copyright and hence that
these old authors lay in the public domain. Now and again one of
the little men ventured to publish Shakespeare or Milton, was hotly
denounced by the 'proprietor' as a pirate, and as hotly denied the
charge. But this controversy arose only after 1731, for the Act of
1709 was perfectly explicit in continuing the copyrights of old
books in the hands of their then possessors for the term of
twenty-one years from 25 April 1710. Any play of Shakespeare's
published during
this period by any stationer other than the Tonson firm or the
Wellington firm&mdash;the lawful proprietors of all of Shakespeare's
plays&mdash;was undeniably a piracy.</p>

<p>Three such piracies&mdash;the only ones known to me&mdash;form
the
subject of the present paper. But before we embark on the account
of these three little spurious Shakespeares it will

<pb n="001.050"/>

simplify matters to have before us a description of three other
Shakespeares&mdash;irreproachable publications of the lawful owners of
the copyrights, the Wellingtons:<ref target="f001.04.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>

  <p>Ford's bibliography<ref target="f001.04.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>  contains
three entries corresponding to these. It ought to contain six, for
there exist two editions of the 1723 <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, two of the 1724
<hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, and two of the 1729 <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> to which
the
foregoing descriptions would in each case apply equally well. That
Ford failed to recognize these duplicate editions is not to his
discredit, for the duplication is so close that even when the pairs
are seen together it is not easy at once to distinguish them. More
conspicuous differences than those which they present have been
overlooked in books of greater importance than these three
insignificant duodecimos. Not until very recently was it recognized
that the 1709 Rowe edition of Shakespeare and the 1765 Johnson
edition were each two editions, actually, instead of one. And these
pairs differ even as to collation. But their title-pages, their
format, their illustrations&mdash;the points ordinarily observed by
booksellers and
collectors&mdash;differ only in such trifling details as no one but a
prying bibliographer is likely to observe&mdash;or value.<ref
target="f001.04.03" n="3">3</ref>  This practice of making reprints
duplicate their first editions might reasonably be taken to explain
the reprints which we are now considering. A close examination of
these, however, reveals certain features which clearly show such an
explanation to be untenable and which suggest instead unlawful
publication and an intent to deceive. It will make the detailed
description of these features easier if we confine ourselves first
to one of the plays&mdash;the 1724 <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>. In this
description

<pb n="001.052"/>

I use the letters <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi> to designate the two
editions (in what I believe to be their correct order).</p>



<p><hi rend="italic">Title-page</hi>. Comparison of the <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">B</hi>
titles in the accompanying reproduction reveals small typographical
variations sufficiently apparent without further comment. But it
also reveals a degree of correspondence too great to be the result
of accident or of the natural desire of the compositor of a reprint
to save time and trouble by following his copy as exactly as
possible. The dimensions of the <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi>
type-pages,
for example, differ by scarcely a hair's breadth.<ref
target="f001.04.04" n="4">4</ref>  The
similarity of the pair of ornaments
on <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi>, each composed of four common
stock
pieces, is not remarkable; the close correspondence of their
relative positions is more so.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Headband, A2</hi><hi rend="super">r</hi>. Again, it is not
remarkable that the
printer of <hi rend="italic">B</hi> should have had in his shop, or have been able
to obtain, the type sorts of which he found the <hi rend="italic">A</hi> headband
composed. These were standard ornaments, doubtless obtainable by
any printer. The significant points are, on the one hand, that the
two headbands are not exactly identical and, on the other, that
they are so near alike that the differences can be detected only
upon close examination. To make the rows of very small pieces which
compose the outer border and separate the larger interior elements
fill the required spaces, it was necessary to insert here and there
thin types. In the top row are an exclamation point and a question
mark; in the righthand side an exclamation point; in the lefthand
side an 'i'. Exactly the same types appear in <hi rend="italic">B</hi> as in
<hi rend="italic">A</hi> and in precisely the same positions&mdash;an effect which

required careful calculation and counting.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Factotum initial, A2</hi><hi rend="super">r</hi>. The factotum
of <hi rend="italic">B</hi>
is not
identical with that of <hi rend="italic">A</hi> but is sufficiently like it&mdash;and
this is the important point&mdash;to be regarded as unmistakably an
imitation. The <hi rend="italic">A</hi> factotum having been a woodblock, the
<hi rend="italic">B</hi> printer did not have,

<pb n="001.053"/>

and could not go out and buy, a duplicate, as he could the
component parts of the headband. His alternatives were instead to
use another factotum of similar size and character, or to have an
imitation of <hi rend="italic">A</hi> specially made for the occasion. The first of
these alternative courses would not, it seems, answer his purpose,
and we may assume that he chose the second. It is chiefly upon this
factotum (supported by the tailpiece on H6<hi rend="super">v</hi>) that my
determination of the order in which the two editions were printed
rests. It is obvious that the <hi rend="italic">A</hi> factotum is old and worn,
while <hi rend="italic">B</hi> appears fresh and clean.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Tailpiece, p. 96</hi> (<hi rend="italic">H6</hi><hi rend="super">v</hi>).
Much of what I
have
said about the factotums applies to these tailpieces. <hi rend="italic">B</hi> is
of cruder workmanship than <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, with heavy outlines and
inferior draughtsmanship, but is clean and unworn.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Signatures</hi>. One of the easiest quick tests by which to
determine whether two given copies of a book (of the 18th century
or earlier) are printed from the same setting of type or whether
they belong instead to two different editions is to compare
signatures. Since compositors did not bother to center their
signatures exactly in the lower margins, a signature in one edition
will ordinarily occupy a different position in relation to the
letters of the line just above it from that of the corresponding
signature in another edition. The variation between the position of
the 'A2' in <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B</hi> (see the reproduction) is
so
slight as to appear not to be the result of chance. A comparison of
the other signatures of the two editions makes it clear that chance
is not here the controlling factor&mdash;that, even in such a trifling
and unobtrusive detail, the <hi rend="italic">B</hi> compositor was consciously
imitating his copy, <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Of twenty-three signatures in the
volume the <hi rend="italic">B</hi>
compositor placed eighteen of them more accurately than he did the
'A2'.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Press figures</hi>. In many 18th-century books we find in
an
occasional lower margin a figure, asterisk, or the like&mdash;never
more than one to a forme. These are believed to indicate the press
or the pressman on which or by which the forme was

<pb n="001.054"/>

printed. It seems probable that they were inserted by the pressman;
they could not have been inserted until the formes were made up.
And so there would normally be&mdash;and there normally is&mdash;no
agreement whatever between the press figures of a first edition and
those of a reprint of it. In the <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> there is such
agreement. One press figure appears in <hi rend="italic">A</hi>&mdash;a '2' on
C6<hi rend="super">v</hi>.
And <hi rend="italic">B</hi> agrees with this, even down to the position of the
figure on the page. This can only be intentional imitation.</p>

<p>So much for the 1724 <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>. The 1723
<hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and
the 1729 <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> exhibit the same kinds of similarities in
the two editions of each. Title-pages are copied with approximately
the same degree of fidelity. Factotums and tailpieces of the two
<hi rend="italic">A</hi> editions are worn like those of <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, while

those of the <hi rend="italic">B</hi> editions are new looking, heavy, rather crude
in workmanship, and have the appearance of imitations executed by
the same hand as those of <hi rend="italic">Othello. Hamlet</hi> has at the head of
its text a composite headband somewhat like that of <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>,
the <hi rend="italic">B</hi> edition showing the same care in the placing of the
thin types needed to fill up that we found there. The
<hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> headpiece is, instead, a foliated woodblock
ornament, <hi rend="italic">B</hi> imitating <hi rend="italic">A</hi> just as in the
factotums and
tailpieces. In its signatures <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> is almost as remarkable
in the correspondence of <hi rend="italic">B</hi> to <hi rend="italic">A</hi> as
<hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>.
Of a total of twenty-five signatures, eighteen agree more or less
exactly in their relative positions. Likewise the <hi rend="italic">Hamlet B</hi>
press figures exactly duplicate the four in <hi rend="italic">A</hi>&mdash;three
stars
and a '1'. In the 1729 <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> no press figures occur in
either edition, and the <hi rend="italic">B</hi> compositor failed to follow
<hi rend="italic">A</hi> in the placing of his signatures.</p>

<p>From this mass of evidence it will be quite clear that in the
printing of the three <hi rend="italic">B</hi> editions neither trouble or expense
was spared to produce careful type-facsimiles. There could have
been no reason for this if the <hi rend="italic">B</hi> editions were ordinary
reprints (like those of 1709 and 1765) produced by John Darby, who
is named in all the imprints. Had Darby been responsible for these
reprints, supposing that he had had any motive for producing

<pb n="001.055"/>

exact facsimiles, he could have made them better and with less
trouble by using the same factotums and tailpieces instead of only
moderately good imitations. He retained these old factotums and
tailpieces in his shop and used them later in other plays. Quite
obviously, then, the three reprints are the work of a pirate. And
from the great lengths to which he went to make his spurious
products look exactly like the genuine it seems probable that he
had reason to fear detection.</p>

<p>Were the evidence of piracy less conclusive than it is, one
would be tempted to allow some weight to what appears at first
sight to be a piece of contrary evidence, namely an advertisement
appended to the 1729 <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>. In the 1723
<hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>
also, the original printer, following a common custom, filled what
would otherwise have been a blank and wasted page at the end of the
play by there placing an advertisement of 'Books printed for M.
Poulson.' This our pirate, carrying out with complete fidelity the
facsimile nature of his reprint, reproduces in its proper place
(I6<hi rend="super">v</hi>), thus very honestly advertising the wares of his rival.
In
the <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, Darby had a blank leaf at the end (G6), which
he utilized by printing on the recto a list of 'Books printed for
J. Tonson in the Strand' and on the verso one of 'Books sold by J.
Darby in Bartholomew-Close, A. Bettes-worth in Pater-noster-Row,
and F. Clay without Temple-bar, in trust for Richard, James, and
Bethel
Wellington.' Again, the pirate follows suit, reproducing the
advertisements with close attention to details of typography,
spelling, and punctuation. But there is a difference, and it is
this that creates the difficulty. When we find, upon collating the
Darby-Wellington list, that the reprint omits two titles, we need
not attach much importance to the omission; it could, despite this
printer's usual care, be a mere accident. But when, proceeding down
the list, we find in the spurious reprint two titles not included
in the genuine original, this is harder to explain. What we have
seen of the pirate's work has not led us to expect from him any
degree of carelessness that could have produced such a result. The
only

<pb n="001.056"/>

explanation which I have been able to evolve eliminates any
carelessness on the pirate's part without, I hope, too great a
strain upon our credulity. The two extra titles which appear in the
reprint, '<hi rend="italic">Collier's</hi> Dictionary abridg'd, 2 Vol.' and
'<hi rend="italic">Hartman's</hi> Family Physician,' were for many years among
the
Wellington stock. They appear, for example, together with most of
the other titles in the <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> list, in a list of books
printed for the three Wellingtons and sold by Darby, Bettes-worth,
Clay, and R. Caldwell which is appended to a 1728 edition of Lee's
<hi rend="italic">Mithridates</hi> and in another Wellington-Bettes-worth-Clay list
appended to a 1734 edition of <hi rend="italic">Mithridates</hi>. Is it not
reasonable to assume, then, that Darby omitted the Collier and
Hartman titles from the <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> list by mistake, that he
remedied this by a belated press correction, that copies were sold
in both states, that the pirate had before him a copy with the list
in the second state, and that the two copies known to me both belong, by
an unhappy chance, to the first?</p>

<p>Three questions about these elaborately executed piracies remain
to be considered: Who was the pirate? When did he produce his
spurious reprints? How did he intend to dispose of them? While I
can supply no confident answer to any of these questions, I can at
least throw some light on all of them and suggest some plausible
answers.</p>

<p>William Feales, who is first heard of in 1729, very soon
established himself as a large dealer in plays. His name appears in
the imprint of many plays between 1731 and 1736, never, so far as
I have observed, as sole publisher, always in conjunction with such
well-established capitalists as Bernard Lintott, the Wellingtons,
or the Tonsons, particularly the last. From the first he appears to
have been primarily a wholesale dealer in plays, especially
remainders. Two receipts preserved in the British Museum<ref
 target="f001.04.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>  show him buying in October 1731 from
Benjamin Motte 1950 copies of Crowne's <hi rend="italic">Sir Courtly Nice</hi>
for
&pound;13.11.0, and in July 1733 from Lintott 606 copies of Cibber's
<hi rend="italic">Love's Last Shift</hi>, the price not stated. <hi rend="italic">Sir Courtly
Nice</hi> was a

<pb n="001.057"/>

fairly new play, published at some time in 1731, but the price of
1 2/3 pence per copy suggests a remainder stock. Though Feales sold
plays separately, he also collected them into bound sets for which
he supplied general title-pages. The first of these he called
<hi rend="italic">The English Theatre</hi>. This began as an eight-volume set,
dated 1731, but additional 'Parts' of six or eight volumes extended
the set by 1733 to twenty-six volumes containing 104 plays, which
he advertised at &pound;4.7.6 bound (which comes to 10d. per play). I
do not know of any complete set of these; the Folger Library has a
nearly complete set the only missing volume of which is supplied in
another broken set.</p>


<p>The plays, which have their own titles, are chiefly old
remainders, their dates going back as far as 1719 and their
imprints representing many publishers. As a stock of old remainders
became exhausted, Feales obtained other reprints to fill their
places; in all probability he undertook for this purpose the
publication of new reprints in conjunction with those publishers
who controlled the copyrights. Thus in a volume with a general
title-page dated 1731 we may find plays dated 1733. And in the two
Folger sets, though they are alike in general titles and contents,
a given play may be of two different editions, one 1728, the other
1733. With Feales's later ventures, <hi rend="italic">The British Theatre</hi>, in
ten volumes, and 'The Beautiful Editions of the Plays with Red
Titles and Handsome Frontispieces'&mdash;the latter consisting of the
old plays issued separately with new (cancel) titles&mdash;I am not now
concerned.</p>

<p>Feales's method of play publishing bears upon our three pirated
plays. For all three of them appear in the first volume of <hi rend="italic">The
English Theatre</hi>, 1731&mdash;the three counterfeit reprints, in the
order indicated by their imprint dates, complete with titles and
advertisements&mdash;together with a 1729 edition of Tate's <hi rend="italic">King
Lear</hi>. The two Folger copies of this volume are identical in
every important respect.</p>

<p>Now I cannot say how Feales acquired the three reprints. He was
not himself a printer, and when he required the services of a
printer he usually employed Darby himself, who is in this

<pb n="001.058"/>

case, as always so far as I know, above suspicion. Yet it is not
impossible&mdash;or even unlikely&mdash;that Feales was the culprit.
Nothing is known about him before 1731, except for the single
imprint of 1729 mentioned before. He was not in any case a
well-established member of the trade and may well, before he became
respectable as the associate of the most substantial stationers of
London, have been a shady character not above a barefaced piracy.
He may have employed some equally shady printer to do the job for
him and, experiencing difficulty in getting the pirated plays off
his hands, may have kept them until the assembling of <hi rend="italic">The
English Theatre</hi> occurred to him. Or he may have acquired a
large stock of miscellaneous plays with such a collection in view
and, unable to obtain editions of the most popular plays of
Shakespeare which he desired for his first volume, may have had
them secretly printed for the purpose. On the other hand, it must
be regarded as equally possible that
Feales, a wholesale dealer in all sorts of plays, bought these
three piracies from their real perpetrator, either quite innocently
or with some degree of guilt. Perhaps, even, the real pirate was
caught, and his stock confiscated, as the Act of 1709 provided, and
then acquired by Feales. There seems little to choose between these
alternative suggestions.</p>

<p>Whichever origin we choose, it seems to me very probable that
the three plays were produced not earlier than 1729, and I see no
good reason for assigning a date earlier than 1731. The dates on
the title-pages of the reprints may of course be ignored. And the
similarity of technique in all three, together with the uniformity
in execution of the woodblock ornaments, supplies some ground for
assuming that the three piracies were carried out by one printer
and at one time.</p>

<p>When all is said, it must be admitted that we have here but few
facts. All that can be said with complete confidence is that the
three reprints are piracies, and that William Feales is the only
man whom we can connect with them in any way.</p>

<p>THE MOST RECENT STUDY OF THE PRINTING of the
controversial "Pied
Bull" quarto of <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> remarks that the application of a
spelling test to determine the number of compositors employed
remains a desideratum.<ref target="f001.05.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>  Following
this suggestion, I have examined the text of the "Pied Bull"
<hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> and two other play quartos printed by Nicholas Okes,
in
an attempt to prove, if possible, the number of compositors
employed.<ref target="f001.05.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>  The technique I use was
first developed by Professor Charlton Hinman.<ref
target="f001.05.03" n="3">3</ref>  It
consists, in brief, of identifying
the orthographic habits and peculiarities of individual
compositors. In addition to supplying three good examples of the
reliability of Professor Hinman's test,<ref
target="f001.05.04" n="4">4</ref>  I think that I can
show conclusively
that only one compositor was engaged in the production of
<hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>.</p>

<pb n="001.062"/>

<p>In order to prove that the "Pied Bull" <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> is the work
of a single compositor, it is first necessary to examine two other
dramatic quartos printed by Nicholas Okes. The information thereby
obtained concerning the spelling habits of the compositors in the
Okes shop can then be applied to the <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> quarto.</p>

<p>In 1612, four years after he printed the <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> quarto,
Nicholas Okes printed the first quarto of John Webster's <hi rend="italic">The
White Devil</hi>. An examination of this quarto shows that two
compositors were employed. One compositor (whom I designate B)
never uses the apostrophe in the form <hi rend="italic">Ile</hi>, although he
regularly uses it in such forms as <hi rend="italic">He'd, We've</hi>, and the
like. In addition to this peculiar use of the apostrophe,
Compositor B frequently uses <hi rend="italic">ie</hi> for final <hi rend="italic">y</hi>.
The
other compositor (whom I designate A) generally uses the apostrophe
in the form <hi rend="italic">I'le</hi> and, with certain exceptions mentioned
below, never uses <hi rend="italic">ie</hi> for final <hi rend="italic">y</hi>. Both
compositors
invariably spell certain words with a final <hi rend="italic">y</hi>. These words,
which are not included in the tabulations because they are
non-significant, are: <hi rend="italic">any, away, lay, may, many, pray, say,
way</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">why</hi>. The appearance of
<hi rend="italic">Ile/I'le</hi> and
final <hi rend="italic">y/ie</hi> forms is given in the following
 chart.<ref target="f001.05.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> </p>


<p>The tabulation shows that the alternation of the two compositors
was not regular. Beginning with B1, Compositor A set B1,
B1<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
C1-F2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, G1-G2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, H2,
H2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, H4,
H4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, I3, I3<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
I4<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
K1, K3<hi rend="super">v</hi>-K4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, L3-M2<hi rend="super">v</hi>.
The quarto consists
of 88 pages, 87
of which contain letterpress (the verso of the title page is
blank). Of these, Compositor A set 56 pages. The remaining 31 pages
were set by Compositor B.<ref target="f001.05.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> </p>

<pb entity="sb01641" n="001.064"/>

  <!-- <p><figure entity="sb01641"></figure></p> -->

<p>In 1609, one year later than the "Pied Bull" <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>,
Nicholas Okes printed the first and only quarto of Robert Armin's
<hi rend="italic">The History of the Two Maids of More-clacke</hi>. An
examination
of the text of this quarto shows that, as with <hi rend="italic">The White
Devil</hi>, two compositors were engaged. The two compositors,
moreover, are the same two whose work has been identified in the
Webster quarto. The following chart shows the occurrence of the
significant forms by which their identity can be ascertained.<ref

<pb entity="sb01661" n="001.066"/>

  <!-- <p><figure entity="sb01661"></figure></p> -->

<p>In <hi rend="italic">The Merry Maids of More-clacke</hi>, composing started

with
A1.<ref target="f001.05.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref>  Compositor B set the following

pages: A1, A2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, A3, B1-B2<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
C1-C2<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
D1-D3, E1-E2<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
F1-F2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, G1-G2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, H1-H3,
H4<hi rend="super">v</hi>-I2<hi rend="super">v</hi>. The title-page was
probably set by B. The remaining 31 pages (out of a total of 70)
were composed by A. The two compositors generally alternated after
setting four type-pages, and the evidence of this alternation is,
in the main, quite clear.<ref target="f001.05.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> </p>



<p>By combining the evidence obtained from <hi rend="italic">The White
Devil</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">The Two Maids</hi>, and tabulating this evidence in
percentages, the spelling habits of the two compositors can be
summarized as follows:

<table>
<row>
<cell></cell>
<cell><hi rend="italic">I'le</hi></cell>
<cell><hi rend="italic">Ile</hi></cell>
<cell><hi rend="italic">y</hi></cell>

</table>
</p>

<pb entity="sb01671" n="001.067"/>

<p>Turning now to the "Pied Bull" <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> quarto, we find
that
only one compositor was engaged in setting the book, and that this
compositor is the Compositor B of <hi rend="italic">The White Devil</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">The
Two Maids of More-clacke</hi>. A tabulation of the characteristic
forms upon which this spelling test is based is given below.</p>

  <!-- <p><figure entity="sb01671"></figure></p> -->

<pb entity="sb01681" n="001.068"/>

  <!-- <p><figure entity="sb01681"></figure></p> -->

<p>The characteristics that distinguish Compositor B are at once
apparent: the absence of the apostrophe in <hi rend="italic">Ile</hi> forms, the
frequent spellings in final <hi rend="italic">ie</hi>, and the preponderance of
<hi rend="italic">doe</hi> spellings. When presented in percentage form, the
figures for <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> are very close to the percentages arrived
at by combining the evidence obtained from <hi rend="italic">The White Devil</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">The Two Maids</hi>. In <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>, final
<hi rend="italic">ie</hi>
is used
45% of the time as compared with 40%, and the <hi rend="italic">doe</hi> form is
used 72% of the time as compared with 80% for <hi rend="italic">The White
Devil</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Two Maids</hi>.</p>

<p>On only two pages, I believe, is the evidence inconclusive. On
H4, we find seven final <hi rend="italic">y</hi>'s, no final <hi rend="italic">ie</hi>
spellings,
and no <hi rend="italic">Ile</hi> forms. The two <hi rend="italic">doe</hi> forms suggest
Compositor B but are not evidence enough upon which to assign him
the work. On L4, the only significant forms appearing are seven
final <hi rend="italic">y</hi>'s. As Compositor B has, however, set all of the
other pages, it seems very likely that he also set H4 and L4.</p>

<p>The thirteen settings of the running-titles<ref
 target="f001.05.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref>  that
appear in the quarto all read
<hi rend="italic">The Historie of King Lear</hi>. On the strength of the
<hi rend="italic">ie</hi>
spelling, I believe that these, like the rest of the text, were set
by Compositor B.</p>

 <note id="f001.05.06" n="6" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">6</hi></seg><p>The evidence in certain pages is
insufficient, and in five cases, somewhat ambiguous. The appearance
of a single final <hi rend="italic">y</hi> on the title-page is certainly
insufficient evidence for assigning the page to A; but as A
composed the two following pages, it seems reasonably likely that
he set the title-page too. This suggestion becomes even more likely
when we note that the pages immediately preceding the title-page
(in order of composition) were also set by A.
On pages E1, F2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, G1, H2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and
I2<hi rend="super">v</hi> we find
a single final
<hi rend="italic">ie</hi> spelling conflicting with a preponderance of final
<hi rend="italic">y</hi> spellings; and on F2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, G1, and
H2<hi rend="super">v</hi>
conflicting with
<hi rend="italic">I'le</hi> forms as well. On E1, the form <hi rend="italic">bodie</hi>
appears
as
the final word of a full line, and the unexpected spelling may be
explained as the method adopted for justifying the line. The
spellings on G1, H2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and I2<hi rend="super">v</hi> seem to
be inexplicable
exceptions to A's normal spelling habits. The conflict on
F2<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
however, is capable of explanation, and suggests a third
characteristic that may be of some use in distinguishing the two
compositors. The word <hi rend="italic">merrie</hi> appears on the fourth line
from
the bottom ofthe page. In the preceding line, the word <hi rend="italic">do</hi>
appears three times, each time spelled <hi rend="italic">do</hi>. On the last line
of the page the word appears spelled <hi rend="italic">doe</hi>. A tabulation of
the occurrence of <hi rend="italic">do/doe</hi> forms throughout the book reveals
that B shows a marked
preference for the <hi rend="italic">doe</hi> form; A is predisposed toward the
<hi rend="italic">do</hi> form. It would, therefore, seem probable that Compositor
A set the first 33 lines on F2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and was then relieved by
Compositor B who set the remaining four lines and the three
following pages. (A similar case is cited by Professor Hinman,
<hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, p. 90).</p></note>

 <note id="f001.05.07" n="7" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">7</hi></seg><p>As in the previous tabulation, words
invariably spelled with a final <hi rend="italic">y</hi> by both compositors are
not included.</p></note>

 <note id="f001.05.08" n="8" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">8</hi></seg><p>The evidence provided by the running-titles
proves that printing began with text gathering A. As in <hi rend="italic">The
White Devil</hi>, the title-page and preliminary matter, consisting
of two pages signed <hi rend="super">a</hi>, were printed along with the final
two-page gathering by full sheet imposition. The running-title
appearing on the versos reads "The History(ie) of the two". Four
such running-titles are used. Two read "Historie", and were, I
believe, set by Compositor B. The other two, reading "History",
were probably set by Compositor A.</p></note>

 <note id="f001.05.09" n="9" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">9</hi></seg><p>On certain pages the evidence is
inconclusive, and on others, somewhat ambiguous. The one <hi rend="italic">ie</hi>

form on the title-page is hardly sufficient evidence to assign the
composition of the title-page to B. On A4, one <hi rend="italic">ie</hi> spelling
(curtesie) conflicts with twenty <hi rend="italic">y</hi> spellings. The same word,
this time spelled "courtesie", appears on H3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, where it
conflicts with ten final <hi rend="italic">y</hi> spellings. On B4<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
the form
"weie" (for <hi rend="italic">weigh</hi>) appears twice. I believe "weie" may have
been A's normal spelling. On D4 and F3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, the spelling
"busie"
occurs; and on D4, we also find "obloquie". On the strength of
these two <hi rend="italic">ie</hi> forms on D4, plus the single <hi rend="italic">Ile</hi>
form
and the one spelling <hi rend="italic">doe</hi>, the page should probably be
assigned to Compositor B. To do so, however, upsets the quite
regular alternation that precedes and follows. On G3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, G4,
and
G4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, the single <hi rend="italic">ie</hi> spellings seem to be
inexplicable
variations from A's normal habits. On B1
and D1, pages clearly composed by B, we find the form <hi rend="italic">Il'e</hi>.
A possible explanation may be that B, attempting to follow his copy
closely, misplaced the apostrophe in setting the word.</p></note>

  <p>THE DISCOVERY<ref target="f001.06.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>  DURING

THE SUMMER
OF 1947 of a copy of <hi rend="italic">The First Five Bookes of Ovids
Metamorphosis</hi> "Imprinted for W:B: 1621" puts an end to many
   conjectures<ref target="f001.06.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>  about this mysterious
and elusive littlc book; but not to all, for according to the
title-page, it belongs to "edit: 2d." The copy, which was acquired
for the Folger Shakespeare Library, may be the very one of which
just one hundred and forty years ago Joseph Haslewood supplied to
Sir Egerton Brydges the following account:

<q>Art. IV. <hi rend="italic">The First Five Bookes of Ovid's Metamorphosis,
Second Edition. Imprinted for W.B. 1621. 16 mo pp. 141, besides
Introduction</hi>.</q>

<q>This edition of the translation of Ovid by Geo. Sandys, is
unnoticed in all the lists of his works. The title is engraved on
a curtain, supported by two flying Cupids; above the curtain, Venus
lying on a couch of clouds, holding a burning heart, attended with
doves and the god of love, and below a full assembly of the heathen
deities. "Fr. Delaram, sculp."<ref target="f001.06.02a" n="2a"><hi rend="super">2a</hi></ref>
A head of Ovid in an

<pb n="001.072"/>

oval, with verses beneath, as in the folios. "Ovid defended," is
the only article prefixed to this edition, which has a trifling
variance from the subsequent ones, as giving "Ovid's
selfe-censure," a translation of the concluding lines of lib. 15 .
. . Of the edition, dated 1621, I have never seen any other copy
than the one above described. The date of the first edition of the
five books yet remains to be ascertained.<ref
target="f001.06.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> </q></p>





<p>More than once the failure of scholars to locate this or any
other copy of the book&mdash;nowhere is the name of the owner of the
copy in question stated&mdash;has led to speculation about the accuracy
of Haslewood's description and even about his honesty.<ref
target="f001.06.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref>
The vindication of the antiquary, who
suffered deeply from the scorn of some of his more genteel
contemporaries, in this instance may help to validate his other
contributions to bibliography.</p>


<p>The Folger copy of <hi rend="italic">The First Five
Bookes</hi>&mdash;which,
until
another comes to light, I shall call unique&mdash;corresponds in almost
every detail to that described by Haslewood. The book, which
measures 6.4 x 10.2 cm., is actually a duodecimo and not a
sexagesimo. When purchased, it possessed only the rear cover and
portions of the backstrip of eighteenth-century calf, and its
condition was such that after a careful examination

<pb n="001.073"/>

the book was taken apart and then rebound in green niger. On blank
leaf &para;6<hi rend="super">v</hi>, written in a childish scrawl as part of a
doggerel
statement of ownership, is the name of Thomas Hickman. The
collation appears to be, &para;<hi rend="super">6</hi> A-F<hi rend="super">12</hi>
(F12, possibly a blank,
wanting). Leaves "&para;1/6 were not conjugate, each having been
backed with heavy wove paper. For this reason the collation . . .
cannot be entirely certain; but the exact correspondence of
chain-lines made it appear highly probable that these two leaves
had originally been conjugate . . . All other pairs of leaves were
normally conjugate except F2/11, F3/10, of which there was every
reason to believe that they had originally been conjugate."<ref

F11<hi rend="super">v</hi>, blank. Pp.
[xii] +
141.</p>


<p>It will be noticed immediately that the Folger copy lacks a leaf
bearing the head of Ovid engraved in an oval, with verses beneath.
Probably this was a frontispiece which was lost at the time the
little book lost its front cover.<ref target="f001.06.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref>
The title-page is exactly as Haslewood described it, and the
prefatory defense of Ovid begins, as Haslewood said it did, with a
translation from the concluding lines of Book XV of the
<hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi>. These points have been conjecturally called
in question, and it is doing simple justice to Haslewood to affirm
his accuracy. The first sentence of "Ovid Defended" is identical in
the editions of 1621 and 1626,<ref target="f001.06.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref>
except that the words "from detraction" have been added in line 3
of the later edition. In the 12mo, the second sentence is as
follows:

<q><lg type="verse">
<l>And, in that the traduced may with modesty enough</l>
<l>report their owne merits, I will first begin with</l></lg></q>

<pb n="001.074"/>

<q><lg type="verse">
<l>a OVID'S SELFE-CENSVRE.</l>
<l>Now haue I ended, what the Thunders rage,</l>
<l>Nor fire, nor steele shall raze, nor eating Age.</l>
<l>Come when it wil my death's vncertayn houre;</l>

<l>I, in my fame, eternally shall liue.<ref
 target="f001.06.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> </l></lg></q>

The reference "a," is identified on &para;6<hi rend="super">r</hi> as "L. 15 in
fin."
The preface continues: "A prediction already confirmed by many
lustres of Ages. Heare we now that accurate Orator, Marcus Annaevs
Seneca." The section continues as in <hi rend="italic">1626</hi> until Erasmus is
reached, where the earlier edition provides an ampler testimony.
After Stephanus, <hi rend="italic">1626</hi> inserts Marcus Antonius Tritonius and
Bernardus Martinus. There are occasional variations in the wording
of the transitional sentences.</p>




<p>Though the book was originally entered in the registers of the
Company of Stationers to Matthew Lownes and William Barrett on 27
April 1621,<ref target="f001.06.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref>  the engraved
title-page of the second

<pb n="001.075"/>

edition names only W[illiam B[arrett].<ref
 target="f001.06.09a" n="9a"><hi rend="super">9a</hi></ref>  The printer of
this edition is
unknown, and no guesses as to his identity can be hazarded because
the book contains no printer's devices, no ornaments, and no
initial letters. From the date of the second edition, it is obvious
that the book was popular, for a reprint was called for within
twelve months of the date of entry.</p>



<p>The relationship between the second edition of 1621 and the
folio of 1626 is very close. In the preliminaries, for example, the
edition of 1626 has on the verso of the leaf of dedication an
engraving that has for its central feature the head of Ovid in an
oval, with verses beneath; this corresponds to the engraving
described by Haslewood but now wanting in the Folger copy of the
1621 edition. Each edition has an engraved title-page, but these
differ radically. And each edition has a section enentitled, "Ovid
Defended."<ref target="f001.06.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref>  It is in the texts of
the translation that the editions most closely resemble each other.
These may be minutely collated for page after page without
discovery of even a literal difference. From time to time, the
compositors of the 1621 edition were forced by the length of a line
to use an ampersand or to indicate the omission of "n" or "m" by
printing a vowel with a tilde.<ref target="f001.06.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref>
Occasionally <hi rend="italic">1626</hi>
corrects a typographical error in <hi rend="italic">1621</hi><ref
 target="f001.06.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref>  or
 introduces one.<ref target="f001.06.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref>  Sandys devoted

<pb n="001.076"/>

much attention to smoothing the metre of the lines in the edition
of 1626, frequently altering the spelling of a dissyllabic word to
insure that it should be pronounced as a monosyllable and eliding
e's and o's before vowels or the letter h.<ref
 target="f001.06.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref>  Otherwise,
except for verbal changes or
alterations in the translation, which will be discussed together in
another connection, the text of the first five books of the 1626
edition agrees to a remarkable degree with that of the edition of
1621. Only in the reprinting of Bibles, I think, will such literal
correspondence be found in other seventeenth-century books.</p>






<p>If this be true, it follows that a corrected copy of the second
edition of 1621 must have been supplied to the printer in 1626 for
the use of his compositors,<ref target="f001.06.14a" n="14a"><hi rend="super">14a</hi></ref>  and
the accuracy of the reprint suggests that Sandys read the proofs
zealously. Now if a copy of the second edition of 1621 was used as
printer's copy in 1626, it is a safe presumption not only that this
second edition was an exceptionally faithful reprint of the first
edition of 1621 but that the latter was printed from a manuscript
supplied by Sandys himself. It would follow that Sandys planned the
book and its engravings in conjunction with his publishers, William
Barrett and Matthew Lownes.<ref
target="f001.06.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> </p>



<p>While Sandys was in Virginia, William Barrett died, and on 3
April 1626, his relict, Mistress Barrett, conveyed to John Parker
her rights in a number of books, including Sandys's
<hi rend="italic">Ovid</hi>.<ref target="f001.06.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref>  Then, a little
more
than one month later, William

<pb n="001.077"/>

Stansby entered "<hi rend="italic">A booke Called Ovids Metamorphosis XV
bookes</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in English verse</hi> by George Sandes."<ref
target="f001.06.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref>  Although the imprint on the engraved
title-page names neither printer nor publisher and the colophon
reads, "Printed by William Stansby 1626," it may be presumed that
Stansby served as publisher of this edition, for in 1626 Sandys
expected to return shortly to Virginia. He probably assumed that
his rights in the book were fully protected by the pregnant words,
"Cum Priuilegio," engraved on the title-page. This phrase alludes
to letters patent granted by King Charles to Sandys on 24 April
1626<ref target="f001.06.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref>  that gave him exclusive
publishing rights for twenty-one years.<ref
target="f001.06.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref>  These rights he
had to assert within
two years, for Robert Young published an octavo reprint of the
complete translation early in 1628.</p>





<p>The details of the transaction by which Young became possessed
of rights in the book are obscure. Matthew Lownes was dead before
10 April 1627, for on that date many of his titles were transferred
to his son Thomas,<ref target="f001.06.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref>  but not the
<hi rend="italic">Ovid.</hi> Soon after, Thomas Lownes conveyed a large group
of
books to Humphrey Lownes and Robert Young,<ref
target="f001.06.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref>  but
again the <hi rend="italic">Ovid</hi> is not
named.
Yet the minutes of Court Book C, are explicit in their statement
that "the assignm<hi rend="super">t</hi> to Robt Younge . . . shalbe . . . Crost
out
of the Regester Booke of the Company." It must be assumed that in
a private and unrecorded transaction<ref
target="f001.06.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref>  Matthew Lownes
had before his death
transferred to Young his interest in <hi rend="italic">The First Five Bookes</hi>,
as recorded long before on 27 April 1621, and that Young had,
somewhat

<pb n="001.078"/>

unethically perhaps, taken advantage of this right in five books to
reprint the complete translation of fifteen books.</p>




<p>The wording of the minute in the Court Book suggests that,
though he had provided Stansby with a copy of the 1621 edition to
print from in 1626, Sandys considered his Fifteen Books an
independent publication and that he gave no compensation to John
Parker, who had acquired William Barrett's rights in <hi rend="italic">The First
Five Bookes</hi>, or to Matthew Lownes, who had transferred his
rights in the duodecimo to Robert Young.<ref
target="f001.06.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref>  It is my
belief, as stated above, that
William Stansby, printer of the folio of 1626, probably served only
as Sandys's agent. But the outraged poet took no chances when he
made his demands upon the Company of Stationers: the minute records
that

<q>Mr Sandes Patent for the sole printing of the 15. bookes of
Ovides Metamorphosis by him translated into English verse was
openlye reade in the hall this quarter day. And it is ordered that
th' entrance of M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Barret and M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Lownes
deceased of the first

five books and the assignm<hi rend="super">t</hi> to Robt Younge, and the
Entrance of
the whole 15. bookes to mr Stansby shalbe all Crost out of the
Regester Booke of the Company for that noe man shall laye anie
claime to the printing of the same or any pte thereof.<ref
target="f001.06.24" n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref> </q>

And so it was done, but the transfer of Mistress Barrett's rights
to Parker was somehow overlooked.</p>



<p>Between the years 1621 and 1626 Sandys made a number of
revisions of his translation of the first five books of the
<hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi>. Some of these appear to have been
introduced
for the purpose of improving the accuracy of the translation. Thus
the reading of <hi rend="italic">1621</hi> (p. 9, line 24), "Or must th' Earth be
by saluages possest?" is changed in <hi rend="italic">1626</hi> to "Must Earth be
onely by wild beasts possest?" (<hi rend="italic">Met.</hi> 1. 249, ferisne paret
populandas tradere

<pb n="001.079"/>

terras). Again, "trembling" (<hi rend="italic">1621</hi>, p. 80, line 28) is
corrected to "wrathfull" (cf. <hi rend="italic">Met.</hi> III. 577, ira tremendos),
and "Epogus" (<hi rend="italic">1621</hi>, p. 82, line 13) to "Epopeus" (cf.
<hi rend="italic">Met.</hi> III. 619).</p>

<p>More frequently Sandys amended his translation to improve the
Latin pronunciation of proper names. In <hi rend="italic">1621</hi> (p. 23, line
31), Pleias is trisyllabic, with the accent on the second syllable:

<q><lg type="verse">
<l>But, calls his sonne, of bright <hi rend="italic">Ple&iuml;as</hi>
bred;</l></lg></q>

in <hi rend="italic">1626</hi> both syllabification and accent are changed:

<q><lg type="verse">
<l>But, calls his sonne, of fulgent <hi rend="italic">Pleias</hi> bred;</l></lg></q>


(<hi rend="italic">Met.</hi> 1. 670, Pleias enixa est letoque det imperat Argum).
In one case at least, Sandys corrected the pronunciation of one
name at the expense of another. In <hi rend="italic">1621</hi> (p. 36, line 13), he
was not satisfied with his rendition of "Citheron":

<q><lg type="verse">
<l><hi rend="italic">Mycale</hi>, with the sacred
<hi rend="italic">Citheron:</hi></l></lg></q>

so he revised it to

<q><lg type="verse">
<l>High <hi rend="italic">Mycale</hi>, diuine <hi rend="italic">Cithaeron</hi>,
wast:</l></lg></q>

(cf. <hi rend="italic">Met.</hi> 11. 223, Dindymaque et Mycale natusque ad sacra
Cithaeron),
thus doing violence to the pronunciation of "Mycale."</p>

<p>Some of the revisions entail the rewriting of a complete line or
even a couplet. The ravishment of Io, (1. 599-600) is rendered thus
in <hi rend="italic">1621</hi> (p. 21, lines 21-22):

<q><lg type="verse">
<l>With darknesse he the Earth inveloped;</l>
<l>And catching her, inforc't her Maiden-head.</l></lg></q>

In <hi rend="italic">1626</hi>, the couplet is changed to read:

<q><lg type="verse">
<l>He in the Aire a sable cloud displai'd,</l>
<l>Caught, and devirginat's the strugling Maid.</l></lg></q>

The account of Phaeton's conversation with Apollo (<hi rend="italic">Met.</hi> 11.
33-34) appears in <hi rend="italic">1621</hi> (P. 29, lines 27-28) as follows:

<q><lg type="verse">
<l>What brought thee hither, <hi rend="italic">Phaeton</hi>, said hee,</l>
<l>My dearest sonne? well worthy so to bee.</l></lg></q>

<pb n="001.080"/>

In <hi rend="italic">1626</hi>, the passage is altered thus:

<q><lg type="verse">
<l>Who said, What hether drew thee <hi rend="italic">Phaeton</hi>,</l>
<l>Who art, and worthily my dearest Son?</l></lg></q>

Once Sandys rewrites a passage (<hi rend="italic">Met.</hi> 111. 185-88) to secure
greater precision and compression. In <hi rend="italic">1621</hi> (p. 66, line
31&mdash; p. 67, line 3), five lines are required:

<q><lg type="verse">
<l>When from her aged Love shee takes her flight:</l>
<l>Such was <hi rend="italic">Diana's</hi>, taken in that plight.</l>
<l>Although inuiron'd by her Virgin trayne,</l>
<l>Shee side-long turneth, casting with disdayne</l>
<l>A killing looke; and wisht her deadly Bowe:</l></lg></q>

Three lines suffice in <hi rend="italic">1626:</hi>

<q><lg type="verse">
<l>Such flusht in <hi rend="italic">Dians</hi> cheeks, being naked tane.</l>
<l>And though inuiron'd by her Virgin trayne,</l>
<l>Shee side-long turnes, looks back, and wisht her bow: . .
.</l></lg></q>

The later version profits by the removal of the couplet that
elaborates the reference in the preceding line to "rosie Morn," and
in this revision Elizabethan exuberance can be seen yielding to
classical correctness. Other examples might be cited of Sandys's
efforts to polish his lines, but these indicate the care he
expended on the translation.</p>

<p>Now that the finding of a copy of the second edition of <hi rend="italic">The
First Five Bookes of Ovids Metamorphosis</hi> has cleared Joseph
Haslewood of charges of inaccuracy (or worse) and thrown new light
on the history of Sandys's famous translation, it remains to
inquire once again whether this book in the edition of 1626 may be
considered the first published verse in the English language which
was written on the mainland of North America.<ref
target="f001.06.25" n="25"><hi rend="super">25</hi></ref>  The
answer must be given in the
negative. Another "American" poem preceded it by fully three years.

1623 by a Gentleman in that Country." Since the ballad gives a
highly circumstantial account of the Indian massacre of 1622, the
date is probably accurate and the attribution of authorship
correct. The author may have been "a Gentleman," but surely his
literary attainments were of the slightest, if the ballad is a fair
measure. The first stanza is typical:

<q><lg type="verse">
<l>No English heart, but heard with griefe</l>
<l>the massacre here done:</l>
<l>And how by sauage trecheries,</l>
<l>full many a mothers sonne:</l>
<l>But God that gaue them power and leaue,</l>
<l>their cruelties to vse,</l>
<l>Hath giuen them vp into our hands,</l>
<l>who English did abuse.</l></lg></q>

There is no need to detail the evidence of the author's first-hand
knowledge of events. The ballad may be read in the facsimile
provided in the bookseller's catalogue. It has, moreover, been
available to scholars and historians in another form for eight
years, having been reproduced as Number 105 in "Photostat
Americana, Second Series," in May 1940 from the copy in the Public
Record Office in London.<ref target="f001.06.27" n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref> </p>




<p>Appropriately enough, this rare ballad, generally overlooked

<pb n="001.082"/>

by literary historians, includes a fine tribute to George Sandys:

<q><lg type="verse"><l>Stout Master George Sands vpon a night,</l>
<l>did brauely venture forth:</l>
<l>And mong'st the sauage murtherers,</l>
<l>did forme a deed of worth.</l>
<l>For finding many by a fire,</l>
<l>to death their liues they pay:</l>
<l>Set fire of a Towne of theires,</l>
<l>and brauely came away.</l></lg></q>

photostats from the University of Chicago Library and Harvard
University Library indicates that Delaram copied in reverse the
unsigned engraving which serves as the general title of a duodecimo
edition published in Amsterdam in 1619 by Guilielmus Ianssonius
with the title, <hi rend="italic">Pub: Ovidii Nasonis Opera</hi> (another copy is
credited to Mills College and a fourth to the Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale). The work also appears in a 1624 edition (cf. copies
credited to the American Antiquarian Society and to the
Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale), but Dr. Brigham writes me that the copy
in the library of the American Antiquarian Society is not a Jansson
publication. The title-page of this edition, which has no engraved
general title, reads as follows: "<hi rend="italic">Publii Ovidii Nasonis Operum
Tomus I. quo continentur Heroidum Epistola. Amorum Libri III. De
arte Amandi Libri tres. De Remedio Amoris Libri II. Et alia, qua
aversa pagella indicat</hi>. [cut
of 2 globes] Amsterdami Apud Guilielmum Caesium Anno MDCXXiiii."
The appearance of the name Caesium suggests that the copy listed in
the catalogue of the Bibl. Nat. as by "G. Janss. Caesium" may be
inaccurately described. In 1629 the Jansson edition was reprinted
with a different title, <hi rend="italic">Pub: Ovidii Nas: Opera. Daniel Heinsius
textum recensuit</hi>, by Ioannes Ianssonus (I have used a photostat
of the title-page of the Harvard copy; other copies of this edition
are in the Boston Public Library, the Washington and Lee University
Library, the British Museum, and the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale).
This 1629 edition has an engraved title-page, unsigned, that is
closely copied from that of 1619. According to the catalogue of the
Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, later editions were published by J.
Jansson in 1634 and 1647 and by J. Blaeu in 1649.
I am indebted to Dr. F. T. Bowers for directing my attention to the
Dutch engraving and to F. C. Francis, Esq., Mr. William A. Jackson,

<p>Conventional histories of literature and orthodox bibliography
have paid scant attention to the reaction of the reading public to
book production. Sociologists, public opinion analysts, and
commercial interests have recognized the importance of current
problems of "literary taste." What are the reasons for the neglect
of the historical aspects of readers' reactions? The scarcity of
objective data would appear to be the obvious explanation. However,
we possess a mass of information which can profitably be utilized
in analyzing the reception by the public of specific titles or
groups of publications. The first and main sources are data on the
periodicity, or frequency of republication, a barometer of public
appeal, which can be assembled with comparative ease by the scholar
well trained in the use of bibliographical tools. Another, more
obscure source, is found in the advertisements and catalogues
issued by publishers and bookdealers with some frequency since the
15th century.
Specimens of this latter type are the subject of this paper.</p>

<p>The firm of Aldus, founded in 1494 by Aldo Manuzio and continued
successfully by his son Paolo, fell into comparative decline under
his grandson Aldo Manuzio, the Younger. From 1581 on, the business
was conducted largely by Niccolo Manassi

<pb n="001.086"/>

who, in the words of Renouard<ref target="f001.07.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
exploited "non sans quelque capacit&eacute;, l'immense r&eacute;putation
de
cette typographie c&eacute;l&egrave;bre." Renouard who takes a somewhat
dim
view of Manassi's stewardship, comments on him, under the year
1586, as follows: "L'imprimerie, r&eacute;gie par Nicolas Manassi . .
. se trouve r&eacute;duite &agrave; bien peu de chose. Il paro&icirc;t que
son exploitation se bornoit presque &agrave; la vente du peu de livres
rest&eacute;s en magasin." This statement is not entirely correct. His
activities as a publisher, between the years 1581 and 1586, compare
not unfavorably with those of the younger Aldus. That more than a
few books were still in stock becomes evident upon examination of
the "Libri di stampa d'Aldo che si trovano al presente" (see
illustrations). It seems, however, true that Manassi was eager to
reduce the stock at hand; or so we deduce from his use, from 1586
on, of a new kind of sales catalogues, published as appendices of
the firm's
regular publications. As far as could be ascertained, he was the
first to use his own publications as vehicles for advertising the
remaining, unsold stock. This technique, used today on book
jackets, common in books during the 19th century, is generally
associated with English 17th century printers who used it to
promote the sale of dramatic publications.
<ref target="f001.07.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> </p>



<p>Little or no attention has been paid to the sales catalogues of
Aldus, though Renouard mentioned them, had seen 23, and listed
21.<ref target="f001.07.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref>  He reprints the sales
catalogue found in LeRoy, 1592 (R.248, 3) "parce qu'il est un des
plus amples"; he refers to it as the sixth Aldus catalogue. Five
earlier publishers' lists of the firm were printed separately, and
issued in the years 1498, 1503, 1513 (two catalogues) and 1563. The
1586-1598 series, of

<pb n="001.087"/>

which our sales catalogues are part, covers a comparatively short
period. Its catalogues are characterized by the fact that they were
printed as part of regular publications, and list only items still
available ("che si trovano"), and therefore unsold. By examining
items not sold, in the light of total production, we can arrive at
an estimate of the attitude of the reading public towards Aldus
publications. Since items&mdash;except for pre-publication
announcements&mdash;are priced, a comparison of the sales catalogues
provides data on book price variations. Finally, the listing itself
is brief and not too clear, as was customary for all early
bibliographies and catalogues; nevertheless, sufficient points of
some bibliographical value have been clarified, beyond the
information previously supplied in the comprehensive study of
Renouard, to justify further investigation of such sales
catalogues.</p>


<p>The designation "nuovo" (or "nuova," "nuovi") found following
the indication of size in the 1586 and 1589 catalogues, remains a
riddle. The most likely interpretation is that it refers to reprint
editions, an explanation which holds true for a majority of items
designated "nuovo." It cannot mean recent publications, since the
imprints cover the range from 1575 to 1589. It may mean new, as
against second-hand copies, but this is highly doubtful, since it
is assumed that most items advertised were available in several
copies, as must definitely be the case for the 1586-1589 imprints,
just off the press and presumably all new. It seems unlikely that
"nuovo" refers to a special kind of size, since it is used in
connection with folio, 4to, 8vo and 16mo.</p>

<p>Sales catalogues chosen here for the comparative study are those
printed in Armandus, <hi rend="italic">Declaratio</hi> (1586)
<ref target="f001.07.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref>
and Bobali, <hi rend="italic">Rime</hi>
(1589)<ref target="f001.07.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>  The relative position of
individual
items in those catalogues is indicated in the tabular presentation,
preceding the price. Data from the LeRoy list of 1592 have been
added to

 <pb entity="sb01881" n="001.088"/>

 <!-- <figure entity="sb01881"></figure> -->

 <pb entity="sb01891" n="001.089"/>

 <!-- <figure entity="sb01891"></figure> -->

<pb n="001.090"/>

illustrate the sales progress during the three following years.
Since the 1592 catalogue includes the dates of printing, it is of
particular value in identifying editions in the two earlier
catalogues. By re-arranging chronologically the items listed in the
sales catalogues of the Armandus and the Bobali, the business
success of Manassi and the Aldus family is portrayed somewhat in
the fashion of an inventory.</p>

 <div2  id="vol001.07.03" type="section" n="3">
<head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">COMMENTARY AND CONCLUSION</hi></head>

<p>The first two items in the tabular presentation are the only
"remainders" from the period of Andrea Asolano who conducted the
affairs of the Aldus establishment from 1515 to 1529. They like the
following items (nos. 3-5) were apparently sold out between the
years 1586 and 1589. Six items (nos. 6-11) belong to the late
period of Paolo Manuzio. The rest (nos. 12-76) are the products of
the younger Aldo Manuzio or his manager Manassi.</p>

<p>In the tabular presentation the number of items, listed by year
in Renouard, is added in parentheses after the years 1563 to 1589,
to provide comparative information on sales versus production.
Thus, we find that of 185 publications listed by Renouard for the
period 1563-1574<ref target="f001.07.18" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref>  all but six had
been sold out by 1586. Quite obviously the picture is less
favorable as we approach the date of 1586.</p>


<p>Of 64 items listed in the 1586 sales catalogue, thirteen (nos.
1-5, 8, 10, 23, 25, 36, 43, 51, and 60), or roughly one-fifth were
not relisted in the catalogue of 1589, and therefore were probably
sold. However, two of these

<pb n="001.100"/>

were again listed in 1592, possibly as single copies. Eight more
items (nos. 7, 12, 24, 27, 49, 58, 63, and 76) from the original 64
were omitted in the 1592 listing and can be considered
"out-of-print."</p>

<p>Three items (nos. 9, 16, and 20), though printed between 1569
and 1578, are listed in the 1592 catalogue only; they may possibly
be single copies.</p>

<p>Several items were listed in one of the catalogues in one
edition, sold out, reprinted, and listed in another edition in a
later catalogue, as for example Tasso's <hi rend="italic">Aminta</hi> (nos. 43 and
74).</p>

<p>Unfortunately we do not possess information on the size of
editions, or the number of copies still available at the time of
listing. In any case, this new type of advertising must have been
successful and profitable; otherwise Manassi would not have
continued the practice as persistently as he did.</p>

<p>The prices are in Venetian lire (or librae, livres, pounds) and
soldi. A comparison with book prices of other publishers of the
period has not been attempted. Price increases between lists (nos.
12-15, 18, 34, 37, 57, 59, 64, and 76) reflect the continued rise
of prices, typical for the second half of the 16th century. Why, in
contrast, the prices of a few items (nos. 24, 61 and especially 71,
the last drastically reduced from 1.10 to 0.10, if not a
typographical error) were reduced, is difficult to understand,
except that complete failure to sell may have been the reason.</p>

<p>As stated in the introduction, the ability to sell is an
indicator of "literary taste". It is beyond the scope of this study
to draw any conclusions in this matter, except for pointing to some
few examples: Of seven Tasso items (nos. 42-46, 53 and 74) only the
Aminta (nos. 43 and 74) seems to have been a commercial success.
All others remained listed throughout. Of nine Cicero items (nos.
8, 13, 22, 29, 34-35, 38-40) only the earliest imprint, the
<hi rend="italic">Epistolae ad Atticum</hi>, 1569, in Italian, went out of print
between 1586 and 1592. In all these cases competition from other
publishers has undoubtedly been a contributing factor. But the
competition was equally heavy for items which were sold
successfully. It may therefore, be safe to say that Tasso's
<hi rend="italic">Rime, Padre di famiglia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Rinaldo</hi> were not
too
popular in the 1580's. Similarly it would appear that Cicero, most
esteemed during the 15th and first half of the 16th century, had
lost ground by the end of this century
and that only the lower

<pb n="001.101"/>

intelligentsia, the literate whose reading was limited to works in
his native tongue, prolonged enthusiasm for Ciceronian writings.
Similar and less obvious conclusions could probably be drawn upon
a complete analysis of the Aldus sales catalogues; but this task is
left to the literary historian.</p>

<p>Bibliographical puzzles (or solutions) in connection with this
study are few. They are found in notes 4, 5, 8, 9 and 12 of the
tabular presentation. A more extended investigation of all known
Aldus sales catalogues&mdash;a long range plan&mdash;may well unearth
considerably more, and more valuable, information.</p>

manuscripts and also in Caxton's print, which, representing a lost

and it is frequently difficult to tell, on <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> grounds,

target="f001.08.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>  They are similar
in that each divides
the manuscripts<ref target="f001.08.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref>  into two groups
independently descended from a lost original.<ref
target="f001.08.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref>  But this
similarity is not real, for
the components of the two groups are different in each
classification, as one can see from footnote

<pb n="001.106"/>

4 above. Such confusion suggests that a bifid arrangement is
wrong.</p>




<p>In great part the confusion almost certainly arises from the
slightness of the variations. Each editor presumably regards a
somewhat different set of readings as significant for grouping the
manuscripts.<ref target="f001.08.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>  With long poems, of
course, it is often necessary to limit the number of variants&mdash;for
practical reasons. The <hi rend="italic">Purse</hi> is short, however, and by
considering all of the variant readings, I believe I can show that
a trifid arrangement is correct.</p>


<p>The classification proposed in this paper is hence
complete;<ref target="f001.08.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref>  and whether one agrees
with the argument or not, one has before one all of the evidence
upon which a classification may be based.</p>


<p>The <hi rend="italic">Purse</hi> manuscripts, with their sigils, are as
follows:<ref target="f001.08.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref>

<p>If my reasoning is correct, the following is the most probable
tree for these texts.</p>

<!-- <p><figure entity="sb011071"></figure></p> -->

<p>I. In explaining the tree, we may begin most conveniently with
the lowest MS. on it&mdash;A<hi rend="super">2</hi>. Miss Hammond has
proved that H and
A<hi rend="super">2</hi> are sister MSS,<ref
target="f001.08.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref>  but it is
nevertheless obvious that A<hi rend="super">2</hi> has no independent
<hi rend="italic">textual</hi>
value for the <hi rend="italic">Purse</hi>. Because the reading of H in line 11,
<hi rend="italic">Ie-lownesse</hi> (for <hi rend="italic">yelownesse</hi>), is obviously more

authoritative than the reading of A<hi rend="super">2</hi>, <hi rend="italic">eye
lownesse</hi>, I
have chosen H as the exemplar which more closely approximates the
common original of H and A<hi rend="super">2</hi>, and have hence diagramed
A<hi rend="super">2</hi>
as
descended from H and have omitted a separate discussion of it.</p>


<p>II. H and M share several readings found in no other MSS<ref
target="f001.08.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref>  and hence must be considered as closely
related. Neither can be considered as descended from the other,
however, for each text reads uniquely in places where the other
agrees with the rest

<pb n="001.108"/>

of the MSS.<ref target="f001.08.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref>  First, M's unique
readings (H's readings agree here with all other MSS):

<list>
<item>15. Omits <hi rend="italic">to me;</hi> H <hi rend="italic">to me</hi></item>

<item>16. Om. <hi rend="italic">downe;</hi> H <hi rend="italic">downe</hi></item>

<item>17. <hi rend="italic">pis night;</hi> H <hi rend="italic">thurgh youre
myght</hi></item>
</list>
</p>



<p>Note also this reading in M:

<list>
<item>7, 14, 21. <hi rend="italic">y muste;</hi> H <hi rend="italic">must I</hi>, the
word-order of
the rest of the MSS.</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>Now, H's unique readings (M's readings agree with the rest of
the MSS):

<list>
<item>2. Om. <hi rend="italic">be;</hi> M <hi rend="italic">be</hi></item>

<item>3. Om. <hi rend="italic">nowe;</hi> M <hi rend="italic">nowe</hi></item>

<item>10. <hi rend="italic">To . . . as;</hi> M <hi rend="italic">Or . . .
lyke</hi></item>

<item>12. <hi rend="italic">feere;</hi> M <hi rend="italic">stere</hi></item>

<item>20. Om. <hi rend="italic">thus;</hi> M <hi rend="italic">thus</hi></item>
</list>
</p>

<p>Note also these readings in H:

<list>
<item>5. <hi rend="italic">on biere;</hi> M <hi rend="italic">vpon my bere</hi>, the
reading
of all
MSS except P Cx (see section VI below, in which it is shown that P
Cx have a common original).</item>

<item>15. <hi rend="italic">my lif my light;</hi> M <hi rend="italic">my hertis
light</hi>.
Both
readings are unique, yet M's is closer to the generally supported
reading, <hi rend="italic">my lyves lyght</hi>.</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>H and M share these unique readings:

<list>
<item>11. H <hi rend="italic">yowre Ie-lownesse bath no peere;</hi> M
<hi rend="italic">youre
yelownes bathe no pere</hi>. For reasons which will become apparent,
Chaucer's original (the <hi rend="italic">x</hi> of the tree) must be assumed to
have read <hi rend="italic">That of yelownesse had neuer pere</hi>.</item>

<item>16. <hi rend="italic">souerayn lady</hi>. The rest of the MSS read
<hi rend="italic">saveour</hi>.</item>

<item>20. Both MSS read line 6 here and omit the usual <hi rend="italic">But yet
I pray unto your curtesye</hi>.</item>
</list>
</p>

<pb n="001.109"/>

<p>On the basis of the above shared unique readings, we may assume
ex <hi rend="super">2</hi>HM,<ref target="f001.08.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref>  which we may call
<hi rend="italic">a</hi>. The significant readings of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> are as follows:

<list>
<item>1. to</item>

<item>4. yf</item>

<item>5. Me were as lefe to be leyde vpon my bere</item>

<item>7, 14, 21. must I</item>

<item>10. Or se</item>

<item>11. That of youre yelownesse hath no pere</item>

<item>13. Quene of comforte and of company</item>

<item>15. Now purse</item>

<item>16. And souerayne lady downe in this world here</item>

<item>18. Sith</item>

<item>20. ffor which vnto yowre mercy thus I crye</item>

<item>22ff. Om. Envoy</item>
</list>
</p>


<p>III. CC<hi rend="sub">2</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> share several unique readings.
Because
of the following unique reading in <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, however, we cannot
assume the descent <hi rend="italic">a</hi> &gt; CC<hi rend="sub">2</hi>:

<list>
<item>11. <hi rend="italic">That of youre yelownesse hath no pere</hi>.
CC<hi rend="sub">2</hi>,
which reads <hi rend="italic">neuer no pere</hi>, must belong with the MSS in
which
<hi rend="italic">neuer</hi> occurs (i.e., all except <hi rend="italic">a);</hi> further,
CC<hi rend="sub">2</hi>
omits <hi rend="italic">youre</hi> with all other MSS.</item>
</list>

Nor, because of the following unique readings in CC<hi rend="sub">2</hi> (where
<hi rend="italic">a</hi> and the rest of the MSS agree), can we assume the descent
<hi rend="italic">a</hi> &lt; CC<hi rend="sub">2</hi>:

<list>
<item>1. Om. <hi rend="italic">to;</hi> a <hi rend="italic">to</hi></item>

<item>15ff. CC<hi rend="sub">2</hi> om. third stanza and envoy; <hi rend="italic">a</hi>,
although
it omits the envoy, contains the third stanza.</item>
</list>

Note also these readings in CC<hi rend="sub">2</hi>:

<list>
<item>4. Om. <hi rend="italic">yf;</hi> a <hi rend="italic">yf</hi>, the reading of all
other
MSS
except A Cx P.<ref target="f001.08.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> </item>

<pb n="001.110"/>

<item>5. <hi rend="italic">Me were A leef to be layd opon my bere;</hi> a
<hi rend="italic">Me
were as lefe to be leyde upon my bere</hi>, a reading closer to the
generally supported reading, which omits <hi rend="italic">to</hi>.</item>
</list>

CC<hi rend="sub">2</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> share the following unique readings:

<list>
<item>5. <hi rend="italic">to be leyde upon my bere</hi>. All other MSS om.
<hi rend="italic">to</hi>.</item>

<item>11. <hi rend="italic">no pere</hi>. All other MSS om.
<hi rend="italic">no</hi>.</item>
</list>

The following reading may be taken as corroborative evidence:

<list>
<item>7, 14. <hi rend="italic">must</hi>. All other MSS except CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi><ref
target="f001.08.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref>  have variations of
<hi rend="italic">mote</hi>.</item>
</list>
</p>



<p>On the basis of the above readings, we may assume ex <hi rend="super">2</hi>
<hi rend="italic">a</hi> CC<hi rend="sub">2</hi>, <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, the significant readings of
which, as
they differ from those of <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, are as follows:

<list>
<item>11. That of yelownesse hath never no pere</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>IV. H<hi rend="super">2</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> share two unique
readings. However,
because of the following unique readings in <hi rend="italic">b</hi> (where
H<hi rend="super">2</hi>
and the rest of the MSS agree), we cannot assume the descent
<hi rend="italic">b</hi> &gt; H<hi rend="super">2</hi>:

<list>
<item>5. <hi rend="italic">to be layde;</hi> H<hi rend="super">2</hi> <hi rend="italic">be
leyde</hi></item>

<item>16. <hi rend="italic">souerayne lady;</hi> H<hi rend="super">2</hi>
<hi rend="italic">saveoure</hi></item>

<item>20. Reads line 6 here; H<hi rend="super">2</hi> <hi rend="italic">But yitte I pray
vn-to your
courtesye</hi></item>

<item>22ff. Om. envoy; H<hi rend="super">2</hi> has the envoy</item>
</list>

Nor, because of the following unique readings in H<hi rend="super">2</hi>
(where
<hi rend="italic">b</hi> and the rest of the MSS agree), can we assume the descent
<hi rend="italic">b</hi> &lt; H<hi rend="super">2</hi>:

<list>
<item>10. <hi rend="italic">Or shew . . . to;</hi> b <hi rend="italic">Or se</hi> (om.
<hi rend="italic">to</hi>)</item>

<item>15. <hi rend="italic">Yee pursse;</hi> b <hi rend="italic">Now
purse</hi></item>
</list>

Note also this reading in H<hi rend="super">2</hi>:

<list>
<item>16. <hi rend="italic">as in pis worlde doune here</hi>. Although in reading

<hi rend="italic">downe in this world here b</hi> incorrectly omits
<hi rend="italic">as</hi>, it
preserves the generally supported word-order.<ref
target="f001.08.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref> </item>
</list>
</p>


<pb n="001.111"/>

<p>H<hi rend="super">2</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> share this unique reading:

<list>
<item>13. Om. <hi rend="italic">good</hi>. All other MSS read
<hi rend="italic">good</hi>.</item>
</list>

These readings are also significant:

<list>
<item>11. H<hi rend="super">2</hi> <hi rend="italic">neuer his pere;</hi> b
<hi rend="italic">neuer no
pere</hi>. The
extra word is uniquely common to these MSS.</item>

<item>18. <hi rend="italic">Sith</hi>. All other texts except CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi> and the
Thynne
print of 1532 read <hi rend="italic">Syn</hi>.<ref
target="f001.08.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> </item>
</list>
</p>


<p>On the basis of these readings we may assume ex <hi rend="super">2</hi>
<hi rend="italic">b</hi>
H<hi rend="super">2</hi>, <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, the significant readings of which, as
they differ
from those of <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, are as follows:

<list>
<item>5. be leyde</item>

<item>16. saveoure</item>

<item>20. But yitte I pray vn-to your courtesye</item>

<item>22ff. The envoy presumably read as in
H<hi rend="super">2</hi>.</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>V. Before considering the group A CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi> Cx P, I shall give
briefly the evidence for the classification of the sixteenth,
seventeenth, and eighteenth-century printed versions of the
<hi rend="italic">Purse</hi>. Since they all derive ultimately from Cx, they are of
no value in establishing a text.<ref target="f001.08.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref>
The descent often can be determined only through shared spellings
since many of these texts are practically identical. The copy in
Thynne's 1532 edition of <hi rend="italic">The Workes</hi> (sig.
Vvv4<hi rend="super">b</hi>) is
almost identical with Cx: the only variations of importance are the
substitution of <hi rend="italic">arte</hi> for <hi rend="italic">be</hi> in line 15, and
<hi rend="italic">Sithe</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Syn</hi> in line 18. The copies in the 1542
and
the undated (1545?) Thynne (sig. TT5<hi rend="super">a</hi> and
Qqq4<hi rend="super">b</hi>
respectively)
are independently descended from the 1532 volume, as can be
determined from the spellings which the undated Thynne shares with
the 1532 but not with the 1542. The only variant reading of any
importance is the undated Thynne's
error <hi rend="italic">tresour</hi> for <hi rend="italic">tresorere</hi> in line 18. The copy
in
Stow's 1561

<pb n="001.112"/>

edition of <hi rend="italic">The Workes</hi> (sig.
O006<hi rend="super">6</hi>-Ppp1<hi rend="super">a</hi>), is
descended
from the copy in the undated Thynne edition, sharing with it
<hi rend="italic">tresoure</hi> but misreading <hi rend="italic">worde</hi> for
<hi rend="italic">worlde</hi>, l.
16, and <hi rend="italic">Burtes</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Brutes</hi>, l. 22. The copy in
Speght-s 1598 edition of <hi rend="italic">The Workes</hi> (sig.
O005<hi rend="super">b</hi>-O006<hi rend="super">a</hi>)
is descended from Stow: it leaves uncorrected the three misreadings
mentioned above but introduces no new errors. The copy in Speght's
1602 edition (sig. Iii3<hi rend="super">a</hi>) "corrects" the errors of its
predecessor (<hi rend="italic">treasoure</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">treasure</hi>,
<hi rend="italic">Burtes</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">Brutes</hi>, <hi rend="italic">word</hi>
becomes
<hi rend="italic">world</hi>) but for some unknown reason attributes the poem to
Hoccleve. This copy introduces a few slight variants (these are
found also in its offsprings, a copy in a 1649 pamphlet reprinted
and discussed by P. B. Mitchell in <hi rend="italic">MLN</hi>, li [1936], 436, and
the reprint in the 1687 Speght). The last text we need consider is
the copy in Urry's 1721 <hi rend="italic">The Works of
Geoffrey Chaucer, Compared with the Former Editions, and many
valuable MSS</hi> (p. 549). Despite the pretensions of the book's
title, this copy is only a sophisticated version of Stow.</p>


<p>VI. CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi> Cx P share one unique reading. Because CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi> is a
fragment, containing also a number of unique readings, neither Cx
nor P can be descended from it:

<list>

to
the
reading we must assume for <hi rend="italic">x</hi>, <hi rend="italic">all oure

</list>
</p>



<p>Neither CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi> nor Cx can be descended from P:

<list>
<item>4. <hi rend="italic">But certes;</hi> Cx <hi rend="italic">For certes</hi>, the
reading
of

<item>4. <hi rend="italic">ye now make;</hi> P <hi rend="italic">but ye make</hi>, the
reading of

reading
of all

Note also the following unique spelling in Cx:

<list>
<item>19. <hi rend="italic">ony;</hi> CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi> P <hi rend="italic">any</hi>, the usual
spelling.</item>
</list>

CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi> Cx P share one unique reading:

read
<hi rend="italic">song</hi>.</item>
</list>

<pb n="001.114"/>

Note these other readings as corroborative evidence:

bere</hi>. P <hi rend="italic">up on bere</hi>, Cx <hi rend="italic">upon a
bere</hi>.</item>

<item>8. <hi rend="italic">yet</hi>. The rest of the MSS read <hi rend="italic">it</hi>.
Presumably, Cx and P's unusual spelling arose from a parent MS.
whose parent, in turn, read <hi rend="italic">yt.</hi></item>

<item>25. CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi> Cx P depart from the reading which we must assume

to be that of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> (see section X below), <hi rend="italic">all oure

<p>VII. A and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> share two readings, one unique, the other,

although not unique, believed to be significant for grouping A with
<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Because, however, of the following unique readings in A
(where <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and the rest of the MSS agree), we cannot assume
the descent <hi rend="italic">d</hi> &lt; A:

<list>
<item>4. <hi rend="italic">any;</hi> d <hi rend="italic">heuy</hi></item>

<item>13. Om. <hi rend="italic">of;</hi> d <hi rend="italic">of</hi></item>

<item>21. Om. <hi rend="italic">mote;</hi> d <hi rend="italic">mote</hi></item>

<item>22ff. A omits the envoy</item>
</list>

Note these unique spellings in A:

<list>
<item>7. <hi rend="italic">dey;</hi> d <hi rend="italic">dye</hi>, the usual
spelling.</item>

<item>20. <hi rend="italic">Rut</hi> (an obvious scribal error); d
<hi rend="italic">But</hi>.</item>
</list>
</p>

<pb n="001.115"/>

<p>Nor, because of the following unique readings in <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
(where
A agrees with the rest of the MSS), can we assume the descent
<hi rend="italic">d</hi> &gt; A:

<list>
<item>5. <hi rend="italic">upon bere;</hi> A <hi rend="italic">upon my
bere</hi></item>

<item>8. <hi rend="italic">yet;</hi> A <hi rend="italic">hit</hi></item>
</list>
</p>

<p>A and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> share these readings:

<list>
<item>4. Om. <hi rend="italic">if</hi>. All other MSS except CC<hi rend="sub">2</hi> read
<hi rend="italic">if</hi>.</item>

<item>7, 14, 21. <hi rend="italic">Be</hi>. All other MSS read some form of
<hi rend="italic">Beth</hi>.</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>Although this evidence is not strong, it is stronger than any
other evidence for placing A; hence I think we may assume ex <hi rend="super">2</hi>
<hi rend="italic">d</hi> A, <hi rend="italic">e</hi>, the significant readings of which, as
they
differ from those of <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, are as follows:

<list>
<item>4. For certes but ye make me heuy chere</item>

<item>5. vpon my bere</item>

<item>8. hit</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>VIII. Because of the following unique readings in <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
(where <hi rend="italic">e</hi> agrees with the two MSS not yet considered, F and
Ff), we cannot assume the descent <hi rend="italic">e</hi> &lt; <hi rend="italic">c:</hi>

<list>
<item>11. <hi rend="italic">had never no pere;</hi> e <hi rend="italic">had neuer
pere</hi></item>

<item>13. Om. <hi rend="italic">good;</hi> e <hi rend="italic">good</hi></item>
</list>
</p>

<p>Nor, because of the following unique readings in <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
(where
<hi rend="italic">c</hi> agrees with F Ff), can we assume the descent
<hi rend="italic">e</hi>
&gt;
<hi rend="italic">c</hi>:

<list>
<item>4. Om. <hi rend="italic">if;</hi> c <hi rend="italic">if</hi></item>

<item>24. Om. <hi rend="italic">song;</hi> c <hi rend="italic">song</hi></item>

<item>25. Om. <hi rend="italic">oure;</hi> c (with Ff)
<hi rend="italic">oure</hi></item>
</list>
</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> share one reading which is not
shared
by
the two MSS yet to be considered (F Ff):

<list>
<item>19. <hi rend="italic">For I am shave as nigh as any frere</hi></item>
</list>

This line must be assumed to be the reading of the prototype.
Otherwise we must assume, as will appear, that <hi rend="italic">x</hi> read
<hi rend="italic">For
I am shave as nye as is any frere</hi> (a reading found only in Ff).
Hence

<pb n="001.116"/>

we cannot consider that <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> had an
exclusive
common ancestor. Each rather represents a group derived
independently from an unknown parent MS.</p>

<p>IX. F and Ff share a number of unique readings. Because of these
unique readings in Ff, however, we cannot assume the descent F &lt;
Ff:

<list>
<item>11. <hi rend="italic">the lewdnesse;</hi> F <hi rend="italic">yelownesse</hi>, the
reading of
<hi rend="italic">c e</hi>.</item>

<item>19. Om. <hi rend="italic">nye;</hi> F <hi rend="italic">nye</hi>, the reading of
<hi rend="italic">c
e</hi>.</item>
</list>

Note also these two spellings in Ff:

<list>
<item>7, 14. <hi rend="italic">deye;</hi> F <hi rend="italic">dye</hi>, the usual
spelling.</item>

<item>21. <hi rend="italic">erlles;</hi> F <hi rend="italic">elles</hi>, the usual
spelling.</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>Nor, because of these unique readings in F, can we assume the
descent F &gt; Ff:

<list>
<item>19. <hi rend="italic">a;</hi> Ff <hi rend="italic">any</hi>, the reading of <hi rend="italic">c
e</hi>.</item>

<item>25. <hi rend="italic">alle myn harme;</hi> Ff <hi rend="italic">all oure
harmes</hi>,
the
reading of <hi rend="italic">c</hi>.</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>F and Ff share these unique readings:

<list>
<item>18. <hi rend="italic">bene</hi>. The other MSS read
<hi rend="italic">be</hi>.</item>

<item>19. <hi rend="italic">is</hi>. The other MSS omit.</item>

<item>25. <hi rend="italic">mowen</hi>. This form varies in all other
copies.</item>
</list>

Note also these two unique spellings:

<list>
<item>8. <hi rend="italic">voucheth sauf</hi>. This phrase was troublesome to
nearly all of the <hi rend="italic">Purse</hi> scribes (A <hi rend="italic">vouchesafe;</hi>
A<hi rend="super">2</hi>
H <hi rend="italic">fouchesauf;</hi> CC<hi rend="sub">2</hi> <hi rend="italic">wouschsaf;</hi> Cx
<hi rend="italic">vouchesauf;</hi>
H<hi rend="super">2</hi> <hi rend="italic">wouchepe save;</hi> M
<hi rend="italic">fouchesaufe;</hi> P
<hi rend="italic">vouch
sauf</hi>).</item>

<item>14. <hi rend="italic">ayeyne</hi></item>
</list>
</p>

<p>On the basis of the above readings we may assume ex <hi rend="super">2</hi> F Ff,
<hi rend="italic">f</hi>, the significant readings of which are as follows:

<list>
<item>4. but yf</item>

<item>7, 14, 21. Beth</item>

<item>13. of gode companye</item>

<item>18. Syn</item>

<item>19. For I am shave as nye as is any frere<ref
target="f001.08.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref> </item>

<pb n="001.117"/>

<item>24. song</item>

<item>25. all oure harmes</item>
</list>
</p>


<p>X. Neither <hi rend="italic">c</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">e</hi> can be descended
from <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
because of <hi rend="italic">f</hi>'s reading:

<list>
<item>19. <hi rend="italic">For I am shave as nye as is any frere</hi>. Here
<hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> agree on <hi rend="italic">as nygh as any
frere</hi>.</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>XI. <hi rend="italic">f</hi> shares with <hi rend="italic">c</hi> these readings not
found
in
<hi rend="italic">e:</hi>

<list>
<item>4. <hi rend="italic">but if</hi>. <hi rend="italic">e</hi> omits
<hi rend="italic">if</hi></item>

<item>7, 14, 21. <hi rend="italic">Beth</hi> e <hi rend="italic">Be</hi></item>

<item>24. <hi rend="italic">song</hi>. <hi rend="italic">e</hi> omits
<hi rend="italic">song</hi></item>

<item>25. <hi rend="italic">all oure harmes</hi> e <hi rend="italic">all
harmes</hi></item>
</list>
</p>

<p>But <hi rend="italic">f</hi> shares with <hi rend="italic">e</hi> these readings not
found
in
<hi rend="italic">c:</hi>

<list>
<item>13. <hi rend="italic">gode</hi>. <hi rend="italic">c</hi> omits
<hi rend="italic">gode</hi></item>

<item>18. <hi rend="italic">Syn.</hi> c <hi rend="italic">Sith</hi><ref
target="f001.08.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref> </item>
</list>
</p>


<p>Hence we must suppose that <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, <hi rend="italic">e</hi>, and
<hi rend="italic">f</hi> all
derive independently from one parent (the <hi rend="italic">x</hi> of the
tree).</p>

<p>XII. From the tree it will be seen that four MSS (F Ff A
H<hi rend="super">2</hi>)
are all at one remove from the original. Of these Ff has the fewest
unique readings and is in general a good text. It therefore forms
the basis of the text which I now print.</p>

<p>When one compares this text with Skeat's and Robinson's, one
does not find a great many differences,<ref target="f001.08.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref>  a fact which
should not be surprising, since all three texts are based on the same manuscript. The
differences are:

<pb n="001.119"/>

<list>
<item>3. <hi rend="italic">been</hi>. Skeat <hi rend="italic">be</hi>.</item>

<item>4. <hi rend="italic">ffor certes but yf ye make me hevy chere</hi>. Skeat

<item>11. <hi rend="italic">That of yelownesse had neuer pere</hi>. Skeat and

</p>



<p>Because the differences between my text and Skeat's and
Robinson's, while numerous, are rather trivial, a natural question
now&mdash;at least a question frequently asked&mdash;is this: If a text is
to stay substantially the same, why go to the trouble of
"establishing" it?<ref target="f001.08.25" n="25"><hi rend="super">25</hi></ref>  Is the work
worth doing, really? An answer lies readily at hand in Dr.
B&uuml;hler's comments on the Morgan MS.:

<q>Does line 17 in the Morgan MS. [<hi rend="italic">Oute of this toune helpe me
pis night</hi>] mean that Chaucer wanted money to leave Greenwich
and thus avoid an expected encounter with the sheriff? . . . The
lines (apart from the Envoy) suggest a date not later than May 4,
1398, for on that day King Richard took Chaucer "into his special
protection. . . ." After that date Chaucer had no reason to press
for money so urgently, or, for that matter, to leave town
precipitously. This is true not only of the poem as it stands in
the Morgan MS. but also in the other MSS.; the Morgan text (in line
17) mainly emphasizes Chaucer's immediate need of money. This
argues for a date earlier than May 4th, 1398; in that case, the
Morgan text may be construed to represent the earlier version of
the poem.<ref target="f001.08.26" n="26"><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref> </q></p>



<pb n="001.120"/>

<p>Chaucer's biography is so meager that it is tempting to make any
inferences we can. I think my study shows, however, that we must
reject any inferences drawn from line 17 in the Morgan MS. From the
evidence set forth in section 11 above, we must conclude that the
Morgan MS. is the sister of Harley 2251&mdash;that the two manuscripts
have an exclusive common ancestor, the <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of my tree. From
the evidence set forth in sections III and IV, we must conclude
that <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is the sister of CC<hi rend="sub">2</hi>,<ref
target="f001.08.27" n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref>  and that,
in turn, the exclusive common
ancestor of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and CC<hi rend="sub">2</hi> (the <hi rend="italic">b</hi> of my tree)
is the
sister of Harley 7333. Now in line 17 Harley 2251 and Harley 7333
read <hi rend="italic">Out of this towne help me thurgh youre myght;</hi> this is
the reading of the rest of the manuscripts also. Hence the reading
of <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, the parent of the Morgan MS., must have been
<hi rend="italic">thurgh
youre myght</hi>, and the variant <hi rend="italic">pis night</hi> the emendation
of
a scribe.</p>

independently descended from <hi rend="italic">x;</hi> hence we must assume the
reading of Cx P A to be that of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> (note also the reading of
A<hi rend="super">2</hi> H).
CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi>'s reading, however, leaves us with two additional problems:
the agreement in word-order with H<hi rend="super">2</hi> and the agreement
in the
variant <hi rend="italic">worde</hi> with the Stow print. For the first of these I
can offer no explanation except to remark on the general badness of
CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi>'s text, a badness which suggests memorial transcription. I
am forced to regard the agreement in word-order with H<hi rend="super">2</hi>
as
accidental in view of the rather strong evidence for grouping
CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi> with Cx P in l. 24. The second agreement is even more
remarkable when considered with the next line, for there CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi>
reads <hi rend="italic">tresour</hi> with Stow. Yet we know that Stow's reading
derives from the 1545(?) Thynne. It is chronologically impossible,
of course, that CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi> be descended from Thynne or Stow, and there
seems to be no reason for thinking that Thynne or Stow utilized
CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi>, since their texts are otherwise in close agreement with
their printed predecessors. The explanation must lie in the
character of the variants. Both
<hi rend="italic">tresour</hi> and <hi rend="italic">worde</hi> make a sort of obvious
sense, and
hence both may be sophistications; or they may be misprints in
Thynne and Stow, graphic errors in CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi> (note that CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi>'s
scribe drops a letter in <hi rend="italic">shave</hi>, l. 19, reading
<hi rend="italic">shae</hi>).
(Professor Hench has called my attention, since I wrote this note,
to the fact that <hi rend="italic">word</hi> is commonly found for
<hi rend="italic">world</hi>
in
Middle English texts (cf. <hi rend="italic">NED</hi>). Hence the form in CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi>
is
quite probably only a variant spelling.)
Such striking agreements as the <hi rend="italic">tresourworde</hi> pair show how
necessary it is to consider all variant readings in constructing a

to follow no consistent plan: for instance, he adopts the spelling
of Cx P, <hi rend="italic">purs</hi>, in l. 15, although the spelling of F,
<hi rend="italic">purse</hi>, is found also in A A<hi rend="super">2</hi> [CC<hi rend="sub">1</hi>] H

in
two of the three branches of the tree and hence must be assumed to
have been in the original. Furthermore, it would seem more probable
that a scribe would emend to make the line more regular than emend
to make it less regular. (It may be well to remind the reader that
the <hi rend="italic">x</hi> of the tree is only the archetype of the eleven
<hi rend="italic">Purse</hi> MSS; that it is not necessarily identical with

<p>THE RECENT REVOLUTIONARY STUDIES in the field of
headlines by
Bowers,<ref target="f001.09.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>  McManaway, Hinman and

others among my colleagues have suggested to me that I might try my
prentice hand at this line of investigation. For this trial effort,
I chose an English incunabulum in the Pierpont Morgan Library<ref
target="f001.09.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>  which might prove valuable from a
bibliographical point of view even if, for the literary student,
the book is singularly lacking in appeal. The results of my study
are set forth below; they are interesting though, perhaps,
inconclusive&mdash;the latter being the possible result of my
inexperience in this form of bibliographical research.</p>



<p>The volume under examination is the <hi rend="italic">Year-Book 37 Henry
VI</hi>
credited to the press of William de Machlinia in London and
apparently printed between 1486 and 1490. The collation of the
volume, as given by Duff 422,<ref target="f001.09.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref>  is:
[a<hi rend="super">8-1</hi>] b-f<hi rend="super">8</hi> g h<hi rend="super">6</hi>. The
information as to the
first quire is
somewhat uninformative. Upon

<pb n="001.126"/>

careful study it becomes evident that folio 3 is an insert as it is
printed on different paper from the rest of the quire; the
watermarks and the stub found between folios 5 and 6 of the Morgan
and Exeter College copies confirm this. Apparently this leaf was
forgotten or overlooked when the quire went to press and the
omission was made good by an insert. According to Dr. Greg's
formulary, the first quire would be described as
<hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="super">6</hi>(a2+1). For reasons which I set forth in
my Rosenbach
lecture (1947), I should prefer to describe this as [a<hi rend="super">7</hi>; a3
disjunct) or, as expressed in M. Polain's<ref
target="f001.09.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref>  form,
[a<hi rend="super">7</hi>(4+3, le 3<hi rend="super">e</hi>
encart&eacute;)].</p>



<p>Before turning to the volume itself, a word may be said about
the headlines in such fifteenth-century books as the present
example. It is, of course, a commonplace observation that early
type was often somewhat crudely cut and easily subject to damage;
frequently the ink was carelessly applied and, being thin, tended
to spread and distort the face of the type. This at once simplifies
and complicates the examination of the headlines. While the variety
of tied letters in the earlier fonts makes it easy to sort out the
headlines into readily identifiable groups, the indistinct
characters and bad inking make it extremely difficult, on occasion,
to determine whether a specific headline on one page is the same as
that on another or whether the apparent identity is just an
instance of a headline reset with the identical combination of tied
letters and reasonably comparable spacing. The headlines in the
present volume have been minutely examined as to letter-press, and
calliper
measurements of over-all length and spacings have been carefully
recorded;<ref target="f001.09.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>  for the purposes of this
discussion, only those running heads will be admitted which can,
with reasonable certainty, be assumed to be identical.</p>


<pb n="001.127"/>

<p>One peculiarity of the headlines in this book must be pointed
out at once, since it is of special significance. In normal
circumstances (and especially in books of a later date), a
particular headline, when it forms part of a permanent
skeleton,<ref target="f001.09.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref>  must necessarily always
be in the same position<ref target="f001.09.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref>  relative
to the edges of the type-page. In this <hi rend="italic">Year-Book</hi>, however,
the position of a specific headline is not so invariable. For
example, in quire b the eight verso running-heads show five
(possibly more) different positions relative to the (printed)
left-hand edge of the type-page, the maximum difference being as
much as 13 millimetres. Dr. Fredson Bowers has kindly suggested to
me what is surely the only reasonable explanation for this
phenomenon. It is possible that the long lines of the folio volume
made it difficult for the pressman to pick up a whole line of type
(that is, the headline with its letter-press
and quads) without danger of pieing. Thus one may assume, in this
case, that in transferring the parts of a skeleton from one forme
to assemble them again around the type-pages of the next one, the
printer merely picked up the letter-press of the headline, centered
it (as nearly as he could judge) to the text-page and filled up the
rest of this line to the edge of the type-page with the loose quads
from the forme about to be distributed. This would adequately
explain the variations in the position of the headline from page to
page.</p>



<p>Turning now to the actual headlines in Machlinia's
<hi rend="italic">Year-Book</hi>, we find that, with three exceptions,<ref
target="f001.09.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref>  each recto page contains the words
"Henrici sexti." The versos usually indicate the four terms of
court (Michaelmas, Hilary, Easter

<pb n="001.128"/>

and Trinity). The recto headlines are extant in at least three
different settings that can easily be spotted:

<list>
<item>(1). Thorned <hi rend="italic">H; ri</hi> tied</item>

<item>(2). Thorned <hi rend="italic">H; ri</hi> separate letters</item>

<item>(3). Unthorned <hi rend="italic">H; ri</hi> tied</item>
</list>

As the investigation will at this stage be simplified by confining
our study to the last three gatherings (f-h), it will be seen that
the verso headlines cover the Trinity term (Tri&nmacr; xxxvij) and
appear in four different settings:

<list>
<item>(a). <hi rend="italic">ri</hi> tied; <hi rend="italic">j</hi> undotted; 5 mm. space;
30
mm.
over-all<ref target="f001.09.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> </item>

<item>(b). <hi rend="italic">ri</hi> tied; <hi rend="italic">j</hi> dotted; 3 mm. space; 28
mm.
over-all</item>

<item>(c). <hi rend="italic">ri</hi> tied; <hi rend="italic">j</hi> dotted; 1 mm. space; 26
mm.
over-all</item>

<item>(d). <hi rend="italic">ri</hi> separate; <hi rend="italic">j</hi> undotted; 30 mm.
over-all</item>
</list>
</p>



<p>Now the outer formes of quire f regularly have the combination:
Trinity (c)&mdash;Henry (1); the inner formes, however, have with the
same regularity: Trinity (a)&mdash;Henry (3). In the case of gathering
g. both inner and outer formes have the headlines: Trinity
(b)&mdash;Henry (1). The headlines of quire h are decidedly more
complicated. The first two sheets (h1.6 and h2.5) have in both
formes:<ref target="f001.09.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref>  Trinity (d)&mdash;Henry
(3);
but the inner and outer formes of the innermost (h3.4) both have:
Trinity (b)&mdash;Henry (1). The result then is this: in gathering f,
Machlinia had and used two skeletons, one for the outer forme and
the other for the inner; in quire g he used but one skeleton (a
variant of that found in &dollar;(0) of f); and, for quire h, he employed
for the outer two sheets a variant of the skeleton used in the
inner forme of f. Since the innermost sheet of h is printed with
the same running heads as quire g, it probably indicates that when
Machlinia had set his
type through folio 4 recto, he was ready to print the inner forme
of the innermost sheet and proceeded to do so with the skeleton
that had just been

<pb n="001.129"/>

used for printing the last forme of g (whichever one that may have
been).<ref target="f001.09.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref>  While this sheet was
printing, Machlinia put in a new head, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> Trinity (d), for
the skeleton used for the inner forme of f in order to print the
middle sheet of h as well as the inner forme of the outer sheet;
the recto headline also appears on h1.</p>



<p>Turning now to the earlier gatherings, we find that the
headlines for quire c are perplexing but afford information of a
rather speculative sort. Here are found on the versos three forms
for the headline for Hilary term:

<list>
<item>(&agr;). Hill' xxxvij&mdash;c4, c5 and c6</item>

<item>(&bgr;). Hillarij xxxvij&mdash;c8 (and d1)</item>

<item>(&ggr;). Hillarij xxxiiij (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>)&mdash;c2 and
c7</item>
</list>

A study of the sheets <hi rend="italic">in their bound and quired form</hi> (not
that of production) supplies the following information. The
skeleton for the previous printed forme (be that either forme of
the outer sheet of gathering b) contained the headline "Mich&imacr;s
xxxvij&mdash;Henry (2)" and this reappears in the first inner forme of
c (c1<hi rend="super">v</hi>-c8). For the outer forme, and for all the other
versos
(save c3), Machlinia required a new running title for Hilary term.
Thus he here used Hilary (&bgr;) for c8<hi rend="super">v</hi> and, for c1,
Henry (1).
This latter heading had been previously employed for the printing
of the rectos of b6 and [a3-5].</p>

<p>For the next sheet (c2-c7), Machlinia used another headline. The
skeleton then contained, for the outer forme, the incorrect Hilary
(&ggr;)<ref target="f001.09.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref>  and Henry (1). This same
skeleton was

<pb n="001.130"/>

employed for the inner forme, with the result that the Hilary (&ggr;)
headline on c2<hi rend="super">v</hi> was then wrong in two respects since,
instead of
Michaelmas 37, it read Hilary 34.</p>


<p>In the case of the third and fourth sheets of signature c,<ref
target="f001.09.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref>  Machlinia was obliged to meet a rather
complex situation, for whereas the outer forme of the former and
the inner of the latter had the same headline, the complementary
formes did not. For the formes with the identical headline,<ref
target="f001.09.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref>  he used a running title reading Hilary
(&agr;)&mdash;Henry (2); this corrects the error of Hilary (&ggr;) of the
second sheet.</p>



<p>Beginning with the outer sheet, the headlines may be summarized
thus:

<list>
<item>Quire c   1.8(o):   Henry (1)&mdash;Hilary (&bgr;)</item>

<item>             (i):   Henry (2)&mdash;Mich&imacr;s xxxvij</item>

<item>          2.7(o.i): Henry (1)&mdash;Hilary (&ggr;)</item>

<item>          3.6(o):   Henry (2)&mdash;Hilary (&agr;)</item>

<item>             (i):   Henry (2)&mdash;Mich&imacr;s xxxvij H vi<ref
target="f001.09.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> </item>

<item>          4.5(o):   De t'mino<ref
target="f001.09.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref>
&amp;c&mdash;Hilary (&agr;)</item>

<item>             (i):   Henry (2)&mdash;Hilary (&agr;)</item>
</list>

<p>The actual printing of the eight leaves of gathering c may well
have proceeded as follows. When the compositor had set through
folio 5<hi rend="super">r</hi>, printing on this section could have begun. In
moving
the skeleton from the last forme of b and requiring a new headline
for c4<hi rend="super">v</hi>-c5, the printer placed the still usable running title
(Mich&imacr;s xxxvij) above the type-page of c1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and
supplied the
new head Henry (2)&mdash;Hilary (&agr;). For the outer forme of c3.6 he
could (and perhaps did) use the same skeleton and headline
immediately<ref target="f001.09.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> &mdash;and he could
then
have perfected both sheets by using the respective halves of the
original headline together with the special running titles as noted
above. At this stage the original pair of running titles was no
longer together, so the compositor set up the combination Henry
(1)&mdash;Hilary (&ggr;) for c2.7 (probably using a skeleton then idle)
and printed both outer and inner formes with this. The skeleton for
inner c3.6 could
then have been used for printing inner c1.8, keeping Henry (2) and
using the Mich&imacr;s xxxvij which had been preserved for this
purpose. For the outer forme of this sheet, the printer then had
available the skeleton of c2.7; he retained the Henry (1) but,
noting the misprint, supplied the correct Hilary (&bgr;) for
c8<hi rend="super">v</hi>.</p>


<p>These are the facts, so far as they can be ascertained with any
reasonable assurance, which may be determined from the
headlines&mdash;though the reader, without the book before him, is
possibly by this time thoroughly confused. If my findings are
correct, it would indicate that expediency was the order of the day
at Machlinia's press.<ref target="f001.09.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref>  It seems
likely that the printing

<pb n="001.132"/>

of the various formes for this book was undertaken rather with the
idea of conserving effort than that of saving time or maintaining
a logical sequence. As we have seen, Machlinia was perfectly
capable (in gathering f) of handling two skeletons, printing the
one forme with one skeleton and perfecting with the other. Why he
did not follow the same procedure in quire g is incomprehensible to
me, unless it be true that another press with a less skilled crew
was set to work on this section of the book. Again, in quires c and
h, Machlinia used more than one skeleton but (in all of h and in
parts of c) he printed the inner and outer formes of the same sheet
with the same skeleton. He thereby voided whatever benefits
normally accrue through the use of multiple skeletons, especially
those of keeping the press at full productivity and saving time.
Machlinia may, of course, have found difficulty in keeping the text
pages of troublesome Law-French in proper order (he had already
made one
serious slip in the first quire). This may have suggested to him
that it would be better to proceed with caution rather than to
avail himself of the full potential productivity of the press. If
there is any other explanation for the curious order in which the
headlines appear in quires c and h, it is not apparent to me.</p>

from the skeleton of c1-c8<hi rend="super">v</hi>, Hilary (&bgr;) for the inner
forme
as it reappears (just once again) on d1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and Henry (1) for
the
outer, since this reading is found only on d1 and was not used
again till quire f. The innermost sheet, in turn, has the same
headline in both formes: Pasche xxxvij (<hi rend="italic">j</hi>
undotted)&mdash;Henry
(3); the latter appears here for the first time. This combination
of running titles occurs only once more, in the outer forme of the

defy classification.</p></note>

four times have set such headlines with the same combination of
abbreviations, spacings and measurements. This is especially true
in view of the noticeable variety found elsewhere whenever he was
called upon to supply new letter-press. It is true that the
headline on c6 verso seems to measure one millimetre more than the
others but it is possible that this particular forme was not locked
up as tightly as the other two. The measurements for the Trinity
headline, it should be noted, depend on the space between the term
and the year&mdash;a somewhat different matter than simple over-all
length. Even a slight loosening of the pressure would probably
spread the increased
length more or less equitably throughout the running title, not
necessarily in just one particular place.</p></note>

this was done solely for the purpose of speeding up the presswork.
He also states (p. 209): "It follows as a general principle that in

appear only if the book was printed in an edition large enough for
composition to keep ahead of presswork&mdash;and of presswork at the
increased speed which the use of two skeletons would make

but it must be borne in mind that Machlinia was working, almost
certainly with rather simple equipment, more than a century earlier
than the period with which Hinman concerns himself. For the way the

1599: A

 <div2 id="vol001.10.01" type="section" n="1">

<p>THE FULL STORY OF THE DIFFERENT ISSUES of <hi rend="italic">Nosce
Teipsum</hi>,
1599, a quarto, has by no means been told. I propose to add a
chapter, analyzing and identifying the twenty copies I have
examined or have had examined for me. Of these copies of STC 6355,
all printed by Richard Field for John Standish in 1599, eleven are
usually described as first editions, nine as second. Some libraries
have made a further distinction between a first and second issue of
the first edition, based upon variant readings in line sixteen of
signature C1<hi rend="super">v</hi>. The reading "chaunge" has been used to
distinguish the first issue, the second issue having "chaunce" at
this point.</p>

<p>These editions and issues, however, are linked by more than
their common imprint. In signatures K and L, for example, the first
and second editions are being printed very nearly at the same time.
Standing type from the first edition, signatures K4 and L3, is used
with the new running-title in the second edition. More
significantly, in two copies of the second edition &mdash;one in the
Chapin Library of Williams College, the other in the Folger
Shakespeare Library, the copy identified as STC 6355b&mdash;outer K of
the second edition is perfected with corrected inner K from the
first edition.</p>

<p>Apparently this perfecting was stopped early; the perfecting

<pb n="001.136"/>

of outer K in other copies of the second edition was continued with
only one page of standing type.</p>

<p>Because this linking of editions is but a small part of the
central problem, I have not attempted to examine all available
copies of the second edition. Nor have I reported in the charts
five copies which appear to be normal second editions throughout.
Those unreported copies are in the Rylands Library, Manchester;
Emmanuel College Library, Cambridge; the Henry E. Huntington
Library; Yale University Library; and the Detroit Public
Library.</p>

<p>A more significant link between the first and second editions is
to be seen in three copies: the Chapin Library copy, the Library of
Congress copy, and the Bodleian copy. These three are usually
identified as second editions, but all three have signatures B and
C from the first edition. I doubt that these are made-up copies in
the usual sense of the word.</p>

<p>These links are charted in the accompanying Table I, the full
meaning of which will become apparent as this report progresses. At
the moment a brief word of explanation is in order: I have used the
symbol <hi rend="italic">X</hi> for the first edition and <hi rend="italic">Y</hi> for the
second.
The appended <hi rend="italic">u</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> indicate the uncorrected
and
corrected states of a forme, the combined <hi rend="italic">uc</hi> indicates a
partially corrected forme. The <hi rend="italic">X1</hi> and <hi rend="italic">X2</hi>
indicate
the
first and second settings of type in outer B and C, about which
more later. The absence of an appended symbol does not necessarily
indicate an invariant forme but merely that I have not recorded any
corrections. The gaps in the chart call attention to those copies
which have not been studied fully, because I found it necessary to
have them examined for me. Those fully reported I have studied
either in the originals or in photostats.</p>

<p>As is apparent from the chart, the linking of editions is just
one of several abnormalities that resulted from the complicated
printing of <hi rend="italic">Nosce Teipsum</hi>. That several formes appear in
two
settings of type has been long known, but not explained. I

<pb n="001.137"/>

propose here to report fully what I have found and to attempt an
explanation.</p>

<p>Though the creaking of the machinery while the guns are hauled
into position might prove somewhat annoying, several more charts
must be displayed and explained: the accompanying Table II
indicates the distribution of running-titles in all formes of the
first edition. The apparently arbitrary choice of letters to
designate running-titles was a device to facilitate recognition.
Each symbol indicates the letter in the running-title which is its
most obvious distinguishing mark. Thus the so-called <hi rend="italic">U</hi>
running-title is that in which the U and M are badly spaced. It
will be noted immediately that after sheet G the arrangement of
these heads in sets of four is slightly varied. The earlier
grouping has heads S U T E in one unit and O I N P in another.</p>

<p>By way of warning it must be noted here that in the
rearrangement of heads after sheet G, the bad spacing of the
<hi rend="italic">U</hi> head was remedied. But close examination leads me to
believe that it is the same head, not a new one. In passing I might
add that the running-titles of <hi rend="italic">Nosce Teipsum</hi> are somewhat
hard to manage because they are all upper-case letters and do not
show many marks of positive identification. Only the simultaneous
examination of many copies made it possible for me to ignore minor
variations due to faulty inking or dirty type.</p>

<p>Table III is involved in the distinction between the first and
second settings of type in outer B and outer C, and generally in
the relationship between the first and second editions. It charts
an odd practice by one of the compositors in Field's shop, the man
who set the type for almost all of the second edition and part of
the first; this compositor habitually placed a space in front of
each mark of final punctuation. The formes in both editions which
are set by this compositor are marked <hi rend="italic">W</hi>, the
unspaced-punctuation formes are marked <hi rend="italic">N</hi>. The chart refers
to the first setting of type in the first edition, and momentarily

<pb n="001.138"/>

ignores a slight exception which will be discussed in detail
later.</p>

<p>The forme that I have listed as B(0)X2, the reset, is unusual in
that the so-called wide-spaced final punctuation appears on
B2<hi rend="super">v</hi>
and B3, and the unspaced or narrow punctuation on B1 and
B4<hi rend="super">v</hi>.
This abnormality obviously suggests a resetting by two compositors,
each working from half a sheet already printed on one side. No
other conceivable explanation is as satisfying as this one; hence
I have not hesitated to label the second setting positively.</p>

<p>This reset of outer B is superior to the original setting in
several important readings, and includes on B4<hi rend="super">v</hi> the use
of
italic instead of roman type in lines 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14,
and 15. Ordinarily we expect reset pages to be inferior to the
original setting in appearance at least.<ref
target="f001.10.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>  But here the
evidence of two
compositors at work, each on a half sheet, is, I think, decisive.
Such a division of copy is expedient when the press is standing by,
waiting for a forme which had been mistakenly distributed too
soon.</p>


<p>Because the reset in B(o) is marked by improvements in readings
and by the substitution of italic for roman, a needed correction,
the same touchstones ought to be valid in C(o).</p>

<p>In outer C the reset forme substitutes italic for roman in
nineteen words or phrases; it adds twenty commas; it improves seven
readings, adds one typographical error and rectifies another. This
analysis is re-inforced especially by one faulty reading in the
first setting: "A&#x0188;t" for "Art" on sig. C3. There can be no
question that the correct reading is "Art". A compositor setting
from manuscript could misread and set "A&#x0188;t". But it is unlikely
that he should set "A&#x0188;t", using the ligature, from a printed page
reading "Art". The more likely explanation is that he was resetting
from corrected copy that consisted of the printed word "A&#x0188;t" with
marginal proof corrections to indicate the proper reading.</p>

<pb n="001.139"/>

<p>When we turn to examination of the combinations of formes in B
and C, we note several oddities. In sheet B, for example, all
copies of the uncorrected state of the inner forme are perfected by
the first setting of type, and all copies of the corrected state by
the second setting.</p>

<p>In inner B the corrected state is marked by these readings:

<table>
<row>
<cell>Sig. B1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, line 14</cell>
<cell><hi rend="italic">Good</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi></cell>
</row>

<row>
<cell>Sig. B2, line 4</cell>
<cell>retain'd</cell>
</row>

<row>
<cell>Sig. B4, line 4</cell>
<cell>threat</cell>
</row>
</table>
The uncorrected readings are "<hi rend="italic">God</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi>",

"retained", "thereat". Only the last is a manifest error, though
all the corrected readings are somewhat superior to the
uncorrected.<ref target="f001.10.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> </p>


<p>The corrected state of inner C (not a new setting of type at
all) is distinguished by the readings "chaunce" and
"Doctrines".</p>

<p>As is noted in Table I, the wholly uncorrected state of C(i) in
the first edition, with the reading "chaunge" on sig. C1<hi rend="super">v</hi>
line
16, and the reading "Doctrine" on sig. C2 line 6, has been found in
only one copy, the so-called first issue of the first edition in
the Huntington Library. Four copies retain "chaunge" but correct to
"Doctrines". The remaining copies make the further correction to
"chaunce".</p>

<p>Quite the opposite of what we found in sheet B, the five
uncorrected and partially corrected formes of inner C are perfected
by the second setting of type. One additional copy, that in the
Carl Pforzheimer Library, perfects the corrected state of inner C
with the second setting. All other copies have corrected inner C
perfected by the first setting of type.</p>

<p>The central question, as I take it, is this: How could a
miscalculation go unnoticed until two successive outer formes had
been printed and their type distributed? The notion that the formes
had pied may be discounted immediately, for the running-titles were
not disturbed.</p>

<pb n="001.140"/>

<p>Any explanation must, I believe, take into account the odd order
of perfecting in sheets B and C, as well as the apparent
over-printing of these sheets that manifests itself in the three
copies of the second edition which have sheets B and C from the
first edition.</p>

<p>It seems to me that we must assume, first of all, that the outer
formes of sheets B and C were printed successively or perhaps
simultaneously before perfecting was begun. Putting together all
the evidence of running-titles, variants, and oddities, and making
use of traceable broken letters, I offer one possible solution of
the problem.</p>

<p>In the following tentative explanation of what perhaps happened
in Field's shop, the number of copies printed is, of course, pure
conjecture, however reasonable the figures might appear to be.
Because the time element is so important at the start at least, I
have numbered the various steps in the process.<ref
target="f001.10.03" n="3">3</ref> </p>


<p>1. Forme B(o)X1 [S E T] and Forme C(o)X1 [O P N] were first
imposed and run off. After about 800 copies had been machined, the
type was distributed. It is possible that two presses worked off
these formes simultaneously, and in view of what happened later it
is perhaps probable.</p>

<p>2. Forme B(i)Xu [S U T E] perfected the 800 copies of Forme
B(o)X1 [S E T]. Here in sig. B3<hi rend="super">v</hi> line 8 appears for the
first
time a distinctively broken lower-case roman letter g in the word
"sight".</p>

<p>At this point it was decided to enlarge the edition to about
1400 copies. The decision was reached before the perfecting of
sheet C was begun.</p>

<p>3. For some reason Forme C(i)Xu [O I N P] started to print white
paper before perfecting C(o)X1. After about 100 copies had been
printed, the first correction was made. After about 400 copies of
C(i)Xuc [O I N P], the second correction

<pb n="001.141"/>

was made. The final 100 copies on white paper were printed from
C(i)Xc [O I N P].</p>

<p>Then the now wholly-corrected Forme C(i)Xc [O I N P] went on to
perfect the 800 copies of C(o)X1.</p>

<p>4. Meanwhile Forme B(i)Xu [S U T E] had finished perfecting and
had gone on to print 600 copies on white paper, but the forme had
in the meantime undergone correction. Thus we have 600 white paper
copies of B(i)Xc [S U T E].</p>

<p>5. The resetting of already distributed type occurred here.
Forme B(o)X2 [O P N] used the ornament that had been used in Forme
B(o)X1 and some of the display type from the head-title: for
example, the <hi rend="italic">g</hi> from the word "<hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi>",
but not
the
<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. This Forme B(o)X2 [O P N] perfected the 600 copies of
B(i)Xc [S U T E].</p>

<p>6. In Forme C(o)X2 [O P N] the previously mentioned wide-spacing
compositor assisted, setting sigs. C2<hi rend="super">v</hi> and C3. Here, on
sig. C1,
the oddly broken letter g re-appears.</p>

<p>7. The 600 copies of Forme C(i)Xu-Xuc-Xc were perfected by Forme

C(o)X2 [O P N]. And that completed the printing of all of sheets B
and C for the first edition.</p>

<p>At this point it was decided to enlarge the edition further, to
perhaps 2400 copies, by making of it a double edition. The
composition for what we call the second edition could have started
at about the same time as step number 5 above, but not very well
earlier. I believe that the wide-spacing compositor began to set
Forme B(o) for the second edition as soon as he had completed his
two pages for B(o)X2, for these reasons:</p>

<p>For sig. B1 of the second edition he used some of the remaining
letters of display type from the head-title of Forme B(o)X1: for
example, the <hi rend="italic">l</hi> from the word "<hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi>" and
the
<hi rend="italic">e</hi> from the word "<hi rend="italic">humane</hi>". The ornament used
is
a
mirror image of that used in both settings of the first edition.
Thus the re-appearance of certain letters and non-appearance of
others gives us probable temporal termini within which the
composition of the second edition may have begun. I assume that
composition began after

<pb n="001.142"/>

B(o)X1 was distributed and before B(o)X2 was completed.</p>

<p>The decision to enlarge again, when the last of 1400 copies of
sheets B and C were in process of being machined, made it advisable
to print only 1000 copies of those sheets in the second edition.
Thereafter each edition would print 1200 copies. The odd
distribution of running-titles in the first edition can be
reasonably accounted for if we assume that one press printed one
forme each day.</p>

<p>While the first edition machined sheet D, the second edition was
working with sheet C. The distinctively broken letter g appears now
in both C(o) and C(i) in the second edition. Obviously the type
from C(o)X2 was distributed by the wide-spacing compositor in order
to replenish a case that must have been quite short of certain
sorts; so short, in fact, that it became expedient to distribute
one of the formes in sheet C in the second edition before
composition for the other forme was well under way. This unusual
state of affairs came about probably because the second edition was
being set by formes from proof-read sheets of the first edition as
they came off the press. Had this delay between inner and outer
formes of a single sheet occurred at the end of a working day, no
special inconvenience would have resulted.</p>

<p>From this point on, it seems likely that the second edition was
composed by formes from the first edition and printed at the same
time as the first edition but slightly more than one forme behind.
Tracing the broken g through the formes enables us to see some such
pattern.</p>

<p>The broken g, last used in both formes of sheet C in the second
edition, appears nowhere in sheet D. But it occurs in the first
edition in sig. E3<hi rend="super">v</hi> line 14, and in sig. F2 line 8.</p>

<p>Then it appears again in the second edition, in G1<hi rend="super">v</hi>
line 4.
Then back to the first edition in H3 line 6 and in I3<hi rend="super">v</hi> line
13.</p>

<p>It seems reasonably certain that the second edition was at least
one forme behind the first edition but probably not much more than
two formes behind. After sig. I3<hi rend="super">v</hi> the distinctively

<pb n="001.143"/>

broken g disappears. Fortunately, other links become apparent.</p>

<p>It is noted in Table III that the wide-spacing compositor set
both formes of sheet H, the inner forme of sheet I, and both formes
of sheets K and L in the first edition; his hand is also traceable
in the second edition in all formes except inner and outer F, inner
and outer I, and outer L. This suggests the switching of
compositors wherever the pressure was greatest at the moment. I
think, too, that after the second edition had machined inner I, all
the resources of the shop were directed toward completing the
printing of the first edition. Some evidence is available to enable
us to determine the time relationship in sheets K and following in
the first edition.</p>

<p>We note, for instance, that Forme K(i)Xc was used to perfect the
first printed sheets of Forme K(o) in the second edition. The fact
that the entire forme was used, running-titles and all, is
significant, especially when we note that the relative position of
those running-titles on the page is different in the second
edition. Then, when the inner forme of K in the second edition was
imposed, it used standing type from Forme K(i)Xc on sig.
K4<hi rend="super">v</hi> but
with a single italic word in the first line set in different type.
Apparently the use of the first edition forme in the second edition
took place after that forme was unlocked.</p>

<p>Now when we note that the running-titles used in K(i)Xc were
used also in L(i)X we may assume that, unless the printing of sheet
L in the first edition was delayed, the use of K(i)Xc to perfect
K(o) of the second edition took place after the printing of the
first edition was completed. In other words, the I T U S
running-titles were re-imposed around the still standing pages of
K(i)Xc for use in the second edition after they had been used for
L(i)X. This explanation can be re-inforced by means of a further
link between the two editions a bit earlier.</p>

<p>When sig. M1 in the first edition, a single page, was printed
along with the preliminary matter,<ref target="f001.10.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref>
only one running-title was

<pb n="001.144"/>

needed. The title used was the one identified in Table II as
<hi rend="italic">P.</hi> Another running-title in the same O E N P group, the
<hi rend="italic">O</hi> title, for which there was no longer any use in the first
edition, appears now on sig. I3 in the second edition. I have not
been able to trace any other of the first edition running-titles in
the second edition.</p>


<p>As a final link, the display type from the first edition
title-page and from sig. A3 was re-used in the second edition but
with a different ornament, again a mirror image of that which was
used in the first edition. That the second edition was printed
after the first here is determinable by the progressive
deterioration of the central stem in the letter m in the word
"Humane" on the title-page. The letter is damaged throughout the
first edition copies and through part of the second edition copies.
In some copies of the second edition the piece is broken off
completely. In general, it seems clear that the outer forme of
sheet I in the second edition was imposed while the press was
machining the final formes of the first edition.</p>

<p>To sum up: in the outer forme of sheet I of the second edition
one running-title from the first edition was used.<ref
target="f001.10.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>  In the
inner forme of sheet K an entire
forme was used for some of the perfecting of the second edition.
Then a single page of standing type from the inner forme of sheet
K in the first edition was used with a new running-title in the
newly set inner forme of sheet K in the second edition. This must
have been a time-consuming process, but no simpler explanation
suggests itself. The possible overprinting of the inner forme of
sheet K in the first edition would not account for the different
position of headlines in the normal Forme K(i)Xc and in those pages
as they appear in the second edition sheets. Similarly, in sheet L
a single page of standing type from the first edition was used on

 <pb entity="sb011451" n="001.145"/>

sig. L3 with a new running-title and with reset marginal notes in
the second edition.</p>


<p>Furthermore, two compositors are at work on the final sheets of
the second edition: the inner forme of sheet L is wide-spaced
before final punctuation except for the first two lines of sig.
L1<hi rend="super">v</hi>; the outer forme of sheet L is narrow-spaced except
for sig.
L3, where the wide spacing results from the fact that this is
standing type from the wide-spaced first edition.</p>

<p>In passing it might be noted that all the evidence that the
second edition was set from the first is borne out by careful
collation of variant readings. I make a special point of this since
we might be tempted to assume that sheet I in the first edition was
set from already printed formes of sheet I from the second edition,
because of the odd division of labor between compositors. But I
believe that the use of the <hi rend="italic">O</hi> running-title on sig. I3
precludes this. Apparently we must assume a division of copy
designed to allow each compositor to set a complete forme.</p>

<p>Finally, the fact that the variant reading on sig. K3v&mdash;
"<hi rend="italic">will</hi>" for "will"&mdash;represents a miscorrection in the
first
edition that was repeated in the second must not disturb our belief
that the second edition was in every forme set from the first.</p>

<p>The complicated order of formes through the press in sheets B
and C of the first edition, as outlined above, would result in the
following combinations of variants:
</p>

  <pb  entity="sb011461a" n="001.146"/>

<!-- <p><figure entity="sb011461a"></figure></p> -->

<p>It is unfortunate that the wide distribution of copies of the
first edition makes so difficult the examination of watermarks and
paper. Otherwise it might be interesting to see whether such a
study would confirm or render untenable the beliefs expressed
here.</p>

  <head/>
<p>IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ONE ECONOMY practised
in the
publishing of cheap play quartos was the use of job lots of paper.
These papers usually originated in France and varied somewhat in
thickness, texture, and watermarks. As a result of their use, many
quartos contain several different watermarks, and some almost as
many different watermarks as sheets.<ref
target="f001.11.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>  Often individual
sheets vary in
watermarks from copy to copy. It is obvious that such varying
watermarks may prove a source of information as to the manner in
which a book went through the press. Despite inherent ambiguities,
they promise support to the evidence supplied by press corrections,
headlines, and the early treatise by Joseph Moxon toward the
solution of bibliographical problems.</p>


<p>This article is intended as a preliminary enquiry into the
significance of job-lot or variant watermarks. The evidence and
illustrations are drawn mainly from a group of play-quartos printed
by Thomas Cotes in the spring of 1639/40. Though studies of the
papers of other printers are needed for correlation, the present
investigation appears already to yield useful inferences and
methods.</p>

<pb n="001.152"/>

<p>The examination of watermarks is no easy task. The microfilm
facilitates the collation of typographical variants from all over
the world, but seldom suggests the presence of even a blatant
watermark. If the bibliographer wishes to compare the paper in a
number of copies, he must examine them at Bodley, Folger, and
Huntington, or wherever they may be; and exact comparison suggests
the advantage of carrying his own copy about as a basis of
reference. Often it may not be possible to draw clear inferences
from fewer than five or ten copies. In quartos the watermarks occur
within the fold at the spine, and may be further obscured by sewing
and close binding. When small they may be difficult to make out at
all; and even when they are large and sprawling they may be
difficult to describe well enough for sure recognition when one
meets them again.<ref target="f001.11.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>  The initials on
pots, the quarterings on shields, or the number of grapes on a stem
may be hard
to decipher. However, many watermarks are sufficiently
distinguishable without such details. Gradually as one works from
copy to copy the patterns of watermarks in an edition emerge and
take on an appearance of significance.</p>


<p>The most interesting set of job-lot watermarks that I have
encountered occurs in a group of seven play quartos printed by
Thomas Cotes (successor to the Jaggards) in or about
February-March-April 1639/40. They consist of two plays of
Fletcher, <hi rend="italic">Wit without Money</hi> (1639) and <hi rend="italic">The
Night-Walker</hi> (1640), printed for Andrew Crooke and William
Cooke, and five of Shirley, two, <hi rend="italic">The Maides Revenge</hi> (1639)

and <hi rend="italic">The Humorous Courtier</hi> (1640), printed for Cooke alone,

two, <hi rend="italic">The Coronation</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi>
(both
1640),
printed for Crooke and Cooke, and one, <hi rend="italic">Loves Crueltie</hi>
(1640), printed for Crooke alone.<ref target="f001.11.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref>
I began the study of

<pb n="001.153"/>

their watermarks to learn what support they offered a hypothesis
concerning the order in which these plays were printed. I found
that the sequence of the watermarks substantiated my idea of the
typographical relations of the title-pages.<ref
target="f001.11.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref>  Thus
encouraged, I proceeded to look
for further meaning in the watermarks.</p>



<p>I noted that Cotes printed two other plays in 1640:
Chamberlain's <hi rend="italic">The Swaggering Damsell</hi>, for Andrew Crooke,

and
Habington's <hi rend="italic">The Queene of Arragon</hi>, for William Cooke. The

first is a quarto containing seven of the watermarks found in the
Fletcher-Shirley group, and <hi rend="italic">The Queene of Arragon</hi> is a
small
<hi rend="italic">folio</hi> which luckily exhibits three (at least) of the same
watermarks &mdash;in the center of the page. As these two plays were
entered on 2 April 1640,<ref target="f001.11.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>  while
Cotes was seeing the Fletcher-Shirley quartos through the press, it
is likely that he went on with the new work for Crooke and Cooke
and completed the Chamberlain and Habington plays by May or
June.<ref target="f001.11.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> </p>



<p>I have attempted no complete study of these nine Cotes plays in
terms of compositors, headlines, press corrections, and watermarks.
There might never be time for that. But I have gathered data on all
and have made a detailed study of one important quarto, <hi rend="italic">The
Opportunitie</hi>. I have examined twenty copies of this play for
press corrections and twelve copies for watermarks. A full
collation of eight copies and a partial collation of others has
revealed corrections in just five formes: inner and outer C, outer
F, inner G, and inner K. Several of those in outer C and outer F
bespeak a corrector of intelligence and resource, but those in the
other formes are mechanical and

<pb n="001.154"/>

routine, though useful in the study of printing-house practice.
This difference in the <hi rend="italic">kinds</hi> of corrections may itself
suggest inferences concerning the order of formes through the
press.</p>

<p>The table shows the number and frequency of corrections for each
forme. If the sample is a fair one, we have indications that half
the edition sheet of inner C was run before corrections were made,
amounting to nine small changes. Corrections were also made in the
outer forme, somewhat sooner in its run, apparently when the reader
discovered blunders in the sense. One suspects there had been
earlier corrections when the compositor looked over his type or
preliminary proofs were taken. In outer F a good third of the
sheets remained uncorrected. But of inner G and of inner K only
single uncorrected copies have come to light. Their rarity suggests
the possible existence of other uncorrected (inner) formes.</p>

<p>Study of the headlines in <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi> reveals two
distinct skeletons. These show regular and normal transference from
forme to forme, except for interchanges of formes at four points
and turns of skeleton X at inner E and inner K. This is the pattern
of the two skeletons:

<p>Judging from the treatment of speech prefixes and spellings, the
early sheets were set by two compositors, but from about

<pb n="001.155"/>

sheet E on by a single and different compositor.<ref
target="f001.11.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref>  If there
is more than coincidence in
the turning of skeleton X at inner E, one may suspect an
interruption in the work on the quarto there.<ref

<p>With these bibliographical features of the quarto in mind, we
turn to the watermarks in <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi>. There seem to
be
seven. The accompanying table shows their distribution in the
twelve copies examined, together with the incidence of corrections
in these copies. The pot watermark common to sheets B and C is a
one-handled pot surmounted by fleuron and crescent; its bowl,
measuring 19 mm. across, bears the letters &GRO; -- probably
indicating manufacture by the Rousel family in France.<ref
target="f001.11.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref>
One copy in sheet B has a slightly
larger pot with two slender handles and a round bowl of 22 mm.,
bearing a fleurde-lis.<ref target="f001.11.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref>  The
characteristic mark of sheets B to F is the very Christian symbol
IHS with cross mounted on the bar of the H;<ref
target="f001.11.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref>  it measures
36 x 36 mm.<ref target="f001.11.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref>  Associated with this
paper (in the same
edition sheets) is one showing a small bird (45 x 27 mm.) with
pointed head, wings outstretched, and tail fanned out: I find
nothing like it in Briquet, Bofarull,<ref target="f001.11.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref>
or
Nicola&iuml;.<ref target="f001.11.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref>

<pb n="001.156"/>

As these IHS and bird papers are similarly associated in other
plays,<ref target="f001.11.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref>  they probably had the same
origin and came packed together, that is, with tokens or reams of
each in the same lot or bale. Twice in sheet D occurs a U-shaped
spray of flowers (48 mm. across) with letters or leaves between the

<p>The watermarks in <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi> fall into three
main
groups: pots, IHS-birds, and grapes. There is a certain orderliness
in their distribution. Though the marks in various Caroline plays
give the impression of chaos,<ref target="f001.11.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref>  here
in a dozen copies we are aware of balance and continuity&mdash;a record
of presswork in palimpsest form. The striking feature of sheet B is
the equal

<pb n="001.158"/>

division into six pot and six IHS watermarks. This division is
repeated in sheet C: six pot and three each of IHS and bird
watermarks. More startling is the distribution of press corrections
in C: the six uncorrected exemplars of the inner forme are printed
on the six sheets of pot-G/RO paper, and the six corrected
exemplars of that forme are printed on the other two papers.
Further, the three uncorrected exemplars of the outer forme
likewise appear on the pot paper, backed of course by the
uncorrected state of the inner forme. Clearly, so neat a
distribution may be fortuitous, for we are analyzing a sample of
precisely twelve copies;<ref target="f001.11.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref>  yet
sheets D, E, F serve to clarify and stress the pattern. This
pattern involves multiples of two. Sheet D, indeed, with two spray,
seven IHS, and three bird watermarks, varies from even quantities.
But E is divided neatly into eight and four, and F into ten and
two. (As the IHS mark tends to outnumber the bird, it
looks now as if the original proportion of these papers in sheet C
may have been four to two.) With sheet G comes a shift to a new
watermark and a steady outpouring of grapes, except for two crown
marks in H. There are just four instances of uncorrected readings
in outer F, and they fall only on IHS paper. The variant formes of
G and K are printed on (apparently) invariant paper.<ref
target="f001.11.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref>  If
in the latter part of the quarto the
rhythm of two's is somewhat obscured, it is not obviously
disturbed.</p>




<p>The distribution we have observed bears substantial implications
for the size of the edition and for the order of the formes through
the press. The first is the easier to see. The edition was probably
one of 1500 copies. This quantity best satisfies both the
distribution ratios and the external evidence.<ref
target="f001.11.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref>  If we adopt
the working assumption that
each watermark in the

<pb n="001.159"/>

table represents a half-token of paper (five quires), we can follow
the course of the press (or presses) from paper to paper fairly
well. We reckon in tokens as the seventeenth-century pressman
commonly did. The hypothesis works this way. Whatever was the first
forme on the press and the number of presses involved, sheet B used
three tokens or 750 sheets each of IHS paper and pot paper. The pot
paper was continued and printed the uncorrected state of inner C,
using three more tokens and thus completing three reams of pot
paper. The rest of the edition sheet must have been made up of a
ream of IHS paper and a token of bird paper, or vice versa (the
table showing 3's for each). Sheet D used a stray token of spray
paper along with perhaps two reams of IHS and a token of bird paper
(the ratio being 2:7:3). Sheet E is easy: exactly two reams of IHS
and one of bird (8:4); and so is F, with five tokens of IHS and one
of bird (10:2). At this point the warehouse boy opened up a bale of
grape paper, and the press (or presses) proceeded monotonously
through thirteen reams of it (sheet G to half-sheet A), unrelieved
except for a token of crown paper which turned up during the
printing of sheet H.</p>


<p>An edition of 1500 fits with other evidence and considerations.
(1) <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi> was made up in three lots, with variant
imprints: the main lot for Crooke and Cooke, a smaller one for
Crooke alone, and a few copies for sale in Dublin. (2) I have
located thirty-six copies in libraries and a dozen others in sale
or auction catalogs. Thus the edition was clearly one of some size.
(3) Shirley was a popular dramatist in his time and also liked on
the Restoration stage; yet Andrew Crooke found it unnecessary to
reprint any of Shirley's plays in which he had rights.<ref
target="f001.11.24" n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref>
(4) The Stationers' Company had long
permitted editions of 1250 and 1500, and the number had been
increased to 1500 and 2000 in 1635.<ref
target="f001.11.25" n="25"><hi rend="super">25</hi></ref>  In July 1639 the
Company specifically
gave John Benson "leaue to print an

<pb n="001.160"/>

Imp<hi rend="super">r</hi>ssion of 1500" copies of a second edition of
Davenant's play
<hi rend="italic">The Tragedy of Albovine</hi><ref
target="f001.11.26" n="26"><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref> &mdash;though
apparently he did not do so.
(5) As Mr. Hinman has pointed out, two sets of headlines (such as
<hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi> has) would hardly save time in presswork,
due to the time needed for typesetting, unless the edition was one
of at least 1200 copies.<ref target="f001.11.27" n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref>  (6) An
edition of 1500 is implied by certain evidence concerning the rate
of presswork presently to be offered.<ref
target="f001.11.28" n="28"><hi rend="super">28</hi></ref> </p>






<p>Before taking up the problem of the order of the formes through
the press, we should know the number of presses available. The
Cotes establishment was an important one and must have operated at
least two presses. The Jaggards had had two in their day. Mr.
Willoughby has shown that their output for 1619-1623 averaged more
than four hundred edition sheets a year, far more than one press
would be able to handle.<ref target="f001.11.29" n="29"><hi rend="super">29</hi></ref>  Thomas
and Richard Cotes, their successors, carried on a business of
similar size.<ref target="f001.11.30" n="30"><hi rend="super">30</hi></ref>  And in 1637 a Star
Chamber decree allowed the master printers, Thomas Cotes among
them, two presses, or, rather, no more than two presses.<ref
target="f001.11.31" n="31"><hi rend="super">31</hi></ref>
As this act seems not to have been
closely enforced,<ref target="f001.11.32" n="32"><hi rend="super">32</hi></ref>  we need to allow
for the possibility that Cotes had a third press, possibly some
worn relic of Jaggard days, useful mainly for proofing<ref
target="f001.11.33" n="33"><hi rend="super">33</hi></ref>
and
for printing

<pb n="001.161"/>

broadsides. Two presses, however, would provide ample means for
printing six to ten edition sheets a week (depending on the size of
the edition),<ref target="f001.11.34" n="34"><hi rend="super">34</hi></ref>  along with
opportunities for proofing and for minor pieces of presswork.</p>







<p>Thus the resources of the Cotes shop in the Barbican allowed a
choice between one press and two presses for the printing of a
quarto. The nature of the work, as well as the habits of the shop,
would ordinarily decide the question. In general, two presses
(printing simultaneously or in relay) might be employed when a
single job was in hand or when a certain book was given priority
over others; and one press for each might be used when two books
were in process and full use needed to be made of workmen, type,
and presses. By allocating each quarto to separate compositors and
pressmen and a single press, a master printer might reasonably
expect that work on two plays would go forward simultaneously
without confusion of formes or printed sheets. Circumstances would
modify practice, of course, but a system of alternating the work on
two presses between two books would have been no system at all.
These considerations imply that <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi>, as one of
a series of
play-quartos, would normally be printed on a single press.</p>

<p>For clues as to Cotes's method of handling such quartos, let us
turn to the watermarks in <hi rend="italic">The Night-Walker</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
Coronation</hi>, their marks being much like those in <hi rend="italic">The
Opportunitie</hi>. The accompanying table shows the distribution in
a few copies of these plays. <hi rend="italic">The Night-Walker</hi> has six
watermarks in common with <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi>: pot-G/RO,
pot-fleur-de-lis, IHS, bird, spray, grapes, plus two others, a lion
on a shield and a belt encircling a quartered shield. The
distribution looks a little

<pb n="001.162"/>

wild: each copy has five to seven different marks within nine and
a half sheets. Yet sheet B has one consistent mark&mdash;grapes (its
only appearance in the quarto).<ref target="f001.11.35" n="35"><hi rend="super">35</hi></ref>
And sheets G and H show a division between two marks, pot and IHS;
other sheets a </p>

division among three, as lion twice with bird and belt in sheet D,
and IHS thrice with the same pair in sheet I. Without further
evidence we cannot say whether such distributions are
characteristic of the use of two presses. The case of <hi rend="italic">The
Coronation</hi> is clearer. With just two to five watermarks to a
copy, it has four in common with <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi>: IHS,
bird, grapes, and crown/GP, plus the belt mark found in <hi rend="italic">The
Night-Walker</hi>. Their relatively simple pattern is surprisingly
like that of <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi>. There is the same general
progression from IHS-bird to grape papers, except that <hi rend="italic">The
Coronation</hi> reached the run of grape paper at F, one sheet
behind <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi>.<ref
target="f001.11.36" n="36"><hi rend="super">36</hi></ref>  In
sheets B and C of <hi rend="italic">The Coronation</hi> the belt paper occupies
more or less the place of the pot-G/RO paper. The IHS paper
continues commoner than the associated bird paper. And again the
crown paper occurs sporadically
among the reams of grapes.</p>



<p>The inference is inescapable: <hi rend="italic">The Coronation</hi> was going

through the press at very nearly the same time as <hi rend="italic">The
Opportunitie</hi>.<ref target="f001.11.37" n="37"><hi rend="super">37</hi></ref>  Placed side
by
side, the tables tell a similar story of moving from IHS and
associated papers into a long run of grape paper. The simplest
explanation is that the two plays were being printed on separate
presses fed by the same job-lot supply of paper. There is again the
contrary suggestion of more than one press in the use of three
papers in sheets B to F of <hi rend="italic">The Coronation</hi>, but just such a
mixture of papers may have come from the stockroom. The very
differences in the two sets of watermarks support the hypothesis of
separate presses. During the printing of sheets B and C of these
plays press 1 was supplied with several reams of pot paper, and
press 2 with a similar amount of belt paper. At sheet F, press 2
(printing <hi rend="italic">The Coronation</hi>) came upon a little more belt
paper, possibly a
remainder from its earlier use. The spray paper occurs only in
<hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi>. And only in <hi rend="italic">The Coronation</hi>
does
the
grape paper turn up

<pb n="001.164"/>

from time to time before the main body of the grape paper is
reached.<ref target="f001.11.38" n="38"><hi rend="super">38</hi></ref>  Thus, the general
similarities and particular differences together argue that the two
plays were printed on separate presses during approximately the
same period of time.</p>



<p>That this is probably the right view, at least for the latter
two-thirds of <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi>, is attested by the apparent
fact of a single compositor there. When composition must keep up
with two presses, we may expect to find alternate setting by two
compositors. But when a single press undertakes an edition of 1250
or 1500, one compositor should be able to keep up with its
demands.<ref target="f001.11.39" n="39"><hi rend="super">39</hi></ref>  Though there are signs
of
two compositors in the first third of the play, particularly in
sheet C, for the present it is safer to assume a single press
there, too.</p>


<p>Now we can attempt to plot the order of the formes through the
press, using what we know of compositors, headlines, corrections,
the edition size, the presses available&mdash;and the papers laid out.
As some of the evidence is itself inferential and limited by the
number of copies examined, and as the patterns of the watermarks
are under consideration as new evidence, we need rather to explore
the more likely methods of presswork than grasp at conclusions.
However, the new material considerably extends the range of enquiry
and perhaps leads us close to right answers.</p>

<p>For the present we assume that 1500 copies of <hi rend="italic">The
Opportunitie</hi> were printed on a single press.</p>

<p>Sheet B has been composed. Skeleton X has been made up and
placed about its inner forme, and skeleton Y made up (with an
ornament at the head of the first page of text) and placed about
its outer forme. Whichever forme went first on the press might be
a matter of chance if B4<hi rend="super">v</hi> was composed before the press
was made
ready or if preliminary proofs were taken before presswork began.
Though there is some reason to think the

<pb n="001.165"/>

normal procedure in Cotes's shop was inner forme on first,<ref
target="f001.11.40" n="40"><hi rend="super">40</hi></ref>  the beginning forme would matter less
than later ones. Here, on first analysis, it looks as if the press
began with the outer forme. In the absence of variants in sheet B
the watermarks offer a clue&mdash;that is, the watermarks of B in their
relation to the watermarks and corrections of C. Assuming (what is
reasonable but uncertain) that the pot papers in sheets B and C
were a continuous run of just three reams among the prevailing IHS
paper, we see that printing might begin with the outer forme on
three tokens of IHS paper, and then proceed to a similar quantity
of pot paper. In this manner skeleton Y would be first through the
press and available for imposing about the inner forme of C as soon
as seven type-pages of this signature had been composed. The shift
of the skeleton from an outer to an inner forme would be natural
enough.</p>


<p>There is, however, a better explanation of this shift. It lies
in the pattern of the headlines through the quarto. As we have
noted, there is a shift of skeletons not only after B, but likewise
after D (with a turn of skeleton X), after E, and after G; and
between I and K&mdash;though there is no shift&mdash;skeleton X is
turned
to starting position. Thus we find a rhythm of alternate sheets,
except for a change of accent or quickening of tempo at sheet
E.<ref target="f001.11.41" n="41"><hi rend="super">41</hi></ref>  I have an idea that the correct
explanation is that which Mr. Bowers has recently found for a
similar phenomenon in the Pide Bull <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>: a shift means the
end of a day's labor, or

<pb n="001.166"/>

some like pause in the work.<ref target="f001.11.42" n="42"><hi rend="super">42</hi></ref>
Indeed, the rhythm suggests a rough printing schedule for the play.
We may suppose that Cotes's well-ordered establishment, using two
skeletons, normally printed and perfected about 1000 sheets (two
reams) on one press in one day.<ref target="f001.11.43" n="43"><hi rend="super">43</hi></ref>
Thus, in machining an edition of 1500, completion of a sheet would
tend to coincide with the end of the work-day every third day.
Ordinarily a sheet begun on a morning would be two-thirds done by
the evening and quite finished at noon the next day; and the
following sheet would be one-third done by the second evening and
completely perfected by the third evening. And, it will be noted,
if all went well the presswork on four edition sheets might neatly
fill a week.</p>




<p>Then what precisely caused the shifts? Probably the habits of
certain compositors in the shop of Thomas Cotes. If the compositor
preferred to wait till the end of the day to distribute type,<ref
target="f001.11.44" n="44"><hi rend="super">44</hi></ref>  at the end of any third day he would
have on his workbench both formes of the sheet finished that day.
If he placed the second forme on the bench below the first, pushing
the first up and out of the way, the second forme (last off the
press) would of course be the nearer one to him when he began
distributing. And in this situation he would naturally attend to
the nearer forme first. If in stripping this forme he placed its
skeleton around the next forme designed for the press, and was
consistent in the forme he sent first to press, he would bring
about the sort of shift of skeleton that occurred four times during
the printing of the play. The twice-turning of skeleton X might
come from setting the forme down elsewhere before finding room for
it on the
bench. And the <hi rend="italic">omission</hi> of a shift between sheets I and K
may have been due to the nature of K,

<pb n="001.167"/>

which, ending in the midst of K4<hi rend="super">r</hi>, might the more readily
receive the waiting skeleton X about its inner forme before outer
I with skeleton Y came from the press.<ref
target="f001.11.45" n="45"><hi rend="super">45</hi></ref> </p>



<p>We now return to the presswork on the early sheets, better able
to imagine how they were handled. We see that the inner forme of
sheet B may after all have been first on the press if the
completion of work on the sheet coincided with the end of a day. If
so, presswork must have commenced sometime during the previous day.
Actually the shift may have come about either through beginning
printing with the outer forme or beginning distribution with the
second forme at the end of the day, though the sequence of shifts
favors the latter view. In either case, we assume that the pressman
began printing on IHS paper and after about 750 sheets went on to
the first tokens of pot paper. If work commenced around noon, about
mid-morning of the second day he would turn the pile and, the work
moving smoothly, perfect the whole of it before going home to
supper. And in the meantime sheet C would have been composed.</p>

<p>Sheet C is unusually interesting because of the close
correspondence between its variations in text and paper. The
chances are that the printing of this sheet began on a morning with
the inner forme (and skeleton Y) on the press. The priority of the
inner forme is particularly suggested by the fact that fifty per
cent of the exemplars are uncorrected&mdash;that half the white paper
was printed before the corrector arrived&mdash;whereas outer C received
corrections after about 15 per cent of its pulls. The pressman,
continuing with the pot paper used in B, began in the middle of a
ream of it and finished three tokens before pausing for corrections
and then going on to a fresh supply of IHS (and bird) paper, on
which he impressed the whole of the corrected state. After thus
taking 750 pulls of each state, by mid-afternoon he would be ready
to turn the pile of printed sheets

<pb n="001.168"/>

and begin perfecting the lot. He would perfect perhaps a token with
outer C (and skeleton X) in uncorrected state, pause again for
corrections, and perfect another token with the corrected forme
before quitting for the day&mdash;if he completed the 2000 daily pulls
we have assumed. The following morning would be sufficient for
perfecting the remaining 1000 sheets. This treatment of sheet C
envisages the "normal" procedure of printing the whole run of white
paper with one forme before turning the pile and perfecting with
the other forme;<ref target="f001.11.46" n="46"><hi rend="super">46</hi></ref>  and the pauses
for corrections might be suitably filled with the taking of
proofs<ref target="f001.11.47" n="47"><hi rend="super">47</hi></ref>  or necessary work about the
press.<ref target="f001.11.48" n="48"><hi rend="super">48</hi></ref> </p>




<p>However, there is a modification of this method which would make
more efficient use of the pressman's time and such evidence as the
relative quantities of uncorrected pulls for the two formes. It is
odd that half the pulls of inner C should be uncorrected and a
third of these backed with uncorrected pulls of the outer
forme&mdash;when only three later formes exhibit corrections, and these
with normal percentages in different sheets. But, as will be seen
presently, sheet C must have been printed around Easter; and on the
morning of Easter Even or Easter Monday Tom Cotes or the corrector
might come to the printing-house late. Now then. The pressman,
while printing the three tokens of uncorrected inner C, may have
become aware of the need of corrections and decided not to go
beyond the mid-point of the run without them. He had a heap of 750
sheets and had exhausted the supply of pot paper. Having proceeded
so far, he might turn the heap, substitute the outer forme on the
bed
of the press, and begin printing with little fear of smudging. By
noon he would have perfected about a token (one third) of

<pb n="001.169"/>

the printed sheets, thus completing 1000 pulls for the morning.
About this time (we may suppose) the corrector appeared and
attended to the inner forme, and then in a burst of virtuosity
corrected the outer forme as well.</p>

<p>I am led to this inference not merely by the three to one ratio
of uncorrected pulls and the neatness of the hypothesis but by the
presence of "literary" corrections in these formes, perhaps one in
inner C and four in outer C.<ref target="f001.11.49" n="49"><hi rend="super">49</hi></ref>  After
study of the variant and invariant formes in several quartos, I am
of the opinion that Cotes's formes commonly received cursory
correction before printing commenced,<ref
target="f001.11.50" n="50"><hi rend="super">50</hi></ref>  and I consider
such corrections as
those in outer C and outer F, and possibly those in inner C, true
stop-press corrections, the second sets of corrections made in
those formes. Obviously, second corrections would be made only
where first corrections proved insufficient from the point of view
of printer's style or reader's sense. There is no way of knowing
whether both uncorrected states of sheet C <hi rend="italic">were</hi> printed
ahead of the corrected states, but this method accords precisely
with the evidence. In the afternoon the
pressman would go ahead with the corrected formes, presumably first
printing the second half of the run of inner C, on IHS and bird
papers, and then, towards the end of the day, perfecting about one
token with corrected outer C. As before, he would finish perfecting
the edition sheet the next morning.</p>



<pb n="001.170"/>

<p>There is less evidence as to the manner of printing the sheets
that followed C, but what there is fits the hypothesis of 1500
copies printed on a single press at the rate of one edition sheet
in a day and a half.</p>

<p>If the perfecting of sheet C was completed on a morning, the
press could begin printing the white paper of sheet D in the
afternoon. No late corrections were made,<ref
target="f001.11.51" n="51"><hi rend="super">51</hi></ref>  and the
sequence of the three
watermarks is doubtful.<ref target="f001.11.52" n="52"><hi rend="super">52</hi></ref>  Assuming
normal procedure, with the inner forme on the press first and
printing the whole run of paper before the exchange of formes, we
may suppose that 1000 sheets were printed in the afternoon, that
perfecting began about the middle of the next morning, that the
sheet was completed by evening. At this point comes the second
shift of skeletons&mdash;and the turning of skeleton X.</p>



<p>Sheet E is an anomaly, for a third shift of skeletons occurs
between it and the following sheet. There are indications of a
change of compositors, perhaps in the midst of E1<hi rend="super">r</hi>.<ref
target="f001.11.53" n="53"><hi rend="super">53</hi></ref>  There are no variants, and the
watermarks imply an orderly run of two reams of IHS paper and one
ream of bird paper. We may imagine some sort of delay, due to
holidays, the change in compositors, or the need of the press for
other work.<ref target="f001.11.54" n="54"><hi rend="super">54</hi></ref>  The delay may have
been half a day or as much as a day and a half. At any rate, it is
convenient to suppose that the printing of this sheet began about
noon of one day and ended at the close of the next. For at this
point comes the third shift in skeletons.</p>



<p>Continuing our hypothetical schedule, we find particular support
for it in the corrections of outer F. If the printing of inner F
(invariant) took the usual three-fourths of a day, the press would
have time to perfect 500 sheets in the late afternoon.

<pb n="001.171"/>

These correspond to the proportion of uncorrected sheets in the
run, one-third. Over night the need of corrections was noted, and
they were made. That these were <hi rend="italic">second</hi> corrections is
indicated by the fact that <hi rend="italic">none</hi> were literal corrections,
two amended the sense,<ref target="f001.11.55" n="55"><hi rend="super">55</hi></ref>  and the
remaining five strengthened the punctuation. Presumably, then, the
corrected outer forme perfected the last 1000 sheets on the
following morning. Noting that the uncorrected state is on IHS
paper, we may infer that the perfecting, and therefore likewise the
printing of the white paper, commenced with a ream of IHS paper.
The order of the other two reams is not clear, but the principle of
continuity would put the (token of) bird paper at the end of the
run.</p>


<p>At this point the change to grape paper took place. There is
nothing to suggest a delay, for the new paper was probably laid out
and dampened the night before. Our alternating schedule starts the
printing of sheet G in an afternoon. If inner G went on the press
first, either several proofs were taken or else printing proceeded
while the proofs were being read. For this time the fourteen
corrections include five literal changes, nine punctuation
additions or substitutions, and <hi rend="italic">no</hi> alterations of verbal
sense. It was a quick job, or one done at lunchtime: only a few
uncorrected quires can have been printed, for just one uncorrected
copy has come to light. As this copy has a grape watermark,<ref
target="f001.11.56" n="56"><hi rend="super">56</hi></ref>  apparently the whole edition sheet is
so marked. On the second day of grape paper the heap would be ready
to turn by mid-morning, and perfecting could be completed by night.
The fourth shift of skeletons took place here.</p>


<p>Sheets H and I involve no problems and may be assigned to the
third, fourth, and fifth days of grape paper. The two crown/ GP
watermarks among the twelve exemplars in H may be a good clue to
the source of the grape paper, but they seem to tell us nothing
about presswork.</p>

<p>The imposition of sheet K was accompanied by no shift of

<pb n="001.172"/>

skeleton but instead a turning of skeleton X as inner K received
it. When this forme went on the press (first or last), two small
corrections were made in the final type-page after only a few pulls
had been taken. (Corrections may have been made already in the
three earlier pages of the forme.) These amounted to one perverse
change in a speech-prefix<ref target="f001.11.57" n="57"><hi rend="super">57</hi></ref>  and one
correction of broken type. Such changes might be made without
removing the forme from the press. And thus the machining of sheet
K would go ahead relatively smoothly on grape paper and reach
completion about noon of its second day.</p>


<p>With the nine edition sheets of text out of the way, the press
would proceed to the preliminaries, half-sheet A. At about this
time Shirley, on arriving from Ireland, visited the printing-house,
and penned his dedication to Captain Richard Owen.<ref
target="f001.11.58" n="58"><hi rend="super">58</hi></ref>  In
it he tells us he found <hi rend="italic">The
Opportunitie</hi> "emergent from the Presse, and prepar'd to seeke
entertainment abroad." If there was no delay, this dedication as
well as the title-page should have been in type by the morning on
which the last sheets of K were perfected, and the greater part of
the required half-sheets might be wrought off the same day. The
most likely treatment would be imposition in a single forme<ref
target="f001.11.59" n="59"><hi rend="super">59</hi></ref>  and printing by the print-and-turn
method.<ref target="f001.11.60" n="60"><hi rend="super">60</hi></ref>  That is, the forme would
be made up of the title (A1<hi rend="super">r</hi>), a blank
(A1<hi rend="super">v</hi>), the dedication
(A2<hi rend="super">r</hi>), and "The Actors Names" (A2<hi rend="super">v</hi>),
arranged clockwise
in
the chase, with the
title at lower left (or upper right); and as usual the sheets would
be turned endwise for perfecting by the same forme.<ref
target="f001.11.61" n="61"><hi rend="super">61</hi></ref> </p>





<pb n="001.173"/>

<p>Now, the matter is complicated by variant imprints and a curious
distribution of watermarks. Three lots were made up for the
publishers: (1) the main one for Crooke and Cooke, dated 1640; (2)
a smaller one for Crooke alone, not dated; and (3) a few copies for
Crooke to sell in Dublin, dated 1640. These states exist in
percentages of approximately 58, 40, and 2.<ref
target="f001.11.62" n="62"><hi rend="super">62</hi></ref>  The
watermark table shows state 1
fairly equally divided between watermarked and unwatermarked ends,
but state 2 printed only on watermarked ends. Of five copies of
this state examined,<ref target="f001.11.63" n="63"><hi rend="super">63</hi></ref>  five are
watermarked with grapes, none unwatermarked. (State 3 is the unique
Kemble-Devonshire-Huntington copy and is mounted so as to obscure
watermarks.) The explanation of this distribution does not seem
easy, particularly as we do not know how consistently watermarked
ends were arranged in a ream. It probably would be easier for a
paper maker to gather sheets
consistently, and the run of watermarks in certain folio and quarto
sheets seems uniform, but little is known about the point. In the
present half-sheet we must assume either a freakish distribution or
a fairly consistent arrangement of the sheets on which the undated
state was printed.</p>



<p>A possible explanation, offered tentatively, is this. The
pressman printed the complete run of the main state,<ref
target="f001.11.64" n="64"><hi rend="super">64</hi></ref>  say
875 copies (three and a half
tokens), before turning the heap and perfecting with states 2 and
3. If the title fell on unwatermarked ends during the first ream
and on watermarked ends during the rest of the run, the ratio of
blanks to marks for state 1 would be

<pb n="001.174"/>

about five to four. After the imprint was changed and the heap had
been turned, the pressman would be printing the undated title on
watermarked ends for the space of a ream and on unwatermarked ends
for a few quires beyond, if, say, 625 copies were needed of the two
Crooke states.<ref target="f001.11.65" n="65"><hi rend="super">65</hi></ref>  If we allow a quire
for state 3 (a few copies to sell in Dublin), the ratio of marks to
blanks for state 2 would be about five to one. However, the press
would go on perfecting so that the whole of state 1 might include
the dedication. The objection to this method is that it wastes
upwards of 250 half-sheets, though some allowance may be made for
proofs, unsatisfactory pulls, and possibly printer's copy
books<ref target="f001.11.66" n="66"><hi rend="super">66</hi></ref>  and title-pages to be used
as posters. On the other hand, an initial run of 875 or 900 sheets
would just about fill an afternoon, and would conveniently put the
whole of the main state on one side of the sheet. No simple,
economical
explanation seems available.<ref target="f001.11.67" n="67"><hi rend="super">67</hi></ref>  When
ingenuity tires, we may fall back on eccentric distribution as an
almost-acceptable answer.</p>





<p>Thus far we have assumed that <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi> was
printed wholly on a single press. We need now to explore briefly
the possibility that a few of the early sheets were printed instead
on two presses. Reasons for making allowance for this possibility
include: (1) the neat division between pot and other watermarks in
sheets B and C; (2) the evidence of two compositors in C,
suggesting rapid composition; (3) the three to one ratio of
uncorrected pulls in the two formes of C, suggesting a lag

<pb n="001.175"/>

between presses; and (4) the incidence of Easter, 5 April
1640,<ref target="f001.11.68" n="68"><hi rend="super">68</hi></ref>  and consequent abnormal
working conditions in the printing-house. These reasons are not
material, but they are clues worth investigating.</p>


<p>The equal balance between pot and IHS watermarks in sheet B
urges the idea of simultaneous printing on two presses.
Simultaneous printing would seem a natural method for machining the
first sheet of a play, if two presses were available.<ref
target="f001.11.69" n="69"><hi rend="super">69</hi></ref>  Press
1 (say) might begin with the
inner forme (skeleton X) and print a ream and a half of pot paper,
while press 2 would take the outer forme (skeleton Y) and print a
similar amount of IHS paper. At this point the pressmen would
exchange heaps and begin to perfect each other's work. The first
man through would provide the first forme on of the next sheet; and
this in itself might cause such a shift in skeletons as that
between B and C.</p>


<p>At this stage single-press printing might begin, or both presses
might continue. However, sheet C cannot have been printed
simultaneously, for the uncorrected states are found back to back.
The relay system might be used&mdash;that in which one press prints and
the other perfects.<ref target="f001.11.70" n="70"><hi rend="super">70</hi></ref>  Following this
method, we may suppose that press 1 would continue with pot paper,
using up the second ream and a half of it before pausing for
corrections. When they arrived, it probably would go on to impress
the corrected inner state on IHS and bird paper. In that case press
2 might follow after a ream or so with the uncorrected state of
outer C.<ref target="f001.11.71" n="71"><hi rend="super">71</hi></ref>  An advantage of this
procedure is that press

<pb n="001.176"/>

2 might receive corrections at much the same time as press 1, that
is, after press 1 had printed three tokens (half the run) and press
2 had perfected about one. If the inner forme received its
corrections first, the lag of the second press might be more than
a ream, and there would be little danger of smudging. But all three
papers would have to originate with press 1.</p>



<p>The apparently balanced distribution of papers in sheet C
suggests an interesting variation. After press 1 had printed the
three tokens of pot paper, it could receive the outer forme and
begin perfecting. In the meantime inner C, now corrected, might
find press 2 idle and use it for printing the second half of the
edition sheet, on IHS and bird paper laid out for that press. Press
1 after perfecting a token would need to stop for corrections,
about midday. It might end in perfecting the sheets printed by both
presses.</p>

<p>Whatever the system used to print sheet D, it looks as if
perfecting was completed at the end of a day, when a shift of
skeletons took place. The time needed for relay printing is not
easy to reckon, but two presses could handle an edition-sheet of
1500 in one day if the second press followed the first by two or
three tokens. In the meantime, however, the first press would be
able to go on to new work.</p>

<p>The uncertainties are too many in view of our little
acquaintance with two-press work and the meanings of watermarks. At
present the best evidence in favor of the use of two presses in any
sheet of <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi> seems to be that of two
compositors at work on sheet C&mdash;where there might be the need of
keeping up with two presses turning out sheet B. Actually, the
intrusive compositor seems to have set just two pages of C, and
there might be various reasons for his appearance. If we could
assign a single two-press method to sheets B, C, D, the idea of two
presses would be more attractive. Or if the pot paper of B and C
extended into D, we might accept two-press printing for B and C.
However, so neatly does the one-press hypothesis fit with the
meaning suggested for the skeleton

<pb n="001.177"/>

shifts, with the apparent relation between press corrections and
watermarks in sheets C and F, and with the evidence of parallel
work on <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
Coronation</hi>&mdash;there
seems little reason to look for an ornate explanation. At the same
time, it is manifest that we need more light on two-press methods;
and it looks as if variant watermarks, when studied, may furnish
some.</p>

<p>There remains the question of the approximate period during
which <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi> was put through the press. We have
a
fairly definite <hi rend="italic">terminus ad quem</hi>. After some three years in
Ireland, Shirley returned to England in mid-April 1640.<ref
target="f001.11.72" n="72"><hi rend="super">72</hi></ref>
He must have reached London about
Monday, April 20.<ref target="f001.11.73" n="73"><hi rend="super">73</hi></ref>  As he found his

play "emergent from the Preffe, and prepar'd to feeke entertainment
abroad," we may take it that sheets B to K were then printed and
ready, or sheet K was coming from the press. Reckoning back in
terms of 1500 copies, a single press, and the skeleton shifts, we
can make a schedule with tentative dates. It starts on April Fool's
day and need not be taken as revelation.</p>



<p>April 1, 2, 4 (Wed.-Sat. of Holy Week). Sheet B composed and
printed. A compositor would set about six pages on the first
day,<ref target="f001.11.74" n="74"><hi rend="super">74</hi></ref>  and printing might begin late
on the morning of the 2nd. If the pressman did not labor on Good
Friday, but worked all day Saturday, he would finish perfecting the
sheet by that evening; and the first skeleton shift would come at
the end of a week. Meanwhile, sheet C would be composed, one
compositor setting two pages on Thursday afternoon (say) and
another the remaining six on Saturday.</p>


<p>April 6-11 (Easter week). Sheets C, D, E printed; C and D on the
first three days, E after a delay (of uncertain length) on
Friday-Saturday. The late corrections in inner C may be due to

<pb n="001.178"/>

the late arrival of the Cotes brothers or their corrector on Easter
Monday. Skeleton X got turned at the time of the delay, and the
week ends with the third shift of skeletons.</p>

<p>April 13-18 (Mon.-Sat.). Sheets F, G, H, I printed. If inner F
was printed first and outer F was the perfecting forme, corrections
must have been made between days after a ream of uncorrected pulls.
The press handled a normal week's run of four edition-sheets. At
the end of the week skeleton X got turned again.</p>

<p>April 20-22 (Mon.-Wed.). Sheet K and half-sheet A printed.
Shirley came to the printing-house on Monday or Tuesday and wrote
the dedication to Captain Owen. If there were no delay, the
half-sheet might be printed on Tuesday afternoon and perfected on
Wednesday morning. Gathering into copies might take place later the
same day.</p>

<p>Though there is no way to check the details of this schedule,
the general idea in it seems right enough, and the imagined
sequence is instructive. We realize that one press would take
nearly three weeks to produce an edition of 1500 copies. We note
that Easter may have contributed to the irregularities of sheet C.
The shifts and turns of skeleton suggest reasonable allocations of
work to particular days and weeks. And through analogy we can
measure the amount of time Cotes took to print <hi rend="italic">The
Coronation</hi>, and perhaps the whole series of 1639/40
Fletcher-Shirley quartos.</p>

<p>We can now cast up accounts. Study of the variant
watermarks<ref target="f001.11.75" n="75"><hi rend="super">75</hi></ref>  in <hi rend="italic">The
Opportunitie</hi> has enabled us to draw several useful inferences:
(1) It was printed in an edition of 1500 copies. (2) It was
produced mainly or wholly on a single press parallel with <hi rend="italic">The
Coronation</hi>. (3) Late corrections, when made, occurred between

<pb n="001.179"/>

tokens or reams, and sometimes at noon or night. (4) Composition
and presswork on the quarto took approximately the first three
weeks of April 1640.</p>


<p>Similar study of other play quartos, and indeed books of various
formats, dates, and printers, should improve the quality of such
inferences, and should throw light on two-press work and other
procedures of the printing-house. One weakness of watermarks as
evidence is their inherent ambiguity. And they lend themselves to
subtleties and complications. Clearly, he who looks for meaning in
their permutations needs to temper ingenuity with calm common
sense. Bibliographers who fear madness may prefer to let them
alone.</p>

<p>There are, however, some simple uses of variant watermarks that
may help to preserve sanity. I mention three.</p>

<p>First, an obvious point. Everyone knows that in first editions
the preliminaries were commonly printed last, but everyone cannot
readily demonstrate the fact. A glance at the tables of watermarks
found in <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Coronation</hi>
is
enough to assure oneself that half-sheet A of both these plays was
printed at least among the last. However, the continuity of
watermarks is sometimes lacking, as in <hi rend="italic">Loves Crueltie</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">The Night-Walker;</hi> and in such cases there may have been a
delay in printing the preliminary half-sheet.</p>

<p>The second point presents a useful corollary. As press
corrections are ever a highly important source of evidence as to
what an author wrote, we need aids in searching them out. Variant
watermarks are such an aid. After the investigator has listed the
watermarks in several copies of a book, he will sometimes find such
a contrast between papers as we have noted in sheets C and F of
<hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi>. In these cases he may well suspect
variants and begin collation in sheets with two contrasting marks.
Naturally, he will not always find variants: collation of sheet B
of <hi rend="italic">The Opportunitie</hi> in terms of pot and IHS papers yields
none; yet collation of the same papers

<pb n="001.180"/>

in sheet C brings to light corrections in the inner forme, and may
do so likewise in the outer forme. Clearly this should prove a
time-saving device. Working without knowledge of the watermarks,
one might examine five or even seven copies of <hi rend="italic">The
Opportunitie</hi> (among the twelve of the table) before finding
variants in inner C. In collating some other sheets, the student
would have fewer rewards, but before long he would have reason to
suspect that most of the formes are invariant.</p>

<p>The principle is simply this: Since textual variants sometimes
occur on contrasting papers, one should collate formes printed on
such papers first. To this may be added: Since composition of pages
in normal order favored a custom of sending the inner forme to
press first and the first forme might wait some time for
corrections,<ref target="f001.11.76" n="76"><hi rend="super">76</hi></ref>  one should collate
inner formes first, at least in two-skeleton printing.</p>


<p>My first attempts to apply the principle were instructive.
Noting that my copy of <hi rend="italic">The Coronation</hi> differed from the
University of Chicago copy in watermarks in several sheets, I
collated these sheets&mdash;and found no variants. Then I realized that
only in sheet E were the contrasting marks (bird and grapes)
representative, so far as I could tell from five copies. Next I
compared the Inderwick-Folger copy of <hi rend="italic">The Night-Walker</hi>
(using a microfilm) with the Newberry copy. The first two sheets I
tried yielded variants. Sheet C, with bird and spray marks, proved
variant in its inner forme. Sheet G, with pot and IHS marks, proved
variant in its outer forme. Testing farther, I listed the
watermarks in three copies of <hi rend="italic">A Pastorall Called the
Arcadia</hi>, "Written by <hi rend="italic">Iames Shirly</hi> Gent." (an unlikely

attribution) and printed by John Dawson, 1640. It is evident that
Dawson was buying some of the same job-lot papers that Cotes
bought. I noted that in sheet C my copy
agreed with the Newberry copy in its watermark (lion on a shield)
but not with the Chicago copy (15 grapes). Turning at once to the
inner forme, I found no corrections on C1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, but at
C2<hi rend="super">r</hi> 4
"wisper"

<pb n="001.181"/>

in my copy and "whisper" in the Chicago copy. Thus admonished, I
did not shout. But, whatever my run of luck, I was confident I had
a gadget that would save some time in collation.</p>

<p>The third (and last) point illustrates the surprises that may
lurk in watermarks. Examining the University of Chicago copy of
<hi rend="italic">The Queene of Arragon</hi>, by William Habington, I rejoiced to
find three watermarks I knew well&mdash;in the midst of folio pages
where I could measure them: several IHS marks, many grape marks,
and once the bird with wings outstretched. A few days later I
looked at the Newberry copy, and discovered a startling thing. The
watermarks were different. No IHS marks, no bird mark, just one
thin page with grapes. The prevailing mark in the Newberry copy is
a long heraldic panel surmounted by a thin cross, the whole not too
plain.<ref target="f001.11.77" n="77"><hi rend="super">77</hi></ref>  The paper is thicker than
the intrusive grape paper and apparently of a better sort. What is
the solution to this little mystery? Although I have not had the
copies side by each, I can hardly doubt they are the same setting.
The play (collation A<hi rend="super">2</hi>
B-H<hi rend="super">4</hi>I<hi rend="super">3</hi>) is probably
too long to
leave in
standing type. My guess is that Habington, a butterfly sort of
courtier-poet, had a number of copies printed on better-grade paper
for himself and his friends, and that Tom Cotes simply included a
token or so of this paper in the paper laid out for each sheet. It
might be printed last in each edition-sheet so as to benefit from
corrections. There would have to be care in gathering the fancy
copies, and it is not surprising that one bunch of grapes got in by
accident or lack of a fine-paper sheet.<ref
target="f001.11.78" n="78"><hi rend="super">78</hi></ref>  I have no idea
whether such special
printings were rare or not. "The matter deserves further
study."<ref target="f001.11.00" n="78a"><hi rend="super">78a</hi></ref> </p>




<pb n="001.182"/>

<p>The purpose of this paper has been to call attention to the
significance of variant or dissimilar watermarks for
bibliographical study. Certain findings of the paper are naturally
tentative, subject to the discoveries and corrections of further
investigation. But enough has been done to show that the new tool,
when its subtleties have yielded to patient analysis, will take its
place beside press corrections, headlines, and our knowledge of
hand presses as a useful means of enquiry into the manner in which
books were made. Actually the tool is an old one put to new
employment. A generation of scholars has used inconsistency in
watermarks to spot cancels,<ref target="f001.11.79" n="79"><hi rend="super">79</hi></ref>
inserted sheets,<ref target="f001.11.80" n="80"><hi rend="super">80</hi></ref>  mixed issues,
standing type,<ref target="f001.11.81" n="81"><hi rend="super">81</hi></ref>  made-up copies,
facsimiles,<ref target="f001.11.82" n="82"><hi rend="super">82</hi></ref> , and other
irregularities. Indeed, <hi rend="italic">les filigranes</hi> have come a long way
since Briquet compiled his distinguished
work, and since A. W. Pollard remarked in the 11th
<hi rend="italic">Britannica</hi> that watermarks are helpful in distinguishing
between gatherings. I believe that their aid can be extended to the
study of various normal, though relatively complex, situations, and
that this aid will prove substantial when it is properly correlated
with other bibliographical evidence.</p>

<p>Figure 1 of the appended illustrations shows a St. Memin copper
plate portrait of Landon Carter, now the property of Mr. Dabney
Wellford of Sabine Hall. It is important for several reasons. Of
the St. Memin plates that have survived, it is one of the ones
which have not been steel faced by modern engravers for restrikes.
It is the only one known which carries even a portion of a
manufacturer's mark on the verso, thus showing the source of St.
Memin's copper plate supply at least in one instance:

<name type="title">A Bibliographical Note from the Beaumont and
Fletcher First
Folio</name>
<lb/><name type="author">Guy A. Battle</name>
</head>


<p>In the Beaumont and Fletcher first folio (1647) there are
examples of a little-used type of bibliographical evidence: that of
progressive changes in the boxlines. The boxlines were apparently
made up of a number of flexible pieces which often were bent by the
pressure of the furniture in a slightly different way each time
they were set up with type. Consequently, a number of minute
changes, which progressively developed as the boxlines were used,
may be discerned. Because of the flexibility of these rules their
evidence is tenuous, but often they will provide a clue as to
forme-order or a support for other evidence. Indeed, sometimes even
considered alone, this evidence cannot very well be ignored.</p>

<p>For example, in the fifth section of the folio, one set of
boxlines had a break in the top line, left side (with respect to
the type). This remained constant for many printings, but on
5R2<hi rend="super">r</hi> the gap was pushed together so that the rules
overlapped.
Then, on 5R3<hi rend="super">r</hi> the rules were evidently wedged down by
the
furniture and remained in this position, unchanged, for printing
many subsequent formes. Under a glass the progressive change is
obvious and definite.</p>

<p>It is probable, then, that at this point the outer forme was
printed before the inner forme. (One other small progressive change
also supports this assumption.) Also, by the same kind of evidence
two quite obvious forme sequences are indicated: that the inner
forme of the outer sheet of 5P was

<pb n="001.188"/>

printed before the outer forme of the inner sheet of 5Q and that
the outer forme of the outer sheet of 5R was impressed before the
outer forme of the middle sheet of 5S (a gathering of three
sheets).</p>

<p>A close scrutiny of alterations in the rules that form boxlines,
in conjunction with a study of their running-titles, will often,
perhaps, reveal clues as to forme-order and provide valuable
controls at certain points in bibliographical studies.</p>

<name type="title">Center Rules in Folio Printing: A New Kind of
Bibliographical Evidence</name><lb/>
<name type="author">James S. Steck</name>
</head>


<p>Even more useful than running-titles for identifying the
skeleton-formes used to print a book are the box-rules enclosing
the type-pages of various hand-printed folios.<ref
target="f001.14.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>  Bald and
Willoughby have demonstrated
that the strips of metal constituting the box-rules were treated by
early printers as integral parts of the skeleton-forme. However, a
problem which has not been formally considered is the relation of
the center rule separating the two columns of a double-column folio
type-page to the enclosing box-rules. A study of Section 5 of the
1647 Beaumont and Fletcher Folio produces previously unsuspected
bibliographical evidence which, when fully developed, may make
possible a more minute study of the processes of early
printing.</p>


<p>The first fact revealed is that the center rule<ref
target="f001.14.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>  does
not bear to the box the same
relation which the box maintains to the skeleton-forme: in other
words, the center rule cannot be considered an integral part of the
skeleton-forme.</p>


 <pb entity="sb011891" n="001.189"/>

<p>As an illustration I have made up a table for the various
appearances of these center rules in the first six gatherings of
Griffin's section (Section 5) of the Beaumont and Fletcher
Folio.<ref target="f001.14.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> </p>

<p>
<!-- <figure entity="sb011891"></figure> -->
</p>

<p>The evidence of this partial table shows clearly that because of
the irregular occurrence of the center rules within the various
skeletons and their boxes, no reliance in difficult cases may be
placed upon center rules as a means of identifying the box-rules in
which they are found.</p>

<p>The irregular appearance of these rules requires explanation.
When the printer came to impose the type-pages of a new forme, the
box-rules enclosing the wrought-off type-pages would be transferred
as an integral part of the skeleton; but on the evidence of the
table, the center rule&mdash;in effect a part of the type-page
itself&mdash;was not removed from the type-page until distribution of
at least one column of type had been effected. The reason would
appear to be fairly simple. To leave the center rule between the
two columns is

<pb n="001.190"/>

obviously an expedient to prevent the pieing which would almost
certainly ensue if the rule were removed before the compositor was
ready to distribute the type.<ref target="f001.14.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> </p>


<p>The recurrence of these center rules in different formes,
however irregularly, indicates that the compositor found it a
convenience to have on hand a supply of rules made up to the proper
length. We should thus expect him to lay the center rule aside on
the bench, once it had been freed from its type-page by the
distribution of a column of letterpress. Hence, there is the
possibility of estimating at least the maximum distribution period
for a type-page by tracing the reappearance of its center rule in
another forme. This evidence, of course, can never be completely
exact. We have no reason to believe that a compositor would always
pick up a center rule in the precise order in which it had been
laid aside on the bench. Moreover it is necessary to inquire just
when he would place the center rule between the columns of a
newly-composed type-page. The answer is of some interest as
revealing the precise way in which, on the evidence of Griffin's
section, a large double-column
type-page was composed.</p>

<p>There are two possibilities. First, after completing the first
column of his page, the compositor might take a center rule from
the bench, lay it in the page-galley against the type margin, and
then proceed to set the second column, transferring type from his
composing-stick until the two-column page-galley was complete. If
he did so, he would have an uncomfortably large type-page to
transfer, by means of his slice, from the page-galley to the
composing-stone. That this operation was possible is shown by the
various folios which are set in a single column of long lines, but
there would seem to be little question that with a double-column
page a single column of type would be easier to handle as a unit.
For this reason we might expect a compositor to follow the second
alternative and transfer the letterpress from his page-galley to
the stone after he had completed only a single column. If he did
so, he could then (a) place his center rule beside the column, or
(b) insert it when
the second column was composed and placed beside the first on the
stone, or (c) there could be a delay until two completed type-pages
were ready and were being imposed from the skeleton of a
wrought-off forme.</p>

<p>A study of gathering 5A indicates that, at least for this
section of the folio, the compositor adopted the third method (c).
When we follow him in the order of composition, we see that
type-page 1 recto uses an unidentified

<pb n="001.191"/>

rule, 1 verso rule 1, and 2 recto rule 2. But when on 2 verso we
find rule 1 once more, it is clear that this rule can appear in
these two pages only if it had been inserted as a part of the
process of imposition.<ref target="f001.14.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> </p>


<p>By this demonstration that the rule in question would be placed
in a new type-page at the last possible moment, we can narrow our
estimate of the spread in time between the moment when a rule
becomes available by the distribution of at least one column of its
type-page, and the time when the rule is employed again. In turn,
this greater precision should enable us to estimate more accurately
in these double-column folios the chronological relation between
imposition and presswork on a new forme and distribution of the
type-pages of a wrought-off forme. Clearly, the kind of evidence
afforded by center rules must always be used to supplement and to
check the evidence from running-titles and box-rules in any attempt
to break down the precise method by which two presses printed a
related series of sheets.<ref target="f001.14.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> </p>

above in this present volume, supplementing his more extensive

section appears at times above the shorter rule, and at other times
below it; at other times the sections of the rules maintain the

There are two such boxes in each skeleton-forme; therefore, for the

<name type="title">Textual Revision in Crashaw's "Vpon the Bleeding
Crvcifix"</name><lb/>
<name type="author">George W. Williams</name>
</head>


<p>It is commonly thought that Crashaw's religious lyrics "have
only the structure that is given by the string in a rosary,"<ref
target="f001.15.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>  and thus lack the kind of careful,
"articulated structure"<ref target="f001.15.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>  often
achieved by George Herbert. However, Crashaw was, in fact, capable
of this "articulated structure": an interesting example will be
found in a comparison of the two versions of the poem entitled in
1646 "On the bleeding wounds of our crucified Lord," in 1648 "On
the bleeding body of our crucified Lord," and in 1652 "Vpon the

<pb n="001.192"/>

bleeding Crvcifix A Song."<ref target="f001.15.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref>  The
progressive change of name is significant. The emphasis has been
shifted from the wounds through the body to the crucifix, and the
key to the new structure has been suggested, for the poem has been
made consciously cruciform in the later version. No major change
has occurred in the thought of the poem, but the deceptively simple
transposition in lines two and three of the first stanza and the
consequential rearrangement of the order of the following four
stanzas evidence a certain intention to provide the 1648 version
with an articulated structure in keeping with the new name for the
poem.</p>




<p>An examination of the two versions of the first stanza reveals
Crashaw's statement of the form in the second version.

<q>1646: Iesu, no more, it is full: de From thy hands and from thy
feet, From thy head, and from thy side, All thy <hi rend="italic">Purple
Rivers</hi> meet.</q>

<q>1648 and 1652: Iesu, no more! It is full tide. From thy head &amp;
from thy feet, From thy hands &amp; from thy side All the purple
Riuers meet.</q>

By the single interchange of "hands" and "head," the 1648 stanza
immediately becomes cruciform. The second line, "head . . . feet,"
gives the vertical support, the third line, "hands", provides the
crossbar. Furthermore, the words parallel the movement of the hand
in making the sign of the cross.</p>

<p>The elaboration of this statement follows to build the
articulated structure. In both versions each of the second through
fifth stanzas deals with one of the wounds of the Christ. In the
1646 version these stanzas bear no formal relation to the order of
the wounds in the opening statement. Thus, "hands . . . feet . . .
head . . . side," the order in the first stanza, is expanded in the
random manner: "feet . . . hand . . . side . . . head."<ref
target="f001.15.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref>
In the 1648 revision, however, Crashaw
has so rearranged the order of the second through fifth stanzas
that the statement of the theme is expanded identically in the
stanzas. Thus, the order in the first stanza, "head . . . feet . .
. hands . . . side," is reproduced in the same order in the
stanzas: "head . . . feet . . . hands . . . side."<ref
target="f001.15.05" n="5">5</ref> </p>



<pb n="001.193"/>

<p>It is evident that this is no casual rearrangement, but that
Crashaw is consciously revising to create a cruciform poem which
outlines a small crucifix in the opening lines and proceeds to
enlarge the picture in the body of the poem.</p>

(1830)</name><lb/>
<name type="author">Mary Virginia Bowman</name>
</head>


<p>Tennyson's <hi rend="italic">Poems, Chiefly Lyrical</hi> (1830) was
originally
intended as part of a joint publication to include the poems of his
college friend, Arthur Hallam, but when Hallam's father objected to
the project it was abandoned and Tennyson published separately his
section of the proposed collection. Parental objection to the
publication of Hallam's poems had not been made, however, until
type-setting had been completed. Hence Hallam ordered some copies
of his own section to be run off for private distribution among his
family and friends.<ref target="f001.16.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> </p>


<p>The obscurity of Hallam's book of poems in this privately issued
form has given rise to two major misconceptions. The first&mdash;that
only two copies have survived&mdash;was clarified in 1941 when T. H.
Vail Motter made a census listing the details of fifteen known
copies.<ref target="f001.16.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> </p>


<p>A second misconception&mdash;that at least one copy of the
originally intended joint collection actually survives&mdash;still
remains to be considered. This error was given credence by Hugh
I'Anson Fausset in his biography of Tennyson (1923). After
commenting that Hallam's idea of a public collaboration with
Tennyson was abandoned only when the volume had actually been put
into type, Fausset made the flat statement, "A copy of it exists
today."<ref target="f001.16.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> </p>


<pb n="001.194"/>

<p>This odd statement seems to go back to an unsigned report in
<hi rend="italic">The Bookworm</hi>, a London publication in January, 1894 (VII,
48) which describes the sale at Sotheby's of a copy of the two
sections bound together. After explaining the original intention of
a joint production, the article continues, "and no copy of the
complete book has hitherto occurred for sale. In the copy in
question, however, Hallam's poems are included." Such a statement
could be read to mean a surviving copy of the originally intended
publication, or <hi rend="italic">The Bookworm</hi> may have meant only that this

copy is in the form originally planned. The first reading seems
more probable, however, in the light of the statement further on:
"Some partially erased pencil notes . . . render it probable that
the volume is a unique proof copy belonging to Hallam himself."
There is nothing in the context of this passage to indicate <hi rend="italic">The
Bookworm</hi> remarks are directed at Hallam's section alone.</p>

<p>The confusion seems to be based on the assumption (now known to
be false) that no copies of Hallam's <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> had survived the
<hi rend="italic">non imprimatur</hi>. Therefore, since this volume was in
existence, it was explained as a proof copy of the originally
intended publication. The ghost raised by Fausset from this shadowy
evidence remains to be laid.</p>

<p>The copy described in <hi rend="italic">The Bookworm</hi> (no. 8 in
Motter's
census which refers to the 1925 sale, the volume having eluded him
thereafter) was auctioned at Sotheby's in December, 1893,
where&mdash;according to <hi rend="italic">Book Prices Current
1894</hi>&mdash;it was
bought by the bookseller Pearson.<ref target="f001.16.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref>
It appeared on the market again in a sale at the Anderson
Galleries, New York, in December, 1925 (Sale Catalogue no. 2007,
item 291), and once more in December, 1933, at the Ritter-Hopson
sale of the James M. Kennedy collection, where it was purchased by
Tracy W. McGregor of Detroit. After his death in 1936, the book was
bequeathed as a part of his collection to the University of
Virginia, where it is now preserved in the McGregor Library. That
this is the volume referred to by <hi rend="italic">The Bookworm</hi> writer is
sufficiently demonstrated by its exact correspondence to his
description, including the partially erased pencil notes.</p>


<p>This book is bound in calf (as described in 1894), with
"TENNYSON'S POEMS" lettered on the spine. It begins with Tennyson's
<hi rend="italic">Poems, Chiefly Lyrical</hi> (1830), 154 pages, page 91
misnumbered 19, with "carcanet" on p. 72. The final leaf of
advertisements has been removed. Hallam's <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi>, 174
pages,
follow directly, without the preliminary two-leaf fold containing
a blank and the half-title, and without the final blank. At the top
of page 1 is inked in a printing hand "Poems | by | Arthur Hallam
Esq<hi rend="super">r</hi>." Presumably the

<pb n="001.195"/>

same hand (although in the nature of things this cannot be certain)
has also printed on Tennyson's title-page beneath Tennyson's name
"&amp; | ARTHUR HALLAM." At the top right hand corner of
Tennyson's
title in a different hand is written "E.H.F. from Aunt Julia |
March 1859."</p>

<p>Throughout the book, both in the Tennyson and in the Hallam
sections, are found pencil annotations (most of them partially or
completely erased). These are written in what seem to be three
hands, all of which are different from the Aunt Julia inscription.
The first hand is confined to the written identifications under the
titles of three poems in Hallam's section, as "Sir F. A. Doyle",
which have not been erased. On the errata page of Tennyson's part
is inscribed in what is probably a different hand "To | Edith
Hamilton Forsyth", which has been erased but can be read in an
infra-red photograph. This writing is somewhat similar to the hand
that wrote the identifications, but the inscription is much
smaller. Owing to the small amount of the writing it is impossible
to make a positive decision, but the two are probably unlike. It is
certain, however, that a still different hand has made a number of
pencil comments on various poems in both sections, all of them more
or less
thoroughly erased although some are still readable either by
infra-red photographs or by an occasional convenient offset. A
sample is the remark on p. 157 of Hallam's section, "I think this
would be pleasing if it were intelligible." On p. 5 of Tennyson's
<hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> the writer has copied in quotation marks the next to
the last line of the poem "Like a roseleaf I will crush thee" and
has drawn two sets of roseleaves.</p>

<p>Unique interest is given to these annotations by the tradition
which has grown up that this is a Hallam family copy. <hi rend="italic">The
Bookworm</hi> writer insinuates that these notes are by Arthur
Hallam ("Some partially erased pencil notes . . . render it
probable that the volume is a unique proof copy belonging to Hallam
himself."). Later sales catalogue descriptions of the book ascribe
the pencil notes as well as the additions on the title-page to
Henry Hallam and identify Aunt Julia in the inscription "E.H.F.
from Aunt Julia" as Hallam's sister, Julia, who, according to the
fiction, passed the book on to a descendent after Henry Hallam's
death in 1859.<ref target="f001.16.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> </p>


<p>The source of this belief is unknown. It is probably based
mostly on wishful thinking, although possibly it is also related to
the erroneous concept that this was the only copy of the Hallam
<hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> in existence, which

<pb n="001.196"/>

made it seem very probable that the book was Arthur Hallam's own
copy, kept by his father after Arthur's death in 1833.<ref
target="f001.16.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> </p>


<p>However, the identification of the inscription handwriting as
that of Julia Hallam seems most unlikely in the face of the
evidence of the bookplate, within the front cover, of John Edwardes
Lyall (born 1811 and died 1845), who is apparently the son of
George Lyall and Margaret Ann Edwardes. The evidence of his name is
corroborated by the fact that he married a Julia Davis, with his
sister marrying in 1843 a William Forsyth. Moreover, it is possible
to establish the fact that Lyall and Arthur Hallam were acquainted,
and presumably friends. The two attended Eton together and were
fellow members in the small Eton Society, where they must have
become intimate.<ref target="f001.16.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref>  Thus it is
perfectly natural for Lyall to have been the recipient of a copy of
his poems from Hallam, or just possibly from his father.</p>


<p>This book, in its present form except for the binding, must have
come into the possession of John Edwardes Lyall early in its
history, for he died in 1845 after having been made Advocate
General of Bengal in 1842. It is improbable that his bookplate
would have been inserted in a book after his death, and since the
plate is pasted in the present binding, this makes the combination
of the Hallam and Tennyson poems prior to 1845, and almost
certainly prior to 1842. The binding, although preserved in a
slip-case since 1894, is somewhat loose and shows signs of
considerable wear.</p>

<p>In connection with this question of the date at which the Hallam
and Tennyson parts were brought together, one group of the pencil
annotations has a very considerable significance. These are the
partially erased annotations in the same hand commenting on the
poems in both sections. In the process of binding the present
volume, some of the final letters of this set

<pb n="001.197"/>

have been shaved off, thus establishing the writing of these
particular annotations, at least, as prior to the present calf
binding, which itself is to be dated as prior to 1842.<ref
target="f001.16.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref>  So
far as can be determined from the
relatively small amount of writing preserved, the hand that wrote
these pencil comments on various Tennyson and Hallam poems bears a
remarkable resemblance to that of Arthur Hallam.<ref
target="f001.16.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref>  In
these circumstances, there is
nothing to prevent the hypothesis that Arthur wrote in these two
parts already sewn together and then presented them to an Eton (and
perhaps Inner Temple) classmate; or else, just possibly, after his
son's death Henry Hallam may have sent the volume to a friend,
Lyall. Moreover, the comments themselves show such a close interest
in the poems as to be more likely those of the author than those of
a friend.</p>



<p>Thus, there seem to be two alternatives. If the handwriting is
authentically Arthur Hallam's, then this is a presentation copy of
the two associated sections made by him, or by his father, to a
friend. Or, if the handwriting is that of an unknown person, the
book is a made up combination such as could have been done by any
individual at any time by combining the two first editions.</p>

<p>There is no justification for the statement that this is a proof
copy, for it is not on the paper that would have been used for a
proof (the paper seems to be the same as that used in the other
first edition of Tennyson's <hi rend="italic">Poems, Chiefly Lyrical</hi> in the
McGregor Library). Moreover the pencil annotations which can be
deciphered are not the sort of notes made when reading proof.</p>

<p>Nor is there any justification for assuming that this is a copy
of a published book in collected form. Those who believed in an
actually published copy of the two sections can have had in mind
only one of three possible

<pb n="001.198"/>

forms: (1) A collection in which the original plan was to sign and
page the sheets of the two sections consecutively, not separately
as found at present. (2) A "publisher's" title-page replacing
either Tennyson's present title-page or Hallam's half-title. (3) A
collection which simply binds the two parts as we know them now; in
other words, a replica of the McGregor volume but possibly
containing the Hallam half-title and very likely cancelling the
Tennyson advertisement leaf.</p>

<p>The first is based on what is probably a false assumption.<ref
target="f001.16.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref>  A collection such as the two young men
were contemplating would quite naturally be separately signed and
paged in its two parts in order that separate issue of some copies
could be made if required. To believe that any other form existed,
impressed on paper, than is known from the present separate
examples of each part is to believe that some sheets of Hallam's
part were actually printed consecutively signed and paged with
Tennyson's, and then the type-pages were altered for Hallam's
private printing. This is an absurdity.</p>


<p>The writer of <hi rend="italic">The Bookworm</hi> account seems to waver
between
the second or third possibilities, although he is not overly clear
in the matter. The second would require the present Tennyson
title-leaf, and possibly the Hallam half-title, to be a cancellans,
for which there is no evidence.<ref target="f001.16.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref>  As
for the third possibility, any binding of the two parts together in
their present form is by no means&mdash;as Fausset hastily took
it&mdash;proof of collected publication. Any private person could
perform this operation, and indeed there is a

<pb n="001.199"/>

record that one did.<ref target="f001.16.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref>  In fact,
however, no bound-together copies, except for the McGregor volume,
are known to exist today.</p>


<p>To conclude, the tracing of the history of the McGregor volume
back to the Sotheby sale in 1893 and its establishment as the
collected volume described by the writer of <hi rend="italic">The Bookworm</hi>
article demonstrates that, whatever interpretation is placed on his
comments in 1894, there is nothing in this book which under any
circumstances could lead to a belief, as with Fausett, that a copy
of the originally intended collection was ever in existence. The
McGregor collection is the unique example of what seems to be a
fairly well authenticated joint binding; yet, at best, it can be
shown only to have been put together from two separate parts,
either by Hallam himself or by Lyall, in what we may suppose is
substantially the form the proposed joint publication would have
taken with the exception of a general title naming the two authors
(never printed) and the doubtful matter of whether the half-title
is missing here by design or by accident.</p>
 <note id="f001.16.01" n="1" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>The above is the accepted account and
doubtless approximates the actual facts, although precise evidence
is lacking. For example, it seems to be only an assumption that
Hallam's poems were still in type and had not been printed though
as yet unpublished when his father disrupted the plan. The present
makeup of his section presents no bibliographical evidence either
in favor of or against a form privately printed for personal
distribution. That the typesetting had been well advanced, if not
completed, is presumably demonstrated by the simple fact that
copies were struck off; also a footnote on p. 62 refers to "my
friend, whose name is prefixed with mine to this volume." Although
the retention of this last could have been an oversight, the only
real question is whether Hallam had a few copies privately printed
or whether he took as many already printed sheets as he required
and had the rest destroyed. If Tennyson's section had been planned
as the start of the
volume, then we must believe the first; if Hallam's were to come
initially, then the advertisement leaf concluding Tennyson's
<hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> is not evidence. The proposed order of the two parts
is not known. Possibly the appearance in both sections of the
printer's imprint is evidence in favor of only the private
printing.</p></note>

copy of Tennyson's <hi rend="italic">Poems, Chiefly Lyrical</hi> (London, 1830;
bound with Hallam's poems) have been too well erased to permit
positive identification of the writer. It can be said, negatively,
that the notes (which were made before the book was bound and
trimmed) are not in the hand of Henry Hallam. The formation of
those letters that can be clearly distinguished does bear a
striking resemblance to the hand of Arthur Hallam. On the other
hand, the three names, identifying persons to whom poems are
dedicated, are not in the hand of Arthur Hallam, and do bear a
considerable resemblance to the less distinctive writing of Henry
Hallam, the historian. The words on the errata
leaf, 'To Edith Hamilton Forsyth', appear to have been written by
a third person, certainly not by Arthur Hallam."</p></note>

"Hallam's father at the last minute, and when the poems were
already in type, forbade the joint publication. The printers,
Littlewood and Company, Old Bailey, separated Hallam's fifty titles
from Tennyson's fifty-five, and assembled a certain number of
copies of Hallam's, which Hallam then quietly presented to his
friends." <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, p. 277. Actually, Motter does not
believe in any form of collected publication, and is speaking only
of the makeup that Hallam's section took separately. Yet if the
poems were already in type, the separate signing and paging had
already been effected as a part of putting the type into
page-galley form, and since the text of Hallam's poems began with
the first leaf of a separately signed series of gatherings, there
would have been no "separation" of the type-pages for printing,
unless Motter is implying only that the
printing of the Tennyson and Hallam sections was accomplished at
two different times.</p></note>

<p>Bibliographers generally have assumed that preliminaries or
cancellanda of a book would be printed economically as part of the
final text gathering (or <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>) when space permitted.
Under ordinary circumstances this may surely be taken as a
reasonable hypothesis, but&mdash;it should be noticed&mdash;only when
the
two sections are of an unequal number of leaves. In a duodecimo
collating <hi rend="super">i</hi><hi rend="super">4</hi> A-N<hi rend="super">12</hi>
O<hi rend="super">8</hi>, as
in all the later duodecimos
of Sandys's translation of Ovid's <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi> except for
the 1690 edition, gathering <hi rend="super">i</hi><hi rend="super">4</hi> would
surely be printed as the
cut-off of the sheet with gathering O. Correspondingly, such
formulas as 4<hi rend="super">0</hi>,
A<hi rend="super">4</hi>(&mdash;A<hi rend="super">4</hi>)
B-G<hi rend="super">4</hi> H<hi rend="super">4</hi>(H4+1[=A4?])
for
Dryden's <hi rend="italic">Wild Gallant</hi> (1684), and <hi rend="italic">A</hi>1[=O4?]
B-N<hi rend="super">4</hi>
O<hi rend="super">4</hi>(&mdash;O4) for the anonymous <hi rend="italic">Feign'd
Astrologer</hi> (1668)
probably represent the actual facts of printing. Often the physical
evidence of a wrap-around in an unrebound copy,

<pb n="001.200"/>

or else aberrant binding, will demonstrate the fact for single
leaves. Thus, interestingly, the precise formula for Pordage's
<hi rend="italic">Herod and Mariamne</hi> (1673) as
<hi rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="super">4</hi>(-A1)
B-H<hi rend="super">4</hi>
I<hi rend="super">4</hi>(I4+1[=A1]) is proved by the aberrant Library of
Congress copy
of the 1674 re-issue in which the prologue leaf A4 is found bound
at the end and conjugate with the epilogue leaf I4+1, the two
obviously having been printed as A1.4 but the binder in this copy
transferring the outer fold in error instead of only the initial
leaf.</p>

<p>However, such printing was not invariable, and there are some
dangers in assuming it unless positive evidence is found. For
instance, if one hunts long enough, one will find the blank initial
leaf, as in the Harvard copy, of Behn's <hi rend="italic">Forc'd Marriage</hi>
(1671), which demonstrates that the actual formula for the book is
4<hi rend="super">0</hi>, <hi rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="super">4</hi>
B-L<hi rend="super">4</hi>
M<hi rend="super">4</hi>(M4+1), with sig. A1 blank
and
genuine and therefore not used to print sig. M4+1. Correspondingly,
in the 1615 folio of Sandys's <hi rend="italic">Relation of a Journey</hi>, the
final blank in the last gathering 2D<hi rend="super">6</hi> is sometimes
preserved to
indicate that the single-leaf dedication <hi rend="italic">A</hi>1 was not printed
there as one might otherwise have expected. Nevertheless, when
careful search in a large number of copies fails to turn up such
blanks, the natural inference in certain conditions is that the
blanks never existed for the simple reason that they were used to
print other leaves in the book.<ref
target="f001.17.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> </p>


<p>The cases mentioned above have concerned the major probability
that two sections of a book&mdash;one major and one minor&mdash;would

ordinarily be printed together for economy on one sheet. It is also
generally assumed that when a preliminary and the final text
gathering each consists of only half a sheet, the two would be
printed together. For example, in a quarto collating A<hi rend="super">2</hi>
B-L<hi rend="super">4</hi>
M<hi rend="super">2</hi>, the usual assumption is that A(i) and M(i) would be
imposed
together for printing as one forme, and&mdash;after being perfected by
A(o) and M(o) imposed together as another forme&mdash;the two halves
of
the sheet would be cut apart to form a single copy of each
gathering. In my opinion this is a dubious assumption, and I
suspect that as often as not each was separately imposed and
printed by half-sheet imposition, the four type-pages of A in one
forme and the four of M in another. The evidence of watermarks has
frequently been taken as bearing on this question: if in such a
book A<hi rend="super">2</hi>, for instance,
contained a watermark and M<hi rend="super">2</hi> none, the case was
considered
demonstrated that the two were printed together. Again in my
opinion, for reasons too complex for inquiry here, this watermark
evidence is frequently untrustworthy.</p>

<pb n="001.201"/>

<p>It is my purpose in this note to suggest a form of truly
bibliographical evidence which can be utilized with confidence
under certain conditions to determine precisely whether two
half-sheets were printed together or separately. (This question is
not altogether one of idle curiosity: textual considerations may
enter in such a connection.) Since evidence is drawn from the
running-titles, one must have a book in which running-titles are
present on at least one page each of the outer and inner formes of
the half-sheet text gathering under examination.</p>

<p>Given this common condition, the evidence is very simple. If the
running-titles from only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> forme used to print a preceding
full sheet of the text are found in <hi rend="italic">both</hi> formes of the text
half-sheet, then this half-sheet was printed by itself by
half-sheet imposition. (The order of the titles is important, as
will be seen: for a readily determined exception to this
generalization, see footnote 2 below.) To demonstrate this fact,
all one needs to do is mentally to transfer the quarters (as in a
quarto) from a skeleton forme and impose them in the same relative
positions about the four type-pages imposed for half-sheet
printing. For instance, if the skeleton of inner L is being
transferred to half-sheet M, the running-title of L1<hi rend="super">v</hi> should
go
to M1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, L2 to M1, L4 to M2, and L3<hi rend="super">v</hi>
to
M2<hi rend="super">v</hi>. If, in such a
book, A (without running-titles) and M were imposed together, inner
with inner in one forme and outer with outer in another, the
running-titles from certain of the quarters of inner L would be found in the
same order as above (depending on the position in the (AM) sheet of the
two halves): L1<hi rend="super">v</hi> to M1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and L4 to M2,
or the corresponding
quarters of the other half of the skeleton. But, when the skeleton of the
outer forme of L was transferred to the outer (AM) forme,
L4<hi rend="super">v</hi> would
go probably to M2<hi rend="super">v</hi> and L1 to M1, or the corresponding
quarters. Thus
running-titles from both inner and outer L would necessarily be found in
half-sheet M in a manner impossible if M had been printed by half-sheet
imposition and the full sheet cut apart to make two copies of the same
gathering.<ref target="f001.17.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> </p>


<p>As a practical demonstration, we may take the second edition of
Caryll's <hi rend="italic">Sir Salomon</hi>, which appeared in 1691 with the
collation 4<hi rend="super">0</hi>, A<hi rend="super">2</hi> B-I<hi rend="super">4</hi>
K<hi rend="super">2</hi>.
Here the skeleton of inner H
was used to impose the four type-pages of K<hi rend="super">2</hi>, and hence
one may
prove that K<hi rend="super">2</hi> was printed alone by half-sheet imposition.
In

<pb n="001.202"/>

this case the forme of H(i) was turned on the bench before
re-imposition (a fairly frequent occurrence of no significance), so
that the running-title of H4 appears on K1, that of H3<hi rend="super">v</hi> on
K1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and that of H2 on K2 (K2<hi rend="super">v</hi> has no
title). A more
conventional case is the anonymous <hi rend="italic">Knavery in All Trades</hi>
(1664), with the collation 4<hi rend="super">0</hi>,
<hi rend="italic">A</hi><hi rend="super">2</hi>
B-E<hi rend="super">4</hi> F<hi rend="super">2</hi>.
When
we find the running-title of E1<hi rend="super">v</hi> going to
F1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, E2 to F1,
E3<hi rend="super">v</hi> to F2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and E4 to F2, we can
demonstrate beyond the
shadow of a doubt that&mdash;as with <hi rend="italic">Sir
Salomon</hi>&mdash;the final
half-sheet was printed by itself and not imposed together with the
preliminary half-sheet to the book.</p>

<p>Why one method would be adopted instead of another is rather
puzzling. In books like the Sandys <hi rend="italic">Relation of a Journey</hi> and
the Behn <hi rend="italic">Forc'd Marriage</hi> where blanks were not utilized to
print a necessary single leaf, we may perhaps infer that in each
case there was a delay between the printing of the final text and
the composition of the preliminaries, so that the printer decided
to go ahead without waiting to determine whether the material could
be imposed together. This hypothesis will not hold with the second
edition of <hi rend="italic">Sir Salomon</hi>, printed twenty years after the
first. So far as I can see, there is no difference in efficiency in
presswork in printing A and M together or else separately by
half-sheet imposition (except possibly for more offset of wet ink
on the tympan cloth in the latter case), and my observation in the
later seventeenth-century quartos has been that, if anything, the
separate half-sheet imposition method was perhaps more common. For
this reason, bibliographers should, I think, make a running-title
analysis whenever conditions permit before assuming that two
half-sheets of text and preliminaries were in fact printed together
on one sheet and then cut apart.</p>
 <note id="f001.17.01" n="1" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>Even after a prolonged search, such printing
can remain only inferential, however, unless an aberrant copy
discloses the actual fact of imposition and printing. For instance,
in attempting to establish the true formula for the first gathering
of Sandys's 1632 folio <hi rend="italic">Ovid</hi>, I examined or had reported over

25 copies before a unique copy turned up containing the initial
blank leaf.</p></note>

 <note id="f001.17.02" n="2" place="foot"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">2</hi></seg><p>A complication would ensue if
A<hi rend="super">2</hi> and
M<hi rend="super">2</hi>
were imposed inner with inner, and then the same skeleton were used
to impose the outer formes of each half-sheet for perfecting. But
this could easily be detected and the fact demonstrated by the
appearance of the identical running-title of M1<hi rend="super">v</hi> on
M2<hi rend="super">v</hi> and
of M2 on M1, an impossibility if the four type-pages of M had been
imposed together in one forme. (The possibility is too remote to
consider that the running-titles originally removed from the
skeleton in the half used to print the inner forme of A would be
substituted for those already present for M in the skeleton of
inner (AM) when the outer forme was imposed for perfecting.)</p></note>
