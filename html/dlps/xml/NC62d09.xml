                <p> Camp Tyler, April 9, 1862 Charlie gives intensifying protestations of love to
                    Addie and says there has been snow and hail the last three days. He expresses

                    injury he aquired which Addie had inquired about in a prior letter. </p>

                </opener>

                <p> Perhaps I am placing myself <lb/> in a position liable to censure, in <orig
                        reg="applying">apply-<lb/> ing</orig> endearing terms to you - but when I
                    <lb/> say "My <hi rend="underline">precious</hi> Addie," I feel it from the
                    <lb/> depth of my heart. Used as I have always <lb/> been, to being repelled and
                        <hi rend="underline">scorned</hi> by those <lb/> who should have <hi
                        rend="underline">loved</hi>, to have the <lb/> assurance that there <hi
                        rend="underline">is</hi> one who <hi rend="underline">loves</hi> me, it
                    <lb/> is not at all strange that I should be <orig reg="somewhat">some-<lb/>
                        what</orig> <hi rend="underline">"outr&eacute;"</hi> in my
                    "addre&longs;ses". Had it been<lb/> otherwise with me, I might perhaps be a
                    little <lb/> more reserved in my expre&longs;sions, but I feel that<lb/>
                    <hi rend="underline">my</hi> Addie will pardon this seeming break of <lb/>
                    etiquette.<lb/>
                </p>

                    </figure>
                </p>-->

                <p> Now, after that long apology, you will expect <lb/> something <hi
                        rend="underline">comme il faut</hi>, as the French say. Whether<lb/> all I
                    write is as it should be, or not remains to be<lb/> seen. I am very sorry you
                    suffer so much <lb/> on my account. You are correct in supposing that<lb/> I
                    should not withhold any thing from you, nor <lb/> have I. Had I been seriously
                    injured, I <lb/> should have informed you. My arm was not <lb/> fractured, at
                    least <hi rend="underline">I</hi> do not think it was, and <lb/> it is very
                    nearly well as ever. It was caused<lb/> by a spent ball or a fragment of a shell
                    striking <lb/> my arm just above the elbow, and for the time<lb/> depriving me
                    of the use of it. <hi rend="underline">It might have<lb/> been worse</hi>. Do
                    not think that I would <lb/> conceal anything from you, my own, I am <lb/> not
                    schooled in the art of <hi rend="underline">deception</hi>. <lb/>
                </p>

                <p> Another thing which gives me great uneasine&longs;s<lb/> is, that you do not
                    receive all of my letters. I have <lb/> not allowed <hi rend="underline"
                    >more</hi> than a week to pass without <lb/> writing to you, and yet you did not
                    receive any <lb/> for <hi rend="underline">nearly three weeks</hi>! I know you
                    must <orig reg="anxiously">anx- <lb/>iously</orig> watch the mail. -Laura tells
                    me so- <lb/> It is really too bad.<lb/>
                </p>

                </p>-->

                <p> The weather is horrid - still <hi rend="underline">God </hi>sends it and <lb/>
                    "He doeth all things well." For the past two or three<lb/> days, it has snowed
                    and hailed ince&longs;santly. <lb/> But weather beaten as we are, we do not
                    mind <lb/> it. To be sure, we feel some <hi rend="underline">ennui</hi>, but if
                    we have<lb/> papers - which by the bye are rather scarce - we manage <lb/> to
                    while away the time. Do you see that great drop <lb/> of water there? How
                    provoking that it should come <lb/> right down upon my paper! I tried to prevent
                    it, but <lb/> could not. Excuse it, will you not my love? <lb/>
                </p>

                <p> You ask my advice about your teaching <lb/> school this coming summer, Why
                    Addie? I could<lb/> not have been more surprised, had you asked me <lb/> if you
                    could not eat your breakfast. Do you imagine<lb/> that I wish to control your
                    actions? I do not <hi rend="underline">love </hi><lb/> to <hi rend="underline"
                        >control</hi>. Far from it, dearest. You must do just as <lb/> you see fit,
                    just as though I had never seen you. <lb/> Teaching is a pleasant employment,
                    but it has its <lb/> pains, also; I taught three terms, and if my <orig
                        reg="experience">expe-<lb/> rience</orig> is like everyone's, or rather if
                    they are all like mine, <lb/> they found the bitter with the sweet.<lb/>
                </p>


                <p> Do not think that I wish to dissuade you from it.<lb/> Have you asked Hal's
                    advice, and your papa's? <lb/>
                    <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0540"/>

                    </figure>-->
                    Trust their advice sooner than me, for you know <lb/> they are older and more
                    experienced. <lb/>
                </p>


                <p> You must not allow your faith in the <lb/> great and good God to waver for a
                    moment, for you <lb/> know, "whom He loveth He <sic corr="chasteneth"
                    >chastenith</sic>." "He is ever <lb/> faithful, ever sure," if it is his will
                    that I should come home <lb/> soon, won't we be happy?<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> I believe Ed. Williams<ref target="n1" n="1">1</ref> was uninjured in the <lb/>
                    late battle. I am not personally acquainted with<lb/> him, but often hear Will
                    speak of him.<lb/>
                </p>

                <closer> But I must close as it is nearly night. <lb/> Tell your papa that he has my
                    kind regards, and <lb/> give my respects to all.<lb/><lb/> You and Laurie must
                    write often <lb/> and rest assured that I will write as often as possible.
                    <lb/><lb/> Did I mention in mine of the 6th that <lb/> I sent a picture of crop
                    lanes?<lb/><lb/> May Heavens ble&longs;sings be thine, dear Addie, <lb/> is
                    the prayer of your Charlie.<lb/>
