            Your card at hand.

            E.A. Marshall hails from Long
            Island, N. Y.  Don’t know town.  Came over
            at early part of war.  Speaking no French
            he was to be put in Legion but due to
            French parentage was allowed to serve in
            Active French regiment.  For 19 months he
            was in trenches of Bois le Pretre,
            Due to base ball arm was made a 
            bomber.  When information was once
            wanted Marshall volunteered to capture
            a Boche.  He sneaked out at night
            to German lines and returned leading
            Hun by the ear.  Was awarded Croix
            de Guerre.  Recently sent to Verdun.
            Negotiated a successful attack without injury
            save an eclat bruise and was again 
            cited for brilliant work.  As you
            know De Sillac informs me that the
            boy is slated for Aviation.  He’s a 
            good little writer.  You might make
            a deal with him some way.  Shall I
            ask him?  Hope he gets transferred.
            </p><p>
            Letter from Eyre says he
            has no news from Page.  Then
            
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            he adds “Do not hesitate to let me ^or Paul
            know all the news at the front.”  Don’t 
            you like the word hesitate?
            </p><p>
            I’m getting damned discouraged
            about my back.  Thank God the
            experiments are over.  Ought to
            be in soft here.  Wrote Polly Root,
            and her committee is forwarding bales 
            of stuff to this joint.  Can’t get em [sic]
            to make my bed up, tho, [sic] and I can’t
            do it cause of my back.  So I lie
            midst the bread crumbs.  Grate! [sic]
            </p><p>
            Am starting on the eclope
            speil [sic].  Any news from Haviland.. [?]
            </p><p>
            What do you mean when you say:
            “How did the slider come out?”
            </p><p>
            Wrote Yvonne that I lay awake at
            nights thinking about her and then after 
            that I was afraid to go to sleep.  I 
            wonder if she’ll catch on, and if
            so will stand for it?  Thought it
            time to play first cards.  (Have heard from her)[.]
            </p><p>
            Am freezing my balls off here.  All
            my clothes with escadrille &mdash; even coat.
            Have sent for it, tho. [sic]
