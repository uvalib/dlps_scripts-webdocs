                <p>WHEREAS, <name>Mr. Lovelace</name> has been a leader in a wide variety of

                <p>The Rector called for a motion to approve the Minutes of the meeting of January
                    31-February 1. The motion was offered and the Minutes were approved.</p>

                        over the last few months and announced that he will create a President’s
                        Commission on Diversity and Equity. The membership will include faculty,
                        students, representatives of the administration, alumni, parents and

                    <p>The commission will be charged with evaluating University programs that
                        address issues of diversity and equity; identifying gaps in programs and
                        suggesting remedies for filling those gaps; reviewing previous University
                        studies on diversity and equity and examining comparable programs elsewhere
                        for recommendations that should be implemented; and developing a “best

                        Board.</p>

                        Alumni Engagement Task Force, a proposal which was endorsed by the Board of
                        Managers. The Task Force will be asked to examine alumni relations programs
                        in detail, and to make broad recommendations concerning approach, programs,

                <p>The Rector noted that <name>Mr. C. Ray Smith</name> of the Darden School is
                    retiring from the faculty after 42 years. He asked the Provost to present a
                    resolution honoring <name>Mr. Smith</name> and marking the occasion. <name>Mr.
                        Block</name> read the following resolution which on motion was approved by
                    the Board:</p>



                <p>WHEREAS, <name>C. Ray Smith</name> was raised in Bassett, did his undergraduate
                    work at Bridgewater College, and matriculated in the Darden School in 1956;
                    and</p>

                <p>WHEREAS, <name>Mr. Smith</name> took his M.B.A. in 1958, a member of the second
                    Darden class, and returned in 1961 to join the faculty; and</p>


                <p>WHEREAS, <name>Mr. Smith</name> thus is the longest serving member of the Darden
                    faculty and has taught virtually every living alumnus of the School; and</p>


                <p>WHEREAS, <name>Mr. Smith</name> was elected a full professor in 1971 and Tipton
                    R. Snavely Professor of Business Administration in 1981; and</p>


                <p>WHEREAS, <name>Mr. Smith</name> continues to teach but also has held virtually
                    every significant administrative position at the Darden School, including
                    appointment as interim dean on three occasions; and</p>


                <p>WHEREAS, <name>Mr. Smith</name> is also Executive Director of the Darden School
                    Foundation; and</p>


                <p>WHEREAS, <name>Mr. Smith</name> intends to retire on the occasion of the 45th
                    reunion of his Darden class in the spring of 2003;</p>


                <p>RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors salutes <name>C. Ray Smith</name>, exemplary good
                    citizen of the University, thanks him for his years of devoted service, and
                    extends him every best wish in his retirement.</p>


                <ornament type="characters">- - - - - - - - - - -</ornament>
                <p>Mr. Robert Harris, Dean of the Darden School, thanked the Board and spoke to Mr.
                    Smith’s years of devoted service to the University. The President commented as
                    well.</p>

            <div1 id="d14" type="report">
                <pb n="6372"/>
                <head type="main">SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE</head>

                <p>The Rector asked the Vice Rector, <name>Mr. Farrell</name>, to report on the work
                    of the Special Committee on Governance, appointed after the last Board meeting
                    by <name>Mr. Ackerly</name>, who designated <name>Mr. Farrell</name> as
                    Chair.</p>

                <p><name>Mr. Farrell</name> said the Committee, whose members are Messrs.
                        <name>Crutchfield, Goodwin, Saunders and Vaughan</name>, has held several
                    meetings; other Members of the Board have participated in the Committee’s
                    deliberations. His report, he said, would be preliminary as the Committee has
                    not yet finished its work.</p>

                <p>The Committee suggests that Board committees as much as possible hold their
                    working meetings outside the context of Board of Visitors meetings. These
                    meetings could be held on Friday mornings, concurrently if necessary. The
                    regular Board meeting would begin after lunch on Friday and continue through
                    Saturday morning. Members and their spouses would still gather informally at
                    Carr’s Hill on Thursday evening, but otherwise the Board would not meet on
                    Thursday.</p>

                <p><name>Mr. Farrell</name> then commented on each of the Board’s standing
                    committees:</p>

                <p>Audit – the Audit Committee should become the Audit and Compliance Committee and
                    it should act more like a corporate audit committee. An important part of its
                    expanded functions should be oversight of the University’s compliance with NCAA
                    regulations.</p>

                <p>Buildings and Grounds – the current issue of the Board <hi rend="underline"
                        >Manual</hi> specifies instances of architectural decisions that can be made
                    by the Committee without reference to the full Board. The Special Committee,
                    however, agreed that there are instances where the whole Board should be
                    involved in these decisions; the preliminary conclusion was that the Rector and
                    the Chair of Buildings and Grounds would decide when projects should be referred
                    to the full Board.</p>

                <p>Educational Policy – the Special Committee agreed that the Educational Policy
                    Committee should be revitalized. The Committee suggested that the President, the
                    Rector, the Provost, and the Chair of Educational Policy – with perhaps
                    additional comments by Deans – meet to examine the charter of the Committee and
                    suggest how it might be restructured.</p>

                <pb n="6373"/>

                <p>External Affairs – the External Affairs Committee should be charged with the
                    planning and execution of the Capital Campaign. Relations between the Board and
                    the various foundations are at present partly overseen by the External Affairs
                    Committee and partly by the Finance Committee; these relationships must be
                    examined further.</p>

                <p>Finance and UVIMCO – there is concern about the potential lack of continuity of
                    Board of Visitors Members on the UVIMCO Board. This question needs further
                    study.</p>

                <p>Health Affairs – the Special Committee recommends that this committee be
                    abolished as its functions have been assumed by the Educational Policy Committee
                    and by the Medical Center Operating Board. The Chair of the Health Affairs
                    Committee, Dr. Vaughan, concurs in this recommendation.</p>

                <p>Student Affairs and Athletics – discussion in the Special Committee focused on
                    the proposal to separate these functions, create a new standing committee, and
                    assign student affairs to one and athletics to the other. After a great deal of
                    discussion, the Special Committee concluded that it did not have enough
                    information to make an intelligent recommendation. It is important that there be
                    an “in depth” look into the oversight of athletics.</p>

                <p>Committee on Wise and Executive Committee – the Special Committee saw no need to
                    recommend changes in the functions of these committees.</p>

                <p>Special Committee on Diversity – the Special Committee on Governance recommended
                    that the Rector appoint a Special Committee on Diversity to consider a number of
                    these issues and to determine the Board’s specific responsibility in
                    oversight.</p>

                <p>Mr. Farrell observed that the Special Committee would continue its work and that
                    perhaps some of the issues it has raised could be discussed at the Board Retreat
                    in July.</p>

                <p>The Rector concluded that two recommendations of the Special Committee called for
                    immediate action: the abolition of the Health Affairs Committee and the
                    creation, by him, of a Special Committee on Diversity. After discussion by the
                    Board and noted approvals from <name>Dr. Vaughan</name> – in absentia - , the
                    President and Mr. Sandridge, the Rector entertained a motion to abolish the
                    Health Affairs Committee. The motion was approved.</p>

                <p>WHEREAS, the academic responsibilities of the Health Affairs Committee have been

                <p>The Rector announced that on the recommendation of the Special Committee on

                    Committee on Diversity will report to the Board at the Board Retreat in July.
                    Initially, it is to consider:</p>

                <p>The scope of efforts to promote diversity among members of the student body,
                    faculty of all schools, staff and administrators;</p>

                <p>The scope of efforts to promote diversity in external relations of the
                    University, including with surrounding communities and all aspects of
                    procurement of goods and services;</p>

                <p>Efforts to promote understanding among all elements of the University community;

                <p>The appropriate role of the Board in continuing oversight of diversity

                <p>WHEREAS, the late <name>David A. Harrison, III</name>, of Prince George County,
                    an alumnus of the College and of the School of Law, made generous gifts and

                    support; and</p>

                <p>WHEREAS, the School of Medicine has designated $19.3 million of this for

                <p>WHEREAS, the Administration of the University has recommended that the
                    University’s existing enrollment plan, approved by the Board of Visitors in May
                    2001, can be revised to reflect projected increases in the undergraduate and
                    graduate enrollment levels; and</p>
                <lb/>

                <p>WHEREAS, there is no projected change in enrollment in the Continuing and
                    Professional Studies and first professional student populations between
                    2003-2004 and 2007- 2008; and</p>
                <lb/>

                <p>WHEREAS, the revised enrollment projections for 2003- 2004 through 2007-2008 were
                    submitted to the State Council of Higher Education in Virginia on <date
                        value="2003-03-14">March 14, 2003</date>;</p>
                <lb/>

                <p>RESOLVED that, compared with the 2001 plan, the undergraduate student population
                    increase by 70 in the extended period between 2007-2008; the graduate student
                    population increase by 290; the first-professional student population decrease
                    by 23 students; and the Continuing and Professional Studies student population
                    on the Grounds hold steady, resulting in a total student enrollment target of
                    approximately 337 more on-Grounds students than was approved in 2001. The total
                    enrollment target in 2007 will be 19,655 students, 1,745 more than in the
                    1989-1990 base year; and</p>
                <lb/>

                <p>RESOLVED FURTHER that all undergraduate growth maintain the current mix of
                    in-state and out-of-state students and the same quality of education currently
                    provided to undergraduate students.</p>

                    $5.0 MILLION</head>

                <p>WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors has assented to construct a new student center at
                    the University of Virginia’s College at Wise and to renovate and expand Clark
                    Hall; and</p>

                <p>WHEREAS, these two projects are substantially under construction; and</p>

                <p>WHEREAS, each will experience cash flow requirements for expenses incurred in
                    advance of receiving the proceeds from expected funding sources; and</p>

                <pb n="6384"/>

                <p>WHEREAS, controlling the cash flows by delaying further construction until
                    funding is received would result in significantly higher costs later and cause

                <p>On the recommendation of the Special Committee on Governance, I am hereby
                    creating a Special Committee on Diversity.</p>
                <p>In coordination with the President's Commission on Diversity, I am asking the
                    Special Committee generally to review diversity initiatives at the University.
                    More specifically, the Special Committee is charged with an evaluation of
                    efforts to promote diversity among students, faculty and administrators as well
                    as with residents of the City of Charlottesville and Albemarle County. The
                    Special Committee will meet with representatives of these groups, and others it
                    deems appropriate, and will report at the Board's planning retreat in July on at
                    least the following matters:</p>

                <list>

                    <item>The scope of efforts to promote diversity among members of the student
                        body, faculty of all schools, staff and administrators;</item>
                    <lb/>
                    <item>The scope of efforts to promote diversity in external relations of the
                        University, including with surrounding communities and all aspects of
                        procurement of goods and services;</item>
                    <lb/>
                    <item>Efforts to promote understanding among all elements of the University
                        community; and</item>
                    <lb/>
                    <item>The appropriate role of the Board in continuing oversight of diversity
                        issues.</item>
                    <lb/>
                </list>

                <pb n="2"/>
                <p>The Special Committee will be chaired by Warren Thompson and will consist of 5
                    members. The other members will be appointed later this month when Board
                    committee assignments are made.</p>
