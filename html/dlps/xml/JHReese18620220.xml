            <salute>Dear Mother.</salute>
        		</opener>
        		
        		<p>
            I received your letter<lb/>
            to-night and was very glad to hear from<lb/>
            you and to hear that you are getting better.<lb/>
            I am well and so are the rest of the Galway boys<lb/>
            The weather is still stormy and it has been terrible<lb/>
            muddy for the last two months and everything<lb/>
            begun to look gloomy enough.  Well you wanted<lb/>
            to know <del hand="author" rend="line-through">to know</del> who tented with me and who<lb/>
            I slept with.  Well Archie Anderson &mdash; the one that<lb/>
            went with me and a fellow by the name of Smith<lb/>
            and one by the name of Hammond tents with me<lb/>
            Smith and Hammond bunk,d next to us in<lb/>
            Albany and they wanted to tent with us and<lb/>
            as they <add place="top" hand="author">were</add> both good boys &lpar;that is morrally good&rpar;,<lb/>
            we took them in.  I and Archie sleeps together<lb/>
            he is a real fine fellow although not a christian<lb/>
            Well now I will tell you the reason why I have<lb/>
            not said more on religious subjects in my letters.<lb/>
            While we were in Albany we organized a christian<lb/>
            association which had every prospect of being the<lb/>
            means of doing a great deal of good in the Regt.
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002759_0014" n="[page 2]"/>
        			
            and I enjoyed religion as well there as I did at<lb/>
            home for we had divine service regular every<lb/>
            sabbath and we had the privilege of going to<lb/>
            the city to evening meetings and we hag <!--[had]--> prayer-<lb/>
            -meeting twice a week at the barracks, but since<lb/>
            we have been here at the seat of war we have<lb/>
            had a great many difficulties to encounter.  In<lb/>
            the first place we had a great deal to do to<lb/>
            get things in shape to live comfortably and our<lb/>
            religious meetings were in a measure neglected, and<lb/>
            in the next place the weather begun to get<lb/>
            cold and we had no place whatever to hold<lb/>
            meetings in but the chaplains tent and that<lb/>
            would not hold more than 5 or 6 men, and in<lb/>
            the next place our chaplain was not generally<lb/>
            liked by the Regt, and as we had to stand<lb/>
            out doors to hear him preach it soon got so<lb/>
            that scarcely any one went out to hear him<lb/>
            preach, more on account of not liking to stand<lb/>
            out in the cold than anything else, in fact<lb/>
            I have stood out there &lpar;for I always went out&rpar;<lb/>
            and really suffered with the cold.  Well the<lb/>
            chaplain finally got discouraged and nearly<lb/>
            all winter things were at a stand still and<lb/>
            being surrounded by temptations of every kind
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002759_0015" n="[page 3]"/>
        			
            I have at times wandered from the path of<lb/>
            duty, and at times everything looked gloomy<lb/>
            and I know that I have not lived at times as<lb/>
            I ought to have lived, but when I feel low <reg orig="spir=|ited">spirited</reg><lb/>
            I take my bible which I keep with me<lb/>
            and from it I can draw consolation and also in<lb/>
            secret prayer.  I feel that God has been very<lb/>
            mercifull to me and I am resolved to live closer<lb/>
            to Him henceforth than I have ever done before<lb/>
            for I find to be a christian and in the service<lb/>
            of God one hour is better than years in the<lb/>
            service of the devil, but I need your prayers.<lb/>
            Our old chaplain has resigned and we have<lb/>
            got another one and he is a very fine man<lb/>
            and is well liked by the Regt: and we<lb/>
            have got a comfortable place to hold meetings<lb/> 
            in and everything has got started again so that<lb/>
            things looks more prosperous, and I find that<lb/>
            I can enjoy religion much better by having an<lb/>
            opportunity of meeting with christian friends<lb/>
            once or twice a week where we can converse upon<lb/>
            subjects of religion and sing God,s praises and<lb/>
            to offer up our prayer's to Him who is ever ready<lb/>
            to hear and to answer.  We have 64 members in our
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000002759_0016" n="[page 4]"/>
        			
            christian association and it is going on finely.<lb/>
            Well now concerning what you spoke of in your<lb/>
            letter concerning me I of course shall not let it<lb/>
            trouble me for I dond [don't] beleive anything in it, but<lb/>
            still such a thing might be for I am as apt to<lb/>
            get killed as anybody, but if I should go into battle<lb/>
            according to accounts of all  battles there is not more<lb/>
            than one chance in 100 of getting killed, never-the-<lb/>
            -less I hope and trust I shall prepared to die if such<lb/>
            should be my lot.  But I must I must close by<lb/>
            bidding you good night, and in the morning I will<lb/>
            give you the news of the day on another sheet.
            </p>
