DIARY OF IRWIN C. FOX          #12086

     [Serving in the 9th &amp; 152nd Indiana Infantry Regiments in West Virginia and the 
Shenandoah Valley, as recorded in a manuscript diary, in 1861-62, 1865, Fox records his 
unit's movements from West Virginia, through various parts of the Shenandoah, and 
around Fredericksburg in early 1862.  Portions of the diary are missing and portions are 
out of chronological order.   Fox served in the 1861 campaigns around Cheat Mountain 
under future Union General Robert Milroy.  Ambrose Bierce was one of the most famous 
soldiers of the 9th Indiana.] -->

            <!--[On pages  7 &amp; 8, Fox describes a wild train ride as a car derails.   He writes," the 
                    boys finding it out commenced jumping off when the cars were in full motion there being 
                    a high bluff on one side and the river on the other".  On page 21-23, Fox reports on Lee's 
                    surrender and the assassination of Lincoln.  On the following pages, Fox discusses 
                    (through page 33) how the men react and on pages 29-30, he comments on the lack of 
                    food for the soldiers at the war's end.  On pages 38-42, Fox describes camp life for the 
                    soldiers.  Beginning on page 52 and for the following twelve pages, Fox describes life in 
                    camp at the end of the war when the men are waiting to be shipped home.  Beginning on 
                    page 74, Fox describes the deplorable conditions in camp in 1861 on Cheat Mountain 
                    when the men lacked adequate food and tents.   On pages 85-87, Fox describes a battle 
                    that the men of the 9th Indiana participated in though Fox was too ill to fight.   Again on 
                    page 106, Fox paints a vivid picture of camp life and of the terrible conditions that 
                    existed at times for the men in the mountains in 1861 when he writes, "some of our 
                    pickets froze to death last night..."   On page 140, Fox describes the men's elation upon 
                    hearing about the capture of Fort Donelson.]

                <p>[Irwin C. Fox does not often capitalize the first word in a sentence or use periods at 
                    the end.  To make reading the transcription easier, the transcriber has left three blank 
                    spaces where a period should occur.  If a word or words cannot be discerned, a hyphen is 
                    inserted for each missing word.  For example, [---] would indicate three missing words.  
                    If Fox has inserted a word or words above the line, the notation ^ is used with the 
                    inserted word or words following.   See commentary at the end of this transcription
