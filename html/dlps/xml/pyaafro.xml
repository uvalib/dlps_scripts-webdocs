      <head>CHALLENGING HERITAGE: African-American Documentary Resources in North Carolina</head>
      <p> North Carolina is rich in materials for the study of African- American history and life.
       Yet these important resources have never been adequately accessible. This guide is one step
       toward the correction of a glaring deficiency. Through it, for the first time, researchers
       can get a brief overview of the terrain of African-Americana holdings in the Tarheel State.
       Used together with a growing number of repository-level guides to African-Americana, this
       overview should make North Carolina's holdings of these important materials among the most
       accessible in the United States.</p>
      <p> The guide is a product of the ongoing work of the North Carolina African American Archives
       Group. Organized in the fall of <date value="1989">1989</date>, the Group has as its goals
       the promotion of the fuller documentation of the African-American experience in North
       Carolina; the support of the work of African-American collections, especially in historically
       black colleges and universities; the better preservation of, and enhanced access to,
       African-Americana holdings in the state, and promotion of the wider appreciation and use of
       the records of African Americans in North Carolina.</p>
      <p> Fueling these ambitions has been recognition of the fact that North Carolina is in growing
       danger of losing important resources for the study of African-American history and life. Few
       members of the state's black community want to commit their personal records to the larger
       repositories in the state--institutions with which they have had few connections and from
       which they have not always been able to expect adequate attention to African-American
       subjects. On the other hand, few traditionally black institutions have had the financial,
       human, and physical resources to organize, preserve, and provide public access to their
       institutional records and holdings of private papers. Moreover, despite the riches in the
       written record, much of the African-American experience has never been committed to paper: it
       needs to be captured through oral histories, the recording of religious services,
       photographs, and other, non-textual means. Yet another factor militating against adequate
       documentation of African-American history and life, as North Carolina African American
       Archives Group members early realized, is the preoccupation of most institutional
       African-Americana collectors with slavery, Reconstruction, or Civil Rights and personages
       important in these stories; other dimensions and leaders of the African-American community
       have received much less concerted attention.</p>
      <p> Despite this relative neglect, there are significant holdings in North Carolina
       repositories across the breadth of the African- American experience, as this guide makes
       clear. The guide is one outcome of a National Historical Publications and Records Commission
       grant, awarded in <date value="1992">1992</date>, to North Carolina Central University on
       behalf of the North Carolina African American Archives Group. Another NHPRC-supported
       project, sponsored by Wayne State University, helped add data on oral history holdings. A
       National Endowment for the Humanities award, also to Wayne State's African-American
       Educational Archives project and North Carolina Central University, is supporting in-depth
       surveys of the archival holdings of North Carolina's eleven historically black colleges and
       universities. As these data are compiled and these institutions feel ready, repository-level
       guides will appear to deepen the summary presentations of holdings in this statewide guide
       and to complement the collection-level guides to the African-American holdings of some of the
       larger and better-funded archival repositories in the state.</p>
      <p> North Carolina African American Archives Group members hope that wider knowledge of the
       more than 2,500 African-American collections and tens of thousands of volumes of printed
       works in the Tarheel State's more than forty-five repositories of these materials will lead
       private citizens, organizations, and businesses to deposit or donate their historical records
       in appropriate repositories. Members also hope that the Group's NHPRC-funded collection of
       data on the status of African-Americana holdings' organization, maintenance, and needs will
       inform future collaborative as well as individual institutional grant applications to
       leverage improvement of the documentation of the African-American experience and care of the
       African-American record in North Carolina. To this end, the Group is working with the North
       Carolina State Historical Records Advisory Board and the African-American Educational
       Archives Initiative.</p>
      <p> Funding for the publication of the printed version of this guide was provided by the
       Randleigh Foundation Trust to the Southern Historical Collection of the Academic Affairs
       Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The University Press of Virginia
       is publisher of the guide in its electronic form, so is making its Virginia and the North
       Carolina state guides to African-Americana research resources available together in a
       visionary effort to enhance scholarship on African American history and life. As individual
       institutional guides are made available, they will be seamlessly linked to this electronic
       version of the statewide guide for North Carolina, providing access to the remarkable wealth
       of North Carolina African-Americana holdings. In their electronic forms, the statewide and
       individual repository guides will be regularly updated with support from Southern Historical
       Collection staff. This support is only possible because of the encouragement of University
       Librarians James Govan and Joe Hewitt and Associate University Librarian for Special
       Collections Marcella Grendler of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>
      <p> Researchers owe gratitude not only to the funders, compilers, editor, and publishers of
       this guide, but also to the leadership of Benjamin Speller, Dean of the School of Library and
       Information Science of North Carolina Central University, director of the NHPRC-funded needs
       assessment and survey project, and to David Olson, North Carolina State Archivist and NHPRC
       project codirector. That these men were able to draw on the time and knowledge of dozens of
       people from the archival, historical, and civic leadership circles of the sate is testimony
       to the respect in which they are held and to the broadening commitment of North Carolinians
       to a critical part of their story. Alderman Library staff members Michael Plunkett, Curator
       of Special Collections, and David Seaman, Coordinator of the Electronic Text Center, both
       provided much needed technical support and encouragement.</p>

      <head>INTRODUCTION</head>

      <p>The Manuscripts Department of the Academic Affairs Library of the University of North
       Carolina at Chapel Hill has a long tradition for documenting the history and culture of the
       American South. Because African Americans have played an integral and leading role in forming
       that history, records relevant to African-American life and culture constitute a prominent
       portion of the department's holdings of nearly 14.5 million items.</p>

      <p>The majority of the collections documented in this guide are plantation records from the
       antebellum, Civil War, and Reconstruction period. Entries for these collections discuss
       topics such as slaves as plantation labor, and later, the hiring of freedmen. There are also
       several twentieth-century collections described that cover topics such as desegregation,
       bussing, race relations, and civil rights.</p>

      <p>The entries are arranged alphabetically by collection name. Listed after the collection
       name is the collection number and the date span of the entire collection. The entries
       describe only the portion of the collection pertaining to African Americans, with complete
       summary records for collections available through the library's online catalog. The full
       texts of selected unclib <lb/>inventories (i.e., folder and box lists) are present on the
       library's INTERNET server.</p>

      <p>This guide would not be possible without the hard work of a number of staff, both past and
       present. We are especially grateful to our compilers. The project was first started by Katrin
       Hardikar, an NC State University intern. The bulk of the work was done by Lauren Kerr, a
       UNC-CH graduate student. Enola Guthrie also assisted with the data entry.</p>

       from <dateRange from="1840" to="1849">1840s</dateRange> and exist in various formats. Most of
       the images from planter papers reflect African Americans in their roles as house servants,
       nannies, cooks, or field hands. One substantial collection is the Penn School photographs
       (see related entry), which show all aspects of African-American student life from the 1860s
       through the 1940s. The Penn School, located on the coast of South Carolina, was established
       to educate freed slaves. Another important group is the Subregional Photographic Study, part
       of the Howard Odum Papers (see related entry), which contains over 500 images. The study was
       conducted in 1939 in conjunction with the Farm Security Administration to document all
       aspects of life in several North Carolina counties. The study includes many images of African
       Americans as farmers and merchants as well as images of family and small town life. The
       Arthur Raper Papers (see related entry) contain a photographic study of Greene County,
       Georgia, dating from the early 1940s. The over 200 images depict African Americans as tenant
       farmers, school teachers, and students. Images of the elderly and number of rare photographs

      <head type="main">INTRODUCTION</head>

      <head type="sub">A Long and Continuing Tradition: African Americana in the North Carolina
       Collection</head>
      <p>
       <lb/>Robert G. Anthony Jr. </p>
      <p>On February 7, 1918, Charles Lee Smith, president of Edwards &amp; Broughton Printing
       Company in Raleigh wrote Mary L. Thornton that he was mailing three books she had recently
       requested for the North Carolina Collection. Among the titles Smith reported shipping was
        <bibl>The History Of The Negro Baptists Of North Carolina</bibl>, by J. A. Whitted,
       published by Smith's firm in 1908.</p>

      <p>Thornton's request for the Whitted book, which she made shortly after her appointment as
       first curator of the North Carolina Collection, illustrates the beginning of a long and
       continuing tradition of acquiring publications relating to the African American experience in
       North Carolina. Even before the Collection was formally organized as a separate department in
       1917, there was already in the library a small but significant nucleus of materials on
       African Americans in North Carolina. Over the years, the Collection's curators and staff have
       added greatly to those holdings. Today, a significant portion of the more than a quarter
       million printed items and half million photographic images in the Collection may be of
       interest to researchers studying the African American experience in the Tar Heel state.</p>

      <p>Religion and Church Histories</p>
      <p>Whitted's history of African-American Baptists is but one of many publications about the
       religious life of African Americans in North Carolina found in the Collection. There are, for
       example, a significant number of other denominational histories, such as Wm. Joseph Barber's
        <bibl>The Disciple Assemblies Of Eastern North Carolina</bibl> and Linda D. Addo and James
       H. McCallum's <bibl>To Be Faithful To Our Heritage: A History Of Black United Methodism In
        North Carolina</bibl>. Over the years, the Collection has also acquired histories of
       individual African-American churches (i.e. Grace African Methodist Episcopal Zion in
       Charlotte, Mount Olive Baptist in Lewiston, and Oberlin Baptist in Raleigh.).</p>

      <p>Researchers may also find useful the Collection's holdings of publications issued by
       religious bodies, such as minutes, journals, and programs for statewide, regional, or local
       conventions and meetings. For example, the Collection owns copies of the 1919 and 1923
       minutes of the Cape Fear Annual Conference of the A.M.E. Zion Church and the published
       proceedings for the 1921 annual session of the Woman's Home &amp; Foreign Missionary
       Convention of the Brunswick-Waccamaw Missionary Baptist Association.</p>

      <p>At times, various historically white churches have sponsored separate units to organize
       religious work among African Americans. The Collection holds publications from several such
       groups. From the Archdeaconry for Work among Colored People, Episcopal Diocese of North
       Carolina, for example, it has copies of the published minutes of the annual convocation for
       nine of the years between 1905 and 1927 inclusive. Unfortunately, the publications of such
       religious groups, whether issued by African-American churches or by historically white
       churches, were usually printed in limited quantity and not distributed widely. In many cases,
       the North Carolina Collection will have only a few issues&mdash;occasionally only
       one&mdash;from a particular group. But often this small run will be the sole surviving
       records for these organizations.</p>

      <p>Autobiographies and Biographies</p>
      <p>The personal stories of not only ministers and religious leaders, but also African-American
       teachers, business leaders, physicians, athletes, politicians, writers, and many more North
       Carolinians from additional professions can be found in the Collection's extensive holdings
       of autobiographies and biographies. Some are lengthy books, while others may be short
       pamphlets or unpublished theses and dissertations. In still other autobiographical and
       biographical publications, former slaves tell or have their life stories told. In the past
       few years, for example, the Collection has added autobiographies/ biographies of escaped
       slaves Harriet Jacobs and Moses Roper; contemporary minister/political leader Joy Johnson;
       Episcopal priest Pauli Murray; Wilmington physician Hubert Eaton; basketball star Michael
       Jordan; and writer Charles W. Chestnutt, to name but a very few.</p>

      <p>Creative Writing</p>
      <p>Creative writing by African-American North Carolinians such as Chestnutt has been collected
       assiduously. Published verse by George Moses Horton, slave poet of Chatham County and Chapel
       Hill, a special printing of "On the Pulse of Morning," the presidential inauguration poem by
       Winston-Salem resident and Wake Forest University professor Maya Angelou, and works by late
       nineteenth and early twentieth century poet James Ephraim McGirt represent the range of
       materials available. Writings by contemporary African-American novelists, poets, and
       dramatists who either are from or set their works in North Carolina, such as Gerald Barrax,
       Linda Beatrice Brown, Jaki Shelton Green, Randall Kenan, Lenard D. Moore, and Samm-Art
       Williams are also present.</p>

      <p>Several African-American writers, such as Charles Chestnutt and Maya Angelou, are the
       subjects of an increasing body of literary criticism of African-American belles-lettres. The
       Collection, of course, also offers numerous examples of fiction and poetry with
       African-American characters and/or other references to African Americans in the Tar Heel
       state but written by non-African-American authors.</p>

      <p>Newspapers</p>
      <p>Journalistic endeavors by Tar Heel African Americans is another area of writing well
       documented in the North Carolina Collection. In the latter years of the Reconstruction and
       early years of the Jim Crow periods, several newspapers appeared with African American
       communities as their primary intended audiences. Between 1877 and 1894, it is estimated that
       at least twenty African American newspapers were established in the state, although most
       lasted less than two years and offered only small press runs. From various sources, the North
       Carolina Collection has acquired microfilm copies of a number of these papers.</p>

      <p>More recent acquisitions have included sizable microform runs of several major
       long-established African-American papers, such as the <bibl>Star Of Zion</bibl>
       (Salisbury/Charlotte), <bibl>Carolinian</bibl> (Durham), and <bibl>Charlotte Post</bibl>.
       Although the Collection maintains subscriptions to paper copies of only a few current
       newspapers of any type, preferring to invest periodically in microforms of backfiles, it does
       receive and retain paper copies of several African-American community newspapers. These
       include <bibl>The Carolina Times</bibl> (Durham), <bibl>Carolina Peacemaker</bibl>
       (Greensboro), and <bibl>Winston-Salem Chronicle</bibl>. In addition, a complete run of
        <bibl>Black Ink</bibl>, the newspaper of the Black Student Movement at the University of
       North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is available.</p>

      <p>Arts and Crafts</p>
      <p>African-American artists too figure in the holdings of the North Carolina Collection.
       Exhibition catalogs featuring the works of painters, such as Romare Bearden, Minnie Evans,
       and Selma Burke, have been acquired. Several lists of active African American artists are
       also available for use in the Collection's Reading Room. Free African-American cabinetmaker
       Thomas Day of Caswell County has been the subject of one major exhibition and a number of
       articles, and the North Carolina Collection Gallery owns a sampler chest he crafted.
       Published materials on African American music and dance have also been collected, plus a
       limited number of audio-visual recordings.</p>

      <p>Education and Educational Institutions</p>
      <p>Researchers may be interested as well in the Collection's holdings of publications by or
       about various educational institutions associated with African Americans. Among these are
       catalogs, newsletters, and other publications from historically African-American schools and
       colleges. Some are from institutions that still operate. Others, however, document the
       activities of now defunct schools and colleges, such as Palmer Memorial Institute at Sedalia,
       Plymouth State Normal School, and the Orange County Training School at Chapel Hill. Although
       usually only a handful of issues of a publication may have been preserved, they nevertheless
       offer insight into the operations and nature of the institutions that produced them.</p>

      <p>In addition, there are among the Collection's holdings publications from several
       educational organizations, such as the <bibl>North Carolina Teachers Record</bibl>
       (1930-1970), the quarterly of the North Carolina Teachers Association. Statistical and
       sometimes narrative information on state and local government support of public schools and
       colleges for African Americans during the age of segregation can sometimes be found in
       separate publications or sections of general reports issued by state government agencies.</p>

      <p>Charitable and Social Institutions</p>
      <p>Materials from various charitable and social institutions important in the lives of African
       Americans in North Carolina can also be found in the Collection. For example, there are a
       number of reports and pamphlets from the Central (Colored) Orphanage of North Carolina at
       Oxford and the programs since 1952 of the annual Debutante Ball of the Alpha Kappa Alpha
       Sorority held in Raleigh. Yearbooks, programs, brochures, fliers, and other printed materials
       distributed by African-American clubs and social organizations from around the state have
       been acquired. Published histories of a variety of private and public institutions seeking to
       promote the public welfare, especially in the African-American community have also been
       collected. Recent acquisitions in this area include monographs such as <bibl>Through The
        Years</bibl>, 1867-1977: <bibl>Light Over Darkness: A History Of The North Carolina School
        For The Negro Blind And The Deaf</bibl>, by M. H. Crockett and Barbara Crockett Dease, and
        <bibl>Stanford L. Warren Branch Library: 77 Years Of Public Service: A Phoenix In The Durham
        Community</bibl>, by Beverly W. Jones.</p>

      <p>Local Histories and Genealogical Abstracts</p>
      <p>The Collection also acquires local histories of African American communities, a growing
       field of interest for historians, both professional and amateur. For example, the Collection
       recently obtained histories of the towns of James City and Navassa and the Greensboro
       communities of Mount Zion and Warnersville, plus a pictorial history of African-American life
       in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County. A number of local historians and genealogists are
       abstracting public records relating to African Americans, such as cohabitation bonds,
       marriage records for former slaves, and free African Americans in census returns. Other
       abstractors and compilers have focused on transcribing cemetery gravestones, and a
       genealogical society has published abstracts from the records of the North Carolina
       Freedman's Savings &amp; Trust Company. The North Carolina Collection seeks to acquire
       copies of such published abstracts and lists.</p>

      <p>Clippings Files</p>
      <p>The Collection's newspaper clippings files provide another valuable source for information
       on African Americans in North Carolina. Prior to 1975, hundreds of clippings from a number of
       different newspapers and on a variety of African American-related subjects were clipped,
       pasted on tagboard, and microfilmed. Then paper prints were produced from the microfilm and
       bound in four volumes labeled "Negroes in North Carolina." These are available for use in the
       Reading Room. Subject clippings dated after 1975 are currently being microfilmed, and copyflo
       prints of these articles should be available in the Reading Room soon. Biographical clippings
       have not been separated by race of individual featured, and those on African Americans will
       be found throughout the 264 bound volumes in the Reading Room, which cover through 1989.
       Clippings from more recent years have been pasted on tagboards and are available at the
       Reading Room reference counter.</p>

      <p>Photographs</p>
      <p>An extensive collection of approximately a half million photographs and photographic
       negatives also comprise a major resource for research in the North Carolina Collection.
       Countless images among these holdings depict African Americans or some aspect of
       African-American life in North Carolina. Individuals wishing to conduct pictorial research
       should make an appointment to meet with the Collection's photographic archivist, who can
       offer guidance in the use of these materials.</p>

      <p>Access to the Collection</p>
      <p>Researchers interested in the published materials found in the North Carolina Collection
       will want to begin by consulting with a member of the Reading Room staff and then by
       examining the card and online catalogs. Most recent acquisitions and some of the more
       significant older materials are now represented in the online catalog. But it is essential to
       remember that cataloging records for more than three-quarters of the Collection's holdings
       are available only in the paper card catalog.</p>

      <p>Publications may, of course, be identified by checking cataloging records in the card and
       online catalogs under specific titles or authors. Several topical subject headings, however,
       will also prove especially useful for researchers interested in materials on the
       African-American experience in North Carolina. For example, there are more than twenty-three
       inches of catalog cards with the subject tracings Afro-American&mdash;, Afro- Americans,
       North Carolina&mdash;Negro&mdash;, and North Carolina &mdash;Negroes.</p>

      <p>Most of these rather general tracings are divided further by more specific subheadings,
       such as Art, Artists, Baptists, Education, Fiction, Lawyers, Newspapers, Poetry, Social
       conditions, Songs and stories, Suffrage, and numerous others. Additional important subject
       headings include North Carolina&mdash;Slavery, North Carolina&mdash;Race problems,
       and North Carolina&mdash;Race relations. Also, publications that concentrate on African
       Americans in particular communities may be traced under the names of individual cities or
       counties, such as Greensboro (N.C.)&mdash;Race problems and Pitt County
       (N.C.)&mdash;Negroes. Reading Room staff are always willing to assist visitors in
       locating materials in the North Carolina Collection, and researchers are urged to make their
       needs known when they visit. Individuals studying African-American religion may, for example,
       wish to talk with the staff member who has recently inventoried the Collection's holdings of
       publications issued by several African-American denominations. Another staff member is active
       in a statewide African-American history and genealogy organization and may be able to offer
       timesaving guidance in locating useful materials.</p>

      <p>The acquisition of publications relating to the African American experience in North
       Carolina has been an important goal of the North Carolina Collection since its creation in
       1917. Today African Americana is among the most heavily used material in the Collection. In
       the years to come, the Collection will continue to identify and acquire materials appropriate
       for adding to these holdings. In the future, as the opportunity to publish becomes even more
       accessible&mdash;via desktop publishing, xerography, and other reproduction
       processes&mdash;the number of publications being produced will undoubtedly continue to
       increase. It can also be expected that the number of publications relating to African
       Americans in North Carolina will grow. Many of these will likely be issued by small printers
       or individuals, and it will be difficult for libraries to identify and acquire them.
       Researchers interested in the preservation of published African Americana relating to the Tar
       Heel state are urged to notify the North Carolina Collection of important local or limited
       quantity publications. This will help the Collection continue its long tradition of acquiring
       African Americana.</p>

      <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
      <p>The Special Collections Library at Duke University contains more than 200,000 printed
       volumes and upwards of 9,500,000 items in manuscript and archival collections. Among these
       holdings are a wealth of material concerning African-American history and culture. The
       library safeguards letters, lists, ledgers, photographs, films, and rare books documenting
       some three centuries of African-American experience. The collection is especially strong
       regarding nineteenth century slavery, and African-American life in the post-World War II
       civil rights era.</p>
      <p>Below is a representative, but in no way exhaustive, account of material related to
       African-American life available at Duke University's Special Collections Library. The account
       is arranged chronologically and is drawn, often verbatim, from several of the library's
       manuscript guides: Richard C. Davis and Linda Angle Miller's <bibl>Guide to the Cataloged
        Collections in the Manuscript Department of the William R. Perkins Library, Duke
       University</bibl> (1986) and Jennifer Morgan and Virginia Daley's <bibl>Retrieving
        African-American Women's History: A Methodological Guide to Sources in the Perkins Library
        Manuscript Department</bibl> (1989). Parties wishing a more detailed reckoning of
       African-American materials at Duke are strongly urged to use the Morgan and Daley guide as a
       starting point. Those desiring information about the Special Collections Library in general
       should request the library's brochure.</p>
      <p>The library is continually working to expand the scope and depth of its African-American
       holdings. Special Collections is especially interested in documentary materials concerning
       African-American life in the post-World War II civil rights era and items regarding
       African-American life in the Jim Crow South (the 1890s through the 1930s).</p>

       collection is probably most valuable for those papers related to Harris's career in Durham
       politics in the 1950s and early 1960s, especially concerning such matters as race relations
       and civil rights. Of particular interest is his infrequent correspondence with Carla Myerson
       Eugster, a political activist in the local civil rights movement who appears to have
       influenced Harris's decision to enter politics.</p>

      <head>SLAVERY PERIOD</head>
      <p>Over the past 30 years historians have coaxed sensitive and compelling histories of
       African-American slave life from materials authored by those other than slaves themselves.
       From plantation journals, estate accounts, diaries and slave lists, scholars have
       reconstructed black family life, religious culture, work patterns, and social structure. The
       collections listed below reflect the importance of non-slave sources in the writing of slave
       history.</p>
      <p>Special Collections holds much more material on African-American life during slavery than
       can be listed here, including a number of accounts generated by former slaves. The library's
       rare book holdings include more than 20 autobiographical works by former slaves from the
       eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; among them <bibl>The address of Abraham Johnstone</bibl>
        (<date value="1797">1797</date>), <bibl>Memoir of Old Elizabeth, a colored women</bibl>
        (<date value="1866">1866</date>), and <bibl>A narrative of the most remarkable particulars
        in the life of James Albert Ukawsaw, an African prince</bibl> (1770). Moreover, though not
       always noted below, letters from slaves manumitted to Liberia emerge in the collection at
       several points. They can be located using the subject file of the Special Collections card
       catalog. See, for example, the letter dated 2 August <date value="1857">1857</date> in the
       Malone Ellis papers. The library also holds an important collection of broadsides, pamphlets,
       circulars, and other printed materials that allow insight into African-American life during
       slavery. See, for example, <bibl>The Road and Patrol Laws of Georgia</bibl> (<date
        value="1863">1863</date>), <bibl>Religious Instruction of the Negro</bibl> (<date
        value="1861">1861</date>), and <bibl>An Account of the late intended insurrection among a
        portion of the blacks of this city</bibl> (Charleston <date value="1822">1822</date>).</p>

     <div3 id="duke2" type="introduction">
      <head>THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD</head>
      <p>Though not as vast as Special Collections material on black life during slavery, items at
       Duke concerning African-American life during Reconstruction are also too voluminous to list
       here. The material listed below touches on major themes from the period, suggesting the shape
       of the collection as a whole. Black mobility, African-American political activity, the
       transition to wage and contract labor, white violence and black response are a few of the
       areas represented in the collections. The Davis and Miller guide cites many other relevant
       materials.</p>
     </div3>

     <div3 id="duke3" type="introduction">
      <head>THE AGE OF JIM CROW</head>
      <p>The library contains a good mix of first- and third-person accounts of black life during
       the age of Jim Crow. Personal memoirs and correspondence, organizational records, and
       pertinent government material are each represented in the collection. Interviews are also
       prevalent. See, for example, the material on the Tulsa race riot of 1921 in the papers of the
       Duke University Oral History Program.</p>
      <p>Over the next few years, the library hopes for substantial growth in materials related to
       African-American life in the Jim Crow South. Special Collections has been selected as the
       primary repository for an extensive, South-wide collection of interviews concerning the
       period: "Behind the Veil: African-American Life in the Jim Crow South" (The project is being
       conducted by the Duke University Center for Documentary Studies and has been made possible by
       funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities). We hope to supplement this future
       deposit with as much personal correspondence, material culture, photographs, business data,
       educational material, and organizational records as is possible.</p>
      <p>As with material listed under other time periods, the collections listed are only
       representative. Interested parties will profit from consulting the aforementioned collection
       guides. The library's Rare Book Room, for example, contains a copy of <bibl>The Negro
        Directory of Raleigh, Franklinton, Durham, and Henderson</bibl> (1922?). Also, materials
       listed in this survey as "Post-World War II" are sometimes relevant to the Jim Crow era as
       well, most notably the Fannie B. Rosser Papers, the Clydie Fullwood Scarborough Papers, the
       Asa Timothy Spaulding Papers, and the Gordon Blaine Hancock papers.</p>
