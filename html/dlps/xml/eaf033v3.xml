<head>TO THE PUBLIC.</head>
<ornament type="ornament"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> flattering reception that has been <lb/>
given, by the public, to Arthur Mervyn, has prompted the <lb/>
writer to solicit a continuance of the same favor, and to <lb/>
offer to the world a new performance.</p>
<p>America has opened new views to the naturalist and <reg orig="poli-|tician">politician</reg>, <lb/>
but has seldom furnished themes to the moral painter. <lb/>
That new springs of action, and new motives to curiosity <lb/>
should operate; that the field of investigation, opened to <lb/>
us by our own country, should differ essentially from those <lb/>
which exist in Europe, may be readily conceived. The <lb/>
sources of amusement to the fancy and instruction to the <lb/>
heart, that are peculiar to ourselves, are equally numerous <lb/>
and inexhaustible. It is the purpose of this work to profit <lb/>
by some of these sources; to exhibit a series of adventures, <lb/>
growing out of the condition of our country, and connected <lb/>
with one of the most common and most wonderful diseases <lb/>
or affections of the human frame.</p>
<p>One merit the writer may at least claim; that of calling <lb/>
forth the passions and engaging the sympathy of the reader, <lb/>
<pb n="iv" entity="eaf033v3_0017" pid="uva-lib:349749"/>
by means hitherto unemployed by preceding authors. <reg orig="Pue-|rile">Puerile</reg> <lb/>
superstition and exploded manners; Gothic castles and <lb/>
chimeras, are the materials usually employed for this end. <lb/>
The incidents of Indian hostility, and the perils of the <lb/>
western wilderness, are far more suitable; and, for a native <lb/>
of America to overlook these, would admit of no apology. <lb/>
These, therefore, are, in part, the ingredients of this tale, <lb/>
and these he has been ambitious of depicting in vivid and <lb/>
faithful colors. The success of his efforts must be <reg orig="estima-|ted">estimated</reg> <lb/>
by the liberal and candid reader.</p>

<head type="sub">CHAPTER I.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I sit</hi> down, my friend, to comply with thy request. At <lb/>
length does the impetuosity of my fears, the transports of my <lb/>
wonder permit me to recollect my promise and perform it. <lb/>
At length am I somewhat delivered from suspense and from <lb/>
tremors. At length the drama is brought to an imperfect <lb/>
close, and the series of events, that absorbed my faculties, <lb/>
that hurried away my attention, has terminated in repose.</p>
<p>Till now, to hold a steadfast pen was impossible; to <lb/>
disengage my senses from the scene that was passing or <lb/>
approaching; to forbear to grasp at futurity; to suffer so <lb/>
much thought to wander from the purpose which engrossed <lb/>
my fears and my hopes, could not be.</p>
<p>Yet am I sure that even now my perturbations are <reg orig="suf-|ficiently">sufficiently</reg> <lb/>
stilled for an employment like this? That the <reg orig="inci-|dents">incidents</reg> <lb/>
I am going to relate can be recalled and arranged <lb/>
without indistinctness and confusion? That emotions will <lb/>
not be reawakened by my narrative, incompatible with order <lb/>
and coherence? Yet when I shall be better qualified for <lb/>
this task I know not. Time may take away these headlong <lb/>
energies, and give me back my ancient sobriety; but this <lb/>
change will only be effected by weakening my remembrance <lb/>
of these events. In proportion as I gain power over words, <lb/>
<pb n="6" entity="eaf033v3_0019" pid="uva-lib:349751"/>
shall I lose dominion over sentiments. In proportion as my <lb/>
tale is deliberate and slow, the incidents and motives which <lb/>
it is designed to exhibit will be imperfectly revived and <lb/>
obscurely portrayed.</p>
<p>O! why art thou away at a time like this. Wert thou <lb/>
present, the office to which my pen is so inadequate would <lb/>
easily be executed by my tongue. Accents can scarcely be <lb/>
too rapid, or that which words should fail to convey, my <lb/>
looks and gestures would suffice to communicate. But I <lb/>
know thy coming is impossible. To leave this spot is equally <lb/>
beyond my power. To keep thee in ignorance of what has <lb/>
happened would justly offend thee. There is no method of <lb/>
informing thee except by letter, and this method, must I, <lb/>
therefore, adopt.</p>
<p>How short is the period that has elapsed since thou and I <lb/>
parted, and yet how full of tumult and dismay has been my <lb/>
soul during that period! What light has burst upon my <lb/>
ignorance of myself and of mankind! How sudden and <lb/>
enormous the transition from uncertainty to knowledge!</p>
<p>But let me recall my thoughts; let me struggle for so <lb/>
much composure as will permit my pen to trace intelligible <lb/>
characters. Let me place in order the incidents that are to <lb/>
compose my tale. I need not call on thee to listen. The <lb/>
fate of Waldegrave was as fertile of torment to thee as to me. <lb/>
His bloody and mysterious catastrophe equally awakened thy <lb/>
grief, thy revenge, and thy curiosity. Thou wilt catch from <lb/>
my story every horror and every sympathy which it paints. <lb/>
Thou wilt shudder with my forboding and dissolve with my <lb/>
tears. As the sister of my friend, and as one who honors <lb/>
me with her affection, thou wilt share in all my tasks and all <lb/>
my dangers.</p>
<p>You need not be reminded with what reluctance I left you. <lb/>
To reach this place by evening was impossible, unless I had <lb/>
set out early in the morning, but your society was too <reg orig="pre-|cious">precious</reg> <lb/>
not to be enjoyed to the last moment. It was <reg orig="indis-|pensable">indispensable</reg> <lb/>
to be here on Tuesday, but my duty required no <lb/>
more than that I should arrive by sunrise on that day. To <lb/>
travel during the night, was productive of no formidable <lb/>
inconvenience. The air was likely to be frosty and sharp, <lb/>
but these would not incommode one who walked with <lb/>
speed. A nocturnal journey in districts so romantic and <lb/>
<pb n="7" entity="eaf033v3_0020" pid="uva-lib:349752"/>
wild as these, through which lay my road, was more <reg orig="con-|genial">congenial</reg> <lb/>
to my temper than a noonday ramble.</p>
<p>By nightfall I was within ten miles of my uncle's house. <lb/>
As the darkness increased, and I advanced on my way, my <lb/>
sensations sunk into melancholy. The scene and the time <lb/>
reminded me of the friend whom I had lost. I recalled his <lb/>
features, and accents, and gestures, and mused with <reg orig="unut-|terable">unutterable</reg> <lb/>
feelings on the circumstances of his death.</p>
<p>My recollections once more plunged me into anguish and <lb/>
perplexity. Once more I asked, who was his assassin? By <lb/>
what motives could he be impelled to a deed like this? <lb/>
Waldegrave was pure from all offence. His piety was <reg orig="rap-|turous">rapturous</reg>. <lb/>
His benevolence was a stranger to remissness or <lb/>
torpor. All who came within the sphere of his influence <lb/>
experienced and acknowledged his benign activity. His <lb/>
friends were few, because his habits were timid and reserved, <lb/>
but the existence of an enemy was impossible.</p>
<p>I recalled the incidents of our last interview, my <reg orig="importu-|nities">importunities</reg> <lb/>
that he should postpone his illomened journey till the <lb/>
morning, his inexplicable obstinacy; his resolution to set out <lb/>
on foot, during a dark and tempestuous night, and the <reg orig="horri-|ble">horrible</reg> <lb/>
disaster that befel him.</p>
<p>The first intimation I received of this misfortune, the <reg orig="insani-|ty">insanity</reg> <lb/>
of vengeance and grief into which I was hurried, my <lb/>
fruitless searches for the author of this guilt, my midnight <lb/>
wanderings and reveries beneath the shade of that fatal Elm, <lb/>
were revived and reacted. I heard the discharge of the <reg orig="pis-|tol">pistol</reg>, <lb/>
I witnessed the alarm of Inglefield, I heard his calls to his <lb/>
servants, and saw them issue forth with lights, and hasten to <lb/>
the spot whence the sound had seemed to proceed. I <lb/>
beheld my friend, stretched upon the earth, ghastly with a <lb/>
mortal wound, alone, with no traces of the slayer visible, no <lb/>
tokens by which his place of refuge might be sought, the <lb/>
motives of his enmity or his instruments of mischief might be <lb/>
detected.</p>
<p>I hung over the dying youth, whose insensibility forbade <lb/>
him to recognise his friend, or unfold the cause of his <reg orig="de-|struction">destruction</reg>. <lb/>
I accompanied his remains to the grave, I tended <lb/>
the sacred spot where he lay, I once more exercised my <lb/>
penetration and my zeal in pursuit of his assassin. Once <lb/>
<pb n="8" entity="eaf033v3_0021" pid="uva-lib:349753"/>
more my meditations and exertions were doomed to be <lb/>
disappointed.</p>
<p>I need not remind thee of what is past. Time and <lb/>
reason seemed to have dissolved the spell which made me <lb/>
deaf to the dictates of duty and discretion. Remembrances <lb/>
had ceased to agonize, to urge me to headlong acts, and <lb/>
foster sanguinary purposes. The gloom was half dispersed, <lb/>
and a radiance had succeeded sweeter than my former joys.</p>
<p>Now, by some unseen concurrence of reflections, my <lb/>
thoughts reverted into some degree of bitterness. Methought <lb/>
that to ascertain the hand who killed my friend, was not <lb/>
impossible, and to punish the crime was just. That to <reg orig="for-|bear">forbear</reg> <lb/>
inquiry or withhold punishment was to violate my duty <lb/>
to my God and to mankind. The impulse was gradually <lb/>
awakened that bade me once more to seek the Elm; once <lb/>
more to explore the ground; to scrutinize its trunk. What <lb/>
could I expect to find? Had it not been an hundred times <lb/>
examined? Had I not extended my search to the neighboring <lb/>
groves and precipices? Had I not pored upon the brooks, <lb/>
and pryed into the pits and hollows, that were adjacent to <lb/>
the scene of blood?</p>
<p>Lately I had viewed this conduct with shame and regret; <lb/>
but in the present state of my mind, it assumed the <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg> <lb/>
of conformity with prudence, and I felt myself <reg orig="irresisti-|bly">irresistibly</reg> <lb/>
prompted to repeat my search. Some time had elapsed <lb/>
since my departure from this district. Time enough for <lb/>
momentous changes to occur. Expedients that formerly <lb/>
were useless, might now lead instantaneously to the end <lb/>
which I sought. The tree which had formerly been <reg orig="shun-|ned">shunned</reg> <lb/>
by the criminal, might, in the absence of the avenger <lb/>
of blood, be incautiously approached. Thoughtless or <reg orig="fear-|less">fearless</reg> <lb/>
of my return, it was possible that he might, at this <lb/>
moment, be detected hovering near the scene of his offences.</p>
<p>Nothing can be pleaded in extenuation of this relapse into <lb/>
folly. My return, after an absence of some duration, into <lb/>
the scene of these transactions and sufferings, the time of <lb/>
night, the glimmering of the stars, the obscurity in which <lb/>
external objects were wrapped, and which, consequently, did <lb/>
not draw my attention from the images of fancy, may, in <lb/>

and which, during my visit to you, had been <reg orig="sus-|pended">suspended</reg>.</p>
<p>You know the situation of the Elm, in the midst of a <lb/>
private road, on the verge of Norwalk, near the habitation of <lb/>
Inglefield, but three miles from my uncle's house. It was <lb/>
now my intention to visit it. The road in which I was <reg orig="travel-|ling">travelling</reg>, <lb/>
led a different way. It was requisite to leave it, therefore, <lb/>
and make a circuit through meadows and over steeps. My <lb/>
journey would, by these means, be considerably prolonged, <lb/>
but on that head I was indifferent, or rather, considering how <lb/>
far the night had already advanced, it was desirable not to <lb/>
reach home till the dawn.</p>
<p>I proceeded in this new direction with speed. Time, <lb/>
however, was allowed for my impetuosities to subside, and <lb/>
for sober thoughts to take place. Still I persisted in this <lb/>
path. To linger a few moments in this shade; to ponder <lb/>
on objects connected with events so momentous to my <lb/>
happiness, promised me a mournful satisfaction. I was <lb/>
familiar with the way, though trackless and intricate, and I <lb/>
climbed the steeps, crept through the brambles, leapt the <lb/>
rivulets and fences with undeviating aim, till at length I <lb/>
reached the craggy and obscure path, which led to <reg orig="Ingle-|field's">Inglefield's</reg> <lb/>
house.</p>
<p>In a short time, I descried through the dusk the wide <lb/>
spread branches of the Elm. This tree, however faintly <lb/>
seen, cannot be mistaken for another. The remarkable <lb/>
bulk and shape of its trunk, its position in the midst of the <lb/>
way, its branches spreading into an ample circumference, <lb/>
made it conspicuous from afar. My pulse throbbed as I <lb/>
approached it.</p>
<p>My eyes were eagerly bent to discover the trunk and the <lb/>
area beneath the shade. These, as I approached, gradually <lb/>
became visible. The trunk was not the only thing which <lb/>
appeared in view. Somewhat else, which made itself <reg orig="dis-|tinguishable">distinguishable</reg> <lb/>
by its motions, was likewise noted. I faltered <lb/>
and stopped.</p>
<p>To a casual observer this appearance would have been <lb/>
unnoticed. To me, it could not but possess a <reg orig="power-|ful">powerful</reg> <lb/>
significance. All my surmises and suspicions, instantly <lb/>
returned. This apparition was human, it was connected <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="eaf033v3_0023" pid="uva-lib:349755"/>
with the fate of Waldegrave, it led to a disclosure of the <lb/>
author of that fate. What was I to do? To approach <reg orig="un-|warily">unwarily</reg> <lb/>
would alarm the person. Instant flight would set him <lb/>
beyond discovery and reach.</p>
<p>I walked softly to the roadside. The ground was <reg orig="cover-|ed">covered</reg> <lb/>
with rocky masses, scattered among shrub-oaks and <reg orig="dwarf-|cedars">dwarf-cedars</reg>, <lb/>
emblems of its sterile and uncultivated state. Among <lb/>
these it was possible to elude observation and yet approach <lb/>
near enough to gain an accurate view of this being.</p>
<p>At this time, the atmosphere was somewhat illuminated <lb/>
by the moon, which, though it had already set, was yet so <lb/>
near the horizon, as to benefit me by its light. The shape <lb/>
of a man, tall and robust, was now distinguished. <reg orig="Repeat-|ed">Repeated</reg> <lb/>
and closer scrutiny enabled me to perceive that he was <lb/>
employed in digging the earth. Something like flannel was <lb/>
wrapt round his waist and covered his lower limbs. The <lb/>
rest of his frame was naked. I did not recognise in him <lb/>
any one whom I knew.</p>
<p>A figure, robust and strange, and half naked, to be thus <lb/>
employed, at this hour and place, was calculated to rouse <lb/>
up my whole soul. His occupation was mysterious and <lb/>
obscure. Was it a grave that he was digging? Was his <lb/>
purpose to explore or to hide? Was it proper to watch <lb/>
him at a distance, unobserved and in silence, or to rush <lb/>
upon him and extort from him by violence or menaces, an <lb/>
explanation of the scene?</p>
<p>Before my resolution was formed, he ceased to dig. He <lb/>
cast aside his spade and sat down in the pit that he had dug. <lb/>
He seemed wrapt in meditation; but the pause was short, <lb/>
and succeeded by sobs, at first low, and at wide intervals, <lb/>
but presently louder and more vehement. Sorely charged <lb/>
was indeed that heart whence flowed these tokens of <reg orig="sor-|row">sorrow</reg>. <lb/>
Never did I witness a scene of such mighty anguish, <lb/>
such heart-bursting grief.</p>
<p>What should I think? I was suspended in astonishment. <lb/>
Every sentiment, at length, yielded to my sympathy. Every <lb/>
new accent of the mourner struck upon my heart with <reg orig="addi-|tional">additional</reg> <lb/>
force, and tears found their way spontaneously to my <lb/>
eyes. I left the spot where I sood, and advanced within <lb/>
the verge of the shade. My caution had forsaken me, and <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="eaf033v3_0024" pid="uva-lib:349756"/>
instead of one whom it was duty to persecute, I beheld, in <lb/>
this man, nothing but an object of compassion.</p>
<p>My pace was checked by his suddenly ceasing to lament. <lb/>
He snatched the spade, and rising on his feet, began to cover <lb/>
up the pit with the utmost diligence. He seemed aware <lb/>
of my presence, and desirous of hiding something from my <lb/>
inspection. I was prompted to advance nearer and hold his <lb/>
hand, but my uncertainty as to his character and views, the <lb/>
abruptness with which I had been ushered into this scene, <lb/>
made me still hesitate; but though I hesitated to advance, <lb/>
there was nothing to hinder me from calling.</p>
<p>What, ho! said I. Who is there? What are you doing?</p>
<p>He stopt, the spade fell from his hand, he looked up and <lb/>
bent forward his face towards the spot where I stood. An <lb/>
interview and explanation were now methought unavoidable. <lb/>
I mustered up my courage to confront and interrogate this <lb/>
being.</p>
<p>He continued for a minute in his gazing and listening <lb/>
attitude. Where I stood I could not fail of being seen, and <lb/>
yet he acted as if he saw nothing. Again he betook himself <lb/>
to his spade, and proceeded with new diligence to fill up the <lb/>
pit. This demeanor confounded and bewildered me. I <lb/>
had no power but to stand and silently gaze upon his motions.</p>
<p>The pit being filled, he once more sat upon the ground, <lb/>
and resigned himself to weeping and sighs with more <reg orig="vehe-|mence">vehemence</reg> <lb/>
than before. In a short time the fit seemed to <lb/>
have passed. He rose, seized the spade, and advanced to <lb/>
the spot where I stood.</p>
<p>Again I made preparation as for an interview which could <lb/>
not but take place. He passed me, however, without <reg orig="appear-|ing">appearing</reg> <lb/>
to notice my existence. He came so near as almost to <lb/>
brush my arm, yet turned not his head to either side. My <lb/>
nearer view of him, made his brawny arms and lofty stature <lb/>
more conspicuous; but his imperfect dress, the dimness of <lb/>
the light, and the confusion of my own thoughts, hindered <lb/>
me from discerning his features. He proceeded with a few <lb/>
quick steps, along the road, but presently darted to one side <lb/>
and disappeared among the rocks and bushes.</p>
<p>My eye followed him as long as he was visible, but my <lb/>
feet were rooted to the spot. My musing was rapid and <lb/>
incongruous. It could not fail to terminate in one <reg orig="conjec-|ture">conjecture</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="12" entity="eaf033v3_0025" pid="uva-lib:349757"/>
that this person was <hi rend="italic">asleep.</hi> Such instances were not <lb/>
unknown to me, through the medium of conversation and <lb/>
books. Never, indeed, had it fallen under my own <reg orig="observa-|tion">observation</reg> <lb/>
till now, and now it was conspicuous and environed <lb/>
with all that could give edge to suspicion, and vigor to <lb/>
inquiry. To stand here was no longer of use, and I turned <lb/>
my steps toward my uncle's habitation.</p>
<ornament type="line"/>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="II" id="d7">
<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I had</hi> food enough for the longest contemplation. My <lb/>
steps partook, as usual, of the vehemence of my thoughts, <lb/>
and I reached my uncle's gate before I believed myself to <lb/>
have lost sight of the Elm. I looked up and discovered <lb/>
the well known habitation. I could not endure that my <lb/>
reflections should so speedily be interrupted. I, therefore, <lb/>
passed the gate, and stopped not till I had reached a <reg orig="neigh-|boring">neighboring</reg> <lb/>
summit, crowned with chesnut-oaks and poplars.</p>
<p>Here I more deliberately reviewed the incidents that had <lb/>
just occurred. The inference was just, that the man, <reg orig="half-|clothed">halfclothed</reg> <lb/>
and digging, was a sleeper; but what was the cause <lb/>
of this morbid activity? What was the mournful vision <lb/>
that dissolved him in tears, and extorted from him tokens <lb/>
of inconsolable distress? What did he seek, or what <reg orig="en-|deavor">endeavor</reg> <lb/>
to conceal in this fatal spot? The incapacity of <lb/>
sound sleep denotes a mind sorely wounded. It is thus <lb/>
that atrocious criminals denote the possession of some <reg orig="dread-|ful">dreadful</reg> <lb/>
secret. The thoughts, which considerations of safety <lb/>
enable them to suppress or disguise during wakefulness <lb/>
operate without impediment, and exhibit their genuine <reg orig="ef-|fects">effects</reg>, <lb/>
when the notices of sense are partly excluded, and <lb/>
they are shut out from a knowledge of their entire <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg>.</p>
<p>This is the perpetrator of some nefarious deed. What <lb/>
but the murder of Waldegrave could direct his steps hither! <lb/>
His employment was part of some fantastic drama in which <lb/>
his mind was busy. To comprehend it, demands <reg orig="penetra-|tion">penetration</reg> <lb/>
into the recesses of his soul. But one thing is sure; <lb/>
an incoherent conception of his concern in that transaction, <lb/>
<pb n="13" entity="eaf033v3_0026" pid="uva-lib:349758"/>
bewitches him hither. This it is that deluges his heart with <lb/>
bitterness and supplies him with ever-flowing tears.</p>
<p>But whence comes he? He does not start from the <lb/>
bosom of the earth, or hide himself in airy distance. He <lb/>
must have a name and a terrestrial habitation. It cannot be <lb/>
at an immeasurable distance from the haunted Elm. <reg orig="Ingle-|field's">Inglefield's</reg> <lb/>
house is the nearest. This may be one of its <reg orig="inhabit-|ants">inhabitants</reg>. <lb/>
I did not recognise his features, but this was owing <lb/>
to the dusky atmosphere and to the singularity of his garb. <lb/>
Inglefield has two servants, one of whom was a native of <lb/>
this district, simple, guileless and incapable of any act of <lb/>
violence. He was, moreover devoutly attached to his sect. <lb/>
He could not be the criminal.</p>
<p>The other was a person of a very different cast. He was <lb/>
an emigrant from Ireland, and had been six months in the <lb/>
family of my friend. He was a pattern of sobriety and <lb/>
gentleness. His mind was superior to his situation. His <lb/>
natural endowments were strong, and had enjoyed all the <lb/>
advantage of cultivation. His demeanor was grave, and <lb/>
thoughtful, and compassionate. He appeared not untinctured <lb/>
with religion, but his devotion, though unostentatious, was of <lb/>
a melancholy tenor.</p>
<p>There was nothing in the first view of his character <reg orig="cal-|culated">calculated</reg> <lb/>
to engender suspicion. The neighborhood was <lb/>
populous. But as I conned over the catalogue, I perceived <lb/>
that the only foreigner among us was Clithero. Our scheme <lb/>
was, for the most part, a patriarchal one. Each farmer <lb/>
was surrounded by his sons and kinsmen. This was an <lb/>
exception to the rule. Clithero was a stranger, whose <lb/>
adventures and character, previously to his coming hither, <lb/>
were unknown to us. The Elm was surrounded by his <lb/>
master's domains. An actor there must be, and no one was <lb/>
equally questionable.</p>
<p>The more I revolved the pensive and reserved <reg orig="deport-|ment">deportment</reg> <lb/>
of this man, the ignorance in which we were placed <lb/>
respecting his former situation, his possible motives for <reg orig="aban-|doning">abandoning</reg> <lb/>
his country and choosing a station so much below <lb/>
the standard of his intellectual attainments, the stronger my <lb/>
suspicions became. Formerly, when occupied with <reg orig="con-|jectures">conjectures</reg> <lb/>
relative to the same topic, the image of this man <lb/>
did not fail to occur; but the seeming harmlessness of his <lb/>
<pb n="14" entity="eaf033v3_0027" pid="uva-lib:349759"/>
ordinary conduct, had raised him to a level with others, and <lb/>
placed him equally beyond the reach of suspicion. I did not, <lb/>
till now, advert to the recentness of his appearance among <lb/>
us, and to the obscurity that hung over his origin and past <lb/>
life. But now these considerations appeared so highly <lb/>
momentous, as almost to decide the question of his guilt.</p>
<p>But how were these doubts to be changed into absolute <lb/>
certainty. Henceforth this man was to become the subject <lb/>
of my scrutiny. I was to gain all the knowledge, respecting <lb/>
him, which those with whom he lived, and were the <reg orig="per-|petual">perpetual</reg> <lb/>
witnesses of his actions, could impart. For this end <lb/>
I was to make minute inquiries, and to put seasonable <reg orig="inter-|rogatories">interrogatories</reg>. <lb/>
From this conduct I promised myself an ultimate <lb/>
solution of my doubts.</p>
<p>I acquiesced in this view of things with considerable <reg orig="satis-|faction">satisfaction</reg>. <lb/>
It seemed as if the maze was no longer inscrutable. <lb/>
It would be quickly discovered who were the agents and <lb/>
instigators of the murder of my friend.</p>
<p>But it suddenly occurred to me, for what purpose shall <lb/>
I prosecute this search? What benefit am I to reap from <lb/>
this discovery? How shall I demean myself when the <lb/>
criminal is detected? I was not insensible, at that moment, <lb/>
of the impulses of vengeance, but they were transient. I <lb/>
detested the sanguinary resolutions that I had once formed. <lb/>
Yet I was fearful of the effects of my hasty rage, and <lb/>
dreaded an encounter, in consequence of which, I might <lb/>
rush into evils which no time could repair, nor penitence <lb/>
expiate.</p>
<p>But why, said I, should it be impossible to arm myself <lb/>
with firmness? If forbearance be the dictate of wisdom, <lb/>
cannot it be so deeply engraven on my mind as to defy all <lb/>
temptation, and be proof against the most abrupt surprise. <lb/>
My late experience has been of use to me. It has shewn <lb/>
me my weakness and my strength. Having found my <lb/>
ancient fortifications insufficient to withstand the enemy, <lb/>
what should I learn from thence but that it becomes me to <lb/>
strengthen and enlarge them.</p>
<p>No caution indeed can hinder the experiment from being <lb/>
hazardous. Is it wise to undertake experiments by which <lb/>
nothing can be gained, and much may be lost? Curiosity <lb/>
<pb n="15" entity="eaf033v3_0028" pid="uva-lib:349760"/>
is vicious, if undisciplined by reason, and inconducive to <lb/>
benefit.</p>
<p>I was not, however, to be diverted from my purpose. <lb/>
Curiosity, like virtue, is its own reward. Knowledge is of <lb/>
value for its own sake, and pleasure is annexed to the <reg orig="acqui-|sition">acquisition</reg>, <lb/>
without regard to any thing beyond. It is precious <lb/>
even when disconnected with moral inducements and <reg orig="heart-|felt">heartfelt</reg> <lb/>
sympathies, but the knowledge which I sought by its <lb/>
union with these was calculated to excite the most complex <lb/>
and fiery sentiment in my bosom.</p>
<p>Hours were employed in revolving these thoughts. At <lb/>
length I began to be sensible of fatigue, and returning home, <lb/>
explored the way to my chamber without molesting the <lb/>
repose of the family. You know that our doors are always <lb/>
unfastened, and are accessible at all hours of the night.</p>
<p>My slumbers were imperfect, and I rejoiced when the <lb/>
morning light permitted me to resume my meditations. The <lb/>
day glided away, I scarcely know how, and as I had rejoiced <lb/>
at the return of morning, I now hailed, with pleasure, the <lb/>
approach of night.</p>
<p>My uncle and sisters having retired, I betook myself, <lb/>
instead of following their example, to the <hi rend="italic">Chesnut-hill.</hi> <lb/>
Concealed among its rocks, or gazing at the prospect, <lb/>
which stretched so far and so wide around it, my fancy has <lb/>
always been accustomed to derive its highest enjoyment <lb/>
from this spot. I found myself again at leisure to recall the <lb/>
scene which I had witnessed during the last night, to imagine <lb/>
its connexion with the fate of Waldegrave, and to plan the <lb/>
means of discovering the secret that was hidden under these <lb/>
appearances.</p>
<p>Shortly, I began to feel insupportable disquiet at the <lb/>
thoughts of postponing this discovery. Wiles and stratagems <lb/>
were practicable, but they were tedious, and of dubious <lb/>
success. Why should I proceed like a plotter? Do I intend <lb/>
the injury of this person? A generous purpose will surely <lb/>
excuse me from descending to artifices? There are two <lb/>
modes of drawing forth the secrets of another, by open and <lb/>
direct means and by circuitous and indirect. Why scruple <lb/>
to adopt the former mode? Why not demand a conference, <lb/>
and state my doubts, and demand a solution of them, in a <lb/>
manner worthy of a beneficent purpose? Why not hasten <lb/>
<pb n="16" entity="eaf033v3_0029" pid="uva-lib:349761"/>
to the spot? He may be, at this moment, mysteriously <lb/>
occupied under this shade. I may note his behavior; I <lb/>
may ascertain his person, if not by the features that belong <lb/>
to him, yet by tracing his footsteps when he departs, and <lb/>
pursuing him to his retreats.</p>
<p>I embraced this scheme, which was thus suggested, with <lb/>
eagerness. I threw myself with headlong speed, down the <lb/>
hill and pursued my way to the Elm. As I approached the <lb/>
tree, my palpitations increased, though my pace slackened. <lb/>
I looked forward with an anxious glance. The trunk of the <lb/>
tree was hidden in the deepest shade. I advanced close up <lb/>
to it. No one was visible, but I was not discouraged. The <lb/>
hour of his coming was, perhaps, not arrived. I took my <lb/>
station at a small distance, beside a fence, on the right hand.</p>
<p>An hour elapsed before my eyes lighted on the object of <lb/>
which they were in search. My previous observation had <lb/>
been roving from one quarter to another. At last, it dwelt <lb/>
upon the tree. The person whom I before described was <lb/>
seated on the ground. I had not perceived him before, and <lb/>
the means by which he placed himself in this situation had <lb/>
escaped my notice. He seemed like one, whom an effort <lb/>
of will, without the exercise of locomotion, had transported <lb/>
hither, or made visible. His state of disarray, and the <reg orig="dark-|ness">darkness</reg> <lb/>
that shrouded him, prevented me, as before, from <lb/>
distinguishing any peculiarities in his figure or countenance.</p>
<p>I continued watchful and mute. The appearances already <lb/>
described took place, on this occasion, except the <reg orig="circum-|stance">circumstance</reg> <lb/>
of digging in the earth. He sat musing for a while, <lb/>
then burst into sighs and lamentations.</p>
<p>These being exhausted, he rose to depart. He stalked <lb/>
away with a solemn and deliberate pace. I resolved to tread, <lb/>
as closely as possible, in his footsteps, and not to lose sight <lb/>
of him till the termination of his career.</p>
<p>Contrary to my expectation, he went in a direction <lb/>
opposite to that which led to Inglefield's. Presently, be <lb/>
stopped at bars, which he cautiously removed, and, when <lb/>
he had passed through them, as deliberately replaced. He <lb/>
then proceeded along an obscure path, which led across <lb/>
stubble fields, to a wood. The path continued through the <lb/>
wood, but he quickly struck out of it, and made his way, <lb/>
<pb n="17" entity="eaf033v3_0030" pid="uva-lib:349762"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">3</fw></pb>
seemingly at random, through a most perplexing undergrowth <lb/>
of bushes and briars.</p>
<p>I was, at first, fearful that the noise, which I made behind <lb/>
him, in trampling down the thicket, would alarm him; but <lb/>
he regarded it not. The way that he had selected, was <lb/>
always difficult; sometimes considerable force was requisite <lb/>
to beat down obstacles; sometimes, it led into a deep glen, <lb/>
the sides of which were so steep as scarcely to afford a <reg orig="foot-|ing">footing</reg>; <lb/>
sometimes into fens, from which some exertions were <lb/>
necessary to extricate the feet, and sometimes, through <lb/>
rivulets, of which the water rose to the middle.</p>
<p>For some time I felt no abatement of my speed or my <lb/>
resolution. I thought I might proceed, without fear, through <lb/>
breaks and dells, which my guide was able to penetrate. <lb/>
He was perpetually changing his direction. I could form <lb/>
no just opinion as to my situation or distance from the place <lb/>
at which we had set out.</p>
<p>I began at length to be weary. A suspicion, likewise, <lb/>
suggested itself to my mind, whether my guide did not <reg orig="per-|ceive">perceive</reg> <lb/>
that he was followed, and thus prolonged his journey <lb/>
in order to fatigue or elude his pursuer. I was determined, <lb/>
however, to baffle his design. Though the air was frosty, <lb/>
my limbs were bedewed with sweat and my joints were <lb/>
relaxed with toil, but I was obstinately bent upon proceeding.</p>
<p>At length a new idea occurred to me. On finding me <lb/>
indefatigable in pursuit, this person might resort to more <reg orig="atro-|cious">atrocious</reg> <lb/>
methods of concealment. But what had I to fear? <lb/>
It was sufficient to be upon my guard. Man to man, I <lb/>
needed not to dread his encounter.</p>
<p>We, at last, arrived at the verge of a considerable <reg orig="pre-|cipice">precipice</reg>. <lb/>
He kept along the edge. From this height, a dreary <lb/>
vale was discoverable, embarrassed with the leafless stocks <lb/>
of bushes, and encumbered with rugged and pointed rocks. <lb/>
This scene reminded me of my situation. The desert tract <lb/>
called Norwalk, which I have often mentioned to you, my <lb/>
curiosity had formerly induced me to traverse in various <lb/>
directions. It was in the highest degree, rugged, picturesque, <lb/>
and wild. This vale, though I had never before viewed it <lb/>
by the glimpses of the moon, suggested the belief that I <lb/>
had visited it before. Such a one I knew belonged to this <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="eaf033v3_0031" pid="uva-lib:349763"/>
uncultivated region. If this opinion were true, we were <lb/>
at no inconsiderable distance from Inglefield's habitation. <lb/>
Where, said I, is this singular career to terminate?</p>
<p>Though occupied with these reflections, I did not slacken <lb/>
my pursuit. The stranger kept along the verge of the cliff, <lb/>
which gradually declined till it terminated in the valley. <lb/>
He then plunged into its deepest thickets. In a quarter of <lb/>
an hour he stopped under a projecture of the rock which <lb/>
formed the opposite side of the vale. He then proceeded <lb/>
to remove the stalks, which, as I immediately perceived, <lb/>
concealed the mouth of a cavern. He plunged into the <lb/>
darkness, and in a few moments, his steps were heard no <lb/>
more.</p>
<p>Hitherto my courage had supported me, but here it failed. <lb/>
Was this person an assassin, who was acquainted with the <lb/>
windings of the grotto, and who would take advantage of <lb/>
the dark, to execute his vengeance upon me, who had dared <lb/>
to pursue him to these forlorn retreats; or was he maniac, <lb/>
or walker in his sleep? Which ever supposition were true, <lb/>
it would be rash in me to follow him. Besides, he could <lb/>
not long remain in these darksome recesses, unless some <lb/>
fatal accident should overtake him.</p>
<p>I seated myself at the mouth of the cave, determined <lb/>
patiently to wait till he should think proper to emerge. <lb/>
This opportunity of rest was exceedingly acceptable after <lb/>
so toilsome a pilgrimage. My pulse began to beat more <lb/>
slowly, and the moisture that incommoded me ceased to <lb/>
flow. The coolness which, for a little time, was delicious, <lb/>
presently increased to shivering, and I found it necessary to <lb/>
change my posture, in order to preserve my blood from <lb/>
congealing.</p>
<p>After I had formed a path before the cavern's mouth, by <lb/>
the removal of obstructions, I employed myself in walking <lb/>
to and fro. In this situation I saw the moon gradually <lb/>
decline to the horizon, and, at length, disappear. I marked <lb/>
the deepenings of the shade, and the mutations which every <lb/>
object successively underwent. The vale was narrow, and <lb/>
hemmed in on all sides by lofty and precipitous cliffs. The <lb/>
gloom deepened as the moon declined, and the faintness of <lb/>
star light was all that preserved my senses from being useless <lb/>
to my own guidance.</p>
<pb n="19" entity="eaf033v3_0032" pid="uva-lib:349764"/>
<p>I drew nearer the cleft at which this mysterious personage <lb/>
had entered. I stretched my hands before it, determined <lb/>
that he should not emerge from his den without my <lb/>
notice. His steps would, necessarily, communicate the tidings <lb/>
of his approach. He could not move without a noise <lb/>
which would be echoed to, on all sides, by the abruptness <lb/>
by which this valley was surrounded. Here, then, I <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
till the day began to dawn, in momentary expectation <lb/>
of the stranger's reappearance.</p>
<p>My attention was at length excited by a sound that <reg orig="seem-|ed">seemed</reg> <lb/>
to issue from the cave. I imagined that the sleeper was <lb/>
returning, and prepared therefore to seize him. I blamed <lb/>
myself for neglecting the opportunities that had already been <lb/>
afforded, and was determined that another should not escape. <lb/>
My eyes were fixed upon the entrance. The rustling <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg>, <lb/>
and presently an animal leaped forth, of what <lb/>
kind I was unable to discover. Heart-struck by this <reg orig="disap-|pointment">disappointment</reg>, <lb/>
but not discouraged, I continued to watch, but in <lb/>
vain. The day was advancing apace. At length the sun <lb/>
arose, and its beams glistened on the edges of the cliffs <lb/>
above, whose sapless stalks and rugged masses were <reg orig="cover-|ed">covered</reg> <lb/>
with hoar frost. I began to despair of success, but was <lb/>
unwilling to depart, until it was no longer possible to hope <lb/>
for the return of this extraordinary personage. Whether <lb/>
he had been swallowed up by some of the abysses of this <lb/>
grotto, or lurked near the entrance, waiting my departure, <lb/>
or had made his exit at another and distant aperture, was <lb/>
unknown to me.</p>
<p>Exhausted and discouraged, I prepared, at length, to <lb/>
return. It was easy to find my way out of this <reg orig="wilder-|ness">wilderness</reg> <lb/>
by going forward in one direction, regardless of <reg orig="imped-|iments">impediments</reg> <lb/>
and cross-paths. My absence I believed to have <lb/>
occasioned no alarm to my family, since they knew not <lb/>
of my intention to spend the night abroad. Thus <reg orig="unsatis-|factorily">unsatisfactorily</reg> <lb/>
terminated this night's adventures.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> ensuing day was spent, partly in sleep, and partly in <lb/>
languor and disquietude. I incessantly ruminated on the <lb/>
incidents of the last night. The scheme that I had formed <lb/>
was defeated. Was it likely that this unknown person <lb/>
would repeat his midnight visits to the Elm? If he did, and <lb/>
could again be discovered, should I resolve to undertake a <lb/>
new pursuit, which might terminate abortively, or in some <lb/>
signal disaster? But what proof had I that the same route <lb/>
would be taken, and that he would again inter himself alive <lb/>
in the same spot? Or, if he did, since his reappearance <lb/>
would sufficiently prove that the cavern was not dangerous, <lb/>
and that he who should adventure in, might hope to come <lb/>
out again in safety, why not enter it after him? What could <lb/>
be the inducements of this person to betake himself to <reg orig="sub-|terranean">subterranean</reg> <lb/>
retreats? The basis of all this region is <hi rend="italic">limestone;</hi> <lb/>
a substance that eminently abounds in rifts and cavities. <lb/>
These, by the gradual decay of their cementing parts, <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg> <lb/>
make their appearance in spots where they might <lb/>
have been least expected. My attention has often been <reg orig="ex-|cited">excited</reg> <lb/>
by the hollow sound which was produced by my casual <lb/>
footsteps, and which shewed me that I trod upon the roof of <lb/>
caverns. A mountain-cave and the rumbling of an unseen <lb/>
torrent, are appendages of this scene, dear to my youthful <lb/>
imagination. Many of romantic structure were found <reg orig="with-|in">within</reg> <lb/>
the precincts of Norwalk.</p>
<p>These I had industriously sought out; but this had hitherto <lb/>
escaped my observation, and I formed the resolution of <lb/>
sometime exploring it. At present I determined to revisit <lb/>
the Elm, and dig in the spot where this person had been <lb/>
employed in a similar way. It might be that something was <lb/>
here deposited which might exhibit this transaction in a new <lb/>
light. At the suitable hour, on the ensuing night, I took my <lb/>
former stand. The person again appeared. My intention <lb/>
to dig was to be carried into effect on condition of his absence, <lb/>
and was, consequently, frustrated.</p>
<p>Instead of rushing on him, and breaking at once the spell <lb/>
by which his senses were bound, I concluded, contrary to <lb/>
my first design, to wait his departure, and allow myself to be <lb/>
<pb n="21" entity="eaf033v3_0034" pid="uva-lib:349766"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">3*</fw></pb>
conducted whithersoever he pleased. The track into which <lb/>
he now led me was different from the former one. It was a <lb/>
maze, oblique, circuitous, upward and downward, in a degree <lb/>
which only could take place in a region so remarkably <lb/>
irregular in surface, so abounding with hillocks and steeps, <lb/>
and pits and brooks as <hi rend="italic">Salsbury.</hi> It seemed to be the sole <lb/>
end of his labors to bewilder or fatigue his pursuer, to pierce <lb/>
into the deepest thickets, to plunge into the darkest cavities, <lb/>
to ascend the most difficult heights, and approach the <reg orig="slip-|pery">slippery</reg> <lb/>
and tremulous verge of the dizziest precipices.</p>
<p>I disdained to be outstripped in this career. All dangers <lb/>
were overlooked, and all difficulties defied. I plunged into <lb/>
obscurities, and clambered over obstacles, from which, in a <lb/>
different state of mind, and with a different object of pursuit, <lb/>
I should have recoiled with invincible timidity. When the <lb/>
scene had passed, I could not review the perils I had <reg orig="under-|gone">undergone</reg> <lb/>
without shuddering.</p>
<p>At length my conductor struck into a path which, <reg orig="com-|pared">compared</reg> <lb/>
with the ruggedness of that which we had lately <reg orig="trod-|den">trodden</reg>, <lb/>
was easy and smooth. This track led us to the skirt of <lb/>
the wilderness, and at no long time we reached an open field, <lb/>
when a dwelling appeared, at a small distance, which I <lb/>
speedily recognized to be that belonging to Inglefield. I <lb/>
now anticipated the fulfilment of my predictions. My <reg orig="con-|ductor">conductor</reg> <lb/>
directed his steps towards the barn, into which he <lb/>
entered by a small door.</p>
<p>How were my doubts removed! This was no other than <lb/>
Clithero Edny. There was nothing in his appearance <reg orig="in-|compatible">incompatible</reg> <lb/>
with this conclusion. He and his fellow servant <lb/>
occupied an apartment in the barn as a lodging room. This <lb/>
arduous purpose was accomplished, and I retired to the <lb/>
shelter of a neighboring shed, not so much to repose myself <lb/>
after the fatigues of my extraordinary journey, as to devise <lb/>
farther expedients.</p>
<p>Nothing now remained but to take Clithero to task; to <lb/>
repeat to him the observations of the two last nights; to <lb/>
unfold to him my conjectures and suspicions; to convince <lb/>
him of the rectitude of my intentions, and to extort from him <lb/>
a disclosure of all the circumstances connected with the <lb/>
death of Waldegrave, which it was in his power to <reg orig="commu-|nicate">communicate</reg>.</p>
<pb n="22" entity="eaf033v3_0035" pid="uva-lib:349767"/>
<p>In order to obtain a conference, I resolved to invite him to <lb/>
my uncle's, to perform a certain piece of work for me under <lb/>
my own eyes. He would, of course, spend the night with <lb/>
us, and in the evening I would take an opportunity of <reg orig="en-|tering">entering</reg> <lb/>
into conversation with him.</p>
<p>A period of the deepest deliberation was necessary to <lb/>
qualify myself for performing suitably my part in this <reg orig="pro-|jected">projected</reg> <lb/>
interview. I attended to the feelings that were <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg> <lb/>
in this new state of my knowledge. I found reason <lb/>
to confide in my newly acquired equanimity. Remorse, said <lb/>
I, is an ample and proper expiation for all offences. What <lb/>
does vengeance desire but to inflict misery? If misery <lb/>
come, its desires are accomplished. It is only the obdurate <lb/>
and exulting criminal that is worthy of our indignation. It is <lb/>
common for pity to succeed the bitterest suggestions of <reg orig="re-|sentment">resentment</reg>. <lb/>
If the vengeful mind be delighted with the <reg orig="spec-|tacle">spectacle</reg> <lb/>
of woes of its own contriving, at least its canine hunger <lb/>
is appeased, and thenceforth, its hands are inactive.</p>
<p>On the evening of the next day, I paid a visit to Inglefield. <lb/>
I wished to impart to him the discoveries that I had made, <lb/>
and to listen to his reflections on the subject. I likewise <reg orig="de-|sired">desired</reg> <lb/>
to obtain all possible information from the family <reg orig="re-|specting">respecting</reg> <lb/>
the conduct of Clithero.</p>
<p>My friend received me with his usual kindness. Thou <lb/>
art no stranger to his character; thou knowest with what <reg orig="pa-|ternal">paternal</reg> <lb/>
affection I have ever been regarded by this old man; <lb/>
with what solicitude the wanderings of my reason and my <lb/>
freaks of passion, have been noted and corrected by him. <lb/>
Thou knowest his activity to save the life of thy brother, <lb/>
and the hours that have been spent by him, in aiding my <lb/>
conjectures as to the cause of his death, and inculcating the <lb/>
lessons of penitence and duty.</p>
<p>The topics which could not but occur at such a meeting, <lb/>
were quickly discussed, and I hastily proceeded to that <lb/>
subject which was nearest my heart. I related the <reg orig="adven-|tures">adventures</reg> <lb/>
of the two preceding nights, and mentioned the <reg orig="infer-|ence">inference</reg> <lb/>
to which they irresistibly led.</p>
<p>He said that this inference coincided with suspicions he had <lb/>
formed, since our last interview, in consequence of certain <lb/>
communications from his housekeeper. It seems the <reg orig="charac-|ter">character</reg> <lb/>
of Clithero, had, from the first, exercised the inquisitiveness <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="eaf033v3_0036" pid="uva-lib:349768"/>
of this old lady. She had carefully marked his musing and <lb/>
melancholy deportment. She had tried innumerable <reg orig="expe-|dients">expedients</reg> <lb/>
for obtaining a knowledge of his past life, and <reg orig="particu-|larly">particularly</reg> <lb/>
of his motives for coming to America. These <reg orig="expedi-|ents">expedients</reg>, <lb/>
however profound and addressful, had failed. He <lb/>
took no pains to elude them. He contented himself with <lb/>
turning a deaf ear to all indirect allusions and hints, and, <lb/>
when more explicitly questioned, with simply declaring that <lb/>
he had nothing to communicate worthy of her notice.</p>
<p>During the day he was a sober and diligent workman. <lb/>
His evenings he spent in incommunicative silence. On <lb/>
Sundays, he always rambled away, no one knew whither, and <lb/>
without a companion. I have already observed that he and <lb/>
his fellow servant occupied the same apartment in the barn. <lb/>
This circumstance was not unattended to by Miss Inglefield. <lb/>
The name of Clithero's companion was Ambrose. This <lb/>
man was copiously interrogated by his mistress, and she <lb/>
found him by no means so refractory as the other.</p>
<p>Ambrose, in his tedious and confused way, related that <lb/>
soon after Clithero and he had become bed-fellows, the <reg orig="for-|mer">former</reg> <lb/>
was considerably disturbed by restlessness and talking <lb/>
in his sleep. His discourse was incoherent. It was <reg orig="gene-|rally">generally</reg> <lb/>
in the tone of expostulation, and appeared to be <reg orig="entreat-|ing">entreating</reg> <lb/>
to be saved from some great injury. Such phrases as <lb/>
these, "have pity;" "have mercy," were frequently <reg orig="inter-|mingled">intermingled</reg> <lb/>
with groans, and accompanied with weeping. <reg orig="Some-|times">Sometimes</reg> <lb/>
he seemed to be holding conferences with some one, <lb/>
who was making him considerable offers on condition of his <lb/>
performing some dangerous service. What he said in his <lb/>
own person, and in answer to his imaginary tempter, <reg orig="testifi-|ed">testified</reg> <lb/>
the utmost reluctance.</p>
<p>Ambrose had no curiosity on the subject. As this <reg orig="inter-|ruption">interruption</reg> <lb/>
prevented him at first from sleeping, it was his <reg orig="cus-|tom">custom</reg> <lb/>
to put an end to the dialogue, by awakening his <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg>, <lb/>
who betrayed tokens of great alarm and dejection, <lb/>
on discovering how he had been employed, he would <reg orig="solicit-|ously">solicitously</reg> <lb/>
inquire what were the words that he had uttered; but <lb/>
Ambrose's report was seldom satisfactory, because he had <lb/>
attended to them but little, and because he grudged every <lb/>
moment in which he was deprived of his accustomed <lb/>
repose.</p>
<pb n="24" entity="eaf033v3_0037" pid="uva-lib:349769"/>
<p>Whether Clithero had ceased from this practice, or habit <lb/>
had reconciled his companion to the sounds, they no longer <lb/>
occasioned any interruption to his slumber.</p>
<p>No one appeared more shocked than he at the death of <lb/>
Waldegrave. After this event his dejection suddenly <reg orig="in-|creased">increased</reg>. <lb/>
This symptom was observed by the family, but <lb/>
none but the housekeeper took the trouble to notice it to <lb/>
him, or build conjectures on the incident. During nights, <lb/>
however, Ambrose experienced a renewal of his ancient <reg orig="dis-|turbances">disturbances</reg>. <lb/>
He remarked that Clithero, one night, had <reg orig="dis-|appeared">disappeared</reg> <lb/>
from his side. Ambrose's range of reflection <lb/>
was extremely narrow. Quickly falling asleep, and finding <lb/>
his companion beside him when he awoke, he dismissed it <lb/>
from his mind.</p>
<p>On several ensuing nights he awakened in like manner, <lb/>
and always found his companion's place empty. The <reg orig="repe-|tition">repetition</reg> <lb/>
of so strange an incident at length incited him to <reg orig="men-|tion">mention</reg> <lb/>
it to Clithero. The latter was confounded at this <reg orig="intel-|ligence">intelligence</reg>. <lb/>
He questioned Ambrose with great anxiety as to <lb/>
the particulars of this event, but he could gain no <reg orig="satisfac-|tion">satisfaction</reg> <lb/>
from the stupid inattention of the other. From this <lb/>
time there was a visible augmentation of his sadness. His <lb/>
fits of taciturnity became more obstinate, and a deeper gloom <lb/>
sat upon his brow.</p>
<p>There was one other circumstance, of particular <reg orig="impor-|tance">importance</reg>, <lb/>
mentioned by the housekeeper. One evening some <lb/>
one on horseback, stopped at this gate. He rattled at the <lb/>
gate, with an air of authority, in token of his desire that <lb/>
some one would come from the house. Miss Inglefield was <lb/>
employed in the kitchen, from a window of which she <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg> <lb/>
who it was that made the signal. Clithero happened, <lb/>
at the same moment, to be employed near her. She, therefore, <lb/>
desired him to go and see whom the stranger wanted. He <lb/>
laid aside his work and went. The conference lasted above <lb/>
five minutes. The length of it excited in her a faint <reg orig="de-|gree">degree</reg> <lb/>
of surprise, inducing her to leave her employment, and <lb/>
pay an unintermitted attention to the scene. There was <lb/>
nothing, however, but its duration that rendered it <reg orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg>.</p>
<p>Clithero at length entered, and the traveller proceeded. <lb/>
The countenance of the former betrayed a degree of <reg orig="per-|turbation">perturbation</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="eaf033v3_0038" pid="uva-lib:349770"/>
which she had never witnessed before. The <lb/>
muscles of his face were distorted and tremulous. He <reg orig="im-|mediately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
sat down to his work, but he seemed, for some <lb/>
time, to have lost all power over his limbs. He struggled to <lb/>
avoid the sight of the lady, and his gestures, irresolute, or <lb/>
misdirected, betokened the deepest dismay. After some <lb/>
time, he recovered, in some degree, his self-possession; but <lb/>
while the object was viewed through a new medium, and the <lb/>
change existed only in the imagination of the observer, a <lb/>
change was certainly discovered.</p>
<p>These circumstances were related to me by Inglefield <lb/>
and corroborated by his housekeeper. One conseqence <lb/>
inevitably flowed from them. The sleep-walker, he who <lb/>
had led me through so devious a tract, was no other than <lb/>
Clithero. There was, likewise, a strong relation between this <lb/>
person and him who stopped at the gate. What was the <lb/>
subject of discourse between them? In answer to Miss <reg orig="Ingle-|field's">Inglefield's</reg> <lb/>
interrogatories, he merely said that the traveller inquired <lb/>
whither the road led, which at a small distance forward, <lb/>
struck out of the principal one. Considering the length of <lb/>
the interview it was not likely that this was the only topic.</p>
<p>My determination to confer with him in private acquired <lb/>
new force from these reflections. Inglefield assented to my <lb/>
proposal. His own affairs would permit the absence of his <lb/>
servant for one day. I saw no necessity for delay, and <reg orig="im-|mediately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
made my request to Clithero. I was fashioning <lb/>
an implement, I told him, with respect to which I could not <lb/>
wholly depend upon my own skill. I was acquainted with <lb/>
the dexterity of his contrivances, and the neatness of his <lb/>
workmanship. He readily consented to assist me on this <lb/>
occasion. Next day he came. Contrary to my <reg orig="expecta-|tion">expectation</reg>, <lb/>
he prepared to return home in the evening. I urged <lb/>
him to spend the night with us; but no; it was equally <lb/>
convenient, and more agreeable to him, to return.</p>
<p>I was not aware of this resolution. I might, indeed, have <lb/>
foreseen, that, being conscious of his infirmity, he would <lb/>
desire to avoid the scrutiny of strangers. I was painfully <lb/>
disconcerted, but it occurred to me, that the best that could <lb/>
be done, was to bear him company, and seize some <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg>, <lb/>
during this interval, of effecting my purpose. I told <lb/>
him, that since he would not remain, I cared not if, for the <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="eaf033v3_0039" pid="uva-lib:349771"/>
sake of recreation, and of a much more momentous <reg orig="pur-|pose">purpose</reg>, <lb/>
I went along with him. He tacitly, and without <lb/>
apparent reluctance, consented to my scheme, and <reg orig="accord-|ingly">accordingly</reg>, <lb/>
we set off together. This was an awful crisis. The <lb/>
time had now come, that was to dissipate my uncertainty. <lb/>
By what means should I introduce a topic so momentous <lb/>
and singular? I had been qualified by no experience for <lb/>
rightly conducting myself on so critical an emergency. My <lb/>
companion preserved a mournful and inviolable silence. He <lb/>
afforded me no opening, by which I might reach the point <lb/>
in view. His demeanor was sedate, while I was almost <lb/>
disabled, by the confusion of my thoughts, to utter a word.</p>
<p>It was a dreadful charge that I was about to insinuate. I <lb/>
was to accuse my companion of nothing less than murder. <lb/>
I was to call upon him for an avowal of his guilt. I was <lb/>
to state the grounds of my suspicions, and desire him to <lb/>
confute, or confirm them. In doing this, I was principally <lb/>
stimulated by an ungovernable curiosity; yet, if I intended <lb/>
not the conferring of a benefit, I did not, at least, purpose <lb/>
the infliction of evil. I persuaded myself, that I was able <lb/>
to exclude from my bosom, all sanguinary or vengeful <reg orig="im-|pulses">impulses</reg>; <lb/>
and that, whatever should be the issue of this <reg orig="con-|versation">conversation</reg>, <lb/>
my equanimity would be unsubdued.</p>
<p>I revolved various modes of introducing the topic, by <lb/>
which my mind was engaged. I passed rapidly from one <lb/>
to another. None of them were sufficiently free from <reg orig="ob-|jection">objection</reg>, <lb/>
to allow me to adopt it. My perplexity became, <lb/>
every moment, more painful, and my ability to extricate <lb/>
myself, less.</p>
<p>In this state of uncertainty, so much time elapsed, that <lb/>
the Elm at length appeared in sight. This object had <reg orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg> <lb/>
of a mechanical influence upon me. I stopped short, <lb/>
and seized the arm of my companion. Till this moment, <lb/>
he appeared to have been engrossed by his own reflections, <lb/>
and not to have heeded those emotions, which must have <lb/>
been sufficiently conspicuous in my looks.</p>
<p>This action recalled him from his reverie. The first idea <lb/>
that occurred to him, when he had noticed my behavior, <lb/>
was, that I was assailed by some sudden indisposition.</p>
<p>What is the matter, said he, in a tone of anxiety; are <lb/>
you not well?</p>
<pb n="27" entity="eaf033v3_0040" pid="uva-lib:349772"/>
<p>Yes, replied I, perfectly well; but stop a moment; I have <lb/>
something to say to you.</p>
<p>To me? Answered he, with surprise.</p>
<p>Yes, said I, let us turn down this path, pointing at the <lb/>
same time, to that along which I had followed him the <reg orig="pre-|ceding">preceding</reg> <lb/>
night.</p>
<p>He now partook, in some degree, of my embarrassment.</p>
<p>Is there any thing particular? said he, in a doubting accent. <lb/>
There he stopped.</p>
<p>Something, I answered, of the highest moment. Go <lb/>
with me down this path. We shall be in less danger of <lb/>
interruption.</p>
<p>He was irresolute and silent, but seeing me remove the <lb/>
bars and pass through them, he followed me. Nothing <lb/>
more was said till we entered the wood. I trusted to the <lb/>
suggestions of the moment. I had now gone too far to <reg orig="re-|cede">recede</reg>, <lb/>
and the necessity that pressed upon me, supplied me <lb/>
with words. I continued.</p>
<p>This is a remarkable spot. You may wonder why I have <lb/>
led you to it. I ought not to keep you in suspense. There <lb/>
is a tale connected with it, which I am desirous of telling <lb/>
you. For this purpose I have brought you hither. Listen <lb/>
to me.</p>
<p>I then recapitulated the adventures of the two preceding <lb/>
nights. I added nothing, nor retrenched any thing. He <lb/>
listened in the deepest silence. From every incident, he <lb/>
gathered new cause of alarm. Repeatedly he wiped his <lb/>
face with his handkerchief, and sighed deeply. I took no <lb/>
verbal notice of these symptoms. I deemed it incumbent <lb/>
on me to repress nothing. When I came to the concluding <lb/>
circumstance, by which his person was identified, he heard <lb/>
me, without any new surprise. To this narrative, I <reg orig="subjoin-|ed">subjoined</reg> <lb/>
the inquiries that I had made at Inglefield's, and the result <lb/>
of those inquiries. I then continued in these words.</p>
<p>You may ask why I subjected myself to all this trouble? <lb/>
The mysteriousness of these transactions would have <reg orig="natu-|rally">naturally</reg> <lb/>
suggested curiosity in any one. A transient passenger <lb/>
would probably have acted as I have done. But I had <lb/>
motives peculiar to myself. Need I remind you of a late <lb/>
disaster? That it happened beneath the shade of this tree? <lb/>
Am I not justified in drawing certain inferences from your <lb/>
<pb n="28" entity="eaf033v3_0041" pid="uva-lib:349773"/>
behavior? What they are, I leave you to judge. Be it your <lb/>
task, to confute, or confirm them. For this end I have <reg orig="con-|ducted">conducted</reg> <lb/>
you hither.</p>
<p>My suspicions are vehement. How can they be <reg orig="other-|wise">otherwise</reg>? <lb/>
I call upon you to say whether they be just.</p>
<p>The spot where we stood was illuminated by the moon, <lb/>
that had now risen, though all around was dark. Hence <lb/>
his features and person were easily distinguished. His hands <lb/>
hung at his side. His eyes were downcast, and he was <lb/>
motionless as a statue. My last words seemed scarcely to <lb/>
have made any impression on his sense. I had no need to <lb/>
provide against the possible suggestions of revenge. I felt <lb/>
nothing but the tenderness of compassion. I continued, for <lb/>
some time, to observe him in silence, and could discover no <lb/>
tokens of a change of mood. I could not forbear, at last, <lb/>
to express my uneasiness at the fixedness of his features and <lb/>
attitude.</p>
<p>Recollect yourself. I mean not to urge you too closely. <lb/>
This topic is solemn, but it need not divest you of the <reg orig="forti-|tude">fortitude</reg> <lb/>
becoming a man.</p>
<p>The sound of my voice startled him. He broke from <lb/>
me, looked up, and fixed his eyes upon me with an <reg orig="expres-|sion">expression</reg> <lb/>
of affright. He shuddered and recoiled as from a <lb/>
spectre. I began to repent of my experiment. I could say <lb/>
nothing suitable to this occasion. I was obliged to stand a <lb/>
silent and powerless spectator, and to suffer this paroxysm to <lb/>
subside of itself. When its violence appeared to be <reg orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg> <lb/>
abated, I resumed.</p>
<p>I can feel for you. I act not thus, in compliance with a <lb/>
temper that delights in the misery of others. The explanation <lb/>
that I have solicited is no less necessary for your sake than <lb/>
for mine. You are no stranger to the light in which I <reg orig="view-|ed">viewed</reg> <lb/>
this man. You have witnessed the grief which his fate <lb/>
occasioned, and the efforts that I made to discover, and <lb/>
drag to punishment his murderer. You heard the <reg orig="execra-|tions">execrations</reg> <lb/>
that I heaped upon him, and my vows of eternal <reg orig="re-|venge">revenge</reg>. <lb/>
You expect that, having detected the offender, I <lb/>
will hunt him to infamy and death. You are mistaken. I <lb/>
consider the deed as sufficiently expiated.</p>
<p>I am no stranger to your gnawing cares. To the deep <lb/>
and incurable despair that haunts you, to which your waking <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="eaf033v3_0042" pid="uva-lib:349774"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">4</fw></pb>
thoughts are a prey, and from which sleep cannot secure <lb/>
you. I know the enormity of your crime, but I know not <lb/>
your inducements. Whatever they were, I see the <reg orig="conse-|quences">consequences</reg> <lb/>
with regard to yourself. I see proofs of that <reg orig="re-|morse">remorse</reg> <lb/>
which must ever be attendant on guilt.</p>
<p>This is enough. Why should the effects of our misdeeds <lb/>
be inexhaustible? Why should we be debarred from a <lb/>
comforter? An opportunity of repairing our errors may, at <lb/>
least, be demanded from the rulers of our destiny.</p>
<p>I once imagined, that he who killed Waldegrave infficted <lb/>
the greatest possible injury on me. That was an error, <lb/>
which reflection has cured. Were futurity laid open to <lb/>
my view, and events, with their consequences, unfolded; I <lb/>
might see reason to embrace the assassin as my best friend. <lb/>
Be comforted.</p>
<p>He was still incapable of speaking; but tears came to his <lb/>
relief. Without attending to my remonstrances, he betrayed <lb/>
a disposition to return. I had, hitherto, hoped for some <lb/>
disclosure, but now feared that it was designed to be <reg orig="with-|held">withheld</reg>. <lb/>
He stopped not till we reached Inglefield's piazza. <lb/>
He then spoke, for the first time, but in a hollow and <reg orig="tremu-|lous">tremulous</reg> <lb/>
voice.</p>
<p>You demand of me a confession of crimes. You shall <lb/>
have it. Some time you shall have it. When it will be, I <lb/>
cannot tell. Something must be done, and shortly.</p>
<p>He hurried from me into the house, and after a pause, I <lb/>
turned my steps homewards. My reflections, as I proceeded, <lb/>
perpetually revolved round a single point. These were <lb/>
scarcely more than a repetition, with slight variations, of a <lb/>
single idea.</p>
<p>When I awoke in the morning, I hied, in fancy, to the <lb/>
wilderness. I saw nothing but the figure of the wanderer <lb/>
before me. I traced his footsteps anew, retold my <reg orig="narra-|tive">narrative</reg>, <lb/>
and pondered on his gestures and words. My <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg> <lb/>
was not destitute of enjoyment. My stormy passions <lb/>
had subsided into a calm, portentous and awful. My soul <lb/>
was big with expectation. I seemed as if I were on the eve of <lb/>
being ushered into a world, whose scenes were tremendous, <lb/>
but sublime. The suggestions of sorrow and malice had, <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="eaf033v3_0043" pid="uva-lib:349775"/>
for a time, taken their flight, and yielded place to a generous <lb/>
sympathy, which filled my eyes with tears, but had more in it <lb/>
of pleasure than of pain. That Clithero was instrumental to <lb/>
the death of Waldegrave, that he could furnish the clue, <reg orig="ex-|planatory">explanatory</reg> <lb/>
of every bloody and mysterious event, that had <lb/>
hitherto occurred, there was no longer the possibility of <lb/>
doubting. He, indeed, said I, is the murderer of excellence, <lb/>
and yet it shall be my province to emulate a father's <reg orig="cle-|mency">clemency</reg>, <lb/>
and restore this unhappy man to purity, and to peace.</p>
<p>Day after day passed, without hearing any thing of <reg orig="Cli-|thero">Clithero</reg>. <lb/>
I began to grow uneasy and impatient. I had gained <lb/>
so much, and by means so unexpected, that I could more <lb/>
easily endure uncertainty, with respect to what remained to <lb/>
be known. But my patience had its limits. I should, <lb/>
doubtless, have made use of new means to accelerate this <lb/>
discovery, had not his timely appearance made them <reg orig="super-|fluous">superfluous</reg>.</p>
<p>Sunday being at length arrived, I resolved to go to <reg orig="Ingle-|field's">Inglefield's</reg>, <lb/>
seek an interview with his servant, and urge him, by <lb/>
new importunities, to confide to me the secret. On my way <lb/>
thither, Clithero appeared in sight. His visage was pale <lb/>
and wan, and his form emaciated and shrunk. I was <reg orig="as-|tonished">astonished</reg> <lb/>
at the alteration, which the lapse of a week had <lb/>
made in his appearance. At a small distance I mistook him <lb/>
for a stranger. As soon as I perceived who it was, I greeted <lb/>
him with the utmost friendliness. My civilities made little <lb/>
impression on him, and he hastened to inform me, that he <lb/>
was coming to my uncle's, for the purpose of meeting and <lb/>
talking with me. If I thought proper, we would go into the <lb/>
wood together; and find some spot, where we might <reg orig="dis-|course">discourse</reg> <lb/>
at our leisure, and be exempt from interruption.</p>
<p>You will easily conceive with what alacrity I accepted <lb/>
his invitation. We turned from the road into the first path, <lb/>
and proceeded in silence, till the wildness of the surrounding <lb/>
scenery informed us, that we were in the heart of Norwalk. <lb/>
We lighted on a recess, to which my companion appeared to <lb/>
be familiar, and which had all the advantages of solitude, and <lb/>
was suitable to rest. Here we stopped. Hitherto my <reg orig="com-|panion">companion</reg> <lb/>
had displayed a certain degree of composure. Now <lb/>
his countenance betokened a violent internal struggle. It <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="eaf033v3_0044" pid="uva-lib:349776"/>
was a considerable time before he could command his speech. <lb/>
When he had so far effected the conquest of his feelings, he <lb/>
began.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">You</hi> call upon me for a confession of my offences. What <lb/>
a strange fortune is mine! That a human being, in the <lb/>
present circumstances, should make this demand, and that I <lb/>
should be driven, by an irresistible necessity to comply with <lb/>
it! That here should terminate my calamitous series! <lb/>
That my destiny should call upon me to lie down and die, <lb/>
in a region so remote from the scene of my crime; at a <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg>, <lb/>
so great, from all that witnessed and endured their <lb/>
consequences!</p>
<p>You believe me to be an assassin. You require me to <reg orig="ex-|plain">explain</reg> <lb/>
the motives that induced me to murder the innocent. <lb/>
While this is your belief, and this the scope of your <reg orig="expecta-|tions">expectations</reg>, <lb/>
you may be sure of my compliance. I could resist <lb/>
every demand but this.</p>
<p>For what purpose have I come hither? Is it to relate <lb/>
my story? Shall I calmly sit here, and rehearse the <reg orig="inci-|dents">incidents</reg> <lb/>
of my life? Will my strength be adequate to this <lb/>
rehearsal? Let me recollect the motives that governed me, <lb/>
when I formed this design. Perhaps, a strenuousness may <lb/>
be imparted by them, which, otherwise, I cannot hope to <lb/>
obtain. For the sake of those, I consent to conjure up the <lb/>
ghost of the past, and to begin a tale that, with a fortitude <lb/>
like mine, I am not sure that I shall live to finish.</p>
<p>You are unacquainted with the man before you. The <lb/>
inferences which you have drawn, with regard to my designs, <lb/>
and my conduct, are a tissue of destructive errors. You, <lb/>
like others, are blind to the most momentous consequences <lb/>
of your own actions. You talk of imparting consolation. <lb/>
You boast the beneficence of your intentions. You set yourself <lb/>
to do me a benefit. What are the effects of your misguided <lb/>
zeal, and random efforts? They have brought my life to a <lb/>
miserable close. They have shrouded the last scene of it <lb/>
in blood. They have put the seal to my perdition.</p>
<p>My misery has been greater than has fallen to the lot of <lb/>
<pb n="32" entity="eaf033v3_0045" pid="uva-lib:349777"/>
mortals. Yet it is but beginning. My present path, full as <lb/>
it is of asperities, is better than that into which I must enter, <lb/>
when this is abandoned. Perhaps, if my pilgrimage had been <lb/>
longer, I might, at some future day, have lighted upon hope. <lb/>
In consequence of your interference, I am forever debarred <lb/>
from it. My existence is henceforward to be invariable. <lb/>
The woes that are reserved for me, are incapable alike of <lb/>
alleviation or intermission.</p>
<p>But I came not hither to recriminate. I came not hither <lb/>
to accuse others, but myself. I know the retribution that is <lb/>
appointed for guilt like mine. It is just. I may shudder at <lb/>
the foresight of my punishment and shrink in the endurance <lb/>
of it; but I shall be indebted for part of my torment to the <lb/>
vigor of my understanding, which teaches me that my <reg orig="punish-|ment">punishment</reg> <lb/>
is just. Why should I procrastinate my doom and strive <lb/>
to render my burthen more light. It is but just that it should <lb/>
crush me. Its procrastination is impossible. The stroke is <lb/>
already felt. Even now I drink of the cup of retribution. <lb/>
A change of being cannot aggravate my wo. Till <reg orig="con-|sciousness">consciousness</reg> <lb/>
itself be extinct, the worm that gnaws me will <lb/>
never perish.</p>
<p>Fain would I be relieved from this task. Gladly would I <lb/>
bury in oblivion the transactions of my life; but no. My <lb/>
fate is uniform. The d&aelig;mon that controled me at first is <lb/>
still in the fruition of power. I am entangled in his fold, <lb/>
and every effort that I make to escape only involves me in <lb/>
deeper ruin. I need not conceal, for all the consequences <lb/>
of disclosure are already experienced. I cannot endure a <lb/>
groundless imputation, though to free me from it, I must <lb/>
create and justify imputations still more atrocious. My <lb/>
story may at least be brief. If the agonies of remembrance <lb/>
must be awakened afresh, let me do all that in me lies <lb/>
to shorten them.</p>
<p>I was born in the county of Armagh. My parents were <lb/>
of the better sort of peasants, and were able to provide me <lb/>
with the rudiments of knowledge. I should doubtless have <lb/>
trodden in their footsteps, and have spent my life in <lb/>
the cultivation of their scanty fields, if an event had not <lb/>
happened, which, for a long time, I regarded as the most <lb/>
fortunate of my life; but which I now regard as the <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="eaf033v3_0046" pid="uva-lib:349778"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">4*</fw></pb>
scheme of some infernal agent, and as the primary source of <lb/>
all my calamities.</p>
<p>My father's farm was a portion of the demesne of one <lb/>
who resided wholly in the metropolis, and consigned the <lb/>
management of his estates to his stewards and retainers. <lb/>
This person married a lady, who brought him great <reg orig="acces-|sion">accession</reg> <lb/>
of fortune. Her wealth was her only recommendation <lb/>
in the eyes of her husband, whose understanding was <lb/>
depraved by the prejudices of luxury and rank, but was the <lb/>
least of her attractions in the estimate of reasonable beings.</p>
<p>They passed some years together. If their union were <lb/>
not a source of misery to the lady, she was indebted for her <lb/>
tranquillity to the force of her mind. She was, indeed, <lb/>
governed, in every action of her life, by the precepts of duty, <lb/>
while her husband listened to no calls but those of <reg orig="perni-|cious">pernicious</reg> <lb/>
dissipation. He was immersed in all the vices that <lb/>
grow out of opulence and a mistaken education.</p>
<p>Happily for his wife his career was short. He was <reg orig="en-|raged">enraged</reg> <lb/>
at the infidelity of his mistress, to purchase whose <lb/>
attachment, he had lavished two thirds of his fortune. He <lb/>
called the paramour, by whom he had been supplanted, to <lb/>
the field. The contest was obstinate, and terminated in the <lb/>
death of the challenger.</p>
<p>This event freed the lady from many distressful and <lb/>
humiliating obligations. She determined to profit by her <lb/>
newly acquired independence, to live thenceforward <reg orig="con-|formable">conformable</reg> <lb/>
to her notions of right, to preserve and improve, <lb/>
by schemes of economy, the remains of her fortune, and to <lb/>
employ it in the diffusion of good. Her plans made it <reg orig="neces-|sary">necessary</reg> <lb/>
to visit her estates in the distant provinces.</p>
<p>During her abode in the manor of which my father was <lb/>
a vassal, she visited his cottage. I was at that time a child. <lb/>
She was pleased with my vivacity and promptitude, and <lb/>
determined to take me under her own protection. My <reg orig="pa-|rents">parents</reg> <lb/>
joyfully acceded to her proposal, and I returned with <lb/>
her to the capital.</p>
<p>She had an only son of my own age. Her design, in <lb/>
relation to me, was, that I should be educated with her child, <lb/>
and that an affection, in this way, might be excited in me <lb/>
towards my young master, which might render me, when <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="eaf033v3_0047" pid="uva-lib:349779"/>
we should attain to manhood, one of his most faithful and <lb/>
intelligent dependants. I enjoyed, equally with him, all the <lb/>
essential benefits of education. There were certain <reg orig="accom-|plishments">accomplishments</reg>, <lb/>
from which I was excluded, from the belief that <lb/>
they were unsuitable to my rank and station. I was <reg orig="per-|mitted">permitted</reg> <lb/>
to acquire others, which, had she been actuated by <lb/>
true discernment, she would, perhaps, have discovered to be <lb/>
far more incompatible with a servile station. In proportion <lb/>
as my views were refined and enlarged by history and <lb/>
science, I was likely to contract a thirst of independence, <lb/>
and an impatience of subjection and poverty.</p>
<p>When the period of childhood and youth was past, it was <lb/>
thought proper to send her son, to improve his knowledge <lb/>
and manners, by a residence on the continent. This young <lb/>
man was endowed with splendid abilities. His errors were <lb/>
the growth of his condition. All the expedients that <reg orig="ma-|ternal">maternal</reg> <lb/>
solicitude and wisdom could suggest, were employed <lb/>
to render him a useful citizen. Perhaps this wisdom was <lb/>
attested by the large share of excellence which he really <lb/>
possessed; and, that his character was not unblemished, <lb/>
proved only, that no exertions could preserve him from the <lb/>
vices that are inherent in wealth and rank, and which flow <lb/>
from the spectacle of universal depravity.</p>
<p>As to me, it would be folly to deny, that I had benefited <lb/>
by my opportunities of improvement. I fulfilled the <reg orig="expect-|ation">expectation</reg> <lb/>
of my mistress, in one respect. I was deeply imbued <lb/>
with affection for her son, and reverence for herself. <reg orig="Per-|haps">Perhaps</reg> <lb/>
the force of education was evinced in those particulars, <lb/>
without reflecting any credit on the directors of it. Those <lb/>
might merit the name of defects, which were regarded by <lb/>
them as accomplishments. My unfavorable qualities, like <lb/>
those of my master, were imputed to my condition, though, <lb/>
perhaps, the difference was advantageous to me, since the <lb/>
vices of servitude are less hateful than those of tyranny.</p>
<p>It was resolved that I should accompany my master in his <lb/>
travels, in quality of favorite domestic. My principles, <reg orig="what-|ever">whatever</reg> <lb/>
might be their rectitude, were harmonious and flexible. <lb/>
I had devoted my life to the service of my patron. I had <lb/>
formed conceptions of what was really conducive to his <lb/>
interest, and was not to be misled by specious <reg orig="appear-|ances">appearances</reg>. <lb/>
If my affection had not stimulated my diligence, I <lb/>
<pb n="35" entity="eaf033v3_0048" pid="uva-lib:349780"/>
should have found sufficient motives in the behavior of his <lb/>
mother. She condescended to express her reliance on my <lb/>
integrity and judgment. She was not ashamed to manifest, <lb/>
at parting, the tenderness of a mother, and to acknowledge <lb/>
that all her tears were not shed on her son's account. I <lb/>
had my part in the regrets that called them forth.</p>
<p>During our absence, I was my master's constant attendant. <lb/>
I corresponded with his mother, and made the conduct of <lb/>
her son the principal theme of my letters. I deemed it my <lb/>
privilege, as well as duty, to sit in judgment on his actions, <lb/>
to form my opinions without regard to selfish considerations, <lb/>
and to avow them whenever the avowal tended to benefit. <lb/>
Every letter which I wrote, particularly those in which his <lb/>
behavior was freely criticised, I allowed him to peruse. I <lb/>
would, on no account, connive at, or participate in the <reg orig="slight-|est">slightest</reg> <lb/>
irregularity. I knew the duty of my station, and <reg orig="as-|sumed">assumed</reg> <lb/>
no other control than that which resulted from the <lb/>
avoiding of deceit, and the open expression of my <reg orig="senti-|ments">sentiments</reg>. <lb/>
The youth was of a noble spirit, but his firmness <lb/>
was wavering. He yielded to temptations which a censor <lb/>
less rigorous than I, would have regarded as venial, or, <lb/>
perhaps, laudable. My duty required me to set before <lb/>
him the consequences of his actions, and to give impartial <lb/>
and timely information to his mother.</p>
<p>He could not brook a monitor. The more he needed <lb/>
reproof, the less supportable it became. My company <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
every day less agreeable, till at length, there appeared <lb/>
a necessity of parting. A separation took place, but not as <lb/>
enemies. I never lost his respect. In his representations <lb/>
to his mother, he was just to my character and services. <lb/>
My dismission was not allowed to injure my fortune, and his <lb/>
mother considered this event merely as a new proof of the <lb/>
inflexible consistency of my principles.</p>
<p>On this change in my situation, she proposed to me to <lb/>
become a member of her own family. No proposal could <lb/>
be more acceptable. I was fully acquainted with the <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg> <lb/>
of this lady, and had nothing to fear from injustice and <lb/>
caprice. I did not regard her with filial familiarity, but my <lb/>
attachment and reverence would have done honor to that <lb/>
relation. I performed for her the functions of a steward. <lb/>
Her estates in the city were put under my direction. She <lb/>
<pb n="36" entity="eaf033v3_0049" pid="uva-lib:349781"/>
placed boundless confidence in my discretion and integrity, <lb/>
and consigned to me the payment, and in some degree, the <lb/>
selection and government of her servants. My station was <lb/>
a servile one, yet most of the evils of servitude were <reg orig="un-|known">unknown</reg> <lb/>
to me. My personal ease and independence were <lb/>
less infringed than that of those who are accounted the <lb/>
freest members of society. I derived a sort of authority <lb/>
and dignity from the receipt and disbursement of money. <lb/>
The tenants and debtors of the lady were, in some respects, <lb/>
mine. It was, for the most part, on my justice and lenity <lb/>
that they depended for their treatment. My lady's <reg orig="house-|hold">household</reg> <lb/>
establishment was large and opulent. Her servants <lb/>
were my inferiors and menials. My leisure was <reg orig="consider-|able">considerable</reg>, <lb/>
and my emoluments large enough to supply me with <lb/>
every valuable instrument of improvement or pleasure.</p>
<p>These were reasons why I should be contented with my <lb/>
lot. These circumstances alone would have rendered it <lb/>
more eligible than any other, but it had additional, and <lb/>
far more powerful recommendations, arising from the <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg> <lb/>
of Mrs. Lorimer, and from the relation in which she <lb/>
allowed me to stand to her.</p>
<p>How shall I enter upon this theme? How shall I <reg orig="expa-|tiate">expatiate</reg> <lb/>
upon excellencies, which it was my fate to view in their <lb/>
genuine colors, to adore with an immeasurable and <reg orig="inextin-|guishable">inextinguishable</reg> <lb/>
ardor, and which, nevertheless, it was my hateful <lb/>
task to blast and destroy? Yet I will not be spared. I <lb/>
shall find in the rehearsal, new incitements to sorrow. I <lb/>
deserve to be supreme in misery, and will not be denied the <lb/>
full measure of a bitter retribution.</p>
<p>No one was better qualified to judge of her excellencies. <lb/>
A casual spectator might admire her beauty, and the dignity <lb/>
of her demeanor. From the contemplation of those, he <lb/>
might gather motives for loving or revering her. Age <lb/>
was far from having withered her complexion, or destroyed <lb/>
the evenness of her skin; but no time could rob her of the <lb/>
sweetness and intelligence which animated her features. Her <lb/>
habitual beneficence was bespoken in every look. Always <lb/>
in search of occasions for doing good, always meditating <lb/>
scenes of happiness, of which she was the author, or of <reg orig="dis-|tress">distress</reg>, <lb/>
for which she was preparing relief, the most torpid <lb/>
insensibility was, for a time, subdued, and the most depraved <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="eaf033v3_0050" pid="uva-lib:349782"/>
smitten by charms, of which, in another person, they would <lb/>
not perhaps have been sensible.</p>
<p>A casual visitant might enjoy her conversation, might <reg orig="ap-|plaud">applaud</reg> <lb/>
the rectitude of her sentiments, the richness of her <lb/>
elocution, and her skill in all the offices of politeness. But <lb/>
it was only for him, who dwelt constantly under the same <lb/>
roof, to mark the inviolable consistency of her actions and <lb/>
opinions, the ceaseless flow of her candor, her cheerfulness, <lb/>
and her benevolence. It was only for one who witnessed <lb/>
her behavior at all hours, in sickness and in health, her <lb/>
management of that great instrument of evil and good, <lb/>
money, her treatment of her son, her menials, and her <reg orig="kin-|dred">kindred</reg>, <lb/>
rightly to estimate her merits.</p>
<p>The intercourse between us was frequent, but of a <reg orig="pecu-|liar">peculiar</reg> <lb/>
kind. My office in her family required me often to see <lb/>
her, to submit schemes to her consideration, and receive her <lb/>
directions. At these times she treated me in a manner, <lb/>
in some degree, adapted to the difference of rank, and the <lb/>
inferiority of my station, and yet widely dissimilar from that, <lb/>
which a different person would have adopted, in the same <lb/>
circumstances. The treatment was not that of an equal and <lb/>
a friend, but still more remote was it from that of a mistress. <lb/>
It was merely characterized by affability and condescension, <lb/>
but as such it had no limits.</p>
<p>She made no scruple to ask my counsel in every <reg orig="pecuni-|ary">pecuniary</reg> <lb/>
affair, to listen to my arguments, and decide <reg orig="conform-|ably">conformably</reg> <lb/>
to what, after sufficient canvassings and discussions, <lb/>
should appear to be right. When the direct occasions of <lb/>
our interview were dismissed, I did not of course withdraw. <lb/>
To detain or dismiss me was indeed at her option, but, if no <lb/>
engagement interfered, she would enter into general <reg orig="conversa-|tion">conversation</reg>. <lb/>
There was none who could with more safety to herself <lb/>
have made the world her confessor; but the state of society in <lb/>
which she lived, imposed certain limitations on her candor. <lb/>
In her intercourse with me there were fewer restraints than <lb/>
on any other occasion. My situation had made me more <reg orig="in-|timately">intimately</reg> <lb/>
acquainted with domestic transactions, with her views <lb/>
respecting her son, and with the terms on which she thought <lb/>
proper to stand with those whom old acquaintance or <reg orig="kin-|dred">kindred</reg> <lb/>
gave some title to her good offices. In addition to all <lb/>
those motives to a candid treatment of me, there were others <lb/>
<pb n="38" entity="eaf033v3_0051" pid="uva-lib:349783"/>
which owed their efficacy to her maternal regard for me, <lb/>
and to the artless and unsuspecting generosity of her <reg orig="cha-|racter">character</reg>.</p>
<p>Her hours were distributed with the utmost regularity, <lb/>
and appropriated to the best purposes. She selected her <lb/>
society without regard to any qualities but probity and <lb/>
talents. Her associates were numerous, and her evening <lb/>
conversations embellished with all that could charm the <lb/>
senses or instruct the understanding. This was a chosen <lb/>
field for the display of her magnificence, but her grandeur <lb/>
was unostentatious, and her gravity unmingled with <reg orig="haughti-|ness">haughtiness</reg>. <lb/>
From these my station excluded me, but I was <reg orig="com-|pensated">compensated</reg> <lb/>
by the freedom of her communications in the <reg orig="inter-|vals">intervals</reg>. <lb/>
She found pleasure in detailing to me the incidents <lb/>
that passed on those occasions, in rehearsing conversations <lb/>
and depicting characters. There was an uncommon portion <lb/>
of dramatic merit in her recitals, besides valuable and curious <lb/>
information. One uniform effect was produced in me by this <lb/>
behaviour. Each day, I thought it impossible for my <reg orig="at-|tachment">attachment</reg> <lb/>
to receive any new accessions, yet the morrow was <lb/>
sure to produce some new emotion of respect or of gratitude, <lb/>
and to set the unrivalled accomplishments of this lady in a <lb/>
new and more favorable point of view. I contemplated no <lb/>
change in my condition. The necessity of change, whatever <lb/>
were the alternative, would have been a subject of <reg orig="pierc-|ing">piercing</reg> <lb/>
regret. I deemed my life a cheap sacrifice in her <lb/>
cause. No time would suffice to discharge the debt of <lb/>
gratitude that was due to her. Yet it was continually <reg orig="accu-|mulating">accumulating</reg>. <lb/>
If an anxious thought ever invaded my bosom, it <lb/>
arose from this source.</p>
<p>It was no difficult task faithfully to execute the functions <lb/>
assigned to me. No merit could accrue to me from this <lb/>
source. I was exposed to no temptation. I had passed the <lb/>
feverish period of youth. No contagious example had <reg orig="con-|taminated">contaminated</reg> <lb/>
my principles. I had resisted the allurements of <lb/>
sensuality and dissipation incident to my age. My dwelling <lb/>
was in pomp and splendor. I had amassed sufficient to <lb/>
secure me, in case of unforeseen accidents, in the <reg orig="enjoy-|ment">enjoyment</reg> <lb/>
of competence. My mental resources were not <reg orig="des-|picable">despicable</reg>, <lb/>
and the external means of intellectual gratification <lb/>
were boundless. I enjoyed an unsullied reputation. My <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="eaf033v3_0052" pid="uva-lib:349784"/>
character was well known in that sphere which my lady <lb/>
occupied, not only by means of her favorable report, but in <lb/>
numberless ways in which it was my fortune to perform <lb/>
personal services to others.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Mrs. Lorimer</hi> had a twin brother. Nature had <reg orig="im-|pressed">impressed</reg> <lb/>
the same image upon them, and had modelled them <lb/>
after the same pattern. The resemblance between them <lb/>
was exact to a degree almost incredible. In infancy and <lb/>
childhood they were perpetually liable to be mistaken for <lb/>
each other. As they grew up, nothing, to a superficial <lb/>
examination, appeared to distinguish them, but the sexual <lb/>
characteristics. A sagacious observer would, doubtless, <lb/>
have noted the most essential differences. In all those <reg orig="mo-|difications">modifications</reg> <lb/>
of the features which are produced by habits and <lb/>
sentiments, no two persons were less alike. Nature seemed <lb/>
to have intended them as examples of the futility of those <lb/>
theories, which ascribe every thing to conformation and <lb/>
instinct, and nothing to external circumstances; in what <lb/>
different modes the same materials may be fashioned, and to <lb/>
what different purposes the same materials may be applied. <lb/>
Perhaps the rudiments of their intellectual character as well <lb/>
as of their form, were the same; but the powers, that in one <lb/>
case were exerted in the cause of virtue, were, in the other, <lb/>
misapplied to sordid and flagitious purposes.</p>
<p>Arthur Wiatte, that was his name, had ever been the <lb/>
object of his sister's affection. As long as he existed she <lb/>
never ceased to labor in the promotion of his happiness. <lb/>
All her kindness was repaid by a stern and inexorable <lb/>
hatred. This man was an exception to all the rules which <lb/>
govern us in our judgments of human nature. He <reg orig="ex-|ceeded">exceeded</reg> <lb/>
in depravity all that has been imputed to the arch <lb/>
foe of mankind. His wickedness was without any of those <lb/>
remorseful intermissions from which it has been supposed <lb/>
that the deepest guilt is not entirely exempt. He seemed <lb/>
to relish no food but pure unadulterated evil. He rejoiced <lb/>
in proportion to the depth of that distress of which he was <lb/>
the author.</p>
<pb n="40" entity="eaf033v3_0053" pid="uva-lib:349785"/>
<p>His sister, by being placed most within the reach of his <lb/>
enmity, experienced its worst effects. She was the subject <lb/>
on which, by being acquainted with the means of <reg orig="influenc-|ing">influencing</reg> <lb/>
her happiness, he could try his malignant experiments <lb/>
with most hope of success. Her parents being high in rank <lb/>
and wealth, the marriage of their daughter was, of course, <lb/>
an object of anxious attention. There is no event on which <lb/>
our felicity and usefulness more materially depends, and <lb/>
with regard to which, therefore, the freedom of choice and <lb/>
the exercise of our own understanding ought to be less <lb/>
infringed, but this maxim is commonly disregarded in <reg orig="pro-|portion">proportion</reg> <lb/>
to the elevation of our rank and extent of our <lb/>
property.</p>
<p>The lady made her own election, but she was one of <lb/>
those who acted on a comprehensive plan, and would not <lb/>
admit her private inclination to dictate her decision. The <lb/>
happiness of others, though founded on mistaken views, she <lb/>
did not consider as unworthy of her regard. The choice <lb/>
was such as was not likely to obtain the parental sanction, to <lb/>
whom the moral qualities of their son in law, though not <lb/>
absolutely weightless in the balance, were greatly inferior to <lb/>
the considerations of wealth and dignity.</p>
<p>The brother set no value on any thing but the means of <lb/>
luxury and power. He was astonished at that perverseness <lb/>
which entertained a different conception of happiness from <lb/>
himself. Love and friendship he considered as groundless <lb/>
and chimerical, and believed that those delusions, would, in <lb/>
people of sense, be rectified by experience; but he knew <lb/>
the obstinacy of his sister's attachment to these phantoms, <lb/>
and that to bereave her of the good they promised, was the <lb/>
most effectual means of rendering her miserable. For this <lb/>
end he set himself to thwart her wishes. In the imbecility <lb/>
and false indulgence of his parents he found his most <reg orig="pow-|erful">powerful</reg> <lb/>
auxiliaries. He prevailed upon them to forbid that <lb/>
union, which wanted nothing but their concurrence, and their <lb/>
consent to endow her with a small portion of their <reg orig="patri-|mony">patrimony</reg> <lb/>
to render completely eligible. The cause was that of <lb/>
her happiness and the happiness of him on whom she had <lb/>
bestowed her heart. It behoved her, therefore, to call forth <lb/>
all her energies in defence of it, to weaken her brother's <lb/>
influence on the minds of her parents, or to win him to be <lb/>
<pb n="41" entity="eaf033v3_0054" pid="uva-lib:349786"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">5</fw></pb>
her advocate. When I reflect upon her mental powers, and the <lb/>
advantages which should seem to flow from the circumstance <lb/>
of pleading in the character of daughter and sister, I can <lb/>
scarcely believe that her attempts miscarried. I should <lb/>
have imagined that all obstacles would yield before her, and <lb/>
particularly in a case like this, in which she must have <reg orig="sum-|moned">summoned</reg> <lb/>
all her forces, and never have believed that she had <lb/>
struggled sufficiently.</p>
<p>Certain it is that her lot was fixed. She was not only <lb/>
denied the husband of her choice, but another was imposed <lb/>
upon her, whose recommendations were irresistible in every <lb/>
one's apprehension but her own. The discarded lover was <lb/>
treated with every sort of contumely. Deceit and violence <lb/>
were employed by her brother to bring his honor, his liberty, <lb/>
and even his life into hazard. All these iniquities produced <lb/>
no inconsiderable effect on the mind of the lady. The <lb/>
machinations to which her love was exposed, would have <lb/>
exasperated him into madness, had not her most strenuous <lb/>
exertions been directed to appease him.</p>
<p>She prevailed on him at length to abandon his country, <lb/>
though she thereby merely turned her brother's depravity <lb/>
into a new channel. Her parents died without <reg orig="conscious-|ness">consciousness</reg> <lb/>
of the evils they inflicted, but they experienced a bitter <lb/>
retribution in the conduct of their son. He was the darling <lb/>
and stay of an ancient and illustrious house, but his actions <lb/>
reflected nothing but disgrace upon his ancestry, and <reg orig="threat-|ened">threatened</reg> <lb/>
to bring the honors of their line to a period in his <lb/>
person. At their death the bulk of their patrimony <reg orig="de-|volved">devolved</reg> <lb/>
upon him. This he speedily consumed in gaming <lb/>
and riot. From splendid, he descended to meaner vices. <lb/>
The efforts of his sister to recall him to virtue were <reg orig="uninter-|mitted">unintermitted</reg> <lb/>
and fruitless. Her affection for him he converted <lb/>
into a means of prolonging his selfish gratifications. She <lb/>
decided for the best. It was no argument of weakness that <lb/>
she was so frequently deceived. If she had judged truly of <lb/>
her brother, she would have judged not only without <reg orig="ex-|ample">example</reg>, <lb/>
but in opposition to the general experience of <reg orig="man-|kind">mankind</reg>. <lb/>
But she was not to be forever deceived. Her <reg orig="ten-|derness">tenderness</reg> <lb/>
was subservient to justice. And when his vices <lb/>
had led him from the gaming table to the highway, when <lb/>
<pb n="42" entity="eaf033v3_0055" pid="uva-lib:349787"/>
seized at length by the ministers of law, when convicted and <lb/>
sentenced to transportation, her intercession was solicited, <lb/>
when all the world knew that pardon would readily be <lb/>
granted to a supplicant of her rank, fortune, and character, <lb/>
when the criminal himself, his kindred, his friends, and even <lb/>
indifferent persons implored her interference, her justice was <lb/>
inflexible. She knew full well the incurableness of his <lb/>
depravity; that banishment was the mildest destiny that <lb/>
would befall him; that estrangement from ancient haunts <lb/>
and associates was the condition from which his true friends <lb/>
had least to fear. Finding entreaties unavailing, the wretch <lb/>
delivered himself to the suggestions of his malice, and <lb/>
he vowed to be bloodily revenged on her inflexibility. The <lb/>
sentence was executed. That character must indeed be <lb/>
monstrous from which the execution of such threats was to <lb/>
be dreaded. The event sufficiently showed that our fears <lb/>
on this head were well grounded. This event, however, <lb/>
was at a great distance. It was reported that the felons, <lb/>
of whom he was one, mutinied on board the ship in which <lb/>
they had been embarked. In the affray that succeeded, it <lb/>
was said that he was killed.</p>
<p>Among the nefarious deeds which he perpetrated, was to <lb/>
be numbered, the seduction of a young lady, whose heart <lb/>
was broken by the detection of his perfidy. The fruit of <lb/>
this unhappy union was a daughter. Her mother died <lb/>
shortly after her birth. Her father was careless of her <lb/>
destiny. She was consigned to the care of an hireling, <lb/>
who, happily for the innocent victim, performed the <reg orig="mater-|nal">maternal</reg> <lb/>
offices for her own sake, and did not allow the want of <lb/>
a stipulated recompense to render her cruel or neglectful.</p>
<p>This orphan was sought out by the benevolence of Mrs. <lb/>
Lorimer and placed under her own protection. She <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
from her the treatment of a mother. The ties of <lb/>
kindred, corroborated by habit, was not the only thing that <lb/>
united them. That resemblance to herself, which had <lb/>
been so deplorably defective in her brother, was completely <lb/>
realized in his offspring. Nature seemed to have precluded <lb/>
every difference between them but that of age. This <reg orig="dar-|ling">darling</reg> <lb/>
object excited in her bosom more than maternal <reg orig="sympa-|thies">sympathies</reg>. <lb/>
Her soul clung to the happiness of her <hi rend="italic">Clarice,</hi> with <lb/>
more ardor than to that of her own son. The latter was <lb/>
<pb n="43" entity="eaf033v3_0056" pid="uva-lib:349788"/>
not only less worthy of affection, but their separation <reg orig="neces-|sarily">necessarily</reg> <lb/>
diminished their mutual confidence.</p>
<p>It was natural for her to look forward to the future <reg orig="des-|tiny">destiny</reg> <lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">Clarice.</hi> On these occasions she could not help <lb/>
contemplating the possibility of a union between her son <lb/>
and neice. Considerable advantages belonged to this <lb/>
scheme, yet it was the subject of hope rather than the scope <lb/>
of a project. The contingences were numerous and <reg orig="de-|licate">delicate</reg> <lb/>
on which the ultimate desirableness of this union <lb/>
depended. She was far from certain that her son would <lb/>
be worthy of this benefit, or that, if he were worthy, his <lb/>
propensities would not select for themselves a different <lb/>
object. It was equally dubious whether the young lady <lb/>
would not think proper otherwise to dispose of her <reg orig="affec-|tions">affections</reg>. <lb/>
These uncertanties could be dissipated only by <lb/>
time. Meanwhile she wsa chiefly solicitous to render <lb/>
them virtuous and wise.</p>
<p>As they advanced in years, the hopes that she had formed <lb/>
were annihilated. The youth was not exempt from <reg orig="egre-|gious">egregious</reg> <lb/>
errors. In addition to this, it was manifest that the <lb/>
young people were disposed to regard each other in no <lb/>
other light than that of brother and sister. I was not <reg orig="un-|apprised">unapprised</reg> <lb/>
of her views. I saw that their union was <reg orig="impossi-|ble">impossible</reg>. <lb/>
I wsa near enough to judge of the character of <lb/>
Clarice. My youth and intellectual constitution made me <lb/>
peculiarly susceptible to female charms. I was her <reg orig="play-|fellow">playfellow</reg> <lb/>
in childhood, and her associate in studies and <lb/>
amusements at a muturer age. This situation might have <lb/>
been suspected of a dangerous tendency. This tendency, <lb/>
however, was obviated by motives of which I was, for a <lb/>
long time, scarcely conscious.</p>
<p>I was habituated to consider the distinctions of rank as <lb/>
indelible. The obstructions that existed, to any wish that <lb/>
I might form, were like those of time and space, and as, in <lb/>
their own nature, insuperable.</p>
<p>Such was the state of things previous to our setting out <lb/>
upon our travels. Clarice was indirectly included in our <lb/>
correspondence. My letters were open to her inspection, <lb/>
and I was sometimes honored with a few complimentary <lb/>
lines under her own hand. On returning to my ancient <lb/>
abode, I was once more exposed to those sinister influences <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="eaf033v3_0057" pid="uva-lib:349789"/>
which absence had at least suspended. Various suitors had, <lb/>
meanwhile, been rejected. Their character, for the most <lb/>
part, had been such as to account for her refusal, without <lb/>
resorting to the supposition of a lurking or unavowed <reg orig="attach-|ment">attachment</reg>.</p>
<p>On our meeting she greeted me in a respectful but dignified <lb/>
manner. Observers could discover in it nothing not <reg orig="corres-|ponding">corresponding</reg> <lb/>
to that difference of fortune which subsisted between <lb/>
us. If her joy, on that occasion, had in it some portion of <lb/>
tenderness, the softness of her temper, and the peculiar <reg orig="cir-|cumstances">circumstances</reg> <lb/>
in which we had been placed, being considered, <lb/>
the most rigid censor could find no occasion for blame or <lb/>
suspicion.</p>
<p>A year passed away, but not without my attention being <lb/>
solicited by something new and inexplicable in my own <reg orig="sen-|sations">sensations</reg>. <lb/>
At first I was not aware of their true cause; but <lb/>
the gradual progress of my feelings left me not long in doubt <lb/>
as to their origin. I was alarmed at the discovery, but my <lb/>
courage did not suddenly desert me. My hopes seemed to <lb/>
be extinguished the moment that I distinctly perceived the <lb/>
point to which they led. My mind had undergone a change. <lb/>
The ideas with which it was fraught were varied. The <lb/>
sight, or recollection of Clarice, was sure to occasion my <lb/>
mind to advert to the recent discovery, and to revolve the <lb/>
considerations naturally connected with it. Some latent <lb/>
glows and secret trepidations were likewise experienced, <lb/>
when, by some accident, our meetings were abrupt or our <lb/>
interviews unwitnessed; yet my usual tranquillity was not as <lb/>
yet sensibly diminished. I could bear to think of her marriage <lb/>
with another without painful emotions, and was anxious only <lb/>
that her choice should be judicious and fortunate.</p>
<p>My thoughts could not long continue in this state. They <lb/>
gradually became more ardent and museful. The image of <lb/>
Clarice occurred with unseasonable frequency. Its charms <lb/>
were enhanced by some nameless and indefinable additions. <lb/>
When it met me in the way I was irresistibly disposed to <lb/>
stop and survey it with particular attention. The pathetic <lb/>
cast of her features, the deep glow of her cheek, and some <lb/>
catch of melting music, she had lately breathed, stole <reg orig="inces-|santly">incessantly</reg> <lb/>
upon my fancy. On recovering from my thoughtful <lb/>
moods, I sometimes found my cheeks wet with tears, that <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="eaf033v3_0058" pid="uva-lib:349790"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">5*</fw></pb>
had fallen unperceived, and my bosom heaved with <reg orig="involum-|tary">involumtary</reg> <lb/>
sighs.</p>
<p>These images did not content themselves with invading <lb/>
my wakeful hours; but, likewise, encroached upon my sleep. <lb/>
I could no longer resign myself to slumber with the same <lb/>
ease as before. When I slept, my visions were of the same <lb/>
impassioned tenor.</p>
<p>There was no difficulty in judging rightly of my situation. <lb/>
I knew what it was that duty exacted from me. To remain in <lb/>
my present situation was a chimerical project. That time and <lb/>
reflection would suffice to restore me to myself was a notion <lb/>
equally fallacious. Yet I felt an insupportable reluctance to <lb/>
change it. This reluctance was owing, not wholly or chiefly <lb/>
to my growing passion, but to the attachment which bound <lb/>
me to the service of my lady. All my contemplations had <lb/>
hitherto been modelled on the belief of my remaining in my <lb/>
present situation during my life. My mildest anticipations <lb/>
had never fashioned an event like this. Any misfortune was <lb/>
light in comparison with that which tore me from her presence <lb/>
and service. But should I ultimately resolve to separate, <lb/>
how should I communicate my purpose. The pain of <reg orig="part-|ing">parting</reg> <lb/>
would scarcely be less on her side than on mine. Could I <lb/>
consent to be the author of disquietude to her? I had <reg orig="con-|secrated">consecrated</reg> <lb/>
all my faculties to her service. This was the <lb/>
recompense which it was in my power to make for the <lb/>
benefits that I had received. Would not this procedure <lb/>
bear the appearance of the basest ingratitude? The <lb/>
shadow of an imputation like this was more excruciating <lb/>
than the rack.</p>
<p>What motive could I assign for my conduct? The truth <lb/>
must not be told. This would be equivalent to supplicating <lb/>
for a new benefit. It would more become me to lessen than <lb/>
increase my obligations. Among all my imaginations on <lb/>
this subject, the possibility of a mutual passion never <reg orig="occur-|red">occurred</reg> <lb/>
to me. I could not be blind to the essential <reg orig="distinc-|tions">distinctions</reg> <lb/>
that subsist among men. I could expatiate, like others, <lb/>
on the futility of ribbons and titles, and on the dignity that <lb/>
was annexed to skill and virtue; but these, for the most <lb/>
part, were the incoherences of speculation, and in no degree <lb/>
influenced the stream of my actions, and practical <reg orig="senti-|ments">sentiments</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="eaf033v3_0059" pid="uva-lib:349791"/>
The barrier that existed in the present case, I <lb/>
deemed insurmountable. This was not even the subject of <lb/>
doubt. In disclosing the truth, I should be conceived to be <lb/>
soliciting my lady's mercy and intercession; but this would <lb/>
be the madness of presumption. Let me impress her with <lb/>
any other opinion than that I go in search of the happiness <lb/>
that I have lost under her roof. Let me save her generous <lb/>
heart from the pangs which this persuasion would infallibly <lb/>
produce.</p>
<p>I could form no stable resolutions. I seemed unalterably <lb/>
convinced of the necessity of separation, and yet could not <lb/>
execute my design. When I had wrought up my mind to <lb/>
the intention of explaining myself on the next interview, <lb/>
when the next interview took place my tongue was <reg orig="power-|less">powerless</reg>. <lb/>
I admitted any excuse for postponing my design, and <lb/>
gladly admitted any topic, however foreign to my purpose.</p>
<p>It must not be imagined that my health sustained no injury <lb/>
from this conflict of my passions. My patroness perceived <lb/>
this alteration. She inquired with the most affectionate <reg orig="so-|licitude">solicitude</reg> <lb/>
into the cause. It could not be explained. I could <lb/>
safely make light of it, and represented it as something which <lb/>
would probably disappear of itself, as it originated without <lb/>
any adequate cause. She was obliged to acquiesce in my <lb/>
imperfect account.</p>
<p>Day after day passed in this state of fluctuation. I was <lb/>
conscious of the dangers of delay, and that procrastination, <lb/>
without rendering the task less necessary, augmented its <lb/>
difficulties. At length, summoning my resolution, I <reg orig="de-|manded">demanded</reg> <lb/>
an audience. She received me with her usual <lb/>
affability. Common topics were started; but she saw the <lb/>
confusion and trepidation of my thoughts, and quickly <reg orig="relin-|quished">relinquished</reg> <lb/>
them. She then noticed to me what she had <reg orig="ob-|served">observed</reg>, <lb/>
and mentioned the anxiety which these appearances <lb/>
had given her. She reminded me of the maternal regard <lb/>
which she had always manifested towards me, and appealed <lb/>
to my own heart whether any thing could be said in <reg orig="vindica-|tion">vindication</reg> <lb/>
of that reserve with which I had lately treated her, and <lb/>
urged me, as I valued her good opinion, to explain the cause <lb/>
of a dejection <hi rend="italic">that was too visible.</hi></p>
<p>To all this I could make but one answer. Think me not, <lb/>
Madam, perverse or ungrateful. I came just now to apprise <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="eaf033v3_0060" pid="uva-lib:349792"/>
you of a resolution that I had formed. I cannot explain <lb/>
the motives that induce me. In this case, to lie to you <lb/>
would be unpardonable, and since I cannot assign my true <lb/>
motives, I will not mislead you by false representations. I <lb/>
came to inform you of my intention to leave your service, <lb/>
and to retire with the fruits of your bounty, to my native <lb/>
village, where I shall spend my life, I hope, in peace.</p>
<p>Her surprise at this declaration was beyond measure. <lb/>
She could not believe her ears. She had not heard me <lb/>
rightly. She compelled me to repeat it. Still I was jesting. <lb/>
I could not possibly mean what my words imported.</p>
<p>I assured her, in terms still more explicit, that my <reg orig="resolu-|tion">resolution</reg> <lb/>
was taken and was unalterable, and again entreated her <lb/>
to spare me the task of assigning my motives.</p>
<p>This was a strange determination. What could be the <lb/>
grounds of this new scheme? What could be the necessity <lb/>
of hiding them from her? This mystery was not to be <reg orig="en-|dured">endured</reg>. <lb/>
She could by no means away with it. She thought <lb/>
it hard that I should abandon her at this time, when she <lb/>
stood in particular need of my assistance and advice. She <lb/>
would refuse nothing to make my situation eligible. I had <lb/>
only to point out where she was deficient in her treatment of <lb/>
me, and she would endeavor to supply it. She was willing <lb/>
to augment my emoluments in any degree that I desired. <lb/>
She could not think of parting with me; but, at any rate, <lb/>
she must be informed of my motives.</p>
<p>It is a hard task, answered I, that I have imposed upon <lb/>
myself. I foresaw its difficulties, and this foresight has <lb/>
hitherto prevented me from undertaking it; but the necessity <lb/>
by which I am impelled, will no longer be withstood. I am <lb/>
determined to go; but to say why, is impossible. I hope I <lb/>
shall not bring upon myself the imputation of ingratitude; <lb/>
but this imputation, more intolerable than any other, must <lb/>
be borne, if it cannot be avoided but by this disclosure.</p>
<p>Keep your motives to yourself, said she. I have too <lb/>
good an opinion of you to suppose that you would practise <lb/>
concealment without good reason. I merely desire you to <lb/>
remain where you are. Since you will not tell me why you <lb/>
take up this new scheme, I can only say that it is impossible <lb/>
there should be any advantage in this scheme. I will not <lb/>
<pb n="48" entity="eaf033v3_0061" pid="uva-lib:349793"/>
hear of it I tell you. Therefore, submit to my decree with <lb/>
a good grace.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this prohibition I persisted in declaring <lb/>
that my determination was fixed, and that the motives that <lb/>
governed me would allow of no alternative.</p>
<p>So, you will go, will you, whether I will or no? I have <lb/>
no power to detain you? You will regard nothing that I <lb/>
can say?</p>
<p>Believe me, madam, no resolution ever was formed after <lb/>
a more vehement struggle. If my motives were known, <lb/>
you would not only cease to oppose, but would hasten my <lb/>
departure. Honor me so far with your good opinion, as <lb/>
to believe that, in saying this, I say nothing but the truth, <lb/>
and render my duty less burthensome by cheerfully <reg orig="acqui-|escing">acquiescing</reg> <lb/>
in its dictates.</p>
<p>I would, replied my lady, I could find somebody that <lb/>
has more power over you than I have. Whom shall I call <lb/>
in to aid me in this arduous task?</p>
<p>Nay, dear madam, if I can resist your entreaties, surely <lb/>
no other can hope to succeed.</p>
<p>I am not sure of that, said my friend, archly; there is <lb/>
one person in the world whose supplications, I greatly <reg orig="sus-|pect">suspect</reg>, <lb/>
you would not withstand.</p>
<p>Whom do you mean? said I, in some trepidation.</p>
<p>You will know presently. Unless I can prevail upon you, <lb/>
I shall be obliged to call for assistance.</p>
<p>Spare me the pain of repeating that no power on earth <lb/>
can change my resolution.</p>
<p>That 's a fib, she rejoined, with increased archness. You <lb/>
know it is. If a certain person entreat you to stay, you will <lb/>
easily comply. I see I cannot hope to prevail by my own <lb/>
strength. That is a mortifying consideration, but we must <lb/>
not part, that is a point settled. If nothing else will do, I <lb/>
must go and fetch my advocate. Stay here a moment.</p>
<p>I had scarcely time to breathe, before she returned, <reg orig="lead-|ing">leading</reg> <lb/>
in Clarice. I did not yet comprehend the meaning of <lb/>
this ceremony. The lady was overwhelmed with sweet <lb/>
confusion. Averted eyes and reluctant steps, might have <lb/>
explained to me the purpose of this meeting, if I had <reg orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg> <lb/>
that purpose to be possible. I felt the necessity of <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="eaf033v3_0062" pid="uva-lib:349794"/>
new fortitude, and struggled to recollect the motives that had <lb/>
hitherto sustained me.</p>
<p>There, said my patroness, I have been endeavoring to <lb/>
persuade this young man to live with us a little longer. He <lb/>
is determined, it seems, to change his abode. He will not <lb/>
tell why, and I do not care to know, unless I could shew <lb/>
his reasons to be groundless. I have merely remonstrated <lb/>
with him on the folly of his scheme, but he has proved <lb/>
refractory to all I can say. Perhaps your efforts may meet <lb/>
with better success.</p>
<p>Clarice said not a word. My own embarrassment equally <lb/>
disabled me from speaking. Regarding us both, for some <lb/>
time, with a benign aspect, Mrs. Lorimer resumed, taking <lb/>
a hand of each and joining them together.</p>
<p>I very well know what it was that suggested this scheme. <lb/>
It is strange that you should suppose me so careless an <reg orig="ob-|server">observer</reg> <lb/>
as not to note, or not to understand your situation. <lb/>
I am as well acquainted with what is passing in your heart <lb/>
as you yourself are, but why are you so anxious to conceal <lb/>
it. You know less of the adventurousness of love than I <lb/>
should have suspected. But I will not trifle with your <lb/>
feelings.</p>
<p>You, Clithero, know the wishes that I once cherished. I <lb/>
had hoped that my son would have found, in this darling <lb/>
child, an object worthy of his choice, and that my girl would <lb/>
have preferred him to all others. But I have long since <lb/>
discovered that this could not be. They are nowise suited <lb/>
to each other. There is one thing in the next place <reg orig="desir-|able">desirable</reg>, <lb/>
and now my wishes are accomplished. I see that you <lb/>
love each other, and never, in my opinion, was a passion <lb/>
more rational and just. I should think myself the worst of <lb/>
beings if I did not contribute all in my power to your <reg orig="hap-|piness">happiness</reg>. <lb/>
There is not the shadow of objection to your union. <lb/>
I know your scruples, Clithero, and am sorry to see that <lb/>
you harbor them for a moment. Nothing is more <reg orig="un-|worthy">unworthy</reg> <lb/>
of your good sense.</p>
<p>I found out this girl long ago. Take my word for it, <lb/>
young man, she does not fall short of you in the purity and <lb/>
tenderness of her attachment. What need is there of <lb/>
tedious preliminaries. I will leave you together, and hope <lb/>
you will not be long in coming to a mutual understanding. <lb/>
<pb n="50" entity="eaf033v3_0063" pid="uva-lib:349795"/>
Your union cannot be completed too soon for my wishes. <lb/>
Clarice is my only and darling daughter. As to you, <reg orig="Cli-|thero">Clithero</reg>, <lb/>
expect henceforth that treatment from me, not only <lb/>
to which your own merit entitles you, but which is due to <lb/>
the husband of my daughter.&mdash;With these words she <reg orig="re-|tired">retired</reg>, <lb/>
and left us together.</p>
<p>Great God! deliver me from the torments of this <reg orig="remem-|brance">remembrance</reg>. <lb/>
That a being by whom I was snatched from <lb/>
penury and brutal ignorance, exalted to some rank in the <lb/>
intelligent creation, reared to affluence and honor, and <lb/>
thus, at last, spontaneously endowed with all that remained <lb/>
to complete the sum of my felicity, that a being like this&mdash; <lb/>
but such thoughts must not yet be&mdash;I must shut them out, <lb/>
or I shall never arrive at the end of my tale. My efforts <lb/>
have been thus far successful. I have hitherto been able <lb/>
to deliver a coherent narrative. Let the last words that I <lb/>
shall speak afford some glimmering of my better days. <lb/>
Let me execute without faltering the only task that remains <lb/>
for me.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">How</hi> propitious, how incredible was this event! I could <lb/>
scarcely confide in the testimony of my senses. Was it <lb/>
true that Clarice was before me, that she was prepared to <lb/>

which I had deemed insurmountable, that I was fondly <reg orig="be-|loved">beloved</reg> <lb/>
by her, and should shortly be admitted to the <reg orig="posses-|sion">possession</reg> <lb/>

and languor gave place, in my bosom, to the <reg orig="irradia-|tions">irradiations</reg> <lb/>

<p>Alas! They were destined to ebb with unspeakably <lb/>
greater rapidity, and to leave me, in a moment, stranded <lb/>
and wrecked.</p>
<pb n="51" entity="eaf033v3_0064" pid="uva-lib:349796"/>
<p>Our nuptials would have been solemnized without delay, <lb/>
had not a melancholy duty interfered. Clarice had a <lb/>
friend in a distant part of the kingdom. Her health had <lb/>
long been the prey of a consumption. She was now <reg orig="evi-|dently">evidently</reg> <lb/>
tending to dissolution. In this extremity she entreated <lb/>
her friend to afford her the consolation of her presence. <lb/>
The only wish that remained was to die in her arms.</p>
<p>This request could not but be willingly complied with. <lb/>
It became me patiently to endure the delay that would <lb/>
thence arise to the completion of my wishes. Considering <lb/>
the urgency and mournfulness of the occasion, it was <reg orig="impos-|sible">impossible</reg> <lb/>
for me to murmur, and the affectionate Clarice would <lb/>
suffer nothing to interfere with the duty which she owed <lb/>
to her dying friend. I accompanied her on this journey, <lb/>
remained with her a few days, and then parted from her <lb/>
to return to the metropolis. It was not imagined that it would <lb/>
be necessary to prolong her absence beyond a month. <lb/>
When I bade her farewell, and informed her on what day <lb/>
I proposed to return for her, I felt no decay of my <reg orig="satis-|faction">satisfaction</reg>. <lb/>
My thoughts were bright and full of exultation. <lb/>
Why was not some intimation afforded me of the snares <lb/>
that lay in my path? In the train laid for my destruction, <lb/>
the agent had so skilfully contrived that my security was not <lb/>
molested by the faintest omen.</p>
<p>I hasten to the crisis of my tale. I am almost dubious <lb/>
of my strength. The nearer I approach to it, the stronger <lb/>
is my aversion. My courage, instead of gathering force <lb/>
as I proceed, decays. I am willing to dwell still longer on <lb/>
preliminary circumstances. There are other incidents <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
which my story would be lame. I retail them because <lb/>
they afford me a kind of respite from horrors, at the thought <lb/>
of which every joint in my frame trembles. They must be <lb/>
endured, but that infirmity may be forgiven, which makes <lb/>
me inclined to procrastinate my suffering.</p>
<p>I mentioned the lover whom my patroness was <reg orig="compel-|led">compelled</reg>, <lb/>
by the machinations of her brother, to discard. More <lb/>
than twenty years had passed since their separation. His <lb/>
birth was mean and he was without fortune. His <reg orig="profes-|sion">profession</reg> <lb/>
was that of a surgeon. My lady not only prevailed <lb/>
upon him to abandon his country, but enabled him to do <lb/>
this by supplying his necessities from her own purse. His <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="eaf033v3_0065" pid="uva-lib:349797"/>
excellent understanding was, for a time, obscured by <reg orig="pas-|sion">passion</reg>; <lb/>
but it was not difficult for my lady ultimately to obtain <lb/>
his concurrence to all her schemes. He saw and adored <lb/>
the rectitude of her motives, did not disdain to accept her <lb/>
gifts, and projected means for maintaining an epistolary <lb/>
intercourse during their separation.</p>
<p>Her interest procured him a post in the service of the <lb/>
East-India company. She was, from time to time, <reg orig="inform-|ed">informed</reg> <lb/>
of his motions. A war broke out between the <reg orig="Com-|pany">Company</reg> <lb/>
and some of the native powers. He was present at <lb/>
a great battle in which the English were defeated. She <lb/>
could trace him by his letters and by other circumstances <lb/>
thus far, but here the thread was discontinued, and no <lb/>
means which she employed could procure any tidings of <lb/>
him. Whether he was captive, or dead, continued, for <lb/>
several years, to be merely matter of conjecture.</p>
<p>On my return to Dublin, I found my patroness engaged <lb/>
in conversation with a stranger. She introduced us to each <lb/>
other in a manner that indicated the respect which she <lb/>
entertained for us both. I surveyed and listened to him <lb/>
with considerable attention. His aspect was noble and <lb/>
ingenuous, but his sun-burnt and rugged features bespoke a <lb/>
various and boisterous pilgrimage. The furrows of his <lb/>
brow were the products of vicissitude and hardship, rather <lb/>
than of age. His accents were fiery and energetic, and <lb/>
the impassioned boldness of his address, as well as the tenor <lb/>
of his discourse, full of allusions to the past, and regrets <lb/>
that the course of events had not been different, made me <lb/>
suspect something extraordinary in his character.</p>
<p>As soon as he left us, my lady explained who he was. <lb/>
He was no other than the object of her youthful attachment, <lb/>
who had, a few days before, dropped among us as from the <lb/>
skies. He had a long and various story to tell. He had <lb/>
accounted for his silence by enumerating the incidents of <lb/>
his life. He had escaped from the prisons of Hyder, had <lb/>
wandered on foot, and under various disguises, through <lb/>
the northern district of Hindostan. He was sometimes a <lb/>
scholar of Benares, and sometimes a disciple of the Mosque. <lb/>
According to the exigences of the times, he was a pilgrim <lb/>
to Mecca or to Juggernaut. By a long, circuitous, and <reg orig="peri-|lous">perilous</reg> <lb/>
route, he at length arrived at the Turkish capital. <lb/>
<pb n="53" entity="eaf033v3_0066" pid="uva-lib:349798"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">6</fw></pb>
Here he resided for several years, deriving a precarious <lb/>
subsistence from the profession of a surgeon. He was <lb/>
obliged to desert this post, in consequence of a duel between <lb/>
two Scotsmen. One of them had embraced the Greek <lb/>
religion, and was betrothed to the daughter of a wealthy <lb/>
trader of that nation. He perished in the conflict, and the <lb/>
family of the lady not only procured the execution of his <lb/>
antagonist, but threatened to involve all those who were <lb/>
known to be connected with him in the same ruin.</p>
<p>His life being thus endangered, it became necessary for <lb/>
him to seek a new residence. He fled from <reg orig="Constantino-|ple">Constantinople</reg> <lb/>
with such precipitation as reduced him to the lowest <lb/>
poverty. He had traversed the Indian conquests of <reg orig="Alex-|ander">Alexander</reg>, <lb/>
as a mendicant. In the same character, he now <lb/>
wandered over the native country of Philip and <reg orig="Phil&oelig;pe-|men">Phil&oelig;pemen</reg>. <lb/>
He passed safely through multiplied perils, and <lb/>
finally, embarking at Salonica, he reached Venice. He <lb/>
descended through the passes of the Apennine into Tuscany. <lb/>
In this journey he suffered a long detention from banditti, <lb/>
by whom he was waylaid. In consequence of his harmless <lb/>
deportment, and a seasonable display of his chirurgical <lb/>
skill, they granted him his life, though they, for a time, <reg orig="re-|strained">restrained</reg> <lb/>
him of his liberty, and compelled him to endure <lb/>
their society. The time was not misemployed which he <lb/>
spent immured in caverns and carousing with robbers. His <lb/>
details were eminently singular and curious, and evinced <lb/>
the acuteness of his penetration, as well the steadfastness <lb/>
of his courage.</p>
<p>After emerging from these wilds, he found his way along <lb/>
the banks of the Arno to Leghorn. Thence he procured <lb/>
a passage to America, whence he had just returned, with <lb/>
many additions to his experience, but none to his fortune.</p>
<p>This was a remarkable event. It did not at first appear <lb/>
how far its consequences would extend. The lady was, <lb/>
at present, disengaged and independent. Though the <reg orig="pas-|sion">passion</reg> <lb/>
which clouded her early prosperity was extinct, time <lb/>
had not diminished the worth of her friend, and they were <lb/>
far from having reached that age when love becomes <reg orig="chime-|rical">chimerical</reg> <lb/>
and marriage folly. A confidential intercourse was <lb/>
immediately established between them. The bounty of <lb/>
<pb n="54" entity="eaf033v3_0067" pid="uva-lib:349799"/>
Mrs. Lorimer soon divested her friend of all fear of poverty. <lb/>
At any rate, said she, he shall wander no further, but shall <lb/>
be comfortably situated for the rest of his life. All his <lb/>
scruples were vanquished by the reasonableness of her <lb/>
remonstrances and the vehemence of her solicitations.</p>
<p>A cordial intimacy grew between me and the newly <lb/>
arrived. Our interviews were frequent, and our <reg orig="communi-|cations">communications</reg> <lb/>
without reserve. He detailed to me the result of his <lb/>
experience, and expatiated without end on the history of <lb/>
his actions and opinions. He related the adventures of his <lb/>
youth, and dwelt upon all the circumstances of his <reg orig="attach-|ment">attachment</reg> <lb/>
to my patroness. On this subject I had heard only <lb/>
general details. I continually found cause, in the course of <lb/>
his narrative, to revere the illustrious qualities of my lady, <lb/>
and to weep at the calamities to which the infernal malice <lb/>
of her brother had subjected her.</p>
<p>The tale of that man's misdeeds, amplified and <reg orig="drama-|tised">dramatised</reg>, <lb/>
by the indignant eloquence of this historian, oppressed <lb/>
me with astonishment. If a poet had drawn such a <reg orig="por-|trait">portrait</reg> <lb/>
I should have been prone to suspect the soundness of <lb/>
his judgment. Till now I had imagined that no character <lb/>
was uniform and unmixed, and my theory of the passions <lb/>
did not enable me to account for a propensity gratified <lb/>
merely by evil, and delighting in shrieks and agony for their <lb/>
own sake.</p>
<p>It was natural to suggest to my friend, when expatiating <lb/>
on this theme, an inquiry as to how far subsequent events <lb/>
had obliterated the impressions that were then made, and as <lb/>
to the plausibility of reviving, at this more auspicious period, <lb/>
his claims on the heart of his friend. When he thought <lb/>
proper to notice these hints, he gave me to understand that <lb/>
time had made no essential alteration in his sentiments in <lb/>
this respect, that he still fostered a hope, to which every day <lb/>
added new vigor, that whatever was the ultimate event, he <lb/>
trusted in his fortitude to sustain it, if adverse, and in his <lb/>
wisdom to extract from it the most valuable consequences, if <lb/>
it should prove prosperous.</p>
<p>The progress of things was not unfavorable to his hopes. <lb/>
She treated his insinuations and professions with levity; but <lb/>
her arguments seemed to be urged, with no other view than <lb/>
to afford an opportunity of confutation; and, since there was <lb/>
<pb n="55" entity="eaf033v3_0068" pid="uva-lib:349800"/>
no abatement of familiarity and kindness, there was room to <lb/>
hope that the affair would terminate agreeably to his wishes.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="VII" id="d12">
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Clarice,</hi> meanwhile, was absent. Her friend seemed, <lb/>
at the end of a month, to be little less distant from the grave <lb/>
than at first. My impatience would not allow me to wait <lb/>
till her death. I visited her, but was once more obliged to <lb/>
return alone. I arrived late in the city, and being greatly <lb/>
fatigued, I retired almost immediately to my chamber.</p>
<p>On hearing of my arrival, Sarsefield hastened to see me. <lb/>
He came to my bedside, and such, in his opinion, was the <lb/>
importance of the tidings which he had to communicate, that <lb/>
he did not scruple to rouse me from a deep sleep.......</p>
<p>At this period of his narrative, Clithero stopped. His <lb/>
complexion varied from one degree of paleness to another. <lb/>
His brain appeared to suffer some severe constriction. He <lb/>
desired to be excused, for a few minutes, from proceeding. <lb/>
In a short time he was relieved from this paroxysm, and <reg orig="re-|sumed">resumed</reg> <lb/>
his tale with an accent tremulous at first, but acquiring <lb/>
stability and force as he went on.</p>
<p>On waking, as I have said, I found my friend seated at <lb/>
my bedside. His countenance exhibited various tokens of <lb/>
alarm. As soon as I perceived who it was, I started, <reg orig="ex-|claiming">exclaiming</reg>, <lb/>
What is the matter?</p>
<p>He sighed. Pardon, said he, this unseasonable intrusion. <lb/>
A light matter would not have occasioned it. I have waited, <lb/>
for two days past, in an agony of impatience, for your return. <lb/>
Happily, you are, at last, come. I stand in the utmost need <lb/>
of your counsel and aid.</p>
<p>Heaven defend! cried I. This is a terrible prelude. <lb/>
You may, of course, rely upon my assistance and advice. <lb/>
What is it that you have to propose?</p>
<p>Tuesday evening, he answered, I spent here. It was late <lb/>
before I returned to my lodgings. I was in the act of lifting <lb/>
my hand to the bell, when my eye was caught by a person <lb/>
standing close to the wall, at the distance of ten paces. <lb/>
His attitude was that of one employed in watching my <reg orig="mo-|tions">motions</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="eaf033v3_0069" pid="uva-lib:349801"/>
His face was turned towards me, and happened, at <lb/>
that moment, to be fully illuminated by the rays of a <reg orig="globe-|lamp">globelamp</reg> <lb/>
that hung over the door. I instantly recognised his <lb/>
features. I was petrified. I had no power to execute my <lb/>
design, or even to move, but stood, for some seconds, gazing <lb/>
upon him. He was, in no degree, disconcerted by the <lb/>
eagerness of my scrutiny. He seemed perfectly <reg orig="indiffer-|ent">indifferent</reg> <lb/>
to the consequences of being known. At length he <lb/>
slowly turned his eyes to another quarter, but without <reg orig="chang-|ing">changing</reg> <lb/>
his posture, or the sternness of his looks. I cannot <reg orig="de-|scribe">describe</reg> <lb/>
to you the shock which this encounter produced in <lb/>
me. At last I went into the house, and have ever since <lb/>
been excessively uneasy.</p>
<p>I do not see any ground for uneasiness.</p>
<p>You do not then suspect who this person is?</p>
<p>No&mdash;</p>
<p>It is Arthur Wiatte.&mdash;</p>
<p>Good heaven! It is impossible. What, my lady's <reg orig="bro-|ther">brother</reg>?</p>
<p>The same&mdash;</p>
<p>It cannot be. Were we not assured of his death? That <lb/>
he perished in a mutiny on board the vessel in which he was <lb/>
embarked for transportation?</p>
<p>Such was rumor, which is easily mistaken. My eyes <lb/>
cannot be deceived in this case. I should as easily fail to <lb/>
recognise his sister, when I first met her, as him. This is <lb/>
the man, whether once dead or not, he is, at present, alive, <lb/>
and in this city.</p>
<p>But has any thing since happened to confirm you in this <lb/>
opinion.</p>
<p>Yes, there has. As soon as I had recovered from my <lb/>
first surprise, I began to reflect upon the measures proper to <lb/>
be taken. This was the identical Arthur Wiatte. You <lb/>
know his character. No time was likely to change the <lb/>
principles of such a man, but his appearance sufficiently <reg orig="be-|trayed">betrayed</reg> <lb/>
the incurableness of his habits. The same sullen <lb/>
and atrocious passions were written in his visage. You <reg orig="re-|collect">recollect</reg> <lb/>
the vengeance which Wiatte denounced against his <lb/>
sister. There is every thing to dread from his malignity. <lb/>
How to obviate the danger, I know not. I thought, however, <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="eaf033v3_0070" pid="uva-lib:349802"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">6*</fw></pb>
of one expedient. It might serve a present purpose, and <lb/>
something better might suggest itself on your return.</p>
<p>I came hither early the next day. Old Gowan the <reg orig="por-|ter">porter</reg> <lb/>
is well acquainted with Wiatte's story. I mentioned to <lb/>
him that I had reason to think that he had returned. I <lb/>
charged him to have a watchful eye upon every one that <lb/>
knocked at the gate, and that if this person should come, by <lb/>
no means to admit him. The old man promised faithfully <lb/>
to abide by my directions. His terrors, indeed, were greater <lb/>
than mine, and he knew the importance of excluding <lb/>
Wiatte from these walls.</p>
<p>Did you not inform my lady of this?</p>
<p>No. In what way could I tell it to her? What end could <lb/>
it answer? Why should I make her miserable? But I have <lb/>
not done. Yesterday morning Gowan took me aside, and <lb/>
informed me that Wiatte had made his appearance, the day <lb/>
before, at the gate. He knew him, he said, in a moment. <lb/>
He demanded to see the lady, but the old man told him she <lb/>
was engaged, and could not be seen. He assumed <reg orig="pe-|remptory">peremptory</reg> <lb/>
and haughty airs, and asserted that his business was <lb/>
of such importance as not to endure a moment's delay. <lb/>
Gowan persisted in his first refusal. He retired with great <lb/>
reluctance, but said he should return tomorrow, when he <lb/>
should insist upon admission to the presence of the lady. I <lb/>
have inquired, and find that he has not repeated his visit. <lb/>
What is to be done?</p>
<p>I was equally at a loss with my friend. This incident was <lb/>
so unlooked for. What might not be dreaded from the <lb/>
monstrous depravity of Wiatte? His menaces of vengeance <lb/>
against his sister still rung in my ears. Some means of <lb/>
eluding them were indispensable. Could law be resorted to? <lb/>
Against an evil like this, no legal provision had been made. <lb/>
Nine years had elapsed since his transportation. Seven <lb/>
years was the period of his exile. In returning, therefore, <lb/>
he had committed no crime. His person could not be <reg orig="law-|fully">lawfully</reg> <lb/>
molested. We were justified, merely, in repelling an <lb/>
attack. But suppose we should appeal to law, could this be <lb/>
done without the knowledge and concurrence of the lady? <lb/>
She would never permit it. Her heart was incapable of <lb/>
fear from this quarter. She would spurn at the mention of <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="eaf033v3_0071" pid="uva-lib:349803"/>
precautions against the hatred of her brother. Her <reg orig="inquie-|tude">inquietude</reg> <lb/>
would merely be awakened on his own account.</p>
<p>I was overwhelmed with perplexity. Perhaps if he were <lb/>
sought out, and some judgment formed of the kind of danger <lb/>
to be dreaded from him, by a knowledge of his situation and <lb/>
views, some expedient might be thence suggested.</p>
<p>But how should his haunts be discovered? This was <lb/>
easy. He had intimated the design of applying again for <lb/>
admission to his sister. Let a person be stationed near at <lb/>
hand, who, being furnished with an adequate description of <lb/>
his person and dress, shall mark him when he comes, and <lb/>
follow him, when he retires, and shall forthwith impart to us <lb/>
the information on that head which he shall be able to <reg orig="col-|lect">collect</reg>.</p>
<p>My friend concurred in this scheme. No better could, <lb/>
for the present, be suggested. Here ended our conference.</p>
<p>I was thus supplied with a new subject of reflection. It <lb/>
was calculated to fill my mind with dreary forebodings. The <lb/>
future was no longer a scene of security and pleasure. It <lb/>
would be hard for those to partake of our fears, who did not <lb/>
partake of our experience. The existence of Wiatte, was <lb/>
the canker that had blasted the felicity of my patroness. In <lb/>
his reappearance on the stage, there was something <reg orig="porten-|tous">portentous</reg>. <lb/>
It seemed to include in it, consequences of the utmost <lb/>
moment, without my being able to discover what these <reg orig="con-|sequences">consequences</reg> <lb/>
were.</p>
<p>That Sarsefield should be so quickly followed by his <lb/>
arch foe; that they started anew into existence, without <lb/>
any previous intimation, in a manner wholly unexpected, <lb/>
and at the same period. It seemed as if there lurked, under <lb/>
those appearances, a tremendous significance, which human <lb/>
sagacity could not uncover. My heart sunk within me <lb/>
when I reflected that this was the father of my Clarice. He <lb/>
by whose cruelty her mother was torn from the enjoyment <lb/>
of untarnished honor, and consigned to infamy and an <reg orig="un-|timely">untimely</reg> <lb/>
grave. He by whom herself was abandoned in the <lb/>
helplessness of infancy, and left to be the prey of obdurate <lb/>
avarice, and the victim of wretches who traffic in virgin <reg orig="in-|nocence">innocence</reg>. <lb/>
Who had done all that in him lay to devote her <lb/>
youth to guilt and misery. What were the limits of his <lb/>
power? How may he exert the parental prerogatives?</p>
<pb n="59" entity="eaf033v3_0072" pid="uva-lib:349804"/>
<p>To sleep, while these images were haunting me, was <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg>. <lb/>
I passed the night in continual motion. I strode, <lb/>
without ceasing, across the floor of my apartment. My <lb/>
mind was wrought to a higher pitch than I had ever before <lb/>
experienced. The occasion, accurately considered, was far <lb/>
from justifying the ominous inquietudes which I then felt. <lb/>
How then should I account for them?</p>
<p>Sarsefield probably enjoyed his usual slumber. His <reg orig="re-|pose">repose</reg> <lb/>
might not be perfectly serene, but when he ruminated <lb/>
on impending or possible calamities, his tongue did not cleave <lb/>
to his mouth, his throat was not parched with unquenchable <lb/>
thirst, he was not incessantly stimulated to employ his <reg orig="su-|perfluous">superfluous</reg> <lb/>
fertility of thought in motion. If I trembled for <lb/>
the safety of her whom I loved, and whose safety was <reg orig="en-|dangered">endangered</reg> <lb/>
by being the daughter of this miscreant, had he not <lb/>
equal reason to fear for her whom he also loved, and who, <lb/>
as the sister of this ruffian, was encompassed by the most <lb/>
alarming perils. Yet he probably was calm while I was <lb/>
harassed by anxieties.</p>
<p>Alas! The difference was easily explained. Such was <lb/>
the beginning of a series ordained to hurry me to swift <reg orig="de-|struction">destruction</reg>. <lb/>
Such were the primary tokens of the presence <lb/>
of that power by whose accursed machinations I was destined <lb/>
to fall. You are startled at this declaration. It is one to <lb/>
which you have been little accustomed. Perhaps you <reg orig="re-|gard">regard</reg> <lb/>
it merely as an effusion of phrenzy. I know what I <lb/>
am saying. I do not build upon conjectures and surmises. <lb/>
I care not indeed for your doubts. Your conclusion may be <lb/>
fashioned at your pleasure. Would to heaven that my <reg orig="be-|lief">belief</reg> <lb/>
were groundless, and that I had no reason to believe my <lb/>
intellects to have been perverted by diabolical instigations.</p>
<p>I could procure no sleep that night. After Sarsefield's <lb/>
departure I did not even lie down. It seemed to me that I <lb/>
could not obtain the benefits of repose otherwise than by <lb/>
placing my lady beyond the possibility of danger.</p>
<p>I met Sarsefield the next day. In pursuance of the <lb/>
scheme which had been adopted by us on the preceding <lb/>
evening, a person was selected and commissioned to watch <lb/>
the appearance of Wiatte. The day passed as usual with <lb/>
respect to the lady. In the evening she was surrounded by <lb/>
a few friends. Into this number I was now admitted. <reg orig="Sarse-|field">Sarsefield</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="60" entity="eaf033v3_0073" pid="uva-lib:349805"/>
and myself made a part of this company. Various <lb/>
topics were discussed with ease and sprightliness. Her <reg orig="so-|cieties">societies</reg> <lb/>
were composed of both sexes, and seemed to have <lb/>
monopolized all the ingenuity and wit that existed in the <lb/>
metropolis.</p>
<p>After a slight repast the company dispersed. This <reg orig="sepa-|ration">separation</reg> <lb/>
took place earlier than usual on account of a slight <lb/>
indisposition in <hi rend="italic">Mrs. Lorimer.</hi> Sarsefield and I went out <lb/>
together. We took that opportunity of examining our agent, <lb/>
and receiving no satisfaction from him, we dismissed him, <lb/>
for that night, enjoining him to hold himself in readiness for <lb/>
repeating the experiment tomorrow. My friend directed <lb/>
his steps homeward, and I proceeded to execute a <reg orig="commis-|sion">commission</reg>, <lb/>
with which I had charged myself.</p>
<p>A few days before, a large sum had been deposited in the <lb/>
hands of a banker, for the use of my lady. It was the <lb/>
amount of a debt which had lately been recovered. It was <lb/>
lodged here for the purpose of being paid on demand of her <lb/>
or her agents. It was my present business to receive this <lb/>
money. I had deferred the performance of this engagement <lb/>
to this late hour, on account of certain preliminaries which <lb/>
were necessary to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Having received this money, I prepared to return home. <lb/>
The inquietude which had been occasioned by Sarsefield's <lb/>
intelligence, had not incapacitated me from performing my <lb/>
usual daily occupations. It was a theme, to which, at every <lb/>
interval of leisure from business or discourse, I did not fail <lb/>
to return. At those times I employed myself in examining <lb/>
the subject on all sides; in supposing particular <reg orig="emergen-|cies">emergencies</reg>, <lb/>
and delineating the conduct that was proper to be <reg orig="ob-|served">observed</reg> <lb/>
on each. My daily thoughts were, by no means, so <lb/>
fear-inspiring as the meditations of the night had been.</p>
<p>As soon as I left the banker's door, my meditations fell <lb/>
into this channel. I again reviewed the recent occurrences, <lb/>
and imagined the consequences likely to flow from them. <lb/>
My deductions were not, on this occasion, peculiarly <reg orig="dis-|tressful">distressful</reg>. <lb/>
The return of darkness had added nothing to my <lb/>
apprehensions. I regarded Wiatte merely as one against <lb/>
whose malice it was wise to employ the most vigilant <reg orig="pre-|cautions">precautions</reg>. <lb/>
In revolving these precautions nothing occurred <lb/>
that was new. The danger appeared without unusual <reg orig="ag-|gravations">aggravations</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="61" entity="eaf033v3_0074" pid="uva-lib:349806"/>
and the expedients that offered themselves to my <lb/>
choice, were viewed with a temper not more sanguine or <lb/>
despondent than before.</p>
<p>In this state of mind I began and continued my walk. <lb/>
The distance was considerable between my own habitation <lb/>
and that which I had left. My way lay chiefly through <lb/>
populous and well frequented streets. In one part of the <lb/>
way, however, it was at the option of the passenger either to <lb/>
keep along the large streets, or considerably to shorten the <lb/>
journey, by turning into a dark, crooked, and narrow lane. <lb/>
Being familiar with every part of this metropolis, and <reg orig="deem-|ing">deeming</reg> <lb/>
it advisable to take the shortest and obscurest road, I <lb/>
turned into the alley. I proceeded without interruption to <lb/>
the next turning. One night officer, distinguished by his <lb/>
usual ensigns, was the only person who passed me. I had <lb/>
gone three steps beyond when I perceived a man by my <lb/>
side. I had scarcely time to notice this circumstance, when <lb/>
a hoarse voice exclaimed. "Damn ye villain, ye're a <lb/>
dead man!"</p>
<p>At the same moment a pistol flashed at my ear, and a <reg orig="re-|port">report</reg> <lb/>
followed. This, however, produced no other effect, <lb/>
than, for a short space, to overpower my senses. I <reg orig="stag-|gered">staggered</reg> <lb/>
back, but did not fall.</p>
<p>The ball, as I afterwards discovered, had grazed my <reg orig="fore-|head">forehead</reg>, <lb/>
but without making any dangerous impression. The <lb/>
assassin, perceiving that his pistol had been ineffectual, <reg orig="mut-|tered">muttered</reg>, <lb/>
in an enraged tone,&mdash;This shall do your business&mdash; <lb/>
At the same time, he drew a knife forth from his bosom.</p>
<p>I was able to distinguish this action by the rays of a <reg orig="dis-|tant">distant</reg> <lb/>
lamp, which glistened on the blade. All this passed in <lb/>
an instant. The attack was so abrupt that my thoughts <lb/>
could not be suddenly recalled from the confusion into <lb/>
which they were thrown. My exertions were mechanical. <lb/>
My will might be said to be passive, and it was only by <lb/>
retrospect and a contemplation of consequences, that I <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
fully informed of the nature of the scene.</p>
<p>If my assailant had disappeared as soon as he had <reg orig="dis-|charged">discharged</reg> <lb/>
the pistol, my state of extreme surprise might have <lb/>
slowly given place to resolution and activity. As it was, my <lb/>
sense was no sooner struck by the reflection from the blade, <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="eaf033v3_0075" pid="uva-lib:349807"/>
than my hand, as if by spontaneous energy, was thrust into <lb/>
my pocket. I drew forth a pistol&mdash;</p>
<p>He lifted up his weapon to strike, but it dropped from <lb/>
his powerless fingers. He fell, and his groans informed me <lb/>
that I had managed my arms with more skill than my <reg orig="adver-|sary">adversary</reg>. <lb/>
The noise of this encounter soon attracted <reg orig="specta-|tors">spectators</reg>. <lb/>
Lights were brought, and my antagonist discovered <lb/>
bleeding at my feet. I explained, as briefly as I was able, <lb/>
the scene which they witnessed. The prostrate person <lb/>
was raised by two men, and carried into a public house, <lb/>
nigh at hand.</p>
<p>I had not lost my presence of mind. I, at once, <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg> <lb/>
the propriety of administering assistance to the <reg orig="wound-|ed">wounded</reg> <lb/>
man. I despatched, therefore, one of the by-standers <lb/>
for a surgeon of considerable eminence, who lived at a <lb/>
small distance, and to whom I was well known. The man <lb/>
was carried into an inner apartment and laid upon the floor. <lb/>
It was not till now that I had a suitable opportunity of <reg orig="ascer-|taining">ascertaining</reg> <lb/>
who it was with whom I had been engaged. I now <lb/>
looked upon his face. The paleness of death could not <lb/>
conceal his well known features. It was Wiatte himself who <lb/>
was breathing his last groans at my feet!&mdash;</p>
<p>The surgeon, whom I had summoned, attended; but <lb/>
immediately perceived the condition of his patient to be <lb/>
hopeless. In a quarter of an hour he expired. During <lb/>
this interval, he was insensible to all around him. I was <lb/>
known to the surgeon, the landlord, and some of the <reg orig="wit-|nesses">witnesses</reg>. <lb/>
The case needed little explanation. The accident <lb/>
reflected no guilt upon me. The landlord was charged <lb/>
with the care of the corse till the morning, and I was <reg orig="allow-|ed">allowed</reg> <lb/>
to return home, without further impediment.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Till</hi> now my mind had been swayed by the urgencies <lb/>
of this occasion. These reflections were excluded, which <lb/>
rushed tumultuously upon me, the moment I was at leisure <lb/>
to receive them. Without foresight of a previous moment <lb/>
an entire change had been wrought in my condition.</p>
<pb n="63" entity="eaf033v3_0076" pid="uva-lib:349808"/>
<p>I had been oppressed with a sense of the danger that <lb/>
flowed from the existence of this man. By what means the <lb/>
peril could be annihilated, and we be placed in security from <lb/>
his attempts, no efforts of mind could suggest. To devise <lb/>
these means, and employ them with success, demanded, as <lb/>
I conceived, the most powerful sagacity and the firmest <lb/>
courage. Now the danger was no more. The intelligence <lb/>
in which plans of mischief might be generated, was <reg orig="extin-|guished">extinguished</reg> <lb/>
or flown. Lifeless were the hands ready to execute <lb/>
the dictates of that intelligence. The contriver of enormous <lb/>
evil, was, in one moment, bereft of the power and the will <lb/>
to injure. Our past tranquillity had been owing to the belief <lb/>
of his death. Fear and dismay had resumed their dominion <lb/>
when the mistake was discovered. But now we might regain <lb/>
possession of our wonted confidence. I had beheld with <lb/>
my own eyes the lifeless corpse of our implacable adversary. <lb/>
Thus, in a moment, had terminated his long and flagitious <lb/>
career. His restless indignation, his malignant projects, <lb/>
that had so long occupied the stage, and been so fertile of <lb/>
calamity, were now at an end!</p>
<p>In the course of my meditations, the idea of the death of <lb/>
this man had occurred, and it bore the appearance of a <reg orig="desir-|able">desirable</reg> <lb/>
event. Yet it was little qualified to tranquillize my <lb/>
fears. In the long catalogue of contingencies, this, indeed, <lb/>
was to be found; but it was as little likely to happen as any <lb/>
other. It could not happen without a series of anterior <lb/>
events paving the way for it. If his death came from us, it <lb/>
must be the theme of design. It must spring from laborious <lb/>
circumvention and deep laid stratagems.</p>
<p>No. He was dead. I had killed him. What had I <lb/>
done? I had meditated nothing. I was impelled by an <lb/>
unconscious necessity. Had the assailant been my father <lb/>
the consequence would have been the same. My <reg orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg> <lb/>
had been neutral. Could it be? In a space so <lb/>
short, was it possible that so tremendous a deed had been <lb/>
executed? Was I not deceived by some portentous vision? <lb/>
I had witnessed the convulsions and last agonies of Wiatte. <lb/>
He was no more, and I was his destroyer!</p>
<p>Such was the state of my mind for some time after this <lb/>
dreadful event. Previously to it I was calm, considerate, <lb/>
and self-collected. I marked the way that I was going. <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="eaf033v3_0077" pid="uva-lib:349809"/>
Passing objects were observed. If I adverted to the series <lb/>
of my own reflections, my attention was not seized and <lb/>
fastened by them. I could disengage myself at pleasure, <lb/>
and could pass, without difficulty from attention to the <lb/>
world within, to the contemplation of that without.</p>
<p>Now my liberty, in this respect, was at an end. I was <lb/>
fettered, confounded, smitten with excess of thought, and <lb/>
laid prostrate with wonder! I no longer attended to my <lb/>
steps. When I emerged from my stupor, I found that I <lb/>
had trodden back the way which I had lately come, and had <lb/>
arrived within sight of the banker's door. I checked <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg>, <lb/>
and once more turned my steps homeward.</p>
<p>This seemed to be a hint for entering into new <reg orig="reflec-|tions">reflections</reg>. <lb/>
The deed, said I, is irretrievable. I have killed the <lb/>
brother of my patroness, the father of my love.</p>
<p>This suggestion was new. It instantly involved me in <lb/>
terror and perplexity. How shall I communicate the <reg orig="tid-|ings">tidings</reg>? <lb/>
What effect will they produce? My lady's sagacity <lb/>
is obscured by the benevolence of her temper. Her brother <lb/>
was sordidly wicked. A hoary ruffian, to whom the <reg orig="lan-|guage">language</reg> <lb/>
of pity was as unintelligible as the gabble of monkeys. <lb/>
His heart was fortified against compunction, by the atrocious <lb/>
habits of forty years; he lived only to interrupt her peace, <lb/>
to confute the promises of virtue, and convert to rancor <lb/>
and reproach the fair fame of fidelity.</p>
<p>He was her brother still. As a human being, his <reg orig="de-|pravity">depravity</reg> <lb/>
was never beyond the health-restoring power of <lb/>
repentance. His heart, so long as it beat, was accessible <lb/>
to remorse. The singularity of his birth had made her <lb/>
regard this being as more intimately her brother, than would <lb/>
have happened in different circumstances. It was her <reg orig="ob-|stinate">obstinate</reg> <lb/>
persuasion that their fates were blended. The <lb/>
rumor of his death she had never credited. It was a topic <lb/>
of congratulation to her friends, but of mourning and <reg orig="dis-|tress">distress</reg> <lb/>
to her. That he would one day reappear upon the <lb/>
stage, and assume the dignity of virtue, was a source of <lb/>
consolation with which she would never consent to part.</p>
<p>Her character was now known. When the doom of <lb/>
exile was pronounced upon him, she deemed it incumbent <lb/>
on her to vindicate herself from aspersions founded on <reg orig="mis-|conceptions">misconceptions</reg> <lb/>
of her motives in refusing her interference. <lb/>
<pb n="65" entity="eaf033v3_0078" pid="uva-lib:349810"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">7</fw></pb>
The manuscript, though unpublished, was widely circulated. <lb/>
None could resist her simple and touching eloquence, nor <lb/>
rise from the perusal without resigning his heart to the most <lb/>
impetuous impulses of admiration, and enlisting himself <lb/>
a mong the eulogists of her justice and her fortitude. This <lb/>
was the only monument, in a written form, of her genius. <lb/>
As such it was engraven on my memory. The picture that <lb/>
it described was the perpetual companion of my thoughts.</p>
<p>Alas! It had, perhaps, been well for me if it had been <lb/>
buried in eternal oblivion. I read in it the condemnation <lb/>
of my deed, the agonies she was preparing to suffer, and the <lb/>
indignation that would overflow upon the author of so signal <lb/>
a calamity.</p>
<p>I had rescued my life by the sacrifice of his. Whereas <lb/>
I should have died. Wretched and precipitate coward! <lb/>
What had become of my boasted gratitude? Such was the <lb/>
zeal that I had vowed to her. Such the services which it <lb/>
was the business of my life to perform. I had snatched her <lb/>
brother from existence. I had torn from her the hope which <lb/>
she so ardently and indefatigably cherished. From a <reg orig="con-|temptible">contemptible</reg> <lb/>
and dastardly regard to my own safety I had failed <lb/>
in the moment of trial, and when called upon by heaven to <lb/>
evince the sincerity of my professions.</p>
<p>She had treated my professions lightly. My vows of <lb/>
eternal devotion she had rejected with lofty disinterestedness. <lb/>
She had arraigned my impatience of obligation as criminal, <lb/>
and condemned every scheme I had projected for freeing <lb/>
myself from the burthen which her beneficence had laid <lb/>
upon me. The impassioned and vehement anxiety with <lb/>
which, in former days, she had deprecated the <reg orig="ven-|geance">vengeance</reg> <lb/>
of her lover against Wiatte, rung in my ears. My <lb/>
senses were shocked anew by the dreadful sounds, "Touch <lb/>
not my brother. Wherever you meet with him, of <reg orig="what-|ever">whatever</reg> <lb/>
outrage he be guilty, suffer him to pass in safety. <reg orig="De-|spise">Despise</reg> <lb/>
me; abandon me; kill me. All this I can bear even from <lb/>
you, but spare, I implore you, my unhappy brother. The <lb/>
stroke that deprives him of life will not only have the same <lb/>
effect upon me, but will set my portion in everlasting misery."</p>
<p>To these supplications I had been deaf. It is true I had <lb/>
not rushed upon him unarmed, intending no injury nor <reg orig="ex-|pecting">expecting</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="eaf033v3_0079" pid="uva-lib:349811"/>
any. Of that degree of wickedness I was, perhaps, <lb/>
incapable. Alas! I have immersed myself sufficiently deep <lb/>
in crimes. I have trampled under foot every motive dear <lb/>
to the heart of honor. I have shewn myself unworthy the <lb/>
society of men.</p>
<p>Such were the turbulent suggestions of that moment. My <lb/>
pace slackened. I stopped and was obliged to support <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg> <lb/>
against a wall. The sickness that had seized my heart <lb/>
penetrated every part of my frame. There was but one <lb/>
thing wanting to complete my distraction.&mdash;My lady, said I, <lb/>
believed her fate to be blended with that of Wiatte. Who <lb/>
shall affirm that the persuasion is a groundless one. She had <lb/>
lived and prospered, notwithstanding the general belief that <lb/>
her brother was dead. She would not hearken to the rumor. <lb/>
Why? Because nothing less than indubitable evidence would <lb/>
suffice to convince her? Because the counter-intimation <lb/>
flowed from an infallible source? How can the latter <reg orig="sup-|position">supposition</reg> <lb/>
be confuted? Has she not predicted the event?</p>
<p>The period of terrible fulfilment has arrived. The same <lb/>
blow that bereaved <hi rend="italic">him</hi> of life, has likewise ratified her doom.</p>
<p>She has been deceived. It is nothing more, perhaps, <lb/>
than a fond imagination.&mdash;It matters not. Who knows not <lb/>
the cogency of faith? That the pulses of life are at the <lb/>
command of the will? The bearer of these tidings will be <lb/>
the messenger of death. A fatal sympathy will seize bet. <lb/>
She will shrink, and swoon, and perish at the news!</p>
<p>Fond and short-sighted wretch! This is the price thoe <lb/>
hast given for security. In the rashness of thy thought thoe <lb/>
said'st, nothing is wanting but his death to restore us to <lb/>
confidence and safety. Lo! the purchase is made. <reg orig="Ha-|voc">Havoc</reg> <lb/>
and despair, that were restrained during his life, were <lb/>
let loose by his last sigh. Now only is destruction made <lb/>
sure. Thy lady, thy Clarice, thy friend, and thyself, are, <lb/>
by this act, involved in irretrievable and common ruin!</p>
<p>I started from my attitude. I was scarcely conscious of <lb/>
any transition. The interval was fraught with stupor and <lb/>
amazement. It seemed as if my senses had been hushed <lb/>
in sleep, while the powers of locomotion were <reg orig="uncon-|sciously">unconsciously</reg> <lb/>
exerted to bear me to my chamber. By whatever <lb/>
means the change was effected, there I was.</p>
<p>I have been able to proceed thus far. I can scarcely <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="eaf033v3_0080" pid="uva-lib:349812"/>
believe the testimony of my memory that assures me of this. <lb/>
My task is almost executed, but whence shall I obtain <lb/>
strength enough to finish it? What I have told is light as <lb/>
gossamer, compared with the insupportable and crushing <lb/>
horrors of that which is to come. Heaven, in token of its <lb/>
vengeance, will enable me to proceed. It is fitting that my <lb/>
scene should thus close.</p>
<p>My fancy began to be infected with the errors of my <reg orig="un-|derstanding">understanding</reg>. <lb/>
The mood into which my mind was plunged <lb/>
was incapable of any propitious intermission. All within <lb/>
me was tempestuous and dark. My ears were accessible <lb/>
to no sounds but those of shrieks and lamentations. It was <lb/>
deepest midnight, and all the noises of a great metropolis <lb/>
were hushed. Yet I listened as if to catch some strain of <lb/>
the dirge that was begun. Sable robes, sobs and a dreary <lb/>
solemnity encompassed me on all sides. I was haunted to <lb/>
despair by images of death, imaginary clamors, and the <lb/>
train of funeral pageantry. I seemed to have passed <reg orig="for-|wards">forwards</reg> <lb/>
to a distant era of my life. The effects which were <lb/>
come were already realized. The foresight of misery <lb/>
created it, and set me in the midst of that hell which I <lb/>
feared.</p>
<p>From a paroxysm like this the worst might reasonably be <lb/>
dreaded, yet the next step to destruction was not suddenly <lb/>
taken. I paused on the brink of the precipice, as if to <reg orig="sur-|vey">survey</reg> <lb/>
the depth of that phrenzy that invaded me; was able to <lb/>
ponder on the scene, and deliberate, in a state that partook <lb/>
of calm, on the circumstances of my situation. My mind <lb/>
was harassed by the repetition of one idea. Conjecture <lb/>
deepened into certainty. I could place the object in no <lb/>
light which did not corroborate the persuasion that, in the <lb/>
act committed, I had insured the destruction of my lady. <lb/>
At length my mind, somewhat relieved from the tempest of <lb/>
my fears, began to trace and analyse the consequences <lb/>
which I dreaded.</p>
<p>The fate of Wiatte would inevitably draw along with it <lb/>
that of his sister. In what way would this effect be <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg>? <lb/>
Were they linked together by a sympathy whose <lb/>
influence was independent of sensible communication? <lb/>
Could she arrive at a knowledge of his miserable end by <lb/>
other than verbal means? I had heard of such <reg orig="extraordi-|nary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="68" entity="eaf033v3_0081" pid="uva-lib:349813"/>
copartnerships in being and modes of instantaneous <lb/>
intercourse among beings locally distant. Was this a new <lb/>
instance of the subtlety of mind? Had she already <reg orig="en-|dured">endured</reg> <lb/>
his agonies, and like him already ceased to breathe?</p>
<p>Every hair bristled at this horrible suggestion. But the <lb/>
force of sympathy might be chimerical. Buried in sleep, <lb/>
or engaged in careless meditation, the instrument by which <lb/>
her destiny might be accomplished, was the steel of an <reg orig="as-|sassin">assassin</reg>. <lb/>
A series of events, equally beyond the reach of <lb/>
foresight, with those which had just happened, might <reg orig="intro-|duce">introduce</reg>, <lb/>
with equal abruptness, a similar disaster. What, at <lb/>
that moment, was her condition? Reposing in safety in <lb/>
her chamber, as her family imagined. But were they not <lb/>
deceived? Was she not a mangled corse? Whatever <lb/>
were her situation, it could not be ascertained, except by <lb/>
extraordinary means, till the morning. Was it wise to defer <lb/>
the scrutiny till then? Why not instantly investigate the <lb/>
truth?</p>
<p>These ideas passed rapidly through my mind. A <reg orig="con-|siderable">considerable</reg> <lb/>
portion of time and amplification of phrase are <lb/>
necessary to exhibit, verbally, ideas contemplated in a space <lb/>
of incalculable brevity. With the same rapidity I conceived <lb/>
the resolution of determining the truth of my suspicions. <lb/>
All the family, but myself, were at rest. Winding passages <lb/>
would conduct me, without danger of disturbing them, to <lb/>
the hall, from which double staircases ascended. One of <lb/>
these led to a saloon above, on the east side of which was a <lb/>
door that communicated with a suit of rooms, occupied by <lb/>
the lady of the mansion. The first was an antichamber, in <lb/>
which a female servant usually lay. The second was the <lb/>
lady's own bed-chamber. This was a sacred recess, with <lb/>
whose situation, relative to the other apartments of the <lb/>
building, I was well acquainted, but of which I knew nothing <lb/>
from my own examination, having never been admitted <lb/>
into it.</p>
<p>Thither I was now resolved to repair. I was not deterred <lb/>
by the sanctity of the place and hour. I was insensible to <lb/>
all consequences but the removal of my doubts. Not that <lb/>
my hopes were balanced by my fears. That the same <reg orig="tra-|gedy">tragedy</reg> <lb/>
had been performed in her chamber and in the street, <lb/>
nothing hindered me from believing with as much cogency <lb/>
<pb n="69" entity="eaf033v3_0082" pid="uva-lib:349814"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">7*</fw></pb>
as if my own eyes had witnessed it, but the reluctance with <lb/>
which we admit a detestable truth.</p>
<p>To terminate a state of intolerable suspense, I resolved <lb/>
to proceed forthwith to her chamber. I took the light and <lb/>
paced, with no interruption, along the galleries. I used no <lb/>
precaution. If I had met a servant or robber, I am not <lb/>
sure that I should have noticed him. My attention was too <lb/>
perfectly engrossed to allow me to spare any to a casual <lb/>
object. I cannot affirm that no one observed me. This, <lb/>
however, was probable from the distribution of the dwelling. <lb/>
It consisted of a central edifice and two wings, one of which <lb/>
was appropriated to domestics, and the other, at the <reg orig="extre-|mity">extremity</reg> <lb/>
of which my apartment was placed, comprehended a <lb/>
library, and rooms for formal, and social, and literary <reg orig="con-|ferences">conferences</reg>. <lb/>
These, therefore, were deserted at night, and my <lb/>
way lay along these. Hence it was not likely that my steps <lb/>
would be observed.</p>
<p>I proceeded to the hall. The principal parlor was <reg orig="be-|neath">beneath</reg> <lb/>
her chamber. In the confusion of my thoughts, I <lb/>
mistook one for the other. I rectified, as soon as I <reg orig="detect-|ed">detected</reg> <lb/>
my mistake. I ascended, with a beating heart, the <lb/>
staircase. The door of the antichamber was unfastened. <lb/>
I entered, totally regardless of disturbing the girl who slept <lb/>
within. The bed which she occupied was concealed by <lb/>
curtains. Whether she were there, I did not stop to <reg orig="exa-|mine">examine</reg>. <lb/>
I cannot recollect that any tokens were given of <lb/>
wakefulness or alarm. It was not till I reached the door of <lb/>
her own apartment that my heart began to falter.</p>
<p>It was now that the momentousness of the question I was <lb/>
about to decide, rushed with its genuine force, upon my <lb/>
apprehension. Appalled and aghast, I had scarcely power <lb/>
to move the bolt. If the imagination of her death was not <lb/>
to be supported, how should I bear the spectacle of wounds <lb/>
and blood? Yet this was reserved for me. A few paces <lb/>
would set me in the midst of a scene, of which I was the <lb/>
abhorred contriver. Was it right to proceed? There <lb/>
were still the remnants of doubt. My forebodings might <lb/>
possibly be groundless. All within might be safety and <lb/>
serenity. A respite might be gained from the execution of <lb/>
an irrevocable sentence. What could I do? Was not any <lb/>
<pb n="70" entity="eaf033v3_0083" pid="uva-lib:349815"/>
thing easy to endure in comparison with the agonies of <reg orig="sus-|pense">suspense</reg>? <lb/>
If I could not obviate the evil I must bear it, but <lb/>
the torments of suspense were susceptible of remedy.</p>
<p>I drew back the bolt, and entered with the reluctance of <lb/>
fear, rather than the cautiousness of guilt. I could not lift <lb/>
my eyes from the ground. I advanced to the middle of <lb/>
the room. Not a sound like that of the dying saluted my <lb/>
ear. At length, shaking off the fetters of hopelessness, I <lb/>
looked up.</p>
<p>I saw nothing calculated to confirm my fears. Every <lb/>
where there reigned quiet and order. My heart leaped <lb/>
with exultation. Can it be, said I, that I have been betrayed <lb/>
with shadows?&mdash;But this is not sufficient.</p>
<p>Within an alcove was the bed that belonged to her. If <lb/>
her safety were inviolate, it was here that she reposed. <lb/>
What remained to convert tormenting doubt into ravishing <lb/>
certainty? I was insensible to the perils of my present <lb/>
situation. If she, indeed, were there, would not my <reg orig="intru-|sion">intrusion</reg> <lb/>
awaken her? She would start and perceive me, at <lb/>
this hour, standing at her bedside. How should I account <lb/>
for an intrusion so unexampled and audacious? I could <lb/>
not communicate my fears. I could not tell her that the <lb/>
blood with which my hands were stained had flowed from <lb/>
the wounds of her brother.</p>
<p>My mind was inaccessible to such considerations. They <lb/>
did not even modify my predominant idea. Obstacles like <lb/>
these, had they existed, would have been trampled under <lb/>
foot.</p>
<p>Leaving the lamp, that I bore, on the table, I approached <lb/>
the bed. I slowly drew aside the curtain, and beheld her <lb/>
tranquilly slumbering. I listened, but so profound was her <lb/>
sleep, that not even her breathings could be overheard. I <lb/>
dropped the curtain and retired.</p>
<p>How blissful and mild were the illuminations of my bosom <lb/>
at this discovery. A joy that surpassed all utterance <reg orig="suc-|ceeded">succeeded</reg> <lb/>
the fierceness of desperation. I stood, for some <lb/>
moments, wrapt in delightful contemplation. Alas! it was <lb/>
a luminous but transient interval. The madness, to whose <lb/>
black suggestions it bore so strong a contrast, began now to <lb/>
make sensible approaches on my understanding.</p>
<pb n="71" entity="eaf033v3_0084" pid="uva-lib:349816"/>
<p>True, said I, she lives. Her slumber is serene and <lb/>
happy. She is blind to her approaching destiny. Some <lb/>
hours will at least be rescued from anguish and death. <lb/>
When she wakes the phantom that soothed her will vanish. <lb/>
The tidings cannot be withheld from her. The murderer <lb/>
of thy brother cannot hope to enjoy thy smiles. Those <lb/>
ravishing accents, with which thou hast used to greet me, <lb/>
will be changed. Scowling and reproaches, the invectives <lb/>
of thy anger and the maledictions of thy justice will rest <lb/>
upon my head.</p>
<p>What is the blessing which I made the theme of my <lb/>
boastful arrogance? This interval of being and repose is <lb/>
momentary. She will awake but only to perish at the <reg orig="spec-|tacle">spectacle</reg> <lb/>
of my ingratitude. She will awake only to the <reg orig="con-|sciousness">consciousness</reg> <lb/>
of instantly impending death. When she again <lb/>
sleeps she will wake no more. I, her son, I, whom the law <lb/>
of my birth doomed to poverty and hardship, but whom her <lb/>
unsolicited beneficence snatched from those evils, and <reg orig="en-|dowed">endowed</reg> <lb/>
with the highest good known to intelligent beings, <lb/>
the consolations of science and the blandishments of <reg orig="afflu-|ence">affluence</reg>; <lb/>
to whom the darling of her life, the offspring in whom <lb/>
are faithfully preserved the lineaments of its angelic mother, <lb/>
she has not denied!&mdash;What is the recompense that I have <lb/>
made? How have I discharged the measureless debt of <lb/>
gratitude to which she is entitled? Thus!&mdash;</p>
<p>Cannot my guilt be extenuated? Is there not a good <lb/>
that I can do thee? Must I perpetrate unmingled evil? <lb/>
Is the province assigned me that of an infernal emissary, <lb/>
whose efforts are concentred in a single purpose and that <lb/>
purpose a malignant one? I am the author of thy <reg orig="calami-|ties">calamities</reg>. <lb/>
Whatever misery is reserved for thee, I am the source <lb/>
whence it flows. Can I not set bounds to the stream? <reg orig="Can-|not">Cannot</reg> <lb/>
I prevent thee from returning to a consciousness, which, <lb/>
till it ceases to exist, will not cease to be rent and mangled?</p>
<p>Yes. It is in my power to screen thee from the coming <lb/>
storm; to accelerate thy journey to rest; I will do it.&mdash;</p>
<p>The impulse was not to be resisted. I moved with the <lb/>
suddenness of lightning. Armed with a pointed implement <lb/>
that lay&mdash;it was a dagger. As I set down the lamp, I struck <lb/>
the edge. Yet I saw it not, or noticed it not till I needed <lb/>
its assistance. By what accident it came hither, to what <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="eaf033v3_0085" pid="uva-lib:349817"/>
deed of darkness it had already been subservient, I had no <lb/>
power to inquire. I stepped to the table and seized it.</p>
<p>The time which this action required was insufficient to <lb/>
save me. My doom was ratified by powers which no <reg orig="hu-|man">human</reg> <lb/>
energies can counterwork.&mdash;Need I go farther? Did <lb/>
you entertain any imagination of so frightful a catastrophe? <lb/>
I am overwhelmed by turns with dismay and with wonder. <lb/>
I am prompted by turns to tear my heart from my breast, <lb/>
and deny faith to the verdict of my senses.</p>
<p>Was it I that hurried to the deed? No. It was the <lb/>
demon that possessed me. My limbs were guided to the <lb/>
bloody office by a power foreign and superior to mine. I <lb/>
had been defrauded, for a moment, of the empire of my <lb/>
muscles. A little moment for that sufficed.</p>
<p>If my destruction had not been decreed why was the <reg orig="im-|age">image</reg> <lb/>
of Clarice so long excluded? Yet why do I say long? <lb/>
The fatal resolution was conceived, and I hastened to the <lb/>
execution, in a period too brief for more than itself to be <lb/>
viewed by the intellect.</p>
<p>What then? Were my hands imbrued in this precious <lb/>
blood? Was it to this extremity of horror that my evil <lb/>
genius was determined to urge me? Too surely this was <lb/>
his purpose; too surely I was qualified to be its minister.</p>
<p>I lifted the weapon. Its point was aimed at the bosom of <lb/>
the sleeper. The impulse was given.</p>
<p>At the instant a piercing shriek was uttered behind me, <lb/>
and a stretched-out hand, grasping the blade, made it swerve <lb/>
widely from its aim. It descended, but without inflicting a <lb/>
wound. Its force was spent upon the bed.</p>
<p>O! for words to paint that stormy transition! I loosed <lb/>
my hold of the dagger. I started back, and fixed eyes of <lb/>
frantic curiosity on the author of my rescue. He that <reg orig="inter-|posed">interposed</reg> <lb/>
to arrest my deed, that started into being and activity <lb/>
at a moment so pregnant with fate, without tokens of his <lb/>
purpose or his coming being previously imparted, could not, <lb/>
methought, be less than divinity.</p>
<p>The first glance that I darted on this being corroborated <lb/>
my conjecture. It was the figure and lineaments of Mrs. <lb/>
Lorimer. Negligently habited in flowing and brilliant white, <lb/>
with features bursting with terror and wonder, the likeness <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="eaf033v3_0086" pid="uva-lib:349818"/>
of that being who was stretched upon the bed, now stood <lb/>
before me.</p>
<p>All that I am able to conceive of angel was comprised in <lb/>
the moral constitution of this woman. That her genius had <lb/>
overleaped all bounds, and interposed to save her, was no <lb/>
audacious imagination. In the state in which my mind then <lb/>
was no other belief than this could occupy the first place.</p>
<p>My tongue was tied. I gazed by turns upon her who <lb/>
stood before me, and her who lay upon the bed, and who, <lb/>
awakened by the shriek that had been uttered, now opened <lb/>
her eyes. She started from her pillow, and, by assuming a <lb/>
new and more distinct attitude, permitted me to recognize <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Clarice herself!</hi></p>
<p>Three days before, I had left her, beside the bed of a <lb/>
dying friend, at a solitary mansion in the mountains of <reg orig="Don-|negal">Donnegal</reg>. <lb/>
Here it had been her resolution to remain till her <lb/>
friend should breathe her last. Fraught with this <reg orig="persua-|sion">persuasion</reg>; <lb/>
knowing this to be the place and hour of repose of <lb/>
my lady, hurried forward by the impetuosity of my own <reg orig="con-|ceptions">conceptions</reg>, <lb/>
deceived by the faint gleam which penetrated <lb/>
through the curtain and imperfectly irradiated features which <lb/>
bore, at all times, a powerful resemblance to those of Mrs. <lb/>
Lorimer, I had rushed to the brink of this terrible precipice!</p>
<p>Why did I linger on the verge? Why, thus perilously <lb/>
situated, did I not throw myself headlong? The steel was <lb/>
yet in my hand. A single blow would have pierced my <lb/>
heart, and shut out from my remembrance and foresight the <lb/>
past and the future.</p>
<p>The moment of insanity had gone by, and I was once <lb/>
more myself. Instead of regarding the act which I had <lb/>
meditated as the dictate of compassion or of justice, it only <lb/>
added to the sum of my ingratitude, and gave wings to the <lb/>
whirlwind that was sent to bear me to perdition.</p>
<p>Perhaps I was influenced by a sentiment which I had not <lb/>
leisure to distribute into parts. My understanding was, no <lb/>
doubt, bewildered in the maze of consequences which would <lb/>
spring from my act. How should I explain my coming <lb/>
hither in this murderous guise, my arm lifted to destroy the <lb/>
idol of my soul, and the darling child of my patroness? In <lb/>
what words should I unfold the tale of Wiatte, and <reg orig="enume-|rate">enumerate</reg> <lb/>
the motives that terminated in the present scene? What <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="eaf033v3_0087" pid="uva-lib:349819"/>
penalty had not my infatuation and cruelty deserved? What <lb/>
could I less than turn the dagger's point against my own <reg orig="bo-|som">bosom</reg>?</p>
<p>A second time, the blow was thwarted and diverted. <lb/>
Once more this beneficent interposer held my arm from the <lb/>
perpetration of a new iniquity. Once more frustrated the <lb/>
instigations of that demon, of whose malice a mysterious <lb/>
destiny had consigned me to be the sport and the prey.</p>
<p>Every new moment added to the sum of my inexpiable <lb/>
guilt. Murder was succeeded, in an instant, by the more <lb/>
detestable enormity of suicide. She, to whom my <reg orig="ingrati-|tude">ingratitude</reg> <lb/>
was flagrant in proportion to the benefits of which she <lb/>
was the author, had now added to her former acts, that of <lb/>
rescuing me from the last of mischiefs.</p>
<p>I threw the weapon on the floor. The zeal which <lb/>
prompted her to seize my arm, this action occasioned to <lb/>
subside, and to yield place to those emotions which this <lb/>
spectacle was calculated to excite. She watched me in <reg orig="si-|lence">silence</reg>, <lb/>
and with an air of ineffable solicitude. Clarice, <reg orig="gov-|erned">governed</reg> <lb/>
by the instinct of modesty, wrapt her bosom and face <lb/>
in the bed-clothes, and testified her horror by vehement, but <lb/>
scarcely articulate exclamations.</p>
<p>I moved forward, but my steps were random and <reg orig="totter-|ing">tottering</reg>. <lb/>
My thoughts were fettered by reverie, and my <reg orig="gesti-|culations">gesticulations</reg> <lb/>
destitute of meaning. My tongue faltered without <lb/>
speaking, and I felt as if life and death were struggling within <lb/>
me for the mastery.</p>
<p>My will, indeed, was far from being neutral in this <reg orig="con-|test">contest</reg>. <lb/>
To such as I, annihilation is the supreme good. To <lb/>
shake off the ills that fasten on us by shaking off existence, is <lb/>
a lot which the system of nature has denied to man. By <lb/>
escaping from life, I should be delivered from this scene, but <lb/>
should only rush into a world of retribution, and be immersed <lb/>
in new agonies.</p>
<p>I was yet to live. No instrument of my deliverance was <lb/>
within reach. I was powerless. To rush from the <reg orig="pre-|sence">presence</reg> <lb/>
of these women, to hide me forever from their <reg orig="scruti-|ny">scrutiny</reg>, <lb/>
and their upbraiding, to snatch from their minds all traces <lb/>
of the existence of Clithero, was the scope of unutterable <lb/>
longings.</p>
<p>Urged to flight by every motive of which my nature was <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="eaf033v3_0088" pid="uva-lib:349820"/>
susceptible, I was yet rooted to the spot. Had the pause <lb/>
been only to be interrupted by me, it would have lasted <reg orig="for-|ever">forever</reg>.</p>
<p>At length, the lady, clasping her hands and lifting them, <lb/>
exclaimed, in a tone melting into pity and grief;</p>
<p>Clithero! what is this? How came you hither and <lb/>
why?</p>
<p>I struggled for utterance; I came to murder you. Your <lb/>
brother has perished by my hands. Fresh from the <reg orig="com-|mission">commission</reg> <lb/>
of this deed, I have hastened hither, to perpetrate <lb/>
the same crime upon you.</p>
<p>My brother! replied the lady, with new vehemence, O! <lb/>
say not so! I have just heard of his return, from Sarsefield, <lb/>
and that he lives.</p>
<p>He is dead, repeated I, with fierceness; I know it. It <lb/>
was I that killed him.</p>
<p>Dead! she faintly articulated, And by thee, Clithero? <lb/>
O! cursed chance that hindered thee from killing me also! <lb/>
Dead! Then is the omen fulfilled! Then am I undone! <lb/>
Lost forever!</p>
<p>Her eyes now wandered from me, and her countenance <lb/>
sunk into a wild and rueful expression. Hope was utterly <lb/>
extinguished in her heart, and life forsook her at the same <lb/>
moment. She sunk upon the floor pallid and breathless.</p>
<p>How she came into possession of this knowledge I know <lb/>
not. It is possible that Sarsefield had repented of <reg orig="conceal-|ment">concealment</reg>, <lb/>
and, in the interval that passed between our separation <lb/>
and my encounter with Wiatte, had returned, and informed <lb/>
her of the reappearance of this miscreant.</p>
<p>Thus then was my fate consummated. I was rescued <lb/>
from destroying her by a dagger, only to behold her perish <lb/>
by the tidings which I brought. Thus was every omen of <lb/>
mischief and misery fulfilled. Thus was the enmity of <lb/>
Wiatte, rendered efficacious, and the instrument of his <reg orig="de-|struction">destruction</reg>, <lb/>
changed into the executioner of his revenge.</p>
<p>Such is the tale of my crimes. It is not for me to hope <lb/>
that the curtain of oblivion will ever shut out the dismal <lb/>
spectacle. It will haunt me forever. The torments that <lb/>
grow out of it, can terminate only with the thread of my <lb/>
existence, but that I know full well will never end. Death <lb/>
is but a shifting of the scene, and the endless progress of <lb/>
<pb n="76" entity="eaf033v3_0089" pid="uva-lib:349821"/>
eternity, which, to the good, is merely the perfection of <reg orig="feli-|city">felicity</reg>, <lb/>
is, to the wicked, an accumulation of wo. The self <lb/>
destroyer is his own enemy, this has ever been my opinion. <lb/>
Hitherto it has influenced my actions. Now, though the <lb/>
belief continues, its influence on my conduct is annihilated. <lb/>
I am no stranger to the depth of that abyss, into which I <lb/>
shall plunge. No matter. Change is precious for its own <lb/>
sake.</p>
<p>Well; I was still to live. My abode must be somewhere <lb/>
fixed. My conduct was henceforth the result of a perverse <lb/>
and rebellious principle. I banished myself forever from <lb/>
my native soil. I vowed never more to behold the face of <lb/>
my Clarice, to abandon my friends, my books, all my <lb/>
wonted labors, and accustomed recreations.</p>
<p>I was neither ashamed nor afraid. I considered not in <lb/>
what way the justice of the country would affect me. It <lb/>
merely made no part of my contemplations. I was not <lb/>
embarrassed by the choice of expedients, for trammeling up <lb/>
the visible consequences and for eluding suspicion. The <lb/>
idea of abjuring my country, and flying forever from the <lb/>
hateful scene, partook, to my apprehension, of the vast, the <lb/>
boundless, and strange; of plunging from the height of <reg orig="for-|tune">fortune</reg> <lb/>
to obscurity and indigence, corresponded with my <lb/>
present state of mind. It was of a piece with the <reg orig="tremen-|dous">tremendous</reg> <lb/>
and wonderful events that had just happened.</p>
<p>These were the images that haunted me, while I stood <lb/>
speechlessly gazing at the ruin before me. I heard a noise <lb/>
from without, or imagined that I heard it. My reverie was <lb/>
broken, and my muscular power restored. I descended <lb/>
into the street, through doors of which I possessed one set <lb/>
of keys, and hurried by the shortest way beyond the <reg orig="pre-|cincts">precincts</reg> <lb/>
of the city. I had laid no plan. My conceptions, <lb/>
with regard to the future, were shapeless and confused. <lb/>
Successive incidents supplied me with a clue, and suggested, <lb/>
as they rose, the next step to be taken.</p>
<p>I threw off the garb of affluence, and assumed a beggar's <lb/>
attire. That I had money about me for the accomplishment <lb/>
of my purposes was wholly accidental. I travelled along <lb/>
the coast, and when I arrived at one town, knew not why I <lb/>
should go further; but my restlessness was unabated, and <lb/>
change was some relief. I at length arrived at Belfast. A <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="eaf033v3_0090" pid="uva-lib:349822"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">8</fw></pb>
vessel was preparing for America. I embraced eagerly <lb/>
the opportunity of passing into a new world. I arrived at <lb/>
Philadelphia. As soon as I landed I wandered hither, and <lb/>
was content to wear out my few remaining days in the <reg orig="ser-|vice">service</reg> <lb/>
of Inglefield.</p>
<p>I have no friends. Why should I trust my story to another? <lb/>
I have no solicitude about concealment; but who is there <lb/>
who will derive pleasure or benefit from my rehearsal? <lb/>
And why should I expatiate on so hateful a theme? Yet <lb/>
now have I consented to this. I have confided in you the <lb/>
history of my disasters. I am not fearful of the use that you <lb/>
may be disposed to make of it. I shall quickly set myself <lb/>
beyond the reach of human tribunals. I shall relieve the <lb/>
ministers of law from the trouble of punishing. The recent <lb/>
events which induced you to summon me to this conference, <lb/>
have likewise determined me to make this disclosure.</p>
<p>I was not aware, for some time, of my perturbed sleep. <lb/>
No wonder that sleep cannot sooth miseries like mine; that <lb/>
I am alike infested by memory in wakefulness and slumber. <lb/>
Yet I was anew distressed at the discovery that my thoughts <lb/>
found their way to my lips, without my being conscious of it, <lb/>
and that my steps wandered forth unknowingly and without <lb/>
the guidance of my will.</p>
<p>The story you have told is not incredible. The disaster <lb/>
to which you allude did not fail to excite my regret. I can <lb/>
still weep over the untimely fall of youth and worth. I can <lb/>
no otherwise account for my frequenting this shade than by <lb/>
the distant resemblance which the death of this man bore to <lb/>
that of which I was the perpetrator. This resemblance <lb/>
occurred to me at first. If time were able to weaken the <lb/>
impression which was produced by my crime, this similitude <lb/>
was adapted to revive and enforce them.</p>
<p>The wilderness, and the cave to which you followed me, <lb/>
were familiar to my Sunday rambles. Often have I indulged <lb/>
in audible griefs on the cliffs of that valley. Often have I <lb/>
brooded over my sorrows in the recesses of that cavern. <lb/>
This scene is adapted to my temper. Its mountainous <reg orig="as-|perities">asperities</reg> <lb/>
supply me with images of desolation and seclusion, <lb/>
and its headlong streams lull me into temporary forgetfulness <lb/>
of mankind.</p>
<pb n="78" entity="eaf033v3_0091" pid="uva-lib:349823"/>
<p>I comprehend you. You suspect me of concern in the <lb/>
death of Waldegrave. You could not do otherwise. The <lb/>
conduct that you have witnessed was that of a murderer. I <lb/>
will not upbraid you for your suspicions, though I have <lb/>
bought exemption from them at a high price.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">There</hi> ended his narrative. He started from the spot <lb/>
where he stood, and, without affording me any opportunity <lb/>
of replying or commenting, disappeared amidst the thickest <lb/>
of the wood. I had no time to exert myself for his detention. <lb/>
I could have used no arguments for this end, to which it is <lb/>
probable he would have listened. The story I had heard was <lb/>
too extraordinary, too completely the reverse of all my <reg orig="ex-|pectations">expectations</reg>, <lb/>
to allow me to attend to the intimations of self <lb/>
murder which he dropped.</p>
<p>The secret, which I imagined was about to be disclosed, <lb/>
was as inscrutable as ever. Not a circumstance, from the <lb/>
moment when Clithero's character became the subject of my <lb/>
meditations, till the conclusion of his tale, but served to <reg orig="con-|firm">confirm</reg> <lb/>
my suspicion. Was this error to be imputed to <reg orig="credu-|lity">credulity</reg>? <lb/>
Would not any one, from similar appearances, have <lb/>
drawn similar conclusions? Or is there a criterion by which <lb/>
truth can always be distinguished. Was it owing to my <reg orig="im-|perfect">imperfect</reg> <lb/>
education that the inquietudes of this man were not <lb/>
traced to a deed performed at the distance of a thousand <lb/>
leagues, to the murder of his patroness and friend?</p>
<p>I had heard a tale which apparently related to scenes and <lb/>
persons far distant, but though my suspicions have appeared <lb/>
to have been misplaced, what should hinder but that the <lb/>
death of my friend was, in like manner, an act of momentary <lb/>
insanity and originated in a like spirit of mistaken <reg orig="benevo-|lence">benevolence</reg>?</p>
<p>But I did not consider this tale merely in relation to <lb/>
myself. My life had been limited and uniform. I had <lb/>
communed with romancers and historians, but the impression <lb/>
made upon me by this incident was unexampled in my <reg orig="ex-|perience">experience</reg>. <lb/>
My reading had furnished me with no instance, <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="eaf033v3_0092" pid="uva-lib:349824"/>
in any degree, parallel to this, and I found that to be a <reg orig="dis-|tant">distant</reg> <lb/>
and second hand spectator of events was widely different <lb/>
from witnessing them myself, and partaking in their <reg orig="conse-|quences">consequences</reg>. <lb/>
My judgment was, for a time, sunk into imbecility <lb/>
and confusion. My mind was full of the images unavoidably <lb/>
suggested by this tale, but they existed in a kind of chaos, <lb/>
and not otherwise, than gradually, was I able to reduce them <lb/>
to distinct particulars, and subject them to a deliberate and <lb/>
methodical inspection.</p>
<p>How was I to consider this act of Clithero? What a <lb/>
deplorable infatuation! Yet it was the necessary result of a <lb/>
series of ideas mutually linked and connected. His <reg orig="con-|duct">conduct</reg> <lb/>
was dictated by a motive allied to virtue. It was the <lb/>
fruit of an ardent and grateful spirit.</p>
<p>The death of Wiatte could not be censured. The life <lb/>
of Clithero was unspeakably more valuable than that of his <lb/>
antagonist. It was the instinct of self-preservation that <reg orig="sway-|ed">swayed</reg> <lb/>
him. He knew not his adversary in time enough, to <lb/>
govern himself by that knowledge. Had the assailant been <lb/>
an unknown ruffian, his death would have been followed by <lb/>
no remorse. The spectacle of his dying agonies would <lb/>
have dwelt upon the memory of his assassin like any other <lb/>
mournful sight, in the production of which he bore no part.</p>
<p>It must at least be said that his will was not concerned in <lb/>
this transaction. He acted in obedience to an impulse which <lb/>
he could not control, nor resist. Shall we impute guilt <lb/>
where there is no design? Shall a man extract food for <lb/>
self-reproach from an action to which it is not enough to say <lb/>
that he was actuated by no culpable intention, but that he <lb/>
was swayed by no intention whatever? If consequences <lb/>
arise that cannot be foreseen, shall we find no refuge in the <lb/>
persuasion of our rectitude and of human frailty? Shall <lb/>
we deem ourselves criminal because we do not enjoy the <lb/>
attributes of Deity? Because our power and our <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
are confined by impassable boundaries?</p>
<p>But whence arose the subsequent intention? It was the <lb/>
fruit of a dreadful mistake. His intents were noble and <lb/>
compassionate. But this is of no avail to free him from the <lb/>
imputation of guilt. No remembrance of past beneficence <lb/>
can compensate for this crime. The scale, loaded with the <lb/>
<pb n="80" entity="eaf033v3_0093" pid="uva-lib:349825"/>
recriminations of his conscience, is immovable by any <reg orig="coun-|ter-weight">counter-weight</reg>.</p>
<p>But what are the conclusions to be drawn by <reg orig="dispassion-|ate">dispassionate</reg> <lb/>
observers? Is it possible to regard this person with <reg orig="dis-|dain">disdain</reg> <lb/>
or with enmity? The crime originated in those <reg orig="limit-|ations">limitations</reg> <lb/>
which nature has imposed upon human faculties. <lb/>
Proofs of a just intention are all that are requisite to exempt <lb/>
us from blame; he is thus, in consequence of a double <lb/>
mistake. The light in which he views this event is <reg orig="errone-|ous">erroneous</reg>. <lb/>
He judges wrong and is therefore miserable.</p>
<p>How imperfect are the grounds of all our decisions? <lb/>
Was it of no use to superintend his childhood, to select his <lb/>
instructers and examples, to mark the operations of his <lb/>
principles, to see him emerging into youth, to follow him <lb/>
through various scenes and trying vicissitudes, and mark the <lb/>
uniformity of his integrity? Who would have predicted <lb/>
his future conduct? Who would not have affirmed the <reg orig="im-|possibility">impossibility</reg> <lb/>
of an action like this?</p>
<p>How mysterious was the connexion between the fate of <lb/>
Wiatte and his sister! By such circuitous, and yet <reg orig="infalli-|ble">infallible</reg> <lb/>
means, were the prediction of the lady and the <reg orig="ven-|geance">vengeance</reg> <lb/>
of the brother accomplished! In how many cases <lb/>
may it be said, as in this, that the prediction was the cause <lb/>
of its own fulfilment? That the very act, which considerate <lb/>
observers, and even himself, for a time, imagined to have <lb/>
utterly precluded the execution of Wiatte's menaces, should <lb/>
be that inevitably leading to it. That the execution should <lb/>
be assigned to him, who, abounding in abhorrence, and in <lb/>
the act of self-defence, was the slayer of the menacer.</p>
<p>As the obstructor of his designs, Wiatte waylaid and <lb/>
assaulted Clithero. He perished in the attempt. Were <lb/>
his designs frustrated?&mdash;No. It was thus that he secured <lb/>
the gratification of his vengeance. His sister was cut off in <lb/>
the bloom of life and prosperity. By a refinement of good <lb/>
fortune, the voluntary minister of his malice had entailed upon <lb/>
himself exile without reprieve and misery without end.</p>
<p>But what chiefly excited my wonder was the connexion <lb/>
of this tale with the destiny of Sarsefield. This was be <lb/>
whom I have frequently mentioned to you as my preceptor. <lb/>
About four years previous to this era, he appeared in this <lb/>
district without fortune or friend. He desired, one evening, <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="eaf033v3_0094" pid="uva-lib:349826"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">8*</fw></pb>
to be accommodated at my uncle's house. The <reg orig="conversa-|tion">conversation</reg> <lb/>
turning on the objects of his journey, and his present <lb/>
situation, he professed himself in search of lucrative <reg orig="employ-|ment">employment</reg>. <lb/>
My uncle proposed to him to become a teacher, <lb/>
there being a sufficient number of young people in this <reg orig="neigh-|borhood">neighborhood</reg> <lb/>
to afford him occupation and subsistence. He <lb/>
found it his interest to embrace this proposal.</p>
<p>I, of course, became his pupil, and demeaned myself in <lb/>
such a manner as speedily to grow into a favorite. He <lb/>
communicated to us no part of his early history, but <reg orig="inform-|ed">informed</reg> <lb/>
us sufficiently of his adventures in Asia and Italy, to <lb/>
make it plain that this was the same person alluded to by <lb/>
Clithero. During his abode among us his conduct was <lb/>
irreproachable. When he left us, he manifested the most <lb/>
poignant regret, but this originated chiefly in his regard to <lb/>
me. He promised to maintain with me an epistolary <reg orig="inter-|course">intercourse</reg>. <lb/>
Since his departure, however, I had heard nothing <lb/>
respecting him. It was with unspeakable regret that I now <lb/>
heard of the disappointment of his hopes, and was <reg orig="inquisi-|tive">inquisitive</reg> <lb/>
respecting the measures which he would adopt in his <lb/>
new situation. Perhaps he would once more return to <lb/>
America, and I should again be admitted to the enjoyment <lb/>
of his society. This event I anticipated with the highest <lb/>
satisfaction.</p>
<p>At present, the fate of the unhappy Clithero was the <reg orig="sub-|ject">subject</reg> <lb/>
of abundant anxiety. On his suddenly leaving me, at <lb/>
the conclusion of his tale, I supposed that he had gone upon <lb/>
one of his usual rambles, and that it would terminate only <lb/>
with the day. Next morning a message was received from <lb/>
Inglefield inquiring if any one knew what had become of his <lb/>
servant. I could not listen to this message with tranquillity. <lb/>
I recollected the hints that he had given of some design upon <lb/>
his life, and admitted the most dreary forebodings. I <reg orig="speed-|ed">speeded</reg> <lb/>
to Inglefield's. Clithero had not returned, they told me, <lb/>
the preceding evening. He had not apprised them of any <lb/>
intention to change his abode. His boxes, and all that <reg orig="com-|posed">composed</reg> <lb/>
his slender property, were found in their ordinary <lb/>
state. He had expressed no dissatisfaction with his present <lb/>
condition.</p>
<p>Several days passed, and no tidings could be procured of <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="eaf033v3_0095" pid="uva-lib:349827"/>
him. His absence was a topic of general speculation, but <lb/>
was a source of particular anxiety to no one but myself. <lb/>
My apprehensions were surely built upon sufficient grounds. <lb/>
From the moment that we parted, no one had seen or heard <lb/>
of him. What mode of suicide he had selected, he had <lb/>
disabled us from discovering, by the impenetrable secrecy <lb/>
in which he had involved it.</p>
<p>In the midst of my reflections upon this subject, the idea <lb/>
of the wilderness occurred. Could he have executed his <lb/>
design in the deepest of its recesses? These were <reg orig="unvisit-|ed">unvisited</reg> <lb/>
by human footsteps, and his bones might lie for ages in <lb/>
this solitude without attracting observation. To seek them <lb/>
where they lay, to gather them together and provide for <lb/>
them a grave, was a duty which appeared incumbent on me, <lb/>
and of which the performance was connected with a <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg> <lb/>
habitual sentiments and mixed pleasures.</p>
<p>Thou knowest my devotion to the spirit that breathes its <lb/>
inspiration in the gloom of forests and on the verge of <lb/>
streams. I love to immerse myself in shades and dells, <lb/>
and hold converse with the solemnities and secrecies of <lb/>
nature in the rude retreats of Norwalk. The disappearance <lb/>
of Clithero had furnished new incitements to ascend its <lb/>
cliffs and pervade its thickets, as I cherished the hope of <lb/>
meeting in my rambles, with some traces of this man. But <lb/>
might he not still live? His words had imparted the belief <lb/>
that he intended to destroy himself. This catastrophe, <lb/>
however, was far from certain. Was it not in my power to <lb/>
avert it? Could I not restore a mind thus vigorous, to <lb/>
tranquil and wholesome existence? Could I not subdue <lb/>
his perverse disdain and immeasurable abhorrence of <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg>. <lb/>
His upbraiding and his scorn were unmerited and <lb/>
misplaced. Perhaps they argued phrenzy rather than <reg orig="pre-|judice">prejudice</reg>; <lb/>
but phrenzy, like prejudice, was curable. Reason <lb/>
was no less an antidote to the illusions of insanity like his, <lb/>
than to the illusions of error.</p>
<p>I did not immediately recollect that to subsist in this <lb/>
desert was impossible. Nuts were the only fruits it <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg>, <lb/>
and these were inadequate to sustain human life. <lb/>
If it were haunted by Clithero, he must occasionally pass <lb/>
its limits and beg or purloin victuals. This deportment was <lb/>
too humiliating and flagitious to be imputed to him. There <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="eaf033v3_0096" pid="uva-lib:349828"/>
was reason to suppose him smitten with the charms of <reg orig="soli-|tude">solitude</reg>, <lb/>
of a lonely abode in the midst of mountainous and <lb/>
rugged nature; but this could not be uninterruptedly <reg orig="enjoy-|ed">enjoyed</reg>. <lb/>
Life could be supported only by occasionally visiting <lb/>
the haunts of men, in the guise of a thief or a mendicant. <lb/>
Hence, since Clithero was not known to have reappeared, <lb/>
at any farm-house in the neighborhood, I was compelled to <lb/>
conclude, either that he had retired far from this district, or <lb/>
that he was dead.</p>
<p>Though I designed that my leisure should chiefly be <reg orig="con-|sumed">consumed</reg> <lb/>
in the bosom of Norwalk; I almost dismissed the <lb/>
hope of meeting with the fugitive. There were indeed two <lb/>
sources of my hopelessness on this occasion. Not only it <lb/>
was probable that Clithero had fled far away, but, should he <lb/>
have concealed himself in some nook or cavern, within these <lb/>
precincts, his concealment was not to be traced. This arose <lb/>
from the nature of that sterile region.</p>
<p>It would not be easy to describe the face of this district, <lb/>
in a few words. Half of Solebury, thou knowest, admits <lb/>
neither of plough nor spade. The cultivable space lies <lb/>
along the river, and the desert, lying on the north, has <reg orig="gain-|ed">gained</reg>, <lb/>
by some means, the appellation of Norwalk. Canst <lb/>
thou imagine a space, somewhat circular, about six miles <lb/>
in diameter, and exhibiting a perpetual and intricate variety <lb/>
of craggy eminences and deep dells.</p>
<p>The hollows are single, and walled around by cliffs, ever <lb/>
varying in shape and height, and have seldom any <reg orig="percepti-|ble">perceptible</reg> <lb/>
communication with each other. These hollows are of <lb/>
all dimensions, from the narrowness and depth of a well, to <lb/>
the amplitude of one hundred yards. Winter's snow is <lb/>
frequently found in these cavities at mid-summer. The <lb/>
streams that burst forth from every crevice, are thrown, by <lb/>
the irregularities of the surface, into numberless cascades, <lb/>
often disappear in mists or in chasms, and emerge from <reg orig="sub-|terranean">subterranean</reg> <lb/>
channels, and, finally, either subside into lakes, or <lb/>
quietly meander through the lower and more level grounds.</p>
<p>Wherever nature left a flat it is made rugged and scarcely <lb/>
passable by enormous and fallen trunks, accumulated by the <lb/>
storms of ages, and forming, by their slow decay, a <reg orig="moss-|covered">moss-covered</reg> <lb/>
soil, the haunt of rabbits and lizards. These spots <lb/>
are obscured by the melancholy umbrage of pines, whose <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="eaf033v3_0097" pid="uva-lib:349829"/>
eternal murmurs are in unison with vacancy and solitude, <lb/>
with the reverberations of the torrents and the whistling of <lb/>
the blasts. Hiccory and poplar, which abound in the <reg orig="low-|lands">lowlands</reg>, <lb/>
find here no fostering elements.</p>
<p>A sort of continued vale, winding and abrupt, leads into <lb/>
the midst of this region and through it. This vale serves <lb/>
the purpose of a road. It is a tedious maze, and perpetual <lb/>
declivity, and requires, from the passenger, a cautious and <lb/>
sure foot. Openings and ascents occasionally present <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg> <lb/>
on each side, which seem to promise you access to <lb/>
the interior region, but always terminate, sooner or later, in <lb/>
insuperable difficulties, at the verge of a precipice, or the <lb/>
bottom of a steep.</p>
<p>Perhaps no one was more acquainted with this wilderness <lb/>
than I, but my knowledge was extremely imperfect. I had <lb/>
traversed parts of it, at an early age, in pursuit of berries <lb/>
and nuts, or led by a roaming disposition. Afterwards the <lb/>
sphere of my rambles was enlarged and their purpose <lb/>
changed. When Sarsefield came among us, I became his <lb/>
favorite scholar and the companion of all his pedestrian <reg orig="ex-|cursions">excursions</reg>. <lb/>
He was fond of penetrating into these recesses, <lb/>
partly from the love of picturesque scenes, partly to <reg orig="investi-|gate">investigate</reg> <lb/>
its botanical and mineral productions, and partly to <lb/>
carry on more effectually that species of instruction which <lb/>
he had adopted with regard to me, and which chiefly <reg orig="con-|sisted">consisted</reg> <lb/>
in moralizing narratives or synthetical reasonings. <lb/>
These excursions had familiarized me with its outlines and <lb/>
most accessible parts; but there was much which, perhaps, <lb/>
could never be reached without wings, and much the only <lb/>
paths to which I might forever overlook.</p>
<p>Every new excursion indeed added somewhat to my <lb/>
knowledge. New tracks were pursued, new prospects <reg orig="de-|tected">detected</reg>, <lb/>
and new summits were gained. My rambles were <lb/>
productive of incessant novelty, though they always <reg orig="termi-|nated">terminated</reg> <lb/>
in the prospect of limits that could not be overleaped. <lb/>
But none of these had led me wider from my customary <lb/>
paths than that which had taken place when in pursuit of <lb/>
Clithero. I had faint remembrance of the valley, into which <lb/>
I had descended after him, but till then I had viewed it at <lb/>
a distance, and supposed it impossible to reach the bottom <lb/>
but by leaping from a precipice some hundred feet in height. <lb/>
<pb n="85" entity="eaf033v3_0098" pid="uva-lib:349830"/>
The opposite steep seemed no less inaccessible, and the <lb/>
cavern at the bottom was impervious to any views which my <lb/>
former positions had enabled me to take of it.</p>
<p>My intention to reexamine this cave and ascertain <reg orig="whi-|ther">whither</reg> <lb/>
it led, had, for a time, been suspended by different <lb/>
considerations. It was now revived with more energy than <lb/>
ever. I reflected that this had formerly been haunted by <lb/>
Clithero, and might possibly have been the scene of the <lb/>
desperate act which he had meditated. It might at least <lb/>
conceal some token of his past existence. It might lead <lb/>
into spaces hitherto unvisited, and to summits from which <lb/>
wider landscapes might be seen.</p>
<p>One morning I set out to explore this scene. The road <lb/>
which Clithero had taken was laboriously circuitous. On <lb/>
my return from the first pursuit of him, I ascended the cliff <lb/>
in my former footsteps, but soon lighted on the beaten track <lb/>
which I have already described. This enabled me to shun <lb/>
a thousand obstacles, which had lately risen before me, and <lb/>
opened an easy passage to the cavern.</p>
<p>I once more traversed this way. The brow of the hill <lb/>
was gained. The ledges of which it consisted, afforded <lb/>
sufficient footing, when the attempt was made, though <lb/>
viewed at a distance they seemed to be too narrow for that <lb/>
purpose. As I descended the rugged stair, I could not but <lb/>
wonder at the temerity and precipitation with which this <lb/>
descent had formerly been made. It seemed as if the <reg orig="noon-|day">noonday</reg> <lb/>
light and the tardiest circumspection would scarcely <lb/>
enable me to accomplish it, yet then it had been done with <lb/>
headlong speed, and with no guidance but the moon's <reg orig="un-|certain">uncertain</reg> <lb/>
rays.</p>
<p>I reached the mouth of the cave. Till now I had <reg orig="for-|gotten">forgotten</reg> <lb/>
that a lamp or a torch might be necessary to direct <lb/>
my subterranean footsteps. I was unwilling to defer the <lb/>
attempt. Light might possibly be requisite, if the cave <lb/>
had no other outlet. Somewhat might present itself within <lb/>
to the eyes, which might forever elude the hands, but I <lb/>
was more inclined to consider it merely as an avenue, <reg orig="ter-|minating">terminating</reg> <lb/>
in an opening on the summit of the steep, or on the <lb/>
opposite side of the ridge. Caution might supply the place of <lb/>
light, or, having explored the cave as far as possible at present, <lb/>
I might hereafter return, better furnished for the scrutiny.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">With</hi> these determinations, I proceeded. The entrance <lb/>
was low, and compelled me to resort to hands as well as <lb/>
feet. At a few yards from the mouth the light disappeared, <lb/>
and I found myself immersed in the dunnest obscurity. <lb/>
Had I not been persuaded that another had gone before <lb/>
me, I should have relinquished the attempt. I proceeded <lb/>
with the utmost caution, always ascertaining, by out-stretched <lb/>
arms, the height and breadth of the cavity before me. In <lb/>
a short time the dimensions expanded on all sides, and <reg orig="per-|mitted">permitted</reg> <lb/>
me to resume my feet.</p>
<p>I walked upon a smooth and gentle declivity. Presently <lb/>
the wall, on one side, and the ceiling receded beyond my <lb/>
reach. I began to fear that I should be involved in a maze, <lb/>
and should be disabled from returning. To obviate this <lb/>
danger it was requisite to adhere to the nearest wall, and <lb/>
conform to the direction which it should take, without <reg orig="stray-|ing">straying</reg> <lb/>
through the palpable obscurity. Whether the ceiling <lb/>
was lofty or low, whether the opposite wall of the passage <lb/>
was distant or near, this, I deemed no proper opportunity to <lb/>
investigate.</p>
<p>In a short time, my progress was stopped by an abrupt <lb/>
descent. I set down the advancing foot with caution, being <lb/>
aware that I might at the next step encounter a bottomless <lb/>
pit. To the brink of such a one I seemed now to have <lb/>
arrived. I stooped, and stretched my hand forward and <lb/>
downward, but all was vacuity.</p>
<p>Here it was needful to pause. I had reached the brink <lb/>
of a cavity whose depth it was impossible to ascertain. It <lb/>
might be a few inches beyond my reach, or hundreds of <lb/>
feet. By leaping down I might incur no injury, or might <lb/>
plunge into a lake or dash myself to pieces on the points of <lb/>
rocks.</p>
<p>I now saw with new force the propriety of being <reg orig="fur-|nished">furnished</reg> <lb/>
with a light. The first suggestion was to return upon <lb/>
my footsteps, and resume my undertaking on the morrow. <lb/>
Yet, having advanced thus far, I felt reluctance to recede <lb/>
without accomplishing my purposes. I reflected likewise <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="eaf033v3_0100" pid="uva-lib:349832"/>
that Clithero had boldly entered this recess, and had <reg orig="cer-|tainly">certainly</reg> <lb/>
come forth at a different avenue from that at which <lb/>
he entered.</p>
<p>At length it occurred to me, that though I could not go <lb/>
forward, yet I might proceed along the edge of this cavity. <lb/>
This edge would be as safe a guidance, and would serve as <lb/>
well for a clue by which I might return, as the wall which <lb/>
it was now necessary to forsake.</p>
<p>Intense dark is always the parent of fears. Impending <lb/>
injuries cannot in this state be descried, nor shunned, nor <lb/>
repelled. I began to feel some faltering of my courage and <lb/>
seated myself, for a few minutes, on a stony mass which <lb/>
arose before me. My situation was new. The caverns I <lb/>
had hitherto met with in this desert, were chiefly formed of <lb/>
low browed rocks. They were chambers, more or less <lb/>
spacious, into which twilight was at least admitted; but here <lb/>
it seemed as if I were surrounded by barriers that would <reg orig="for-|ever">forever</reg> <lb/>
cut off my return to air and to light.</p>
<p>Presently I resumed my courage and proceeded. My <lb/>
road appeared now to ascend. On one side I seemed still <lb/>
upon the verge of a precipice, and, on the other, all was <lb/>
empty and waste. I had gone no inconsiderable distance, <lb/>
and persuaded myself that my career would speedily <reg orig="ter-|minate">terminate</reg>. <lb/>
In a short time, the space on the left hand was <lb/>
again occupied, and I cautiously proceeded between the <lb/>
edge of the gulf and a rugged wall. As the space between <lb/>
them widened I adhered to the wall.</p>
<p>I was not insensible that my path became more intricate <lb/>
and more difficult to retread in proportion as I advanced. I <lb/>
endeavored to preserve a vivid conception of the way which <lb/>
I had already passed, and to keep the images of the left, and <lb/>
right-hand wall, and the gulf, in due succession in my <lb/>
memory.</p>
<p>The path which had hitherto been considerably smooth, <lb/>
now became rugged and steep. Chilling damps, the secret <lb/>
trepidation which attended me, the length and difficulties of <lb/>
my way, enhanced by the ceaseless caution and the <reg orig="numer-|ous">numerous</reg> <lb/>
expedients which the utter darkness obliged me to <lb/>
employ, began to overpower my strength. I was frequently <lb/>
compelled to stop and recruit myself by rest. These respites <lb/>
from toil were of use, but they could not enable me to <reg orig="pro-|secute">prosecute</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="eaf033v3_0101" pid="uva-lib:349833"/>
an endless journey, and to return was scarcely a <lb/>
less arduous task than to proceed.</p>
<p>I looked anxiously forward in the hope of being <reg orig="com-|forted">comforted</reg> <lb/>
by some dim ray, which might assure me that my <lb/>
labors were approaching an end. At last this propitious token <lb/>
appeared, and I issued forth into a kind of chamber, one <lb/>
side of which was open to the air and allowed me to catch <lb/>
a portion of the chequered sky. This spectacle never <lb/>
before excited such exquisite sensations in my bosom. The <lb/>
air, likewise, breathed into the cavern, was unspeakably <lb/>
delicious.</p>
<p>I now found myself on the projecture of a rock. Above <lb/>
and below the hillside was nearly perpendicular. Opposite, <lb/>
and at the distance of fifteen or twenty yards, was a similar <lb/>
ascent. At the bottom was a glen, cold, narrow and obscure. <lb/>
The projecture, which served as a kind of vestibule to the <lb/>
cave, was connected with a ledge, by which, though not <lb/>
without peril and toil, I was conducted to the summit.</p>
<p>This summit was higher than any of those which were <reg orig="in-|terposed">interposed</reg> <lb/>
between itself and the river. A large part of this <lb/>
chaos of rocks and precipices was subjected, at one view, to <lb/>
the eye. The fertile lawns and vales which lay beyond this, <lb/>
the winding course of the river, and the slopes which rose <lb/>
on its farther side, were parts of this extensive scene. These <lb/>
objects were at any time fitted to inspire rapture. Now my <lb/>
delight was enhanced by the contrast which this lightsome <lb/>
and serene element bore to the glooms from which I had <lb/>
lately emerged. My station, also, was higher, and the limits <lb/>
of my view, consequently more ample than any which I had <lb/>
hitherto enjoyed.</p>
<p>I advanced to the outer verge of the hill, which I found <lb/>
to overlook a steep, no less inaccessible, and a glen equally <lb/>
profound. I changed frequently my station in order to <reg orig="di-|versify">diversify</reg> <lb/>
the scenery. At length it became necessary to <lb/>
inquire by what means I should return. I traversed the <lb/>
edge of the hill, but on every side it was equally steep and <lb/>
always too lofty to permit me to leap from it. As I kept <lb/>
along the verge, I perceived that it tended in a circular <reg orig="di-|rection">direction</reg>, <lb/>
and brought me back, at last, to the spot from which <lb/>
I had set out. From this inspection, it seemed as if return <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="eaf033v3_0102" pid="uva-lib:349834"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">9</fw></pb>
was impossible by any other way than that through the <lb/>
cavern.</p>
<p>I now turned my attention to the interior space. If you <lb/>
imagine a cylindrical mass, with a cavity dug in the centre, <lb/>
whose edge conforms to the exterior edge; and, if you <lb/>
place in this cavity another cylinder, higher than that which <lb/>
surrounds it, but so small as to leave between its sides and <lb/>
those of the cavity, a hollow space, you will gain as distinct <lb/>
an image of this hill as words can convey. The summit of <lb/>
the inner rock was rugged and covered with trees of unequal <lb/>
growth. To reach this summit would not render my return <lb/>
easier; but its greater elevation would extend my view, and <lb/>
perhaps furnish a spot from which the whole horizon was <lb/>
conspicuous.</p>
<p>As I had traversed the outer, I now explored the inner <lb/>
edge of this hill. At length I reached a spot where the chasm, <lb/>
separating the two rocks, was narrower than at any other <lb/>
part. At first view, it seemed as if it were possible to leap <lb/>
over it, but a nearer examination shewed me that the <reg orig="pas-|sage">passage</reg> <lb/>
was impracticable. So far as my eye could estimate it, <lb/>
the breadth was thirty or forty feet. I could scarcely <reg orig="ven-|ture">venture</reg> <lb/>
to look beneath. The height was dizzy, and the walls, <lb/>
which approached each other at top, receded at the bottom, <lb/>
so as to form the resemblance of an immense hall, lighted <lb/>
from a rift, which some convulsion of nature had made in <lb/>
the roof. Where I stood there ascended a perpetual mist, <lb/>
occasioned by a torrent that dashed along the rugged <reg orig="pave-|ment">pavement</reg> <lb/>
below.</p>
<p>From these objects I willingly turned my eye upon those <lb/>
before and above me, on the opposite ascent. A stream, <lb/>
rushing from above, fell into a cavity, which its own force <lb/>
seemed gradually to have made. The noise and the motion <lb/>
equally attracted my attention. There was a desolate and <lb/>
solitary grandeur in the scene, enhanced by the <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg> <lb/>
in which it was beheld, and by the perils through <lb/>
which I had recently passed, that had never before been <lb/>
witnessed by me.</p>
<p>A sort of sanctity and awe environed it, owing to the <reg orig="con-|sciousness">consciousness</reg> <lb/>
of absolute and utter loneliness. It was probable <lb/>
that human feet had never before gained this recess, that <lb/>
<pb n="90" entity="eaf033v3_0103" pid="uva-lib:349835"/>
human eyes had never been fixed upon these gushing waters. <lb/>
The aboriginal inhabitants had no motives to lead them into <lb/>
caves like this, and ponder on the verge of such a precipice. <lb/>
Their successors were still less likely to have wandered <lb/>
hither. Since the birth of this continent, I was probably <lb/>
the first who had deviated thus remotely from the customary <lb/>
paths of men.</p>
<p>While musing upon these ideas, my eye was fixed upon <lb/>
the foaming current. At length, I looked upon the rocks <lb/>
which confined and embarrassed its course. I admired <lb/>
their fantastic shapes, and endless irregularities. Passing <lb/>
from one to the other of these, my attention lighted, at <lb/>
length, as if by some magical transition, on&mdash;a human <reg orig="coun-|tenance">countenance</reg>!</p>
<p>My surprise was so abrupt, and my sensations so <reg orig="tumult-|uous">tumultuous</reg> <lb/>
that I forgot for a moment the perilous nature of my <lb/>
situation. I loosened my hold of a pine branch, which had <lb/>
been hitherto one of my supports, and almost started from <lb/>
my seat. Had my station been in a slight degree nearer <lb/>
the brink than it was, I should have fallen headlong into the <lb/>
abyss.</p>
<p>To meet a human creature, even on that side of the <lb/>
chasm which I occupied, would have been wholly adverse <lb/>
to my expectation. My station was accessible by no other <lb/>
road than that through which I had passed, and no motives <lb/>
were imaginable by which others could be prompted to <reg orig="ex-|plore">explore</reg> <lb/>
this road. But he whom I now beheld, was seated <lb/>
where it seemed impossible for human efforts to have placed <lb/>
him.</p>
<p>But this affected me but little in comparison with other <lb/>
incidents. Not only the countenance was human, but in <lb/>
spite of shaggy and tangled locks, and an air of melancholy <lb/>
wildness, I speedily recognized the features of the fugitive <lb/>
Clithero!</p>
<p>One glance was not sufficient to make me acquainted <lb/>
with this scene. I had come hither partly in pursuit of this <lb/>
man, but some casual appendage of his person, something <lb/>
which should indicate his past rather than his present <reg orig="exist-|ence">existence</reg>, <lb/>
was all that I hoped to find. That he should be found <lb/>
alive in this desert; that he should have gained this summit, <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="eaf033v3_0104" pid="uva-lib:349836"/>
access to which was apparently impossible, were scarcely <lb/>
within the boundaries of belief.</p>
<p>His scanty and coarse garb, had been nearly rent away <lb/>
by brambles and thorns; his arms, bosom and cheek were <lb/>
overgrown and half-concealed by hair. There was <reg orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg> <lb/>
in his attitude and looks denoting more than anarchy <lb/>
of thoughts and passions. His rueful, ghastly, and <reg orig="im-|moveable">immoveable</reg> <lb/>
eyes, testified not only that his mind was ravaged <lb/>
by despair, but that he was pinched with famine.</p>
<p>These proofs of his misery thrilled to my inmost heart. <lb/>
Horror and shuddering invaded me as I stood gazing upon <lb/>
him, and, for a time, I was without the power of <reg orig="delibe-|rating">deliberating</reg> <lb/>
on the measures which it was my duty to adopt for <lb/>
his relief. The first suggestion was, by calling, to inform <lb/>
him of my presence. I knew not what counsel or comfort <lb/>
to offer. By what words to bespeak his attention, or by <lb/>
what topics to mollify his direful passions I knew not. <lb/>
Though so near, the gulf by which we were separated was <lb/>
impassable. All that I could do was to speak.</p>
<p>My surprise and my horror were still strong enough to <lb/>
give a shrill and piercing tone to my voice. The chasm <lb/>
and the rocks loudened and reverberated my accents while <lb/>
I exclaimed&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Man! Clithero!</hi></p>
<p>My summons was effectual. He shook off his trance in <lb/>
a moment. He had been stretched upon his back, with his <lb/>
eyes fixed upon a craggy projecture above, as if he were <lb/>
in momentary expectation of its fall, and crushing him to <lb/>
atoms. Now he started on his feet. He was conscious of <lb/>
the voice, but not of the quarter whence it came. He was <lb/>
looking anxiously around when I again spoke&mdash;Look hither. <lb/>
It is I who called.</p>
<p>He looked. Astonishment was now mingled with every <lb/>
other dreadful meaning in his visage. He clasped his hands <lb/>
together and bent forward, as if to satisfy himself that his <lb/>
summoner was real. At the next moment he drew back, <lb/>
placed his hands upon his breast, and fixed his eyes on the <lb/>
ground.</p>
<p>This pause was not likely to be broken but by me. I <lb/>
was preparing again to speak. To be more distinctly heard, <lb/>
I advanced closer to the brink. During this action, my eye <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="eaf033v3_0105" pid="uva-lib:349837"/>
was necessarily withdrawn from him. Having gained a <lb/>
somewhat nearer station. I looked again, but&mdash;he was gone!</p>
<p>The seat which he so lately occupied was empty. I was <lb/>
not forewarned of his disappearance, or directed to the <lb/>
course of his flight by any rustling among leaves. These <lb/>
indeed would have been overpowered by the noise of the <lb/>
cataract. The place where he sat was the bottom of a <lb/>
cavity, one side of which terminated in the verge of the <lb/>
abyss, but the other sides were perpendicular or <reg orig="overhang-|ing">overhanging</reg>. <lb/>
Surely he had not leaped into this gulf, and yet that <lb/>
he had so speedily scaled the steep was impossible.</p>
<p>I looked into the gulf, but the depth and the gloom <reg orig="al-|lowed">allowed</reg> <lb/>
me to see nothing with distinctness. His cries or <lb/>
groans could not be overheard amidst the uproar of the <lb/>
waters. His fall must have instantly destroyed him, and <lb/>
that he had fallen was the only conclusion I could draw.</p>
<p>My sensations on this incident cannot be easily described. <lb/>
The image of this man's despair, and of the sudden <reg orig="catas-|trophe">catastrophe</reg> <lb/>
to which my inauspicious interference had led, filled <lb/>
me with compunction and terror. Some of my fears were <lb/>
relieved by the new conjecture, that, behind the rock on <lb/>
which he had lain, there might be some aperture or pit into <lb/>
which he had descended, or in which he might be <reg orig="con-|cealed">concealed</reg>.</p>
<p>I derived consolation from this conjecture. Not only the <lb/>
evil which I dreaded might not have happened, but some <lb/>
alleviation of his misery was possible. Could I arrest his <lb/>
footsteps and win his attention, I might be able to insinuate <lb/>
the lessons of fortitude; but if words were impotent, and <lb/>
arguments were nugatory, yet to sit by him in silence, to <lb/>
moisten his hand with tears, to sigh in unison, to offer him <lb/>
the spectacle of sympathy, the solace of believing that his <lb/>
demerits were not estimated by so rigid a standard by others <lb/>
as by himself, that one at least among his fellow-men <reg orig="re-|garded">regarded</reg> <lb/>
him with love and pity, could not fail to be of benign <lb/>
influence.</p>
<p>These thoughts inspired me with new zeal. To effect <lb/>
my purpose it was requisite to reach the opposite steep. I <lb/>
was now convinced that this was not an impracticable <reg orig="un-|dertaking">undertaking</reg>, <lb/>
since Clithero had already performed it. I once <lb/>

more made the circuit of the hill. Every side was steep <lb/>
and of enormous height, and the gulf was no where so <reg orig="nar-|row">narrow</reg> <lb/>
as at this spot. I therefore returned hither, and once <lb/>
mere pondered on the means of passing this tremendous <lb/>
chasm in safety.</p>
<p>Casting my eyes upward, I noted the tree at the root of <lb/>
which I was standing. I compared the breadth of the gulf <lb/>
with the length of the trunk of this tree, and it appeared <lb/>
very suitable for a bridge. Happily it grew obliquely, and <lb/>
if felled by an axe, would probably fall of itself, in such a <lb/>
manner as to be suspended across the chasm. The stock <lb/>
was thick enough to afford me footing, and would enable <lb/>
me to reach the opposite declivity without danger or delay.</p>
<p>A more careful examination of the spot, the scite of the <lb/>
tree, its dimensions, and the direction of its growth, <reg orig="con-|vinced">convinced</reg> <lb/>
me fully of the practicability of this expedient, and <lb/>
I determined to carry it into immediate execution. For <lb/>
this end I must hasten home, procure an axe, and return <lb/>
with all expedition hither. I took my former way, once more <lb/>
entered the subterranean avenue, and slowly re-emerged <lb/>
into day. Before I reached home, the evening was at <lb/>
hand, and my tired limbs and jaded spirits obliged me to <lb/>
defer my undertaking till the morrow.</p>
<p>Though my limbs were at rest, my thoughts were active <lb/>
through the night. I carefully reviewed the situation of this <lb/>
hill, and was unable to conjecture by what means Clithero <lb/>
could place himself upon it. Unless he occasionally <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg> <lb/>
to the habitable grounds, it was impossible for him <lb/>
to escape perishing by famine. He might intend to destroy <lb/>
himself by this means, and my first efforts were to be <reg orig="em-|ployed">employed</reg> <lb/>
to overcome this fatal resolution. To persuade him <lb/>
to leave his desolate haunts might be a laborious and tedious <lb/>
task, meanwhile all my benevolent intentions would be <reg orig="frus-|trated">frustrated</reg> <lb/>
by his want of sustenance. It was proper, therefore, <lb/>
to carry bread with me, and to place it before him. The <lb/>
sight of food, the urgencies of hunger, and my vehement <lb/>
entreaties might prevail on him to eat, though no <reg orig="expostula-|tions">expostulations</reg> <lb/>
might suffice to make him seek food at a distance.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Next</hi> morning I stored a small bag with meat and bread, <lb/>
and throwing an axe on my shoulder, set out, without <reg orig="in-|forming">informing</reg> <lb/>
any one of my intentions, for the hill. My passage <lb/>
was rendered more difficult by these incumbrances, but my <lb/>
perseverance surmounted every impediment, and I gained, <lb/>
in a few hours, the foot of the tree, whose trunk was to serve <lb/>
me for a bridge. In this journey I saw no traces of the <lb/>
fugitive.</p>
<p>A new survey of the tree confirmed my former <reg orig="conclu-|sions">conclusions</reg>, <lb/>
and I began my work with diligence. My strokes <lb/>
were repeated by a thousand echoes, and I paused at first <lb/>
somewhat startled by reverberations, which made it appear <lb/>
as if not one, but a score of axes, were employed at the <lb/>
same time on both sides of the gulf.</p>
<p>Quickly the tree fell, and exactly in the manner which I <lb/>
expected and desired. The wide spread limbs occupied <lb/>
and choked up the channel of the torrent, and compelled it <lb/>
to seek a new outlet and multiplied its murmurs. I dared <lb/>
not trust myself to cross it in an upright posture, but clung, <lb/>
with hands and feet, to its rugged bark. Having reached <lb/>
the opposite cliff I proceeded to examine the spot where <lb/>
Clithero had disappeared. My fondest hopes were realized, <lb/>
for a considerable cavity appeared, which, on a former day, <lb/>
had been concealed from my distant view by the rock.</p>
<p>It was obvious to conclude that this was his present <reg orig="habi-|tation">habitation</reg>, <lb/>
or that an avenue, conducting hither and terminating <lb/>
in the unexplored sides of this pit, was that by which he had <lb/>
come hither, and by which he had retired. I could not <lb/>
hesitate long to slide into the pit. I found an entrance <lb/>
through which I fearlessly penetrated. I was prepared to <lb/>
encounter obstacles and perils similar to those which I have <lb/>
already described, but was rescued from them by ascending, <lb/>
in a few minutes, into a kind of passage, open above, but <lb/>
walled by a continued rock on both sides. The sides of this <lb/>
passage conformed with the utmost exactness to each other. <lb/>
Nature, at some former period, had occasioned the solid <lb/>
mass to dispart at this place, and had thus afforded access <lb/>
<pb n="95" entity="eaf033v3_0108" pid="uva-lib:349840"/>
to the summit of the hill. Loose stones and ragged points <lb/>
formed the flooring of this passage, which rapidly and <reg orig="cir-|cuitously">circuitously</reg> <lb/>
ascended.</p>
<p>I was now within a few yards of the surface of the rock. <lb/>
The passage opened into a kind of chamber or pit, the sides <lb/>
of which were not difficult to climb. I rejoiced at the <lb/>
prospect of this termination of my journey. Here I paused, <lb/>
and throwing my weary limbs on the ground, began to <reg orig="ex-|amine">examine</reg> <lb/>
the objects around me, and to meditate on the steps <lb/>
that were next to be taken.</p>
<p>My first glance lighted on the very being of whom I was <lb/>
in search. Stretched upon a bed of moss, at the distance <lb/>
of a few feet from my station, I beheld Clithero. He had <lb/>
not been roused by my approach, though my foot-steps were <lb/>
perpetually stumbling and sliding. This reflection gave <lb/>
birth to the fear that he was dead. A nearer inspection <lb/>
dispelled my apprehensions, and shewed me that he was <lb/>
merely buried in profound slumber. Those vigils must <reg orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg> <lb/>
have been long which were at last succeeded by a sleep <lb/>
so oblivious.</p>
<p>This meeting was, in the highest degree, propitious. It <lb/>
not only assured me of his existence, but proved that his <lb/>
miseries were capable of being suspended. His slumber <reg orig="ena-|bled">enabled</reg> <lb/>
me to pause, to ruminate on the manner by which his <lb/>
understanding might be most successfully addressed; to <reg orig="col-|lect">collect</reg> <lb/>
and arrange the topics fitted to rectify his gloomy and <lb/>
disastrous perceptions.</p>
<p>Thou knowest that I am qualified for such tasks neither <lb/>
by my education nor my genius. The headlong and <reg orig="fero-|cious">ferocious</reg> <lb/>
energies of this man could not be repelled or diverted <lb/>
into better paths by efforts so undisciplined as mine. A <lb/>
despair so stormy and impetuous would drown my feeble <lb/>
accents. How should I attempt to reason with him? How <lb/>
should I outroot prepossessions so inveterate; the fruits of <lb/>
his earliest education, fostered and matured by the <reg orig="observa-|tion">observation</reg> <lb/>
and experience of his whole life. How should I <reg orig="con-|vince">convince</reg> <lb/>
him that since the death of Wiatte was not intended, <lb/>
the deed was without crime; that, if it had been deliberately <lb/>
concerted, it was still a virtue, since his own life could, by no <lb/>
other means, be preserved; that when he pointed a dagger <lb/>
at the bosom of his mistress he was actuated, not by avarice, <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="eaf033v3_0109" pid="uva-lib:349841"/>
or ambition, or revenge, or malice. He desired to confer <lb/>
on her the highest and the only benefit of which he believed <lb/>
her capable. He sought to rescue her from tormenting <reg orig="re-|grets">regrets</reg> <lb/>
and lingering agonies.</p>
<p>These positions were sufficiently just to my own view, but <lb/>
I was not called upon to reduce them to practice. I had <lb/>
not to struggle with the consciousness of having been rescued <lb/>
by some miraculous contingency, from imbruing my hands <lb/>
in the blood of her whom I adored; of having drawn upon <lb/>
myself suspicions of ingratitude and murder too deep to be <lb/>
ever effaced; of having bereft myself of love, and honor, <lb/>
and friends, and spotless reputation; of having doomed <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg> <lb/>
to infamy and detestation, to hopeless exile, penury, <lb/>
and servile toil. These were the evils which his malignant <lb/>
destiny had made the unalterable portion of Clithero, and <lb/>
how should my imperfect eloquence annihilate these evils? <lb/>
Every man, not himself the victim of irretrievable disasters, <lb/>
perceives the folly of ruminating on the past, and of <reg orig="foster-|ing">fostering</reg> <lb/>
a grief which cannot reverse or recall the decrees of an <lb/>
immutable necessity; but every man who suffers is <reg orig="unavoid-|ably">unavoidably</reg> <lb/>
shackled by the errors which he censures in his <reg orig="neigh-|bor">neighbor</reg>, <lb/>
and his efforts to relieve himself are as fruitless as <lb/>
those with which he attempted the relief of others.</p>
<p>No topic, therefore, could be properly employed by me <lb/>
on the present occasion. All that I could do was to offer <lb/>
him food, and, by pathetic supplications, to prevail on him <lb/>
to eat. Famine, however obstinate, would scarcely refrain <lb/>
when bread was placed within sight and reach. When <lb/>
made to swerve from his resolution in one instance, it <lb/>
would be less difficult to conquer it a second time. The <lb/>
magic of sympathy, the perseverance of benevolence, though <lb/>
silent, might work a gradual and secret revolution, and better <lb/>
thoughts might insensibly displace those desperate <reg orig="sugges-|tions">suggestions</reg> <lb/>
which now governed him.</p>
<p>Having revolved these ideas, I placed the food which I <lb/>
had brought at his right hand, and, seating myself at his feet, <lb/>
attentively surveyed his countenance. The emotions, which <lb/>
were visible during wakefulness, had vanished during this <lb/>
cessation of remembrance and remorse, or were faintly <reg orig="dis-|cernible">discernible</reg>. <lb/>
They served to dignify and solemnize his <reg orig="fea-|tures">features</reg>, <lb/>
and to embellish those immutable lines which <reg orig="beto-|kened">betokened</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="97" entity="eaf033v3_0110" pid="uva-lib:349842"/>
the spirit of his better days. Lineaments were now <lb/>
observed which could never co-exist with folly, or associate <lb/>
with obdurate guilt.</p>
<p>I had no inclination to awaken him. This respite was <lb/>
too sweet to be needlessly abridged. I determined to await <lb/>
the operation of nature, and to prolong, by silence and by <lb/>
keeping interruption at a distance, this salutary period of <reg orig="for-|getfulness">forgetfulness</reg>. <lb/>
This interval permitted new ideas to succeed <lb/>
in my mind.</p>
<p>Clithero believed his solitude to be unapproachable. <lb/>
What new expedients to escape inquiry and intrusion might <lb/>
not my presence suggest! Might he not vanish, as he had <lb/>
done on the former day, and afford me no time to assail his <lb/>
constancy and tempt his hunger? If, however, I withdrew <lb/>
during his sleep, he would awake without disturbance, and <lb/>
be, unconscious for a time, that his secrecy had been violated. <lb/>
He would quickly perceive the victuals and would need <lb/>
no foreign inducements to eat. A provision, so <reg orig="unex-|pected">unexpected</reg> <lb/>
and extraordinary, might suggest new thoughts, and <lb/>
be construed into a kind of heavenly condemnation of his <lb/>
purpose. He would not readily suspect the motives or <lb/>
person of his visitant, would take no precaution against the <lb/>
repetition of my visit, and, at the same time, our interview <lb/>
would not be attended with so much surprise. The more I <lb/>
revolved these reflections, the greater force they acquired. <lb/>
At length, I determined to withdraw, and, leaving the food <lb/>
where it could scarcely fail of attracting his notice, I <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg> <lb/>
by the way that I had come. I had scarcely reached <lb/>
home, when a messenger from Inglefield arrived, requesting <lb/>
me to spend the succeeding night at his house, as some <reg orig="en-|gagement">engagement</reg> <lb/>
had occurred to draw him to the city.</p>
<p>I readily complied with this request. It was not necessary, <lb/>
however, to be early in my visit. I deferred going till the <lb/>
evening was far advanced. My way led under the branches <lb/>
of the elm which recent events had rendered so <reg orig="memora-|ble">memorable</reg>. <lb/>
Hence my reflections reverted to the circumstances <lb/>
which had lately occurred in connexion with this tree.</p>
<p>I paused, for some time, under its shade. I marked the <lb/>
spot where Clithero had been discovered digging. It <reg orig="shew-|ed">shewed</reg> <lb/>
marks of being unsettled, but the sod which had formerly <lb/>
covered it and which had lately been removed, was now <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="eaf033v3_0111" pid="uva-lib:349843"/>
carefully replaced. This had not been done by him on <lb/>
that occasion in which I was a witness of his behaviour. <lb/>
The earth was then hastily removed and as hastily thrown <lb/>
again into the hole from which it had been taken.</p>
<p>Some curiosity was naturally excited by this appearance. <lb/>
Either some other person, or Clithero, on a subsequent <lb/>
occasion, had been here. I was now likewise led to reflect <lb/>
on the possible motives that prompted the maniac to turn <lb/>
up this earth. There is always some significance in the <lb/>
actions of a sleeper. Somewhat was, perhaps, buried in <lb/>
this spot, connected with the history of Mrs. Lorimer or of <lb/>
Clarice. Was it not possible to ascertain the truth in this <lb/>
respect?</p>
<p>There was but one method. By carefully uncovering <lb/>
this hole, and digging as deep as Clithero had already dug, <lb/>
it would quickly appear whether any thing was hidden. To <lb/>
do this publicly by daylight was evidently indiscreet. <reg orig="Be-|sides">Besides</reg>, <lb/>
a moment's delay was superfluous. The night had <lb/>
now fallen, and before it was past this new undertaking <lb/>
might be finished. An interview was, if possible, to be <lb/>
gained with Clithero on the morrow, and for this interview <lb/>
the discoveries made on this spot might eminently qualify <lb/>
me. Influenced by these considerations, I resolved to dig. <lb/>
I was first, however, to converse an hour with the <reg orig="house-|keeper">house-keeper</reg>, <lb/>
and then to withdraw to my chamber. When the <lb/>
family were all retired, and there was no fear of observation <lb/>
or interruption, I proposed to rise and hasten, with a proper <lb/>
implement, hither.</p>
<p>One chamber, in Inglefield's house, was usually reserved <lb/>
for visitants. In this chamber thy unfortunate brother died, <lb/>
and here it was that I was to sleep. The image of its last <lb/>
inhabitant could not fail of being called up, and of <reg orig="banish-|ing">banishing</reg> <lb/>
repose; but the scheme which I had meditated was an <lb/>
additional incitement to watchfulness. Hither I repaired, <lb/>
at the due season, having previously furnished myself with <lb/>
candles, since I knew not what might occur to make a light <lb/>
necessary.</p>
<p>I did not go to bed, but either sat musing by a table or <lb/>
walked across the room. The bed before me was that on <lb/>
which my friend breathed his last. To rest my head upon <lb/>
the same pillow, to lie on that pallet which sustained his <lb/>
<pb n="99" entity="eaf033v3_0112" pid="uva-lib:349844"/>
cold and motionless limbs, were provocations to <reg orig="remem-|brance">remembrance</reg> <lb/>
and grief that I desired to shun. I endeavored to <lb/>
fill my mind with more recent incidents, with the disasters <lb/>
of Clithero, my subterranean adventures, and the probable <lb/>
issue of the schemes which I now contemplated.</p>
<p>I recalled the conversation which had just ended with <lb/>
the housekeeper. Clithero had been our theme, but she <lb/>
had dealt chiefly in repetitions of what had formerly been <lb/>
related by her or by Inglefield. I inquired what this man <lb/>
had left behind, and found that it consisted of a square box, <lb/>
put together by himself with uncommon strength, but of <lb/>
rugged workmanship. She proceeded to mention that she <lb/>
had advised her brother, Mr. Inglefield, to break open this <lb/>
box and ascertain its contents, but this he did not think <lb/>
himself justified in doing. Clithero was guilty of no known <lb/>
crime, was responsible to no one for his actions, and might <lb/>
sometime return to claim his property. This box contained <lb/>
nothing with which others had a right to meddle. Somewhat <lb/>
might be found in it, throwing light upon his past or present <lb/>
situation, but curiosity was not to be gratified by these <lb/>
means. What Clithero thought proper to conceal, it was <lb/>
criminal for us to extort from him.</p>
<p>The housekeeper was by no means convinced by these <lb/>
arguments, and at length, obtained her brother's permission <lb/>
to try whether any of her own keys would unlock this chest. <lb/>
The keys were produced, but no lock nor key-hole were <lb/>
discoverable. The lid was fast, but by what means it was <lb/>
fastened, the most accurate inspection could not detect. <lb/>
Hence she was compelled to lay aside her project. This <lb/>
chest had always stood in the chamber which I now <reg orig="occu-|pied">occupied</reg>.</p>
<p>These incidents were now remembered, and I felt <reg orig="dis-|posed">disposed</reg> <lb/>
to profit by this opportunity of examining this box. <lb/>
It stood in a corner, and was easily distinguished by its <lb/>
form. I lifted it and found its weight by no means <reg orig="extra-|ordinary">extraordinary</reg>. <lb/>
Its structure was remarkable. It consisted of <lb/>
six sides, square and of similar dimensions. These were <lb/>
joined, not by mortice and tennon; not by nails, not by <lb/>
hinges, but the junction was accurate. The means by <lb/>
which they were made to cohere were invisible.</p>
<p>Appearances on every side were uniform, nor were there <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="eaf033v3_0113" pid="uva-lib:349845"/>
any marks by which the lid was distinguishable from its other <lb/>
surfaces.</p>
<p>During his residence with Inglefield, many specimens of <lb/>
mechanical ingenuity were given by his servant. This was <lb/>
the workmanship of his own hands. I looked at it, for some <lb/>
time, till the desire insensibly arose of opening and <reg orig="examin-|ing">examining</reg> <lb/>
its contents.</p>
<p>I had no more right to do this than the Inglefields, <reg orig="per-|haps">perhaps</reg> <lb/>
indeed this curiosity was more absurd, and the <reg orig="gratifi-|cation">gratification</reg> <lb/>
more culpable in me than in them. I was acquainted <lb/>
with the history of Clithero's past life, and with his present <lb/>
condition. Respecting these, I had no new intelligence to <lb/>
gain, and no doubts to solve. What excuse could I make <lb/>
to the proprietor, should he ever reappear to claim his own, <lb/>
or to Inglefield for breaking open a receptacle, which all the <lb/>
maxims of society combine to render sacred.</p>
<p>But could not my end be gained without violence. The <lb/>
means of opening might present themselves on a patient <lb/>
scrutiny. The lid might be raised and shut down again <lb/>
without any tokens of my act; its contents might be <reg orig="exa-|mined">examined</reg>, <lb/>
and all things restored to their former condition in a <lb/>
few minutes.</p>
<p>I intended not a theft. I intended to benefit myself <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
inflicting injury on others. Nay, might not the <reg orig="discove-|ries">discoveries</reg> <lb/>
I should make, throw light upon the conduct of this <reg orig="ex-|traordinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
man, which his own narrative had withheld? <lb/>
Was there reason to confide implicitly on the tale which I <lb/>
had heard.</p>
<p>In spite of the testimony of my own feelings, the miseries <lb/>
of Clithero appeared in some degree, phantastic and <reg orig="ground-|less">groundless</reg>. <lb/>
A thousand conceivable motives might induce him to <lb/>
pervert or conceal the truth. If he were thoroughly known, <lb/>
his character might assume a new appearance, and what is <lb/>
now so difficult to reconcile to common maxims, might prove <lb/>
perfectly consistent with them. I desire to restore him to <lb/>
peace, but a thorough knowledge of his actions is necessary, <lb/>
both to shew that he is worthy of compassion, and to suggest <lb/>
the best means of extirpating his errors. It was possible <lb/>
that this box contained the means of this knowledge.</p>
<p>There were likewise other motives which, as they <reg orig="pos-|sessed">possessed</reg> <lb/>
some influence, however small, deserve to be <reg orig="men-|tioned">mentioned</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="eaf033v3_0114" pid="uva-lib:349846"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">10</fw></pb>
Thou knowest that I also am a mechanist. I had <lb/>
constructed a writing desk and cabinet, in which I had <reg orig="en-|deavored">endeavored</reg> <lb/>
to combine the properties of secrecy, security, and <lb/>
strength, in the highest possible degree. I looked upon <lb/>
this therefore with the eye of an artist, and was solicitous to <lb/>
know the principles on which it was formed. I determined <lb/>
to examine, and if possible to open it.</p>
<ornament type="line"/>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="XII" id="d17">
<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I surveyed</hi> it with the utmost attention. All its parts <lb/>
appeared equally solid and smooth. It could not be doubted <lb/>
that one of its sides served the purpose of a lid, and was <lb/>
possible to be raised. Mere strength could not be applied <lb/>
to raise it, because there was no projecture which might be <lb/>
firmly held by the hand, and by which force could be <reg orig="ex-|erted">exerted</reg>. <lb/>
Some spring, therefore, secretly existed, which might <lb/>
forever elude the senses, but on which the hand, by being <lb/>
moved over it, in all directions, might accidentally light.</p>
<p>This process was effectual. A touch, casually applied at <lb/>
an angle, drove back a bolt, and a spring, at the same time, <lb/>
was set in action, by which the lid was raised above half an <lb/>
inch. No event could be supposed more fortuitous than <lb/>
this. A hundred hands might have sought in vain for this <lb/>
spring. The spot in which a certain degree of pressure <lb/>
was sufficient to produce this effect, was of all, the least <lb/>
likely to attract notice or awaken suspicion.</p>
<p>I opened the trunk with eagerness. The space within <lb/>
was divided into numerous compartments, none of which <lb/>
contained any thing of moment. Tools of different and <lb/>
curious constructions, and remnants of minute machinery, <lb/>
were all that offered themselves to my notice.</p>
<p>My expectations being thus frustrated, I proceeded to <lb/>
restore things to their former state. I attempted to close <lb/>
the lid; but the spring which had raised it refused to <lb/>
bend. No measure that I could adopt, enabled me to place <lb/>
the lid in the same situation in which I had found it. In <lb/>
my efforts to press down the lid, which were augmented in <lb/>
<pb n="102" entity="eaf033v3_0115" pid="uva-lib:349847"/>
proportion to the resistance that I met with, the spring was <lb/>
broken. This obstacle being removed, the lid resumed its <lb/>
proper place; but no means, within the reach of my <reg orig="inge-|nuity">ingenuity</reg> <lb/>
to discover, enabled me to push forward the bolt, and <lb/>
thus to restore the fastening.</p>
<p>I now perceived that Clithero had provided not only <lb/>
against the opening of his cabinet, but likewise against the <lb/>
possibility of concealing that it had been opened. This <reg orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg> <lb/>
threw me into some confusion. I had been tempted <lb/>
thus far, by the belief that my action was without witnesses, <lb/>
and might be forever concealed. This opinion was now <lb/>
confuted. If Clithero should ever reclaim his property, he <lb/>
would not fail to detect the violence of which I had been <lb/>
guilty. Inglefield would disapprove in another what he had <lb/>
not permitted to himself, and the unauthorised and <reg orig="clandes-|tine">clandestine</reg> <lb/>
manner in which I had behaved, would aggravate, in <lb/>
his eyes, the heinousness of my offence.</p>
<p>But now there was no remedy. All that remained was <lb/>
to hinder suspicion from lighting on the innocent, and to <lb/>
confess, to my friend, the offence which I had committed. <lb/>
Meanwhile my first project was resumed, and, the family <lb/>
being now wrapt in profound sleep, I left my chamber, and <lb/>
proceeded to the elm. The moon was extremely brilliant, <lb/>
but I hoped that this unfrequented road and unseasonable hour <lb/>
would hinder me from being observed. My chamber was <lb/>
above the kitchen, with which it communicated by a small <lb/>
staircase, and the building to which it belonged was <reg orig="con-|nected">connected</reg> <lb/>
with the dwelling by a gallery. I extinguished the <lb/>
light, and left it in the kitchen, intending to relight it, by the <lb/>
embers that still glowed on the hearth, on my return.</p>
<p>I began to remove the sod, and cast out the earth, with <lb/>
little confidence in the success of my project. The issue of <lb/>
my examination of the box humbled and disheartened me. <lb/>
For some time I found nothing that tended to invigorate my <lb/>
hopes. I determined, however, to descend, as long as the <lb/>
unsettled condition of the earth shewed me that some one <lb/>
had preceded me. Small masses of stone were occasionally <lb/>
met with, which served only to perplex me with groundless <lb/>
expectations. At length my spade struck upon something <lb/>
which emitted a very different sound. I quickly drew it <lb/>
forth, and found it to be wood. Its regular form, and the <lb/>
<pb n="103" entity="eaf033v3_0116" pid="uva-lib:349848"/>
crevices which were faintly discernible, persuaded me that <lb/>
it was human workmanship, and that there was a cavity <lb/>
within. The place in which it was found, easily suggested <lb/>
some connexion between this and the destiny of Clithero. <lb/>
Covering up the hole with speed, I hastened with my prize <lb/>
to the house. The door, by which the kitchen was entered, <lb/>
was not to be seen from the road. It opened on a field, the <lb/>
farther limit of which was a ledge of rocks, which formed, <lb/>
on this side, the boundary of Inglefield's estate and the <lb/>
westernmost barrier of Norwalk.</p>
<p>As I turned the angle of the house, and came in view of <lb/>
this door, methought I saw a figure issue from it. I was <lb/>
startled at this incident, and, stopping, crouched close to the <lb/>
wall, that I might not be discovered. As soon as the figure <lb/>
passed beyond the verge of the shade, it was easily <reg orig="distin-|guished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
to be that of Clithero! He crossed the field with <lb/>
a rapid pace, and quickly passed beyond the reach of my <lb/>
eye.</p>
<p>This appearance was mysterious. For what end he <lb/>
should visit this habitation, could not be guessed. Was the <lb/>
contingency to be lamented, in consequence of which an <lb/>
interview had been avoided? Would it have compelled <lb/>
me to explain the broken condition of his trunk? I knew <lb/>
not whether to rejoice at having avoided this interview, or to <lb/>
deplore it.</p>
<p>These thoughts did not divert me from examining the <lb/>
nature of the prize which I had gained. I relighted my <lb/>
candle and hied once more to the chamber. The first <reg orig="ob-|ject">object</reg>, <lb/>
which, on entering it, attracted my attention, was the <lb/>
cabinet broken into twenty fragments, on the hearth. I <lb/>
had left it on a low table, at a distant corner of the room.</p>
<p>No conclusion could be formed, but that Clithero had <lb/>
been here, had discovered the violence which had been <lb/>
committed on his property, and, in the first transport of his <reg orig="in-|dignation">indignation</reg>, <lb/>
had shattered it to pieces. I shuddered on <reg orig="re-|flecting">reflecting</reg> <lb/>
how near I had been to being detected by him in <lb/>
the very act, and by how small an interval I had escaped <lb/>
that resentment, which, in that case, would have probably <lb/>
been wreaked upon me.</p>
<p>My attention was withdrawn, at length, from this object, <lb/>
and fixed upon the contents of the box which I had dug up. <lb/>
<pb n="104" entity="eaf033v3_0117" pid="uva-lib:349849"/>
This was equally inaccessible with the other. I had not <lb/>
the same motives for caution and forbearance. I was <reg orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg> <lb/>
desperate, as the consequences of my indiscretion <lb/>
could not be aggravated, and my curiosity was more <reg orig="impe-|tuous">impetuous</reg>, <lb/>
with regard to the smaller than to the larger cabinet. <lb/>
I placed it on the ground and crushed it to pieces with my <lb/>
heel.</p>
<p>Something was within. I brought it to the light, and, <lb/>
after loosing numerous folds, at length drew forth a volume. <lb/>
No object, in the circle of nature, was more adapted than <lb/>
this, to rouse up all my faculties. My feelings were anew <lb/>
excited on observing that it was a manuscript. I bolted <lb/>
the door, and drawing near the light, opened and began to <lb/>
read.</p>
<p>A few pages was sufficient to explain the nature of the <lb/>
work. Clithero had mentioned that his lady had composed <lb/>
a vindication of her conduct towards her brother, when her <lb/>
intercession in his favor was solicited and refused. This <lb/>
performance had never been published, but had been read <lb/>
by many, and was preserved by her friends as a precious <lb/>
monument of her genius and her virtue. This manuscript <lb/>
was now before me.</p>
<p>That Clithero should preserve this manuscript, amidst the <lb/>
wreck of his hopes and fortunes, was apparently <reg orig="conforma-|ble">conformable</reg> <lb/>
to his temper. That, having formed the resolution to <lb/>
die, he should seek to hide this volume from the profane <lb/>
curiosity of survivors, was a natural proceeding. To bury <lb/>
it rather than to burn, or disperse it into fragments, would <lb/>
be suggested by the wish to conceal, without committing <lb/>
what his heated fancy would regard as sacrilege. To bury <lb/>
it beneath the elm, was dictated by no fortuitous or <reg orig="inex-|plicable">inexplicable</reg> <lb/>
caprice. This event could scarcely fail of <reg orig="exer-|cising">exercising</reg> <lb/>
some influence on the perturbations of his sleep, and <lb/>
thus, in addition to other causes, might his hovering near this <lb/>
trunk, and throwing up this earth, in the intervals of <reg orig="slum-|ber">slumber</reg>, <lb/>
be accounted for. Clithero, indeed, had not <reg orig="men-|tioned">mentioned</reg> <lb/>
this proceeding in the course of his narrative; but <lb/>
that would have contravened the end for which he had <reg orig="pro-|vided">provided</reg> <lb/>
a grave for this book.</p>
<p>I read this copious tale with unspeakable eagerness. It <lb/>
essentially agreed with that which had been told by Clithero. <lb/>
<pb n="105" entity="eaf033v3_0118" pid="uva-lib:349850"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">10*</fw></pb>
By drawing forth events into all their circumstances, more <lb/>
distinct impressions were produced on the mind, and proofs <lb/>
of fortitude and equanimity were here given, to which I <lb/>
had hitherto known no parallel. No wonder that a soul <lb/>
like Clithero's, pervaded by these proofs of inimitable <reg orig="excel-|lence">excellence</reg>, <lb/>
and thrillingly alive to the passion of virtuous fame, <lb/>
and the value of that existence which he had destroyed, <lb/>
should be overborne by horror at the view of the past.</p>
<p>The instability of life and happiness was forcibly <reg orig="illus-|trated">illustrated</reg>, <lb/>
as well as the perniciousness of error. Exempt as this <lb/>
lady was from almost every defect, she was indebted for <lb/>
her ruin to absurd opinions of the sacredness of <reg orig="consanguini-|ty">consanguinity</reg>, <lb/>
to her anxiety for the preservation of a ruffian, because <lb/>
that ruffian was her brother. The spirit of Clithero was <lb/>
enlightened and erect, but he weakly suffered the dictates <lb/>
of eternal justice to be swallowed up by gratitude. The <lb/>
dread of unjust upbraiding hurried him to murder and to <lb/>
suicide, and the imputation of imaginary guilt, impelled him <lb/>
to the perpetration of genuine and enormous crimes.</p>
<p>The perusal of this volume ended not but with the night. <lb/>
Contrary to my hopes, the next day was stormy and wet. <lb/>
This did not deter me from visiting the mountain. Slippery <lb/>
paths and muddy torrents were no obstacles to the purposes <lb/>
which I had adopted. I wrapt myself, and a bag of <reg orig="pro-|visions">provisions</reg>, <lb/>
in a cloak of painted canvass and speeded to the <lb/>
dwelling of Clithero.</p>
<p>I passed through the cave and reached the bridge which <lb/>
my own ingenuity had formed. At that moment, torrents of <lb/>
rain poured from above, and stronger blasts thundered <lb/>
amidst these desolate recesses and profound chasms. <reg orig="In-|stead">Instead</reg> <lb/>
of lamenting the prevalence of this tempest, I now <lb/>
began to regard it with pleasure. It conferred new forms <lb/>
of sublimity and grandeur on this scene.</p>
<p>As I crept with hands and feet, along my imperfect bridge, <lb/>
a sudden gust had nearly whirled me into the frightful abyss <lb/>
below. To preserve myself, I was obliged to loose my hold <lb/>
of my burthen and it fell into the gulf. This incident <reg orig="dis-|concerted">disconcerted</reg> <lb/>
and distressed me. As soon as I had effected <lb/>
my dangerous passage, I screened myself behind a cliff, and <lb/>
gave myself up to reflection.</p>
<pb n="106" entity="eaf033v3_0119" pid="uva-lib:349851"/>
<p>The purpose of this arduous journey was defeated, by <lb/>
the loss of the provisions I had brought. I despaired of <lb/>
winning the attention of the fugitive to supplications, or <lb/>
arguments tending to smother remorse, or revive his <reg orig="forti-|tude">fortitude</reg>. <lb/>
The scope of my efforts was to consist in <reg orig="vanquish-|ing">vanquishing</reg> <lb/>
his aversion to food; but these efforts would now be <reg orig="use-|less">useless</reg>, <lb/>
since I had no power to supply his cravings.</p>
<p>This deficiency, however, was easily supplied. I had <lb/>
only to return home and supply myself anew. No time <lb/>
was to be lost in doing this; but I was willing to remain <lb/>
under this shelter, till the fury of the tempest had subsided. <lb/>
Besides, I was not certain that Clithero had again retreated <lb/>
hither. It was requisite to explore the summit of this hill, <lb/>
and ascertain whether it had any inhabitant. I might <reg orig="like-|wise">likewise</reg> <lb/>
discover what had been the success of my former <reg orig="ex-|periment">experiment</reg>, <lb/>
and whether the food, which had been left here <lb/>
on the former day, was consumed or neglected.</p>
<p>While occupied with these reflections, my eyes were fixed <lb/>
upon the opposite steeps. The tops of the trees, waving to <lb/>
and fro, in the wildest commotion, and their trunks, <reg orig="occa-|sionally">occasionally</reg> <lb/>
bending to the blast, which, in these lofty regions, <lb/>
blew with a violence unknown in the tracts below, exhibited <lb/>
an awful spectacle. At length, my attention was attracted <lb/>
by the trunk which lay across the gulf, and which I had <lb/>
converted into a bridge. I perceived that it had already <lb/>
somewhat swerved from its original position, that every blast <lb/>
broke or loosened some of the fibres by which its roots was <lb/>
connected with the opposite bank, and that, if the storm did <lb/>
not speedily abate, there was imminent danger of its being <lb/>
torn from the rock and precipitated into the chasm. Thus <lb/>
my retreat would be cut off, and the evils, from which I was <lb/>
endeavoring to rescue another, would be experienced by <lb/>
myself.</p>
<p>I did not just then reflect that Clithero had found access <lb/>
to this hill by other means, and that the avenue by which he <lb/>
came, would be equally commodious to me. I believed <lb/>
my destiny to hang upon the expedition with which I should <lb/>
recross this gulf. The moments that were spent in these <lb/>
deliberations were critical, and I shuddered to observe that <lb/>
the trunk was held in its place by one or two fibres which <lb/>
were already stretched almost to breaking.</p>
<pb n="107" entity="eaf033v3_0120" pid="uva-lib:349852"/>
<p>To pass along the trunk, rendered slippery by the wet, <lb/>
and unsteadfast by the wind, was eminently dangerous. To <lb/>
maintain my hold, in passing, in defiance of the whirlwind, <lb/>
required the most vigorous exertions. For this end it was <lb/>
necessary to discommode myself of my cloak, and of the <lb/>
volume, which I carried in the pocket of my cloak. I <reg orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg> <lb/>
there was no reason to dread their being destroyed <lb/>
or purloined, if left, for a few hours or a day, in this recess. <lb/>
If laid beside a stone, under shelter of this cliff, they would, <lb/>
no doubt, remain unmolested till the disappearance of the <lb/>
storm should permit me to revisit this spot in the afternoon <lb/>
or on the morrow.</p>
<p>Just as I had disposed of these incumbrances, and had <lb/>
risen from my seat, my attention was again called to the <lb/>
opposite steep, by the most unwelcome object that, at this <lb/>
time, could possibly occur. Something was perceived <reg orig="mov-|ing">moving</reg> <lb/>
among the bushes and rocks, which, for a time, I hoped <lb/>
was no more than a raccoon or opossum; but which <reg orig="pre-|sently">presently</reg> <lb/>
appeared to be a panther. His grey coat, extended <lb/>
claws, fiery eyes, and a cry which he at that moment uttered, <lb/>
and which, by its resemblance to the human voice, is <reg orig="pecu-|liarly">peculiarly</reg> <lb/>
terrific, denoted him to be the most ferocious and <lb/>
untameable of that detested race.<ref target="n1" n="1">*</ref>
<note id="n1" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol">*</seg><p>The grey Cougar. This animal has all the essential characteristics of <lb/>
a tyger. Though somewhat inferior in size and strength, these are such <lb/>
as to make him equally formidable to man.</p></note>
</p>
<p>The industry of our hunters has nearly banished animals <lb/>
of prey from these precincts. The fastnesses of Norwalk, <lb/>
however, could not but afford refuge to some of them. Of <lb/>
late I had met them so rarely, that my fears were seldom <lb/>
alive, and I trod, without caution, the ruggedest and most <lb/>
solitary haunts. Still, however, I had seldom been <reg orig="unfur-|nished">unfurnished</reg> <lb/>
in my rambles with the means of defence.</p>
<p>My temper never delighted in carnage and blood. I <lb/>
found no pleasure in plunging into bogs, wading through <lb/>
rivulets, and penetrating thickets, for the sake of <reg orig="despatch-|ing">despatching</reg> <lb/>
woodcocks and squirrels. To watch their gambols and <lb/>
flittings, and invite them to my hand, was my darling <reg orig="amuse-|ment">amusement</reg> <lb/>
when loitering among the woods and the rocks. It <lb/>
was much otherwise, however, with regard to rattlesnakes <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="eaf033v3_0121" pid="uva-lib:349853"/>
and panthers. These I thought it no breach of duty to <reg orig="ex-|terminate">exterminate</reg> <lb/>
wherever they could be found. These judicious <lb/>
and sanguinary spoilers were equally the enemies of man <lb/>
and of the harmless race that sported in the trees, and many <lb/>
of their skins are still preserved by me as trophies of my <lb/>
juvenile prowess.</p>
<p>As hunting was never my trade or my sport, I never <lb/>
loaded myself with fowling-piece or rifle. Assiduous <reg orig="exer-|cise">exercise</reg> <lb/>
had made me master of a weapon of much easier <reg orig="car-|riage">carriage</reg>, <lb/>
and, within a moderate distance, more destructive and <lb/>
unerring. This was the tomahawk. With this I have often <lb/>
severed an oak branch, and cut the sinews of a catamount, <lb/>
at the distance of sixty feet.</p>
<p>The unfrequency with which I had lately encountered <lb/>
this foe, and the incumbrance of provision, made me <reg orig="ne-|glect">neglect</reg>, <lb/>
on this occasion, to bring with me my usual arms. <lb/>
The beast that was now before me, when stimulated by <lb/>
hunger, was accustomed to assail whatever could provide <lb/>
him with a banquet of blood. He would set upon the man <lb/>
and the deer with equal and irresistible ferocity. His <reg orig="sa-|gacity">sagacity</reg> <lb/>
was equal to his strength, and he seemed able to <lb/>
discover when his antagonist was armed and prepared for <lb/>
defence.</p>
<p>My past experience enabled me to estimate the full <lb/>
extent of my danger. He sat on the brow of the steep, <lb/>
eyeing the bridge, and apparently deliberating whether he <lb/>
should cross it. It was probable that he had scented my <lb/>
footsteps thus far, and should he pass over, his vigilance <lb/>
could scarcely fail of detecting my asylum. The pit into <lb/>
which Clithero had sunk from my view was at some <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg>. <lb/>
To reach it was the first impulse of my fear, but <lb/>
this could not be done without exciting the observation and <lb/>
pursuit of this enemy. I deeply regretted the untoward <lb/>
chance that had led me, when I first came over, to a <reg orig="differ-|ent">different</reg> <lb/>
shelter.</p>
<p>Should he retain his present station, my danger was <lb/>
scarcely lessened. To pass over in the face of a famished <lb/>
tyger was only to rush upon my fate. The falling of the <lb/>
trunk, which had lately been so anxiously deprecated, was <lb/>
now, with no less solicitude, desired. Every new gust, I <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="eaf033v3_0122" pid="uva-lib:349854"/>
hoped, would tear asunder its remaining bands, and, by <reg orig="cut-|ting">cutting</reg> <lb/>
off all communication between the opposite steeps, <lb/>
place me in security.</p>
<p>My hopes, however, were destined to be frustrated. The <lb/>
fibres of the prostrate tree, were obstinately tenacious of <lb/>
their hold, and presently the animal scrambled down the <lb/>
rock and proceeded to cross it.</p>
<p>Of all kinds of death, that which now menaced me was <lb/>
the most abhorred. To die by disease, or by the hand of <lb/>
a fellow creature, was propitious and lenient in comparison <lb/>
with being rent to pieces by the fangs of this savage. To <lb/>
perish, in this obscure retreat, by means so impervious to <lb/>
the anxious curiosity of my friends, to lose my portion of <lb/>
existence by so untoward and ignoble a destiny, was <reg orig="insup-|portable">insupportable</reg>. <lb/>
I bitterly deplored my rashness in coming hither <lb/>
unprovided for an encounter like this.</p>
<p>The evil of my present circumstances consisted chiefly <lb/>
in suspense. My death was unavoidable, but my <reg orig="imagina-|tion">imagination</reg> <lb/>
had leisure to torment itself by anticipations. One foot <lb/>
of the savage was slowly and cautiously moved after the <lb/>
other. He struck his claws so deeply into the bark that <lb/>
they were with difficulty withdrawn. At length he leaped <lb/>
upon the ground. We were now separated by an interval <lb/>
of scarcely eight feet. To leave the spot where I crouched, <lb/>
was impossible. Behind and beside me, the cliff rose <reg orig="per-|pendicularly">perpendicularly</reg>, <lb/>
and before me was this grim and terrific visage. <lb/>
I shrunk still closer to the ground and closed my eyes.</p>
<p>From this pause of horror I was aroused by the noise <lb/>
occasioned by a second spring of the animal. He leaped <lb/>
into the pit, in which I had so deeply regretted that I had <lb/>
not taken refuge, and disappeared. My rescue was so <reg orig="sud-|den">sudden</reg>, <lb/>
and so much beyond my belief or my hope, that I <lb/>
doubted, for a moment, whether my senses did not deceive <lb/>
me. This opportunity of escape was not to be neglected. <lb/>
I left my place, and scrambled over the trunk with a <reg orig="pre-|cipitation">precipitation</reg> <lb/>
which had liked to have proved fatal. The tree <lb/>
groaned and shook under me, the wind blew with <reg orig="unexam-|pled">unexampled</reg> <lb/>
violence, and I had scarcely reached the opposite steep <lb/>
when the roots were severed from the rock and the whole <lb/>
fell thundering to the bottom of the chasm.</p>
<p>My trepidations were not speedily quieted. I looked back <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="eaf033v3_0123" pid="uva-lib:349855"/>
with wonder on my hair-breadth escape, and on that <reg orig="singu-|lar">singular</reg> <lb/>
concurrence of events, which had placed me, in so short <lb/>
a period, in absolute security. Had the trunk fallen a <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
earlier, I should have been imprisoned on the hill or <lb/>
thrown headlong. Had its fall been delayed another <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
I should have been pursued; for the beast now issued <lb/>
from his den, and testified his surprise and disappointment <lb/>
by tokens, the sight of which made my blood run cold.</p>
<p>He saw me, and hastened to the verge of the chasm. <lb/>
He squatted on his hind-legs and assumed the attitude of one <lb/>
preparing to leap. My consternation was excited afresh by <lb/>
these appearances. It seemed at first as if the rift was too <lb/>
wide for any power of muscles to carry him in safety over; <lb/>
but I knew the unparalleled agility of this animal, and that <lb/>
his experience had made him a better judge of the <reg orig="practica-|bility">practicability</reg> <lb/>
of this exploit than I was.</p>
<p>Still there was hope that he would relinquish this design <lb/>
as desperate. This hope was quickly at an end. He <lb/>
sprung, and his fore-legs touched the verge of the rock on <lb/>
which I stood. In spite of vehement exertions, however, <lb/>
the surface was too smooth and too hard to allow him to make <lb/>
good his hold. He fell, and a piercing cry, uttered below, <lb/>
shewed that nothing had obstructed his descent to the <lb/>
bottom.</p>
<p>Thus was I again rescued from death. Nothing but the <lb/>
pressure of famine could have prompted this savage to so <lb/>
audacious and hazardous an effort; but, by yeilding to this <reg orig="im-|pulse">impulse</reg>, <lb/>
he had made my future visits to this spot exempt <lb/>
from peril. Clithero was, likewise, relieved from a danger <lb/>
that was imminent and unforeseen. Prowling over these <lb/>
grounds the panther could scarcely have failed to meet with <lb/>
this solitary fugitive.</p>
<p>Had the animal lived, my first duty would have been to <lb/>
have sought him out, and assailed him with my tomahawk; <lb/>
but no undertaking would have been more hazardous. <lb/>
Lurking in the grass, or in the branches of a tree, his eye <lb/>
might have descried my approach, he might leap upon me <lb/>
unperceived, and my weapon would be useless.</p>
<p>With a heart beating with unwonted rapidity, I once more <lb/>
descended the cliff, entered the cavern, and arrived at <lb/>
Huntly farm, drenched with rain, and exhausted by fatigue.</p>
<pb n="111" entity="eaf033v3_0124" pid="uva-lib:349856"/>
<p>By night the storm was dispelled; but my exhausted <lb/>
strength would not allow me to return to the mountain. At <lb/>
the customary hour I retired to my chamber. I incessantly <lb/>
ruminated on the adventures of the last day, and inquired <lb/>
into the conduct which I was next to pursue.</p>
<p>The bridge being destroyed, my customary access was <lb/>
cut off. There was no possibility of restoring this bridge. <lb/>
My strength would not suffice to drag a fallen tree from <lb/>
a distance, and there was none whose position would abridge <lb/>
or supersede that labor. Some other expedient must, <lb/>
therefore, be discovered to pass this chasm.</p>
<p>I reviewed the circumstances of my subterranean journey. <lb/>
The cavern was imperfectly explored. Its branches might <lb/>
be numerous. That which I had hitherto pursued, <reg orig="ter-|minated">terminated</reg> <lb/>
in an opening at a considerable distance from the <lb/>
bottom. Other branches might exist, some of which might <lb/>
lead to the foot of the precipice, and thence a <reg orig="communica-|tion">communication</reg> <lb/>
might be found with the summit of the interior hill.</p>
<p>The danger of wandering into dark and untried paths, <lb/>
and the commodiousness of that road which had at first been <lb/>
taken, were sufficient reasons for having hitherto suspended <lb/>
my examination of the different branches of this labyrinth. <lb/>
Now my customary road was no longer practicable, and <lb/>
another was to be carefully explored. For this end, on my <lb/>
next journey to the mountain, I determined to take with me <lb/>
a lamp, and unravel this darksome maze; this project I <reg orig="re-|solved">resolved</reg> <lb/>
to execute the next day.</p>
<p>I now recollected what, if it had more seasonably <reg orig="occur-|red">occurred</reg>, <lb/>
would have taught me caution. Some months before <lb/>
this a farmer, living in the skirts of Norwalk, discovered <lb/>
two marauders in his field, whom he imagined to be a male <lb/>
and female panther. They had destroyed some sheep, and <lb/>
had been hunted by the farmer, with long and fruitless <reg orig="dili-|gence">diligence</reg>. <lb/>
Sheep had likewise been destroyed in different <lb/>
quarters; but the owners had fixed the imputation of the <lb/>
crime upon dogs, many of whom had atoned for their <reg orig="sup-|posed">supposed</reg> <lb/>
offences by their death. He who had mentioned his <lb/>
discovery of panthers, received little credit from his <reg orig="neigh-|bors">neighbors</reg>; <lb/>
because a long time had elapsed since these animals <lb/>
were supposed to have been exiled from this district, and <lb/>
because no other person had seen them. The truth of this <lb/>
<pb n="112" entity="eaf033v3_0125" pid="uva-lib:349857"/>
seemed now to be confirmed by the testimony of my own <lb/>
senses; but, if the rumor were true, there still existed <lb/>
another of these animals, who might harbor in the <reg orig="obscuri-|ties">obscurities</reg> <lb/>
of this desert, and against whom it was necessary to <lb/>
employ some precaution. Henceforth I resolved never to <lb/>
traverse the wilderness unfurnished with my tomahawk.</p>
<p>These images, mingled with those which the <reg orig="contempla-|tion">contemplation</reg> <lb/>
of futurity suggested, floated, for a time, in my brain; <lb/>
but at length gave place to sleep.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Since</hi> my return home, my mind had been fully occupied <lb/>
by schemes and reflections relative to Clithero. The project <lb/>
suggested by thee, and to which I had determined to devote <lb/>
my leisure, was forgotten, or remembered for a moment and <lb/>
at wide intervals. What, however, was nearly banished <lb/>
from my waking thoughts, occurred, in an incongruous and <lb/>
half seen form, to my dreams. During my sleep, the image <lb/>
of Waldegrave flitted before me. Methought the sentiment <lb/>
that impelled him to visit me, was not affection or <reg orig="com-|placency">complacency</reg>, <lb/>
but inquietude and anger. Some service or duty <lb/>
remained to be performed by me, which I had culpably <lb/>
neglected; to inspirit my zeal, to awaken my remembrance, <lb/>
and incite me to the performance of this duty, did this <reg orig="glim-|mering">glimmering</reg> <lb/>
messenger, this half indignant apparition, come.</p>
<p>I commonly awake soon enough to mark the youngest <lb/>
dawn of the morning. Now, in consequence perhaps of my <lb/>
perturbed sleep, I opened my eyes before the stars had lost <lb/>
any of their lustre. This circumstance produced some <reg orig="sur-|prise">surprise</reg>, <lb/>
until the images that lately hovered in my fancy, were <lb/>
recalled, and furnished somewhat like a solution of the <lb/>
problem. Connected with the image of my dead friend, <lb/>
was that of his sister. The discourse that took place at our <lb/>
last interview; the scheme of transcribing, for thy use, all <lb/>
the letters which, during his short but busy life, I received <lb/>
from him; the nature of this correspondence, and the <reg orig="op-|portunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
which this employment would afford me of <reg orig="con-|templating">contemplating</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="eaf033v3_0126" pid="uva-lib:349858"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">11</fw></pb>
these ample and precious monuments of the <reg orig="in-|tellectual">intellectual</reg> <lb/>
existence and moral preeminence of my friend, <lb/>
occurred to my thoughts.</p>
<p>The resolution to prosecute the task was revived. The <lb/>
obligation of benevolence, with regard to Clithero, was not <lb/>
discharged. This, neither duty nor curiosity would permit <lb/>
to be overlooked or delayed; but why should my whole <lb/>
attention and activity be devoted to this man. The hours <lb/>
which were spent at home and in my chamber, could not <lb/>
be more usefully employed than in making my intended <lb/>
copy.</p>
<p>In a few hours after sunrise I purposed to resume my <lb/>
way to the mountain. Could this interval be appropriated <lb/>
to a better purpose than in counting over my friend's letters, <lb/>
setting them apart from my own, and preparing them for <lb/>
that transcription from which I expected so high and yet so <lb/>
mournful a gratification.</p>
<p>This purpose, by no violent union, was blended with the <lb/>
recollection of my dream. This recollection infused some <lb/>
degree of wavering and dejection into my mind. In <reg orig="trans-|cribing">transcribing</reg> <lb/>
these letters I should violate pathetic and solemn <reg orig="in-|junctions">injunctions</reg> <lb/>
frequently repeated by the writer. Was there <lb/>
some connexon between this purpose and the incidents of <lb/>
my vision. Was the latter sent to enforce the interdictions <lb/>
which had been formerly imposed?</p>
<p>Thou art not fully acquainted with the intellectual history <lb/>
of thy brother. Some information on that head will be <reg orig="ne-|cessary">necessary</reg> <lb/>
to explain the nature of that reluctance which I now <lb/>
feel to comply with thy request, and which had formerly so <lb/>
much excited thy surprise.</p>
<p>Waldegrave, like other men, early devoted to meditation <lb/>
and books, had adopted, at different periods, different <reg orig="sys-|tems">systems</reg> <lb/>
of opinion, on topics connected with religion and <lb/>
morals. His earliest creeds, tended to efface the <reg orig="impres-|sions">impressions</reg> <lb/>
of his education; to deify necessity and universalize <lb/>
matter; to destroy the popular distinctions between soul and <lb/>
body, and to dissolve the supposed connexion between the <lb/>
moral condition of man, anterior and subsequent to death.</p>
<p>This creed he adopted with all the fulness of conviction, <lb/>
and propagated with the utmost zeal. Soon after our <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="eaf033v3_0127" pid="uva-lib:349859"/>
friendship commenced, fortune placed us at a distance from <lb/>
each other, and no intercourse was allowed but by the pen. <lb/>
Our letters, however, were punctual and copious. Those <lb/>
of Waldegrave were too frequently devoted to the defence <lb/>
of his favorite tenets.</p>
<p>Thou art acquainted with the revolution that afterwards <lb/>
took place in his mind. Placed within the sphere of <reg orig="reli-|gious">religious</reg> <lb/>
influence, and listening daily to the reasonings and <lb/>
exhortations of Mr. S&mdash;, whose benign temper and <lb/>
blameless deportment was a visible and constant lesson, he <lb/>
insensibly resumed the faith which he had relinquished, and <lb/>
became the vehement opponent of all that he had formerly <lb/>
defended. The chief object of his labors, in this new state <lb/>
of his mind, was to counteract the effect of his former <reg orig="rea-|sonings">reasonings</reg> <lb/>
on my opinions.</p>
<p>At this time, other changes took place in his situation, in <lb/>
consequence of which we were once more permitted to <reg orig="re-|side">reside</reg> <lb/>
under the same roof. The intercourse now ceased to <lb/>
be by letter, and the subtle and laborious argumentations <lb/>
which he had formerly produced against religion, and which <lb/>
were contained in a permanent form, were combatted in <lb/>
transient conversation. He was not only eager to subvert <lb/>
those opinions, which he had contributed to instil into me, <lb/>
but was anxious that the letters and manuscripts, which had <lb/>
been employed in their support, should be destroyed. He <lb/>
did not fear wholly or chiefly on my own account. He <reg orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg> <lb/>
that the influence of former reasonings on my faith <lb/>
would be sufficiently eradicated by the new; but he dreaded <lb/>
lest these manuscripts might fall into other hands, and thus <lb/>
produce mischiefs which it would not be in his power to <lb/>
repair. With regard to me, the poison had been followed <lb/>
by its antidote; but with respect to others, these letters <lb/>
would communicate the poison when the antidote could not <lb/>
be administered.</p>
<p>I would not consent to this sacrifice. I did not entirely <lb/>
abjure the creed which had, with great copiousness and <lb/>
eloquence, been defended in these letters. Besides, mixed <lb/>
up with abstract reasonings, were numberless passages which <lb/>
elucidated the character and history of my friend. These <lb/>
were too precious to be consigned to oblivion, and to take <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="eaf033v3_0128" pid="uva-lib:349860"/>
them out of their present connexion and arrangement, <lb/>
would be to mutilate and deform them.</p>
<p>His entreaties and remonstrances were earnest and <reg orig="fre-|quent">frequent</reg>, <lb/>
but always ineffectual. He had too much purity of <lb/>
motives to be angry at my stubbornness, but his sense of the <lb/>
mischievious tendency of these letters, was so great, that <lb/>
my intractability cost him many a pang.</p>
<p>He was now gone, and I had not only determined to <lb/>
preserve these monuments, but had consented to copy them <lb/>
for the use of another; for the use of one whose present <lb/>
and eternal welfare had been the chief object of his cares <lb/>
and efforts. Thou, like others of thy sex, art <reg orig="unaccustom-|ed">unaccustomed</reg> <lb/>
to metaphysical refinements. Thy religion is the growth <lb/>
of sensibility and not of argument. Thou art not fortified <lb/>
and prepossessed against the subtleties, with which the being <lb/>
and attributes of the deity have been assailed. Would it <lb/>
be just to expose thee to pollution and depravity from this <lb/>
source? To make thy brother the instrument of thy <reg orig="apos-|tacy">apostacy</reg>, <lb/>
the author of thy fall? That brother, whose latter <lb/>
days were so ardently devoted to cherishing the spirit of <lb/>
devotion in thy heart?</p>
<p>These ideas now occurred with more force than formerly. <lb/>
I had promised, not without reluctance, to give thee the <lb/>
entire copy of his letters; but I now receded from this <reg orig="pro-|mise">promise</reg>. <lb/>
I resolved merely to select for thy perusal such as <lb/>
were narrative or descriptive. This could not be done with <lb/>
too much expedition. It was still dark, but my sleep was <lb/>
at an end, and, by a common apparatus, that lay beside my <lb/>
bed, I could instantly produce a light.</p>
<p>The light was produced, and I proceeded to the cabinet <lb/>
where all my papers and books are deposited. This was <lb/>
my own contrivance and workmanship, undertaken by the <lb/>
advice of Sarsefield, who took infinite pains to foster that <lb/>
mechanical genius, which displayed itself so early and so <lb/>
forcibly in thy friend. The key belonging to this, was, like <lb/>
the cabinet itself, of singular structure. For greater safety, <lb/>
it was constantly placed in a closet, which was likewise <lb/>
locked.</p>
<p>The key was found as usual, and the cabinet opened. <lb/>
The letters were bound together in a compact form, lodged <lb/>
in a parchment case, and placed in a secret drawer. This <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="eaf033v3_0129" pid="uva-lib:349861"/>
drawer would not have been detected by common eyes, and <lb/>
it opened by the motion of a spring, of whose existence <lb/>
none but the maker was conscious. This drawer I had <lb/>
opened before I went to sleep and the letters were then safe.</p>
<p>Thou canst not imagine my confusion and astonishment, <lb/>
when, on opening the drawer, I perceived that the packet <lb/>
was gone. I looked with more attention, and put my hand <lb/>
within it, but the space was empty. Whither had it gone, <lb/>
and by whom was it purloined? I was not conscious of <lb/>
having taken it away, yet no hands but mine could have <lb/>
done it. On the last evening I had doubtless removed it to <lb/>
some other corner, but had forgotten it. I tasked my <reg orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg> <lb/>
and my memory. I could not conceive the <reg orig="possi-|bility">possibility</reg> <lb/>
of any motives inducing me to alter my arrangements <lb/>
in this respect, and was unable to recollect that I had made <lb/>
this change.</p>
<p>What remained? This invaluable relic had <reg orig="disappear-|ed">disappeared</reg>. <lb/>
Every thought and every effort must be devoted to the <lb/>
single purpose of regaining it. As yet I did not despair. <lb/>
Until I had opened and ransacked every part of the <reg orig="cabi-|net">cabinet</reg> <lb/>
in vain, I did not admit the belief that I had lost it. <lb/>
Even then this persuasion was tumultuous and fluctuating. <lb/>
It had vanished to my senses, but these senses were abused <lb/>
and depraved. To have passed, of its own accord, through <lb/>
the pores of this wood, was impossible; but if it were gone, <lb/>
thus did it escape.</p>
<p>I was lost in horror and amazement. I explored every <lb/>
nook a second and a third time, but still it eluded my eye <lb/>
and my touch. I opened my closets and cases. I pryed <lb/>
every where, unfolded every article of clothing, turned and <lb/>
scrutinized every instrument and tool, but nothing availed.</p>
<p>My thoughts were not speedily collected or calmed. I <lb/>
threw myself on the bed and resigned myself to musing. <lb/>
That my loss was irretrievable, was a supposition not to be <lb/>
endured. Yet ominous terrors haunted me. A whispering <lb/>
intimation that a relic which I valued more than life was <lb/>
torn forever away by some malignant and inscrutable destiny. <lb/>
The same power that had taken it from this receptacle, was <lb/>
able to waft it over the ocean or the mountains, and <reg orig="con-|demn">condemn</reg> <lb/>
me to a fruitless and eternal search.</p>
<p>But what was he that committed the theft? Thou only, <lb/>
<pb n="117" entity="eaf033v3_0130" pid="uva-lib:349862"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">11*</fw></pb>
of the beings who live, wast acquainted with the existence of <lb/>
these manuscripts. Thou art many miles distant, and art <lb/>
utterly a stranger to the mode or place of their <reg orig="conceal-|ment">concealment</reg>. <lb/>
Not only access to the cabinet, but access to the <lb/>
room, without my knowledge and permission, was impossible. <lb/>
Both were locked during this night. Not five hours had <lb/>
elapsed since the cabinet and drawer had been opened, and <lb/>
since the letters had been seen and touched, being in their <lb/>
ordinary position. During this interval, the thief had <reg orig="enter-|ed">entered</reg>, <lb/>
and despoiled me of my treasure.</p>
<p>This event, so inexplicable and so dreadful, threw my <lb/>
soul into a kind of stupor or distraction, from which I was <lb/>
suddenly roused by a foot-step, softly moving in the entry <lb/>
near my door. I started from my bed, as if I had gained a <lb/>
glimpse of the robber. Before I could run to the door, some <lb/>
one knocked. I did not think upon the propriety of <reg orig="an-|swering">answering</reg> <lb/>
the signal, but hastened with tremulous fingers and <lb/>
throbbing heart to open the door. My uncle, in his <reg orig="night-|dress">nightdress</reg>, <lb/>
and apparently just risen from his bed, stood before <lb/>
me!</p>
<p>He marked the eagerness and perturbation of my looks, <lb/>
and inquired into the cause. I did not answer his inquiries. <lb/>
His appearance in my chamber and in this guise, added to <lb/>
my surprise. My mind was full of the late discovery, and <lb/>
instantly conceived some connexion between this <reg orig="unseasona-|ble">unseasonable</reg> <lb/>
visit and my lost manuscript. I interrogated him in my <lb/>
turn as to the cause of his coming.</p>
<p>Why, said he, I came to ascertain whether it was you or <lb/>
not who amused himself so strangely at this time of night. <lb/>
What is the matter with you? Why are you up so early?</p>
<p>I told him that I had been roused by my dreams, and <lb/>
finding no inclination to court my slumber back again, I had <lb/>
risen, though earlier by some hours than the usual period of <lb/>
my rising.</p>
<p>But why did you go up stairs? You might easily imagine <lb/>
that the sound of your steps would alarm those below, who <lb/>
would be puzzled to guess who it was that had thought <lb/>
proper to amuse himself in this manner.</p>
<p>Up stairs? I have not left my room this night. It is not <lb/>
<pb n="118" entity="eaf033v3_0131" pid="uva-lib:349863"/>
ten minutes since I awoke, and my door has not since been <lb/>
opened.</p>
<p>Indeed! That is strange. Nay, it is impossible. It <lb/>
was your feet surely that I heard pacing so solemnly and <lb/>
indefatigably across the <hi rend="italic">long-room</hi> for near an hour. I could <lb/>
not for my life conjecture, for a time, who it was, but finally <lb/>
concluded that it was you. There was still, however, some <lb/>
doubt, and I came hither to satisfy myself.</p>
<p>These tidings were adapted to raise all my emotions to a <lb/>
still higher pitch. I questioned him with eagerness as to <lb/>
the circumstances he had noticed. He said he had been <lb/>
roused by a sound, whose power of disturbing him arose, <lb/>
not from its loudness, but from its uncommonness. He <reg orig="dis-|tinctly">distinctly</reg> <lb/>
heard some one pacing to and fro with bare feet, in <lb/>
the long room; this sound continued, with little <reg orig="intermis-|sion">intermission</reg>, <lb/>
for an hour. He then noticed a cessation of the <reg orig="walk-|ing">walking</reg>, <lb/>
and a sound as if some one were lifting the lid of the <lb/>
large cedar chest, that stood in the corner of this room. <lb/>
The walking was not resumed, and all was silent. He <reg orig="list-|ened">listened</reg> <lb/>
for a quarter of an hour, and busied himself in <reg orig="con-|jecturing">conjecturing</reg> <lb/>
the cause of this disturbance. The most probable <lb/>
conclusion was, that the walker was his nephew, and his <lb/>
curiosity had led him to my chamber to ascertain the truth.</p>
<p>This dwelling has three stories. The two lower stories <lb/>
are divided into numerous apartments. The upper story <lb/>
constitutes a single room whose sides are the four walls of <lb/>
the house, and whose ceiling is the roof. This room is <lb/>
unoccupied, except by lumber, and imperfectly lighted by a <lb/>
small casement at one end. In this room, were footsteps <lb/>
heard by my uncle.</p>
<p>The staircase leading to it terminated in a passage near <lb/>
my door. I snatched the candle, and desiring him to follow <lb/>
me, added, that I would ascertain the truth in a moment. <lb/>
He followed, but observed that the walking had ceased long <lb/>
enough for the person to escape.</p>
<p>I ascended to the room, and looked behind and among <lb/>
the tables, and chairs, and casks, which were confusedly <lb/>
scattered through it, but found nothing in the shape of man. <lb/>
The cedar chest, spoken of by Mr. Huntly, contained old <lb/>
books, and remnants of maps and charts, whose <reg orig="worthless-|ness">worthlessness</reg> <lb/>
unfitted them for accommodation elsewhere. The <lb/>
<pb n="119" entity="eaf033v3_0132" pid="uva-lib:349864"/>
lid was without hinges or lock. I examined this repository, <lb/>
but there was nothing which attracted my attention.</p>
<p>The way between the kitchen door, and the door of the <lb/>
long-room, had no impediments. Both were usually <reg orig="un-|fastened">unfastened</reg> <lb/>
but the motives by which any stranger to the <reg orig="dwel-|ling">dwelling</reg>, <lb/>
or indeed any one within it, could be prompted to choose <lb/>
this place and hour, for an employment of this kind, were <lb/>
wholly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>When the family rose, inquiries were made but no <reg orig="satis-|faction">satisfaction</reg> <lb/>
was obtained. The family consisted only of four <lb/>
persons, my uncle, my two sisters, and myself. I <reg orig="men-|tioned">mentioned</reg> <lb/>
to them the loss I had sustained, but their <reg orig="conjec-|tures">conjectures</reg> <lb/>
were no less unsatisfactory on this than on the former <lb/>
incident.</p>
<p>There was no end to my restless meditations. <reg orig="Walde-|grave">Waldegrave</reg> <lb/>
was the only being, besides myself, acquainted with <lb/>
the secrets of my cabinet. During his life these manuscripts <lb/>
had been the objects of perpetual solicitude; to gain <reg orig="pos-|session">possession</reg>, <lb/>
to destroy, or secrete them, was the strongest of his <lb/>
wishes. Had he retained his sensibility on the approach of <lb/>
death, no doubt he would have renewed, with irresistible <lb/>
solemnity, his injunctions to destroy them.</p>
<p>Now, however, they had vanished. There were no <lb/>
materials of conjecture; no probabilities to be weighed, or <lb/>
suspicions to revolve. Human artifice or power was <reg orig="une-|qual">unequal</reg> <lb/>
to this exploit. Means less than preternatural would <lb/>
not furnish a conveyance for this treasure.</p>
<p>It was otherwise with regard to this unseasonable walker. <lb/>
His inducements indeed were beyond my power to <reg orig="con-|ceive">conceive</reg>, <lb/>
but to enter these doors and ascend these stairs, <reg orig="de-|manded">demanded</reg> <lb/>
not the faculties of any being more than human.</p>
<p>This intrusion, and the pillage of my cabinet were <reg orig="con-|temporary">contemporary</reg> <lb/>
events. Was there no more connexion between <lb/>
them than that which results from time? Was not the <reg orig="pur-|loiner">purloiner</reg> <lb/>
of my treasure and the wanderer the same person? <lb/>
I could not reconcile the former incident with the attributes <lb/>
of man, and yet a secret faith, not to be outrooted or <reg orig="sus-|pended">suspended</reg>, <lb/>
swayed me, and compelled me to imagine that the <lb/>
detection of this visitant, would unveil the thief.</p>
<p>These thoughts were pregnant with dejection and reverie. <lb/>
Clithero, during the day, was forgotten. On the <reg orig="succeed-|ing">succeeding</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="eaf033v3_0133" pid="uva-lib:349865"/>
night, my intentions, with regard to this man, returned. <lb/>
I derived some slender consolation from reflecting, that <lb/>
time, in its long lapse and ceaseless revolutions, might <reg orig="dis-|sipate">dissipate</reg> <lb/>
the gloom that environed me. Meanwhile I <reg orig="strug-|gled">struggled</reg> <lb/>
to dismiss the images connected with my loss and to <lb/>
think only of Clithero.</p>
<p>My impatience was as strong as ever to obtain another <lb/>
interview with this man. I longed with vehemence for the <lb/>
return of day. I believed that every moment added to his <lb/>
sufferings, intellectual and physical, and confided in the <lb/>
efficacy of my presence to alleviate or suspend them. The <lb/>
provisions I had left would be speedily consumed, and the <lb/>
abstinence of three days was sufficient to undermine the <lb/>
vital energies. I, sometimes, hesitated whether I ought not <lb/>
instantly to depart. It was night indeed, but the late storm <lb/>
had purified the air, and the radiance of a full moon was <lb/>
universal and dazzling.</p>
<p>From this attempt I was deterred by reflecting that my <lb/>
own frame needed the repairs of sleep. Toil and <reg orig="watchful-|ness">watchfulness</reg>, <lb/>
if prolonged another day, would deeply injure a <reg orig="con-|stitution">constitution</reg> <lb/>
by no means distinguished for its force. I must, <lb/>
therefore, compel, if it were possible, some hours of repose. <lb/>
I prepared to retire to bed, when a new incident occurred <lb/>
to divert my attention for a time from these designs.</p>
<ornament type="line"/>

<div1 type="chapter" n="XIV" id="d19">
<head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">While</hi> sitting alone by the parlor fire, marking the <lb/>
effects of moonlight, I noted one on horseback coming <lb/>
towards the gate. At first sight, methought his shape and <lb/>
guise were not wholly new to me; but all that I could <reg orig="dis-|cern">discern</reg> <lb/>
was merely a resemblance to some one whom I had <lb/>
before seen. Presently he stopped, and, looking towards <lb/>
the house, made inquiries of a passenger who chanced to <lb/>
be near. Being apparently satisfied with the answers he <lb/>
received, he rode with a quick pace, into the court and <lb/>
alighted at the door. I started from my seat, and, going <lb/>
forth, waited with some impatience to hear his purpose <reg orig="ex-|plained">explained</reg>.</p>
<pb n="121" entity="eaf033v3_0134" pid="uva-lib:349866"/>
<p>He accosted me with the formality of a stranger, and <lb/>
asked if a young man, by name Edgar Huntly, resided <lb/>
here. Being answered in the affirmative, and being <reg orig="re-|quested">requested</reg> <lb/>
to come in, he entered, and seated himself, <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
hesitation, by the fire. Some doubt and anxiety were <lb/>
visible in his looks. He seemed desirous of information <lb/>
upon some topic, and yet betrayed terror lest the answers <lb/>
he might receive should subvert some hope, or confirm <lb/>
some foreboding.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I scrutinized his features with much solicitude. <lb/>
A nearer and more deliberate view convinced me that the <lb/>
first impression was just; but still I was unable to call up <lb/>
his name or the circumstances of our former meeting. <lb/>
The pause was at length ended by his saying, in a faltering <lb/>
voice;&mdash;</p>
<p>My name is Weymouth. I came hither to obtain <reg orig="infor-|mation">information</reg> <lb/>
on a subject in which my happiness is deeply <reg orig="con-|cerned">concerned</reg>.</p>
<p>At the mention of his name, I started. It was a name <lb/>
too closely connected with the image of thy brother, not to <lb/>
call up affecting and vivid recollections. Weymouth thou <lb/>
knowest, was thy brother's friend. It is three years since <lb/>
this man left America, during which time no tidings had <lb/>
been heard of him, at least, by thy brother. He had now <lb/>
returned, and was probably unacquainted with the fate of <lb/>
his friend.</p>
<p>After an anxious pause, he continued&mdash;since my arrival <lb/>
I have heard of an event which has, on many accounts, <lb/>
given me the deepest sorrow. I loved Waldegrave, and <lb/>
know not any person in the world whose life was dearer to <lb/>
me than his. There were considerations, however, which <lb/>
made it more precious to me than the life of one whose <lb/>
merits might be greater. With his life, my own existence <lb/>
and property were, I have reason to think, inseparably <lb/>
united.</p>
<p>On my return to my country, after a long absence, I <lb/>
made immediate inquiries after him. I was informed of <lb/>
his untimely death. I had questions, of infinite moment <lb/>
to my happiness, to decide with regard to the state and <reg orig="dis-|position">disposition</reg> <lb/>
of his property. I sought out those of his friends <lb/>
who had maintained with him the most frequent and <reg orig="confi-|dential">confidential</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="eaf033v3_0135" pid="uva-lib:349867"/>
intercourse, but they could not afford me any <reg orig="satisfac-|tion">satisfaction</reg>. <lb/>
At length, I was informed that a young man of your <lb/>
name, and living in this district, had enjoyed more of his <lb/>
affection and society than any other, had regulated the <reg orig="pro-|perty">property</reg> <lb/>
which he left behind, and was best qualified to afford <lb/>
the intelligence which I sought. You, it seems, are this <lb/>
person, and of you I must make inquiries to which I <reg orig="con-|jure">conjure</reg> <lb/>
you to return sincere and explicit answers.</p>
<p>That, said I, I shall find no difficulty in doing. <reg orig="What-|ever">Whatever</reg> <lb/>
questions you shall think proper to ask, I will answer <lb/>
with readiness and truth.</p>
<p>What kind of property and to what amount was your <lb/>
friend possessed of at his death?</p>
<p>It was money, and consisted of deposits at the bank of <lb/>
North America. The amount was little short of eight <lb/>
thousand dollars?</p>
<p>On whom has this property devolved?</p>
<p>His sister was his only kindred, and she is now in <reg orig="pos-|session">possession</reg> <lb/>
of it?</p>
<p>Did he leave any will by which he directed the <reg orig="disposi-|tion">disposition</reg> <lb/>
of his property? While thus speaking, Weymouth <lb/>
fixed his eyes upon my countenance, and seemed anxious <lb/>
to pierce into my inmost soul. I was somewhat surprised <lb/>
at his questions, but much more at the manner in which <lb/>
they were put. I answered him, however, without delay. <lb/>
He left no will, nor was any paper discovered, by which <lb/>
we could guess at his intentions. No doubt, indeed, had <lb/>
he made a will his sister would have been placed precisely <lb/>
in the same condition in which she now is. He was not <lb/>
only bound to her by the strongest ties of kindred, but by <lb/>
affection and gratitude.</p>
<p>Weymouth now withdrew his eyes from my face, and <lb/>
sunk into a mournful reverie. He sighed often and deeply. <lb/>
This deportment and the strain of his inquiries excited <lb/>
much surprise. His interest in the fate of Waldegrave <lb/>
ought to have made the information he had received, a source <lb/>
of satisfaction rather than of regret. The property which <lb/>
Waldegrave left was much greater than his mode of life, <lb/>
and his own professions had given us reason to expect, but <lb/>
it was no more than sufficient to insure to thee an adequate <lb/>
subsistence. It ascertained the happiness of those who <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="eaf033v3_0136" pid="uva-lib:349868"/>
were dearest to Waldegrave, and placed them forever <reg orig="be-|yond">beyond</reg> <lb/>
the reach of that poverty which had hitherto beset <lb/>
them. I made no attempt to interrupt the silence, but <reg orig="pre-|pared">prepared</reg> <lb/>
to answer any new interrogatory. At length, <reg orig="Wey-|mouth">Weymouth</reg> <lb/>
resumed;&mdash;</p>
<p>Waldegrave was a fortunate man, to amass so <reg orig="considera-|ble">considerable</reg> <lb/>
a sum in so short a time. I remember, when we <reg orig="part-|ed">parted</reg>, <lb/>
he was poor. He used to lament that his scrupulous <lb/>
integrity precluded him from all the common roads to wealth. <lb/>
He did not contemn riches, but he set the highest value <lb/>
upon competence; and imagined that he was doomed <reg orig="for-|ever">forever</reg> <lb/>
to poverty. His religious duty compelled him to seek <lb/>
his livelihood by teaching a school of blacks. The labor <lb/>
was disproportioned to his feeble constitution, and the profit <lb/>
was greatly disproportioned to the labor. It scarcely <reg orig="sup-|plied">supplied</reg> <lb/>
the necessities of nature, and was reduced sometimes <lb/>
even below that standard by his frequent indisposition. I <lb/>
rejoice to find that his scruples had somewhat relaxed their <lb/>
force, and that he had betaken himself to some more <reg orig="pro-|fitable">profitable</reg> <lb/>
occupation. Pray, what was his new way of business?</p>
<p>Nay, said I, his scruples continued as rigid, in this <reg orig="re-|spect">respect</reg>, <lb/>
as ever. He was teacher of the Negro free-school <lb/>
when he died.</p>
<p>Indeed! How then came he to amass so much money? <lb/>
Could he blend any more lucrative pursuit with his duty as <lb/>
a school-master?</p>
<p>So it seems.</p>
<p>What was his pursuit?</p>
<p>That question, I believe, none of his friends are qualified <lb/>
to answer. I thought myself acquainted with the most <lb/>
secret transactions of his life, but this had been carefully <lb/>
concealed from me. I was not only unapprised of any <lb/>
other employment of his time, but had not the slightest <reg orig="sus-|picion">suspicion</reg> <lb/>
of his possessing any property besides his clothes and <lb/>
books. Ransacking his papers, with a different view, I <lb/>
lighted on his bank-book, in which was a regular receipt for <lb/>
seven thousand five hundred dollars. By what means he <lb/>
acquired this money, and even the acquisition of it, till his <lb/>
death put us in possession of his papers, was wholly <reg orig="un-|known">unknown</reg> <lb/>
to us.</p>
<pb n="124" entity="eaf033v3_0137" pid="uva-lib:349869"/>
<p>Possibly he might have held it in trust for another. In <lb/>
this case some memorandums or letters would be found <reg orig="ex-|plaining">explaining</reg> <lb/>
this affair.</p>
<p>True. This supposition could not fail to occur, in <reg orig="con-|sequence">consequence</reg> <lb/>
of which the most diligent search was made among <lb/>
his papers, but no shred or scrap was to be found which <lb/>
countenanced our conjecture.</p>
<p>Your may reasonably be surprised, and perhaps offended, <lb/>
said Weymouth, at these inquiries; but it is time to explain <lb/>
my motives for making them. Three years ago I was, like <lb/>
Waldegrave, indigent, and earned my bread by daily labor. <lb/>
During seven years service in a public office, I saved, from <lb/>
the expenses of subsistence, a few hundred dollars. I <reg orig="de-|termined">determined</reg> <lb/>
to strike into a new path, and, with this sum, to <lb/>
lay the foundation of better fortune. I turned it into a bulky <lb/>
commodity, freighted and loaded a small vessel, and went <lb/>
with it to Barcelona in Spain. I was not unsuccessful in <lb/>
my projects, and, changing my abode to England, France <lb/>
and Germany, according as my interest required, I became <lb/>
finally possessed of sufficient for the supply of all my wants. <lb/>
I then resolved to return to my native country, and, laying <lb/>
out my money in land, to spend the rest of my days in the <lb/>
luxury and quiet of an opulent farmer. For this end I <reg orig="in-|vested">invested</reg> <lb/>
the greatest part of my property in a cargo of wine <lb/>
from Madeira. The remainder I turned into a bill of <reg orig="ex-|change">exchange</reg> <lb/>
for seven thousand five hundred dollars. I had <lb/>
maintained a friendly correspondence with Waldegrave <reg orig="dur-|ing">during</reg> <lb/>
my absence. There was no one with whom I had <lb/>
lived on terms of so much intimacy, and had boundless <lb/>
confidence in his integrity. To him therefore I determined <lb/>
to transmit this bill, requesting him to take the money <lb/>
into safe keeping until my return. In this manner I <reg orig="en-|deavored">endeavored</reg> <lb/>
to provide against the accidents that might befall <lb/>
my person or my cargo in crossing the ocean.</p>
<p>It was my fate to encounter the worst of these disasters. <lb/>
We were overtaken by a storm, my vessel was driven ashore <lb/>
on the coast of Portugal, my cargo was utterly lost, and the <lb/>
greater part of the crew and passengers were drowned. I <lb/>
was rescued from the same fate by some fishermen. In <lb/>
consequence of the hardships to which I had been exposed, <lb/>
having labored for several days at the pumps, and spent the <lb/>
<pb n="125" entity="eaf033v3_0138" pid="uva-lib:349870"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">12</fw></pb>
greater part of a winter night, hanging from the rigging of <lb/>
the ship, and perpetually beaten by the waves, I contracted <lb/>
a severe disease, which bereaved me of the use of my <lb/>
limbs. The fishermen who rescued me, carried me to their <lb/>
huts, and there I remained three weeks helpless and <reg orig="misera-|ble">miserable</reg>.</p>
<p>That part of the coast on which I was thrown, was, in the <lb/>
highest degree, sterile and rude. Its few inhabitants <reg orig="sub-|sisted">subsisted</reg> <lb/>
precariously on the produce of the ocean. Their <lb/>
dwellings were of mud, low, filthy, dark and comfortless. <lb/>
Their fuel was the stalks of shrubs, sparingly scattered over <lb/>
a sandy desert. Their poverty scarcely allowed them salt <lb/>
and black bread with their fish, which was obtained in <reg orig="une-|qual">unequal</reg> <lb/>
and sometimes insufficient quantities, and which they <lb/>
ate with all its impurities, and half cooked.</p>
<p>My former habits, as well as my present indisposition, <lb/>
required very different treatment from what the ignorance <lb/>
and penury of these people obliged them to bestow. I lay <lb/>
upon the moist earth, imperfectly sheltered from the sky, <lb/>
and with neither raiment or fire to keep me warm. My <lb/>
hosts had little attention or compassion to spare to the wants <lb/>
of others. They could not remove me to a more hospitable <lb/>
district, and here, without doubt, I should have perished, had <lb/>
not a monk chanced to visit their hovels. He belonged to <lb/>
a convent of St. Jago, some leagues farther from the shore, <lb/>
who used to send one of its members annually to inspect <lb/>
the religious concerns of those outcasts. Happily this was <lb/>
the period of their visitations.</p>
<p>My abode in Spain had made me somewhat conversant <lb/>
with its language. The dialect of this monk did not so <lb/>
much differ from Castilian, but that, with the assistance of <lb/>
Latin, we were able to converse. The jargon of the <reg orig="fisher-|men">fishermen</reg> <lb/>
was unintelligible, and they had vainly endeavored to <lb/>
keep up my spirits by informing me of this expected visit.</p>
<p>This monk was touched with compassion at my calamity, <lb/>
and speedily provided the means of my removal to his <reg orig="con-|vent">convent</reg>. <lb/>
Here I was charitably entertained, and the aid of a <lb/>
physician was procured for me. He was but poorly skilled <lb/>
in his profession, and rather confirmed than alleviated my <lb/>
disease. The Portuguese of his trade, especially in <reg orig="re-|moter">remoter</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="126" entity="eaf033v3_0139" pid="uva-lib:349871"/>
districts, are little more than dealers in talismans and <lb/>
nostrums. For a long time I was unable to leave my pallet, <lb/>
and had no prospect before me but that of consuming my <lb/>
days in the gloom of this cloister.</p>
<p>All the members of this convent, but he who had been <lb/>
my first benefactor, and whose name was Chaledro, were <lb/>
bigoted and sordid. Their chief motive for treating me <lb/>
with kindness, was the hope of obtaining a convert from <lb/>
heresy. They spared no pains to subdue my errors, and <lb/>
were willing to prolong my imprisonment, in the hope of <lb/>
finally gaining their end. Had my fate been governed by <lb/>
those, I should have been immured in this convent, and <reg orig="com-|pelled">compelled</reg>, <lb/>
either to adopt their fanatical creed or to put an end <lb/>
to my own life, in order to escape their well meant <reg orig="persecu-|tions">persecutions</reg>. <lb/>
Chaledro, however, though no less sincere in his <lb/>
faith and urgent in his entreaties, yet finding me invincible, <lb/>
exerted his influence to obtain my liberty.</p>
<p>After many delays, and strenuous exertions of my friend, <lb/>
they consented to remove me to Oporto. The journey was <lb/>
to be performed in an open cart over a mountainous country, <lb/>
in the heats of summer. The monks endeavored to dissuade <lb/>
me from the enterprise, for my own sake, it being scarcely <lb/>
possible that one in my feeble state, should survive a journey <lb/>
like this; but I despaired of improving my condition by other <lb/>
means. I preferred death to the imprisonment of a <reg orig="Portu-|guese">Portuguese</reg> <lb/>
monastery, and knew that I could hope for no <reg orig="allevia-|tion">alleviation</reg> <lb/>
of my disease, but from the skill of Scottish or French <lb/>
physicians, whom I expected to meet with in that city. I <lb/>
adhered to my purpose with so much vehemence and <lb/>
obstinacy, that they finally yielded to my wishes.</p>
<p>My road lay through the wildest and most rugged <reg orig="dis-|tricts">districts</reg>. <lb/>
It did not exceed ninety miles, but seven days were <lb/>
consumed on the way. The motion of the vehicle racked <lb/>
me with the keenest pangs, and my attendants concluded <lb/>
that every stage would be my last. They had been selected <lb/>
without due regard to their characters. They were knavish <lb/>
and inhuman, and omitted nothing, but actual violence to <lb/>
hasten my death. They purposely retarded the journey, <lb/>
and protracted to seven, what might have been readily <reg orig="per-|formed">performed</reg> <lb/>
in four days. They neglected to execute the orders <lb/>
which they had received, respecting my lodging and <reg orig="provi-|sions">provisions</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="eaf033v3_0140" pid="uva-lib:349872"/>
and from them, as well as from the peasants, who were <lb/>
sure to be informed that I was a heretic, I suffered every <lb/>
species of insult and injury. My constitution, as well as my <lb/>
frame, possessed a fund of strength of which I had no <reg orig="pre-|vious">previous</reg> <lb/>
conception. In spite of hardship, and exposure, and <lb/>
abstinence, I at last arrived at Oporto.</p>
<p>Instead of being carried, agreeably to Chaledro's direction, <lb/>
to a convent of St. Jago, I was left, late in the evening, in <lb/>
the porch of a common hospital. My attendants, having <lb/>
laid me on the pavement, and loaded me with imprecations, <lb/>
left me to obtain admission by my own efforts. I passed <lb/>
the live-long night in this spot, and in the morning was <reg orig="re-|ceived">received</reg> <lb/>
into the house, in a state which left it uncertain <lb/>
whether I was alive or dead.</p>
<p>After recovering my sensibility, I made various efforts <lb/>
to procure a visit from some English merchant. This was <lb/>
no easy undertaking for one in my deplorable condition. <lb/>
I was too weak to articulate my words distinctly, and these <lb/>
words were rendered by my foreign accent, scarcely <reg orig="intel-|ligible">intelligible</reg>. <lb/>
The likelihood of my speedy death made the people <lb/>
about me more indifferent to my wants and petitions.</p>
<p>I will not dwell upon my repeated disappointments, but <lb/>
content myself with mentioning that I gained the attention of <lb/>
a French gentleman, whose curiosity brought him to view <lb/>
the hospital. Through him I obtained a visit from an <reg orig="Eng-|lish">English</reg> <lb/>
merchant, and finally gained the notice of a person, who <lb/>
formerly resided in America, and of whom I had imperfect <lb/>
knowledge. By their kindness I was removed from the <lb/>
hospital to a private house. A Scottish surgeon was <reg orig="sum-|moned">summoned</reg> <lb/>
to my assistance, and in seven months, I was restored <lb/>
to my present state of health.</p>
<p>At Oporto, I embarked, in an American ship, for <reg orig="New-|York">New-York</reg>. <lb/>
I was destitute of all property, and relied, for the <lb/>
payment of the debts which I was obliged to contract, as <lb/>
well as for my future subsistence, on my remittance, to <lb/>
Waldegrave. I hastened to Philadelphia, and was soon <lb/>
informed that my friend was dead. His death had taken <lb/>
place a long time since my remittance to him, hence this <lb/>
disaster was a subject of regret chiefly on his own account. <lb/>
I entertained no doubt but that my property had been <reg orig="se-|cured">secured</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="eaf033v3_0141" pid="uva-lib:349873"/>
and that either some testamentary directions, or <lb/>
some papers had been left behind respecting this affair.</p>
<p>I sought out those who were formerly our mutual <reg orig="ac-|quaintance">acquaintance</reg>, <lb/>
I found that they were wholly strangers to his <lb/>
affairs. They could merely relate some particulars of his <lb/>
singular death, and point out the lodgings which he formerly <lb/>
occupied. Hither I forthwith repaired, and discovered that <lb/>
he lived in this house with his sister, disconnected with its <lb/>
other inhabitants. They described his mode of life in terms <lb/>
that shewed them to be very imperfectly acquainted with it. <lb/>
It was easy indeed to infer, from their aspect and manners, <lb/>
that little sympathy or union could have subsisted between <lb/>
them and their co-tenants, and this inference was <reg orig="confirm-|ed">confirmed</reg> <lb/>
by their insinuations, the growth of prejudice and envy. <lb/>
They told me that Waldegrave's sister had gone to live in <lb/>
the country, but whither, or for how long, she had not <reg orig="con-|descended">condescended</reg> <lb/>
to inform them, and they did not care to ask. <lb/>
She was a topping dame, whose notions were much too <lb/>
high for her station. Who was more nice than wise, and <lb/>
yet was one who could stoop, when it most became her to <lb/>
stand upright. It was no business of theirs, but they could <lb/>
not but mention their suspicions that she had good reasons <lb/>
for leaving the city, and for concealing the place of her <reg orig="re-|treat">retreat</reg>. <lb/>
Some things were hard to be disguised. They <lb/>
spoke for themselves, and the only way to hinder <reg orig="disagree-|able">disagreeable</reg> <lb/>
discoveries, was to keep out of sight.</p>
<p>I was wholly a stranger to Waldegrave's sister. I knew <lb/>
merely that he had such a relation. There was nothing <reg orig="there-|fore">therefore</reg> <lb/>
to outbalance this unfavorable report, but the apparent <lb/>
malignity and grossness of those who gave it. It was not, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
her character about which I was solicitous, but merely <lb/>
the place where she might be found, and the suitable <reg orig="inqui-|ries">inquiries</reg> <lb/>
respecting her deceased brother, be answered. On <lb/>
this head, these people professed utter ignorance, and were <lb/>
either unable or unwilling to direct me to any person in the <lb/>
city who knew more than themselves. After much discourse <lb/>
they, at length, let fall an intimation that if any one knew <lb/>
her place of retreat, it was probably a country lad, by name <lb/>
Huntly, who lived near the <hi rend="italic">Forks</hi> of Delaware. After <lb/>
Waldegrave's death this lad had paid his sister a visit, and <lb/>
seemed to be admitted on a very confidential footing. She <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="eaf033v3_0142" pid="uva-lib:349874"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">12*</fw></pb>
left the house, for the last time, in his company, and he, <lb/>
therefore, was most likely to know what had become of <lb/>
her.</p>
<p>The name of Huntly was not totally unknown to me. I <lb/>
myself was born and brought up in the neighboring <reg orig="town-|ship">township</reg> <lb/>
of Chetasco. I had some knowledge of your family, <lb/>
and your name used often to be mentioned by Waldegrave, <lb/>
as that of one who, at a maturer age, would prove himself <lb/>
useful to his country. I determined therefore to apply to <lb/>
you for what information you could give. I designed to <lb/>
visit my father who lives in Chetasco, and relieve him from <lb/>
that disquiet which his ignorance of my fate could not fail <lb/>
to have inspired, and both these ends could be thus, at the <lb/>
same time, accomplished.</p>
<p>Before I left the city, I thought it proper to apply to the <lb/>
merchant on whom my bill had been drawn. If this bill <lb/>
had been presented and paid, he had doubtless preserved <lb/>
some record of it, and hence a clue might be afforded, <lb/>
though every other expedient should fail. My usual ill <lb/>
fortune pursued me upon this occasion, for the merchant <lb/>
had lately become insolvent, and, to avoid the rage of his <lb/>
creditors, had fled, without leaving any vestige of this or <lb/>
similar transactions behind him. He had, some years since, <lb/>
been an adventurer from Holland, and was suspected to <lb/>
have returned thither.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I came</hi> hither with a heart desponding of success. <reg orig="Ad-|versity">Adversity</reg> <lb/>
had weakened my faith in the promises of the future, <lb/>
and I was prepared to receive just such tidings as you have <lb/>
communicated. Unacquainted with the secret motives of <lb/>
Waldegrave and his sister, it is impossible for me to weigh the <lb/>
probabilities of their rectitude. I have only my own <reg orig="asser-|tion">assertion</reg> <lb/>
to produce in support of my claim. All other evidence, <lb/>
all vouchers and papers, which might attest my veracity, or <lb/>
sanction my claim in a court of law, are buried in the ocean. <lb/>
The bill was transmitted just before my departure from <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="eaf033v3_0143" pid="uva-lib:349875"/>
Maderia, and the letters by which it was accompanied, <lb/>
informed Waldegrave of my design to follow it immediately. <lb/>
Hence he did not, it is probable, acknowledge the receipt <lb/>
of my letters. The vessels in which they were sent, arrived <lb/>
in due season. I was assured that all letters were duly <lb/>
deposited in the post-office, where, at present, mine are not <lb/>
to be found.</p>
<p>You assure me that nothing has been found among his <lb/>
papers, hinting at any pecuniary transaction between him <lb/>
and me. Some correspondence passed between us previous <lb/>
to that event. Have no letters, with my signature, been <lb/>
found? Are you qualified, by your knowledge of his <lb/>
papers, to answer me explicitly? Is it not possible for <lb/>
some letters to have been mislaid?</p>
<p>I am qualified, said I, to answer your inquiries beyond <lb/>
any other person in the world. Waldegrave maintained <lb/>
only general intercourse with the rest of mankind. With <lb/>
me his correspondence was copious, and his confidence, as <lb/>
I imagined, without bounds. His books and papers were <lb/>
contained in a single chest, at his lodgings, the keys of <lb/>
which he had about him when he died. These keys I <lb/>
carried to his sister, and was authorised by her to open and <lb/>
examine the contents of this chest. This was done with <lb/>
the utmost care. These papers are now in my possession. <lb/>
Among them no paper, of the tenor you mention, was <lb/>
found, and no letter with your signature. Neither Mary <lb/>
Waldegrave nor I are capable of disguising the truth or <lb/>
committing an injustice. The moment she receives <reg orig="convic-|tion">conviction</reg> <lb/>
of your right, she will restore this money to you. The <lb/>
moment I imbibe this conviction, I will exert all my <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg>, <lb/>
and it is not small, to induce her to restore it. <reg orig="Per-|mit">Permit</reg> <lb/>
me, however, to question you in your turn. Who was <lb/>
the merchant on whom your bill was drawn, what was <lb/>
the date of it, and when did the bill and its counterparts <lb/>
arrive?</p>
<p>I do not exactly remember the date of the bills. They <lb/>
were made out, however, six days before I myself <reg orig="em-|barked">embarked</reg>, <lb/>
which happened on the tenth of August, 1784. <lb/>
They were sent by three vessels, one of which was <lb/>
bound to Charleston and the others to New York. The <lb/>
last arrived within two days of each other, and about the <lb/>
<pb n="131" entity="eaf033v3_0144" pid="uva-lib:349876"/>
middle of November in the same year. The name of the <lb/>
payer was Monteith.</p>
<p>After a pause of recollection, I answered, I will not <reg orig="hesi-|tate">hesitate</reg> <lb/>
to apprise you of every thing which may throw light <lb/>
upon this transaction, and whether favorable or otherwise to <lb/>
your claim. I have told you among my friend's papers <lb/>
your name is not to be found. I must likewise repeat that <lb/>
the possession of this money by Waldegrave was wholly <lb/>
unknown to us till his death. We are likewise unacquainted <lb/>
with any means by which he could get possession of so large <lb/>
a sum in his own right. He spent no more than his scanty <lb/>
stipend as a teacher, though this stipend was insufficient to <lb/>
supply his wants. This bank-receipt is dated in <reg orig="Decem-|ber">December</reg>, <lb/>
1784, a fortnight, perhaps, after the date that you have <lb/>
mentioned. You will perceive how much this coincidence, <lb/>
which could scarcely have taken place by chance, is <reg orig="favor-|able">favorable</reg> <lb/>
to your claim.</p>
<p>Mary Waldegrave resides, at present, at Abingdon. She <lb/>
will rejoice, as I do, to see one who, as her brother's friend, <lb/>
is entitled to her affection. Doubt not but that she will <lb/>
listen with impartiality and candor to all that you can urge <lb/>
in defence of your title to this money. Her decision will <lb/>
not be precipitate, but it will be generous and just, and <lb/>
founded on such reasons, that, even if it be adverse to your <lb/>
wishes, you will be compelled to approve it.</p>
<p>I can entertain no doubt, he answered, as to the equity <lb/>
of my claim. The coincidences you mention are sufficient <lb/>
to convince me that this sum was received upon my bill, <lb/>
but this conviction must necessarily be confined to myself. <lb/>
No one but I can be conscious to the truth of my own <lb/>
story. The evidence on which I build my faith, in this case, <lb/>
is that of my own memory and senses; but this evidence <lb/>
cannot make itself conspicuous to you. You have nothing <lb/>
but my bare assertion, in addition to some probabilities <lb/>
flowing from the conduct of Waldegrave. What facts may <lb/>
exist to corroborate my claim, which you have forgotten, or <lb/>
which you may think proper to conceal, I cannot judge. I <lb/>
know not what is passing in the secret of your hearts; I am <lb/>
unacquainted with the character of this lady and with yours. <lb/>
I have nothing on which to build surmises and suspicions of <lb/>
your integrity, and nothing to generate unusual confidence. <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="eaf033v3_0145" pid="uva-lib:349877"/>
The frailty of your virtue, and the strength of your <reg orig="tempta-|tions">temptations</reg> <lb/>
I know not. However she decides in this case, and <lb/>
whatever opinion I shall form as to the reasonableness of <lb/>
her decision, it will not become me either to upbraid her, or <lb/>
to nourish discontentment and repinings.</p>
<p>I know that my claim has no legal support; that, if this <lb/>
money be resigned to me, it will be the impulse of <reg orig="sponta-|neous">spontaneous</reg> <lb/>
justice, and not the coercion of law, to which I am <lb/>
indebted for it. Since, therefore, the justice of my claim is <lb/>
to be measured not by law, but by simple equity, I will <reg orig="can-|didly">candidly</reg> <lb/>
acknowledge, that, as yet, it is uncertain whether I <lb/>
ought to receive, even should Miss Waldegrave be willing to <lb/>
give it. I know my own necessities and schemes, and in <lb/>
what degree this money would be subservient to these; but <lb/>
I know not the views and wants of others, and cannot <reg orig="esti-|mate">estimate</reg> <lb/>
the usefulness of this money to them. However I <lb/>
decide upon your conduct in withholding or retaining it, I <lb/>
shall make suitable allowance for my imperfect knowledge of <lb/>
your motives and wants, as well as for your unavoidable <lb/>
ignorance of mine.</p>
<p>I have related my sufferings from shipwreck and poverty, <lb/>
not to bias your judgment or engage your pity, but merely <lb/>
because the impulse to relate them chanced to awake; <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
my heart is softened by the remembrance of <reg orig="Walde-|grave">Waldegrave</reg>, <lb/>
who has been my only friend, and by the sight of one <lb/>
whom he loved.</p>
<p>I told you that my father lived in Chetasco. He is now <lb/>
aged, and I am his only child. I should have rejoiced in <lb/>
being able to relieve his grey hairs from labor, to which his <lb/>
failing strength cannot be equal. This was one of my <reg orig="in-|ducements">inducements</reg> <lb/>
in coming to America. Another was, to prepare <lb/>
the way for a woman whom I married in Europe and who <lb/>
is now awaiting intelligence from me in London. Her <lb/>
poverty is not less than my own, and by marrying against <lb/>
the wishes of her kindred, she has bereaved herself of all <lb/>
support but that of her husband. Whether I shall he able <lb/>
to rescue her from indigence, whether I shall alleviate the <lb/>
poverty of my father, or increase it by burthening his scanty <lb/>
friends by my own maintenance as well as his, the future <lb/>
alone can determine.</p>
<p>I confess that my stock of patience and hope has never <lb/>
<pb n="133" entity="eaf033v3_0146" pid="uva-lib:349878"/>
been large, and that my misfortunes have nearly exhausted <lb/>
it. The flower of my years has been consumed in <reg orig="strug-|gling">struggling</reg> <lb/>
with adversity, and my constitution has received a <lb/>
shock, from sickness and mistreatment in Portugal, which I <lb/>
cannot expect long to survive. But I make you sad (he <lb/>
continued.) I have said all that I meant to say in this <reg orig="inter-|view">interview</reg>. <lb/>
I am impatient to see my father, and night has already <lb/>
come. I have some miles yet to ride to his cottage, and <lb/>
over a rough road. I will shortly visit you again, and talk <lb/>
to you at greater leisure on these and other topics. At <lb/>
present I leave you.</p>
<p>I was unwilling to part so abruptly with this guest, and <reg orig="en-|treated">entreated</reg> <lb/>
him to prolong his visit, but he would not be <reg orig="pre-|vailed">prevailed</reg> <lb/>
upon. Repeating his promise of shortly seeing me <lb/>
again, he mounted his horse and disappeared. I looked <lb/>
after him with affecting and complex emotions. I reviewed <lb/>
the incidents of this unexpected and extraordinary interview, <lb/>
as if it had existed in a dream. An hour had passed, and <lb/>
this stranger had alighted among us as from the clouds, to <lb/>
draw the veil from those obscurities which had bewildered <lb/>
us so long, to make visible a new train of disastrous <reg orig="conse-|quences">consequences</reg> <lb/>
flowing from the untimely death of thy brother, and <lb/>
to blast that scheme of happiness on which thou and I had <lb/>
so fondly meditated.</p>
<p>But what wilt thou think of this new born claim? The <lb/>
story, hadst thou observed the features and guise of the <lb/>
relater, would have won thy implicit credit. His <reg orig="counte-|nance">countenance</reg> <lb/>
exhibited deep traces of the afflictions he had endured, <lb/>
and the fortitude which he had exercised. He was sallow <lb/>
and emaciated, but his countenance was full of seriousness <lb/>
and dignity. A sort of ruggedness of brow, the token of <lb/>
great mental exertion and varied experience, argued a <reg orig="pre-|mature">premature</reg> <lb/>
old age.</p>
<p>What a mournful tale! Is such the lot of those who <lb/>
wander from their rustic homes in search of fortune. Our <lb/>
countrymen are prone to enterprise, and are scattered over <lb/>
every sea and every land in pursuit of that wealth which will <lb/>
not screen them from disease and infirmity, which is missed <lb/>
much oftener than found, and which, when gained, by no <lb/>
means compensates them for the hardships and vicissitudes <lb/>
endured in the pursuit.</p>
<pb n="134" entity="eaf033v3_0147" pid="uva-lib:349879"/>
<p>But what if the truth of these pretensions be admitted? <lb/>
The money must be restored to its right owner. I know <lb/>
that whatever inconveniences may follow the deed, thou wilt <lb/>
not hesitate to act justly. Affluence and dignity, however <lb/>
valuable, may be purchased too dear. Honesty will not <lb/>
take away its keenness from the winter-blast, its ignominy <lb/>
and unwholesomeness from servile labor, or strip of its charms <lb/>
the life of elegance and leisure; but these, unaccompanied <lb/>
with self-reproach, are less deplorable than wealth and honor, <lb/>
the possession of which is marred by our own <reg orig="disapproba-|tion">disapprobation</reg>.</p>
<p>I know the bitterness of this sacrifice. I know the <reg orig="im-|patience">impatience</reg> <lb/>
with which your poverty has formerly been borne, <lb/>
how much your early education is at war with that <reg orig="degrada-|tion">degradation</reg> <lb/>
and obscurity to which your youth has been condemned. <lb/>
How earnestly your wishes panted after a state, which might <lb/>
exempt you from dependence upon daily labor and on the <lb/>
caprices of others, and might secure to you leisure to <reg orig="culti-|vate">cultivate</reg> <lb/>
and indulge your love of knowledge and your social <lb/>
and beneficent affections.</p>
<p>Your motive for desiring a change of fortune has been <lb/>
greatly enforced since we have become known to each other. <lb/>
Thou hast honored me with thy affection, but that union, <lb/>
on which we rely for happiness, could not take place while <lb/>
both of us were poor. My habits, indeed, have made labor <lb/>
and rustic obscurity less painful than they would prove to <lb/>
my friend, but my present condition is wholly inconsistent <lb/>
with marriage. As long as my exertions are insufficient to <lb/>
maintain us both, it would be unjustifiable to burthen you <lb/>
with new cares and duties. Of this you are more <reg orig="thorough-|ly">thoroughly</reg> <lb/>
convinced than I am. The love of independence and ease, <lb/>
and impatience of drudgery, are woven into your <reg orig="constitu-|tion">constitution</reg>. <lb/>
Perhaps they are carried to an erroneous extreme, <lb/>
and derogate from that uncommon excellence by which <lb/>
your character is, in other respects, distinguished, but they <lb/>
cannot be removed.</p>
<p>This obstacle was unexpectedly removed by the death of <lb/>
your brother. However justly to be deplored was this <lb/>
catastrophe, yet like every other event, some of its <reg orig="conse-|quences">consequences</reg> <lb/>
were good. By giving you possession of the means <lb/>
of independence and leisure, by enabling us to complete a <lb/>
<pb n="135" entity="eaf033v3_0148" pid="uva-lib:349880"/>
contract which poverty alone had thus long delayed, this <lb/>
event has been, at the same time, the most disastrous and <lb/>
propitious which could have happened.</p>
<p>Why thy brother should have concealed from us the <reg orig="pos-|session">possession</reg> <lb/>
of this money; why, with such copious means of <lb/>
indulgence and leisure, he should still pursue his irksome <lb/>
trade, and live in so penurious a manner, has been a topic <lb/>
of endless and unsatisfactory conjecture between us. It was <lb/>
not difficult to suppose that this money was held in trust for <lb/>
another, but in that case it was unavoidable that some <reg orig="docu-|ment">document</reg> <lb/>
or memorandum, or at least some claimant would <lb/>
appear. Much time has since elapsed, and you have thought <lb/>
yourself at length justified in appropriating this money to <lb/>
your own use.</p>
<p>Our flattering prospects are now shut in. You must <reg orig="re-|turn">return</reg> <lb/>
to your original poverty, and once more depend for <lb/>
precarious subsistence on your needle. You cannot restore <lb/>
the whole, for unavoidable expenses and the change of your <lb/>
mode of living, has consumed some part of it. For so much <lb/>
you must consider yourself as Weymouth's debtor.</p>
<p>Repine not, my friend, at this unlooked for reverse. <lb/>
Think upon the merits and misfortunes of your brother's <lb/>
friend, think upon his aged father whom we shall enable him <lb/>
to rescue from poverty; think upon his desolate wife, whose <lb/>
merits are, probably, at least equal to your own, and whose <lb/>
helplessness is likely to be greater. I am not insensible to <lb/>
the evils which have returned upon us with augmented force, <lb/>
after having, for a moment, taken their flight. I know the <lb/>
precariousness of my condition and that of my sisters, that <lb/>
our subsistence hangs upon the life of an old man. My <lb/>
uncle's death will transfer this property to his son, who is a <lb/>
stranger and an enemy to us, and the first act of whose <lb/>
authority will unquestionably be to turn us forth from these <lb/>
doors. Marriage with thee was anticipated with joyous <lb/>
emotions, not merely on my own account or on thine, but <lb/>
likewise for the sake of those beloved girls, to whom that <lb/>
event would enable me to furnish an asylum.</p>
<p>But wedlock is now more distant than ever. My heart <lb/>
bleeds to think of the sufferings which my beloved Mary is <lb/>
again fated to endure, but regrets are only aggravations of <lb/>
<pb n="136" entity="eaf033v3_0149" pid="uva-lib:349881"/>
calamity. They are pernicious, and it is our duty to shake <lb/>
them off.</p>
<p>I can entertain no doubts as to the equity of Weymouth's <lb/>
claim. So many coincidences could not have happened by <lb/>
chance. The nonappearance of any letters or papers <reg orig="con-|nected">connected</reg> <lb/>
with it is indeed a mysterious circumstance, but why <lb/>
should Waldegrave be studious of preserving these? They <lb/>
were useless paper, and might, without impropriety, be cast <lb/>
away or made to serve any temporary purpose. Perhaps, <lb/>
indeed, they still lurk in some unsuspected corner. To <lb/>
wish that time may explain this mystery in a different <reg orig="man-|ner">manner</reg>, <lb/>
and so as to permit our retention of this money, is, <lb/>
perhaps, the dictate of selfishness. The transfer to <reg orig="Wey-|mouth">Weymouth</reg> <lb/>
will not be productive of less benefit to him and to <lb/>
his family, than we should derive from the use of it.</p>
<p>These considerations, however, will be weighed when we <lb/>
meet. Meanwhile I will return to my narrative.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Here,</hi> my friend, thou must permit me to pause. The <lb/>
following incidents are of a kind to which the most ardent <lb/>
invention has never conceived a parallel. Fortune, in her <lb/>
most wayward mood, could scarcely be suspected of an <reg orig="in-|fluence">influence</reg> <lb/>
like this. The scene was pregnant with <reg orig="astonish-|ment">astonishment</reg> <lb/>
and horror. I cannot, even now, recall it without <reg orig="re-|viving">reviving</reg> <lb/>
the dismay and confusion which I then experienced.</p>
<p>Possibly, the period will arrive when I shall look back <lb/>
without agony on the perils I have undergone. That period <lb/>
is still distant. Solitude and sleep are now no more than <lb/>
the signals to summon up a tribe of ugly phantoms. Famine, <lb/>
and blindness, and death, and savage enemies, never fail to <lb/>
be conjured up by the silence and darkness of the night. I <lb/>
cannot dissipate them by any efforts of reason. My <reg orig="cow-|ardice">cowardice</reg> <lb/>
requires the perpetual consolation of light. My heart <lb/>
droops when I mark the decline of the sun, and I never <lb/>
sleep but with a candle burning at my pillow. If, by any <lb/>
chance, I should awake and find myself immersed in <reg orig="dark-|ness">darkness</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="eaf033v3_0150" pid="uva-lib:349882"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">13</fw></pb>
I know not what act of desperation I might be suddenly <lb/>
impelled to commit.</p>
<p>I have delayed this narrative longer than my duty to my <lb/>
friend enjoined. Now that I am able to hold a pen, I will <lb/>
hasten to terminate that uncertainty with regard to my fate, <lb/>
in which my silence has involved thee. I will recall that <lb/>
series of unheard of and disastrous vicissitudes which has <lb/>
constituted the latest portion of my life.</p>
<p>I am not certain, however, that I shall relate them in an <lb/>
intelligible manner. One image runs into another, sensations <lb/>
succeed in so rapid a train, that I fear I shall be unable to <lb/>
distribute and express them with sufficient perspicuity. As <lb/>
I look back, my heart is sore and aches within my bosom. <lb/>
I am conscious to a kind of complex sentiment of distress <lb/>
and forlornness that cannot be perfectly portrayed by words; <lb/>
but I must do as well as I can. In the utmost vigor of my <lb/>
faculties, no eloquence that I possess would do justice to the <lb/>
tale. Now in my languishing and feeble state, I shall <reg orig="fur-|nish">furnish</reg> <lb/>
thee with little more than a glimpse of the truth. With <lb/>
these glimpses, transient and faint as they are, thou must be <lb/>
satisfied.</p>
<p>I have said that I slept. My memory assures me of this; <lb/>
it informs me of the previous circumstances of my laying aside <lb/>
my clothes, of placing the light upon a chair within reach of <lb/>
my pillow, of throwing myself upon the bed, and of gazing <lb/>
on the rays of the moon reflected on the wall, and almost <lb/>
obscured by those of the candle. I remember my <reg orig="occa-|sional">occasional</reg> <lb/>
relapses into fits of incoherent fancies, the harbingers <lb/>
of sleep. I remember, as it were, the instant when my <lb/>
thoughts ceased to flow, and my senses were arrested by the <lb/>
leaden wand of forgetfulness.</p>
<p>My return to sensation and to consciousness took place <lb/>
in no such tranquil scene. I emerged from oblivion by <reg orig="de-|grees">degrees</reg> <lb/>
so slow and so faint, that their succession cannot be <lb/>
marked. When enabled at length to attend to the <reg orig="informa-|tion">information</reg> <lb/>
which my senses afforded, I was conscious, for a time, <lb/>
of nothing but existence. It was unaccompanied with <reg orig="lassi-|tude">lassitude</reg> <lb/>
or pain, but I felt disinclined to stretch my limbs, or <lb/>
raise my eyelids. My thoughts were wildering and mazy, <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="eaf033v3_0151" pid="uva-lib:349883"/>
and though consciousness were present, it was disconnected <lb/>
with the locomotive or voluntary power.</p>
<p>From this state a transition was speedily effected. I <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg> <lb/>
that my posture was supine, and that I lay upon my <lb/>
back. I attempted to open my eyes. The weight that <lb/>
oppressed them was too great for a slight exertion to <reg orig="re-|move">remove</reg>. <lb/>
The exertion which I made cost me a pang more <lb/>
acute than any which I ever experienced. My eyes, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
were opened; but the darkness that environed me <lb/>
was as intense as before.</p>
<p>I attempted to rise, but my limbs were cold, and my <lb/>
joints had almost lost their flexibility. My efforts were <reg orig="re-|peated">repeated</reg>, <lb/>
and at length I attained a sitting posture. I was <lb/>
now sensible of pain in my shoulders and back. I was <lb/>
universally in that state to which the frame is reduced by <lb/>
blows of a club, mercilessly and endlessly repeated; my <lb/>
temples throbbed and my face was covered with clammy and <lb/>
cold drops, but that which threw me into deepest <reg orig="consterna-|tion">consternation</reg> <lb/>
was, my inability to see. I turned my head to different <lb/>
quarters, I stretched my eyelids, and exerted every visual <lb/>
energy, but in vain. I was wrapt in the murkiest and most <lb/>
impenetrable gloom.</p>
<p>The first effort of reflection was to suggest the belief <lb/>
that I was blind; that disease is known to assail us in a <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
and without previous warning. This surely was the <lb/>
misfortune that had now befallen me. Some ray, however, <lb/>
fleeting and uncertain, could not fail to be discerned, if the <lb/>
power of vision were not utterly extinguished. In what <lb/>
circumstances could I possibly be placed, from which every <lb/>
particle of light should, by other means, be excluded.</p>
<p>This led my thoughts into a new train. I endeavored <lb/>
to recall the past, but the past was too much in <reg orig="contradic-|tion">contradiction</reg> <lb/>
to the present, and my intellect was too much shattered <lb/>
by external violence, to allow me accurately to review it.</p>
<p>Since my sight availed nothing to the knowledge of my <lb/>
condition, I betook myself to other instruments. The <reg orig="ele-|ment">element</reg> <lb/>
which I breathed was stagnant and cold. The spot <lb/>
where I lay was rugged and hard. I was neither naked nor <lb/>
clothed, a shirt and trowsers composed my dress, and the <lb/>
shoes and stockings, which always accompanied these, <lb/>
<pb n="139" entity="eaf033v3_0152" pid="uva-lib:349884"/>
were now wanting. What could I infer from this scanty <lb/>
garb, this chilling atmosphere, this stony bed?</p>
<p>I had awakened as from sleep. What was my condition <lb/>
when I fell asleep? Surely it was different from the <reg orig="pre-|sent">present</reg>. <lb/>
Then I inhabited a lightsome chamber, and was <lb/>
stretched upon a down bed. Now I was supine upon a <lb/>
rugged surface and immersed in palpable obscurity. Then <lb/>
I was in perfect health; now my frame was covered with <lb/>
bruises and every joint was racked with pain. What <reg orig="dun-|geon">dungeon</reg> <lb/>
or den had received me, and by whose command was <lb/>
I transported hither?</p>
<p>After various efforts I stood upon my feet. At first I <lb/>
tottered and staggered. I stretched out my hands on all <lb/>
sides but met only with vacuity. I advanced forward. At <lb/>
the third step my foot moved something which lay upon the <lb/>
ground, I stooped and took it up, and found, on <reg orig="examina-|tion">examination</reg>, <lb/>
that it was an Indian tomahawk. This incident <reg orig="af-|forded">afforded</reg> <lb/>
me no hint from which I might conjecture my state.</p>
<p>Proceeding irresolutely and slowly forward, my hands at <lb/>
length touched a wall. This, like the flooring, was of stone, <lb/>
and was rugged and impenetrable. I followed this wall. <lb/>
An advancing angle occurred at a short distance, which was <lb/>
followed by similar angles. I continued to explore this <lb/>
clue, till the suspicion occurred that I was merely going <lb/>
round the walls of a vast and irregular apartment.</p>
<p>The utter darkness disabled me from comparing directions <lb/>
and distances. This discovery, therefore, was not made on <lb/>
a sudden, and was still entangled with some doubt. My <lb/>
blood recovered some warmth, and my muscles some <reg orig="elas-|ticity">elasticity</reg>, <lb/>
but in proportion as my sensibility returned my pains <lb/>
augmented. Overpowered by my fears and my agonies, I <lb/>
desisted from my fruitless search, and sat down, supporting <lb/>
my back against the wall.</p>
<p>My excruciating sensations for a time occupied my <reg orig="at-|tention">attention</reg>. <lb/>
These, in combination with other causes, <reg orig="gra-|dually">gradually</reg> <lb/>
produced a species of delirium. I existed as it were <lb/>
in a wakeful dream. With nothing to correct my erroneous <lb/>
perceptions, the images of the past occurred in capricious <lb/>
combinations, and vivid hues. Methought I was the victim <lb/>
of some tyrant who had thrust me into a dungeon of his <lb/>
fortress, and left me no power to determine whether he <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="eaf033v3_0153" pid="uva-lib:349885"/>
intended I should perish with famine, or linger out a long <lb/>
life in hopeless imprisonment. Whether the day was shut <lb/>
out by insuperable walls, or the darkness that surrounded <lb/>
me, was owing to the night and to the smallness of those <lb/>
crannies through which daylight was to be admitted, I <reg orig="con-|jectured">conjectured</reg> <lb/>
in vain.</p>
<p>Sometimes I imagined myself buried alive. Methought <lb/>
I had fallen into seeming death and my friends had <reg orig="con-|signed">consigned</reg> <lb/>
me to the tomb, from which a resurrection was <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg>. <lb/>
That in such a case, my limbs would have been <lb/>
confined to a coffin, and my coffin to a grave, and that I <lb/>
should instantly have been suffocated, did not occur to <reg orig="de-|stroy">destroy</reg> <lb/>
my supposition. Neither did this supposition <reg orig="over-|whelm">overwhelm</reg> <lb/>
me with terror or prompt my efforts at deliverance. <lb/>
My state was full of tumult and confusion, and my attention <lb/>
was incessantly divided between my painful sensations and <lb/>
my feverish dreams.</p>
<p>There is no standard by which time can be measured, <lb/>
but the succession of our thoughts, and the changes that <lb/>
take place in the external world. From the latter I was <lb/>
totally excluded. The former made the lapse of some <lb/>
hours appear like the tediousness of weeks and months. <lb/>
At length, a new sensation recalled my rambling <reg orig="medita-|tions">meditations</reg>, <lb/>
and gave substance to my fears. I now felt the <lb/>
cravings of hunger, and perceived that unless my <reg orig="deliver-|ance">deliverance</reg> <lb/>
were speedily effected, I must suffer a tedious and <reg orig="lin-|gering">lingering</reg> <lb/>
death.</p>
<p>I once more tasked my understanding and my senses, to <lb/>
discover the nature of my present situation and the means <lb/>
of escape. I listened to catch some sound. I heard an <lb/>
unequal and varying echo, sometimes near and sometimes <lb/>
distant, sometimes dying away and sometimes swelling into <lb/>
loudness. It was unlike any thing I had before heard, but <lb/>
it was evident that it arose from wind sweeping through <reg orig="spa-|cious">spacious</reg> <lb/>
halls and winding passages. These tokens were <reg orig="in-|compatible">incompatible</reg> <lb/>
with the result of the examination I had made. <lb/>
If my hands were true I was immured between walls, <lb/>
through which there was no avenue.</p>
<p>I now exerted my voice, and cried as loud as my wasted <lb/>
strength would admit. Its echoes were sent back to me in <lb/>
broken and confused sounds and from above. This effort <lb/>
<pb n="141" entity="eaf033v3_0154" pid="uva-lib:349886"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">13*</fw></pb>
was casual, but some part of that uncertainty in which I <lb/>
was involved, was instantly dispelled by it. In passing <lb/>
through the cavern on the former day, I have mentioned <lb/>
the verge of the pit at which I arrived. To acquaint me <lb/>
as far as was possible, with the dimensions of the place, I <lb/>
had hallooed with all my force, knowing that sound is <reg orig="re-|flected">reflected</reg> <lb/>
according to the distance and relative positions of <lb/>
the substances from which it is repelled.</p>
<p>The effect produced by my voice on this occasion <reg orig="re-|sembled">resembled</reg>, <lb/>
with remarkable exactness, the effect which was <lb/>
then produced. Was I then shut up in the same cavern? <lb/>
Had I reached the brink of the same precipice and been <lb/>
thrown headlong into that vacuity? Whence else could <lb/>
arise the bruises which I had received, but from my fall? <lb/>
Yet all remembrance of my journey hither was lost. I had <lb/>
determined to explore this cave on the ensuing day, but my <lb/>
memory informed me not that this intention had been <reg orig="car-|ried">carried</reg> <lb/>
into effect. Still it was only possible to conclude that <lb/>
I had come hither on my intended expedition, and had been <lb/>
thrown by another, or had, by some ill chance, fallen into <lb/>
the pit.</p>
<p>This opinion was conformable to what I had already <reg orig="ob-|served">observed</reg>. <lb/>
The pavement and walls were rugged like those <lb/>
of the footing and sides of the cave through which I had <lb/>
formerly passed.</p>
<p>But if this were true, what was the abhorred catastrophe <lb/>
to which I was now reserved? The sides of this pit were <lb/>
inaccessible; human footsteps would never wander into <lb/>
these recesses. My friends were unapprised of my forlorn <lb/>
state. Here I should continue till wasted by famine. In <lb/>
this grave should I linger out a few days, in unspeakable <lb/>
agonies, and then perish forever.</p>
<p>The inroads of hunger were already experienced, and this <lb/>
knowledge of the desperateness of my calamity, urged me <lb/>
to phrenzy. I had none but capricious and unseen fate to <lb/>
condemn. The author of my distress and the means he <lb/>
had taken to decoy me hither, were incomprehensible. <lb/>
Surely my senses were fettered or depraved by some spell. <lb/>
I was still asleep, and this was merely a tormenting vision, <lb/>
or madness had seized me, and the darkness that environed <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="eaf033v3_0155" pid="uva-lib:349887"/>
and the hunger that afflicted me, existed only in my own <lb/>
distempered imagination.</p>
<p>The consolation of these doubts could not last long. <lb/>
Every hour added to the proof that my perceptions were <lb/>
real. My hunger speedily became ferocious. I tore the <lb/>
linen of my shirt between my teeth and swallowed the <reg orig="frag-|ments">fragments</reg>. <lb/>
I felt a strong propensity to bite the flesh from my arm. <lb/>
My heart overflowed with cruelty, and I pondered on the <lb/>
delight I should experience in rending some living animal <lb/>
to pieces, and drinking its blood and grinding its quivering <lb/>
fibres between my teeth.</p>
<p>This agony had already passed beyond the limits of <reg orig="en-|durance">endurance</reg>. <lb/>
I saw that time, instead of bringing respite or relief, <lb/>
would only aggravate my wants, and that my only remaining <lb/>
hope was to die before I should be assaulted by the last <lb/>
extremes of famine. I now recollected that a tomahawk <lb/>
was at hand, and rejoiced in the possession of an instrument <lb/>
by which I could so effectually terminate my sufferings.</p>
<p>I took it in my hand, moved its edge over my fingers, and <lb/>
reflected on the force that was required to make it reach <lb/>
my heart. I investigated the spot where it should enter, <lb/>
and strove to fortify myself with resolution to repeat the <lb/>
stroke a second or third time, if the first should prove <reg orig="insuf-|ficient">insufficient</reg>. <lb/>
I was sensible that I might fail to inflict a mortal <lb/>
wound, but delighted to consider that the blood which would <lb/>
be made to flow, would finally release me, and that <reg orig="mean-|while">meanwhile</reg> <lb/>
my pains would be alleviated by swallowing this blood.</p>
<p>You will not wonder that I felt some reluctance to employ <lb/>
so fatal though indispensable a remedy. I once more <reg orig="rumina-|ted">ruminated</reg> <lb/>
on the possibility of rescuing myself by other means. I <lb/>
now reflected that the upper termination of the wall could <lb/>
not be at an immeasurable distance from the pavement. I <lb/>
had fallen from a height, but if that height had been <reg orig="con-|siderable">considerable</reg>, <lb/>
instead of being merely bruised, should I not have <lb/>
been dashed into pieces?</p>
<p>Gleams of hope burst anew upon my soul. Was it not <lb/>
possible, I asked, to reach the top of this pit. The sides <lb/>
were rugged and uneven. Would not their projectures and <lb/>
abruptnesses serve me as steps by which I might ascend in <lb/>
safety. This expedient was to be tried without delay. <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="eaf033v3_0156" pid="uva-lib:349888"/>
Shortly my strength would fail and my doom would be <reg orig="irre-|vocably">irrevocably</reg> <lb/>
sealed.</p>
<p>I will not enumerate my laborious efforts, my alternations <lb/>
of despondency and confidence, the eager and unwearied <lb/>
scrutiny with which I examined the surface, the attempts <lb/>
which I made, and the failures which, for a time, succeeded <lb/>
each other. A hundred times, when I had ascended some <lb/>
feet from the bottom, I was compelled to relinquish my <reg orig="un-|dertaking">undertaking</reg> <lb/>
by the <hi rend="italic">untenable</hi> smoothness of the spaces which <lb/>
remained to be gone over. A hundred times I threw <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg>, <lb/>
exhausted by fatigue and my pains, on the ground. <lb/>
The consciousness was gradually restored that till I had <lb/>
attempted every part of the wall, it was absurd to despair, <lb/>
and I again drew my tottering limbs and aching joints to <lb/>
that part of the wall which had not been surveyed.</p>
<p>At length, as I stretched my hand upward, I found <reg orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg> <lb/>
that seemed like a recession in the wall. It was <reg orig="pos-|sible">possible</reg> <lb/>
that this was the top of the cavity, and this might be the <lb/>
avenue to liberty. My heart leaped with joy, and I <reg orig="pro-|ceeded">proceeded</reg> <lb/>
to climb the wall. No undertaking could be <reg orig="con-|ceived">conceived</reg> <lb/>
more arduous than this. The space between this <lb/>
verge and the floor was nearly smooth. The verge was <lb/>
higher from the bottom than my head. The only means <lb/>
of ascending that were offered me were by my hands, with <lb/>
which I could draw myself upward so as, at length, to <lb/>
maintain my hold with my feet.</p>
<p>My efforts were indefatigable, and at length I placed <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg> <lb/>
on the verge, when this was accomplished, my strength <lb/>
was nearly gone. Had I not found space enough beyond <lb/>
this brink to stretch myself at length, I should unavoidably <lb/>
have fallen backward into the pit, and all my pains had <lb/>
served no other end than to deepen my despair and hasten <lb/>
my destruction.</p>
<p>What impediments and perils remained to be <reg orig="encoun-|tered">encountered</reg> <lb/>
I could not judge. I was now inclined to forbode the <lb/>
worst. The interval of repose which was necessary to be <lb/>
taken, in order to recruit my strength, would accelerate the <lb/>
ravages of famine, and leave me without the power to <lb/>
proceed.</p>
<p>In this state, I once more consoled myself that an <reg orig="instru-|ment">instrument</reg> <lb/>
of death was at hand. I had drawn up with me the <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="eaf033v3_0157" pid="uva-lib:349889"/>
tomahawk, being sensible that should this impediment be <lb/>
overcome others might remain that would prove insuperable. <lb/>
Before I employed it, however, I cast my eyes wildly and <lb/>
languidly around. The darkness was no less intense than in <lb/>
the pit below, and yet two objects were distinctly seen.</p>
<p>They resembled a fixed and obscure flame. They were <lb/>
motionless. Though lustrous themselves they created no <lb/>
illumination around them. This circumstance, added to <lb/>
others, which reminded me of similar objects, noted on <lb/>
former occasions, immediately explained the nature of what <lb/>
I beheld. These were the eyes of a panther.</p>
<p>Thus had I struggled to obtain a post where a savage was <lb/>
lurking, and waited only till my efforts should place me <lb/>
within reach of his fangs. The first impulse was to arm <lb/>
myself against this enemy. The desperateness of my <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
was, for a moment, forgotten. The weapon which <lb/>
was so lately lifted against my own bosom, was now raised <lb/>
to defend my life against the assault of another.</p>
<p>There was no time for deliberation and delay. In a <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
he might spring from his station and tear me to pieces. <lb/>
My utmost speed might not enable me to reach him where <lb/>
he sat, but merely to encounter his assault. I did not reflect <lb/>
how far my strength was adequate to save me. All the <lb/>
force that remained was mustered up and exerted in a <lb/>
throw.</p>
<p>No one knows the powers that are latent in his <reg orig="constitu-|tion">constitution</reg>. <lb/>
Called forth by imminent dangers, our efforts <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg> <lb/>
exceed our most sanguine belief. Though tottering <lb/>
on the verge of dissolution, and apparently unable to crawl <lb/>
from this spot, a force was exerted in this throw, probably <lb/>
greater than I had ever before exerted. It was resistless <lb/>
and unerring. I aimed at the middle space between those <lb/>
glowing orbs. It penetrated the skull and the animal fell, <lb/>
struggling and shrieking, on the ground.</p>
<p>My ears quickly informed me when his pangs were at an <lb/>
end. His cries and his convulsions lasted for a moment and <lb/>
then ceased. The effect of his voice, in these subterranean <lb/>
abodes, was unspeakably rueful.</p>
<p>The abruptness of this incident, and the preternatural <reg orig="ex-|ertion">exertion</reg> <lb/>
of my strength, left me in a state of languor and <reg orig="sink-|ing">sinking</reg>, <lb/>
from which slowly and with difficulty I recovered. The <lb/>
<pb n="145" entity="eaf033v3_0158" pid="uva-lib:349890"/>
first suggestion that occurred was to feed upon the carcass <lb/>
of this animal. My hunger had arrived at that pitch where <lb/>
all fastidiousness and scruples are at an end. I crept to <lb/>
the spot&mdash;I will not shock you by relating the extremes to <lb/>
which dire necessity had driven me. I review this scene <lb/>
with loathing and horror. Now that it is past I look back <lb/>
upon it as on some hideous dream. The whole appears to <lb/>
be some freak of insanity. No alternative was offered, and <lb/>
hunger was capable of being appeased, even by a banquet <lb/>
so detestable.</p>
<p>If this appetite has sometimes subdued the sentiments of <lb/>
nature, and compelled the mother to feed upon the flesh of <lb/>
her offspring, it will not excite amazement that I did not turn <lb/>
from the yet warm blood and reeking fibres of a brute.</p>
<p>One evil was now removed, only to give place to another. <lb/>
The first sensations of fulness had scarcely been felt when <lb/>
my stomach was seized by pangs, whose acuteness exceeded <lb/>
all that I ever before experienced. I bitterly lamented my <lb/>
inordinate avidity. The excruciations of famine were better <lb/>
than the agonies which this abhorred meal had produced.</p>
<p>Death was now impending with no less proximity and <reg orig="cer-|tainty">certainty</reg>, <lb/>
though in a different form. Death was a sweet relief <lb/>
for my present miseries, and I vehemently longed for its <lb/>
arrival. I stretched myself on the ground. I threw myself <lb/>
into every posture that promised some alleviation of this evil. <lb/>
I rolled along the pavement of the cavern, wholly inattentive <lb/>
to the dangers that environed me. That I did not fall into <lb/>
the pit, whence I had just emerged, must be ascribed to <lb/>
some miraculous chance.</p>
<p>How long my miseries endured, it is not possible to tell. <lb/>
I cannot even form a plausible conjecture. Judging by the <lb/>
lingering train of my sensations, I should conjecture that <lb/>
some days elapsed in this deplorable condition, but nature <lb/>
could not have so long sustained a conflict like this.</p>
<p>Gradually my pains subsided and I fell into a deep sleep. <lb/>
I was visited by dreams of a thousand hues. They led me <lb/>
to flowing streams and plenteous banquets, which, though <lb/>
placed within my view, some power forbade me to approach. <lb/>
From this sleep I recovered to the fruition of solitude and <lb/>
darkness, but my frame was in a state less feeble than <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg>. <lb/>
That which I had eaten had produced temporary <reg orig="dis-|tress">distress</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="eaf033v3_0159" pid="uva-lib:349891"/>
but on the whole had been of use. If this food had <lb/>
not been provided for me I should scarcely have avoided <lb/>
death. I had reason therefore to congratulate myself on the <lb/>
danger that had lately occurred.</p>
<p>I had acted without foresight, and yet no wisdom could <lb/>
have prescribed more salutary measures. The panther <lb/>
was slain, not from a view to the relief of my hunger, but <lb/>
from the self-preserving and involuntary impulse. Had I <lb/>
foreknown the pangs to which my ravenous and bloody <lb/>
meal would give birth, I should have carefully abstained, and <lb/>
yet these pangs were a useful effort of nature to subdue <lb/>
and convert to nourishment the matter I had swallowed.</p>
<p>I was now assailed by the torments of thirst. My <reg orig="inven-|tion">invention</reg> <lb/>
and my courage were anew bent to obviate this pressing <lb/>
evil. I reflected that there was some recess from this <reg orig="cav-|ern">cavern</reg>, <lb/>
even from the spot where I now stood. Before, I was <lb/>
doubtful whether in this direction from this pit any avenue <lb/>
could be found, but since the panther had come hither <lb/>
there was reason to suppose the existence of some such <lb/>
avenue.</p>
<p>I now likewise attended to a sound, which, from its <reg orig="inva-|riable">invariable</reg> <lb/>
tenor, denoted somewhat different from the whistling <lb/>
of a gale. It seemed like the murmur of a running stream. <lb/>
I now prepared to go forward, and endeavored to move <lb/>
along in that direction in which this sound apparently came.</p>
<p>On either side and above my head, there was nothing but <lb/>
vacuity. My steps were to be guided by the pavement, <lb/>
which, though unequal and rugged, appeared, on the whole, <lb/>
to ascend. My safety required that I should employ both <lb/>
hands and feet in exploring my way.</p>
<p>I went on thus for a considerable period. The murmur, <lb/>
instead of becoming more distinct, gradually died away. <lb/>
My progress was arrested by fatigue, and I began once <lb/>
more to despond. My exertions produced a perspiration, <lb/>
which, while it augmented my thirst, happily supplied me <lb/>
with imperfect means of appeasing it.</p>
<p>This expedient would, perhaps, have been accidentally <lb/>
suggested, but my ingenuity was assisted by remembering <lb/>
the history of certain English prisoners in Bengal, whom <lb/>
their merciless enemy imprisoned in a small room, and <lb/>
some of whom preserved themselves alive merely by <reg orig="swal-|lowing">swallowing</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="eaf033v3_0160" pid="uva-lib:349892"/>
the moisture that flowed from their bodies. This <lb/>
experiment I now performed with no less success.</p>
<p>This was slender and transitory consolation. I knew that, <lb/>
wandering at random, I might never reach the outlet of this <lb/>
cavern, or might be disabled, by hunger and fatigue, from <lb/>
going farther than the outlet. The cravings which had <lb/>
lately been satiated, would speedily return, and my <reg orig="negli-|gence">negligence</reg> <lb/>
had cut me off from the resource which had recently <lb/>
been furnished. I thought not till now that a second meal <lb/>
might be indispensable.</p>
<p>To return upon my footsteps to the spot where the dead <lb/>
animal lay, was a heartless project. I might thus be placing <lb/>
myself at a hopeless distance from liberty. Besides, my <lb/>
track could not be retraced. I had frequently deviated <lb/>
from a straight direction for the sake of avoiding <reg orig="impedi-|ments">impediments</reg>. <lb/>
All of which I was sensible was, that I was <reg orig="travel-|ling">travelling</reg> <lb/>
up an irregular acclivity. I hoped sometime to reach <lb/>
the summit, but had no reason for adhering to one line of <lb/>
ascent in preference to another.</p>
<p>To remain where I was, was manifestly absurd. Whether <lb/>
I mounted or descended, a change of place was most likely <lb/>
to benefit me. I resolved to vary my direction, and, instead <lb/>
of ascending, keep along the side of what I accounted a <lb/>
hill. I had gone some hundred feet when the murmur, <lb/>
before described, once more saluted my ear.</p>
<p>This sound, being imagined to proceed from a running <lb/>
stream, could not but light up joy in the heart of one nearly <lb/>
perishing with thirst. I proceeded with new courage. The <lb/>
sound approached no nearer, nor became more distinct, but <lb/>
as long as it died not away, I was satisfied to listen and to <lb/>
hope.</p>
<p>I was eagerly observant if any the least glimmering of <lb/>
light, should visit this recess. At length, on the right hand, <lb/>
a gleam, infinitely faint, caught my attention. It was <reg orig="wa-|vering">wavering</reg> <lb/>
and unequal. I directed my steps towards it. It <lb/>
became more vivid and permanent. It was of that kind, <lb/>
however, which proceeded from a fire, kindled with dry <lb/>
sticks, and not from the sun. I now heard the crackling of <lb/>
flames.</p>
<p>This sound made me pause, or at least to proceed with <lb/>
circumspection. At length the scene opened, and I found <lb/>
<pb n="148" entity="eaf033v3_0161" pid="uva-lib:349893"/>
myself at the entrance of a cave. I quickly reached a <lb/>
station when I saw a fire burning. At first no other object <lb/>
was noted, but it was easy to infer that the fire was kindled <lb/>
by men, and that they who kindled it could be at no great <lb/>
distance.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Thus</hi> was I delivered from my prison, and restored to <lb/>
the enjoyment of the air and the light. Perhaps the chance <lb/>
was almost miraculous that led me to this opening. In any <lb/>
other direction, I might have involved myself in an <reg orig="inextri-|cable">inextricable</reg> <lb/>
maze, and rendered my destruction sure; but what <lb/>
now remained to place me in absolute security? Beyond <lb/>
the fire I could see nothing; but since the smoke rolled <lb/>
rapidly away, it was plain that on the opposite side the <reg orig="cav-|ern">cavern</reg> <lb/>
was open to the air.</p>
<p>I went forward, but my eyes were fixed upon the fire; <lb/>
presently, in consequence of changing my station, I <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg> <lb/>
several feet, and the skirts of blankets. I was <reg orig="some-|what">somewhat</reg> <lb/>
startled at these appearances. The legs were naked, <lb/>
and scored into uncouth figures. The <hi rend="italic">moccasins</hi> which lay <lb/>
beside them, and which were adorned in a grotesque <reg orig="man-|ner">manner</reg>, <lb/>
in addition to other incidents, immediately suggested <lb/>
the suspicion that they were Indians. No spectacle was <lb/>
more adapted than this to excite wonder and alarm. Had <lb/>
some mysterious power snatched me from the earth, and <lb/>
cast me, in a moment, into the heart of the wilderness? <lb/>
Was I still in the vicinity of my paternal habitation, or was <lb/>
I thousands of miles distant?</p>
<p>Were these the permanent inhabitants of this region, or <lb/>
were they wanderers and robbers? While in the heart of <lb/>
the mountain I had entertained a vague belief that I was still <lb/>
within the precincts of Norwalk. This opinion was shaken <lb/>
for a moment by the objects which I now beheld, but it <reg orig="in-|sensibly">insensibly</reg> <lb/>
returned; yet, how was this opinion to be <reg orig="recon-|ciled">reconciled</reg> <lb/>
to appearances so strange and uncouth, and what <lb/>
measure did a due regard to my safety enjoin me to take?</p>
<pb n="149" entity="eaf033v3_0162" pid="uva-lib:349894"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">14</fw></pb>
<p>I now gained a view of four brawny and terrific figures, <lb/>
stretched upon the ground. They lay parallel to each <lb/>
other, on their left sides; in consequence of which their <lb/>
faces were turned from me. Between each was an interval <lb/>
where lay a musket. Their right hands seemed placed <lb/>
upon the stocks of their guns, as if to seize them on the first <lb/>
moment of alarm.</p>
<p>The aperture through which these objects were seen, <lb/>
was at the back of the cave, and some feet from the ground. <lb/>
It was merely large enough to suffer a human body to pass. <lb/>
It was involved in profound darkness, and there was no <lb/>
danger of being suspected or discovered as long as I <reg orig="main-|tained">maintained</reg> <lb/>
silence, and kept out of view.</p>
<p>It was easily imagined that these guests would make but <lb/>
a short sojourn in this spot. There was reason to suppose <lb/>
that it was now night, and that after a short repose, they <lb/>
would start up and resume their journey. It was my first <lb/>
design to remain shrouded in this covert till their departure, <lb/>
and I prepared to endure imprisonment and thirst somewhat <lb/>
longer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile my thoughts were busy in accounting for this <lb/>
spectacle. I need not tell thee that Norwalk is the <reg orig="termina-|tion">termination</reg> <lb/>
of a sterile and narrow tract, which begins in the Indian <lb/>
country. It forms a sort of rugged and rocky vein, and <lb/>
continues upwards of fifty miles. It is crossed in a few places <lb/>
by narrow and intricate paths, by which a communication is <lb/>
maintained between the farms and settlements on the <reg orig="oppo-|site">opposite</reg> <lb/>
sides of the ridge.</p>
<p>During former Indian wars, this rude surface was <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
traversed by the Red-men, and they made, by means <lb/>
of it, frequent and destructive inroads into the heart of the <lb/>
English settlements. During the last war, notwithstanding <lb/>
the progress of population, and the multiplied perils of such <lb/>
an expedition, a band of them had once penetrated into <lb/>
Norwalk, and lingered long enough to pillage and murder <lb/>
some of the neighboring inhabitants.</p>
<p>I have reason to remember that event. My father's <lb/>
house was placed on the verge of this solitude. Eight of <lb/>
these assassins assailed it at the dead of night. My parents <lb/>
and an infant child were murdered in their beds; the house <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="eaf033v3_0163" pid="uva-lib:349895"/>
was pillaged, and then burnt to the ground. Happily, <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg> <lb/>
and my two sisters were abroad upon a visit. The <reg orig="pre-|ceding">preceding</reg> <lb/>
day had been fixed for our return to our father's house, <lb/>
but a storm occurred, which made it dangerous to cross the <lb/>
river, and by obliging us to defer our journey, rescued us <lb/>
from captivity or death.</p>
<p>Most men are haunted by some species of terror or <reg orig="an-|tipathy">antipathy</reg>, <lb/>
which they are, for the most part, able to trace to <lb/>
some incident which befel them in their early years. You <lb/>
will not be surprised that the fate of my parents, and the <lb/>
sight of the body of one of this savage band, who, in the <lb/>
pursuit that was made after them, was overtaken and killed, <lb/>
should produce lasting and terrific images in my fancy. I <lb/>
never looked upon, or called up the image of a savage <lb/>
without shuddering.</p>
<p>I knew that, at this time, some hostilities had been <reg orig="com-|mitted">committed</reg> <lb/>
on the frontier; that a long course of injuries and <lb/>
encroachments had lately exasperated the Indian tribes; <lb/>
that an implacable and exterminating war was generally <lb/>
expected. We imagined ourselves at an inaccessible <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg> <lb/>
from the danger, but I could not but remember that <lb/>
this persuasion was formerly as strong as at present, and <lb/>
that an expedition, which had once succeeded, might <reg orig="possi-|bly">possibly</reg> <lb/>
be attempted again. Here was every token of enmity <lb/>
and bloodshed. Each prostrate figure was furnished with <lb/>
a rifled musket, and a leathern bag tied round his waist, <lb/>
which was, probably, stored with powder and ball.</p>
<p>From these reflections, the sense of my own danger was <lb/>
revived and enforced, but I likewise ruminated on the evils <lb/>
which might impend over others. I should, no doubt, be <lb/>
safe by remaining in this nook; but might not some means <lb/>
be pursued to warn others of their danger? Should they <lb/>
leave this spot, without notice of their approach being given <lb/>
to the fearless and pacific tenants of the neighboring <reg orig="dis-|trict">district</reg>, <lb/>
they might commit, in a few hours, the most horrid and <lb/>
irreparable devastation.</p>
<p>The alarm could only be diffused in one way. Could <lb/>
I not escape, unperceived, and without alarming the <reg orig="sleep-|ers">sleepers</reg>, <lb/>
from this cavern? The slumber of an Indian is broken <lb/>
by the slightest noise; but if all noise be precluded, it is <lb/>
commonly profound. It was possible, I conceived, to leave <lb/>
<pb n="151" entity="eaf033v3_0164" pid="uva-lib:349896"/>
my present post, to descend into the cave, and issue forth <lb/>
without the smallest signal. Their supine posture assured <lb/>
me that they were asleep. Sleep usually comes at their <lb/>
bidding, and if, perchance, they should be wakeful at an <lb/>
unseasonable moment, they always sit upon their haunches, <lb/>
and, leaning their elbows on their knees, consume the <reg orig="tedi-|ous">tedious</reg> <lb/>
hours in smoking. My peril would be great. <reg orig="Acci-|dents">Accidents</reg> <lb/>
which I could not foresee, and over which I had no <lb/>
command, might occur to awaken some one at the moment <lb/>
I was passing the fire. Should I pass in safety, I might <lb/>
issue forth into a wilderness, of which I had no knowledge, <lb/>
where I might wander till I perished with famine, or where <lb/>
my footsteps might be noted and pursued, and overtaken <lb/>
by these implacable foes. These perils were enormous <lb/>
and imminent; but I likewise considered that I might be <lb/>
at no great distance from the habitations of men, and, <lb/>
that my escape might rescue them from the most dreadful <lb/>
calamities. I determined to make this dangerous experiment <lb/>
without delay.</p>
<p>I came nearer to the aperture, and had, consequently, a <lb/>
larger view of this recess. To my unspeakable dismay, I <lb/>
now caught a glimpse of one, seated at the fire. His back <lb/>
was turned towards me so that I could distinctly survey his <lb/>
gigantic form and fantastic ornaments.</p>
<p>My project was frustrated. This one was probably <reg orig="com-|missioned">commissioned</reg> <lb/>
to watch and to awaken his companions when a <lb/>
due portion of sleep had been taken. That he would not <lb/>
be unfaithful or remiss in the performance of the part <reg orig="assign-|ed">assigned</reg> <lb/>
to him was easily predicted. To pass him without <reg orig="excit-|ing">exciting</reg> <lb/>
his notice, and the entrance could not otherwise be <lb/>
reached, was impossible. Once more I shrunk back and <lb/>
revolved with hopelessness and anguish, the necessity to <lb/>
which I was reduced.</p>
<p>This interval of dreary foreboding did not last long. <lb/>
Some motion in him that was seated by the fire attracted my <lb/>
notice. I looked, and beheld him rise from his place and <lb/>
go forth from the cavern. This unexpected incident led my <lb/>
thoughts into a new channel. Could not some advantage <lb/>
be taken of his absence? Could not this opportunity be <lb/>
seized for making my escape? He had left his gun and <lb/>
hatchet on the ground. It was likely, therefore, that he had <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="eaf033v3_0165" pid="uva-lib:349897"/>
not gone far, and would speedily return. Might not these <lb/>
weapons be seized, and some provision be thus made against <lb/>
the danger of meeting him without, or of being pursued?</p>
<p>Before a resolution could be formed, a new sound saluted <lb/>
my ear. It was a deep groan, succeeded by sobs that seemed <lb/>
struggling for utterance, but were vehemently counteracted <lb/>
by the sufferer. This low and bitter lamentation apparently <lb/>
proceeded from some one within the cave. It could not be <lb/>
from one of this swarthy band. It must then proceed from <lb/>
a captive, whom they had reserved for torment or servitude, <lb/>
and who had seized the opportunity afforded by the absence <lb/>
of him that watched, to give vent to his despair.</p>
<p>I again thrust my head forward, and beheld, lying on the <lb/>
ground, apart from the rest, and bound hand and foot, a <lb/>
young girl. Her dress was the coarse russet garb of the <lb/>
country, and bespoke her to be some farmer's daughter. <lb/>
Her features denoted the last degree of fear and anguish, <lb/>
and she moved her limbs in such a manner as shewed that <lb/>
the ligatures by which she was confined, produced, by their <lb/>
tightness, the utmost degree of pain.</p>
<p>My wishes were now bent not only to preserve myself, <lb/>
and to frustrate the future attempts of these savages, but <lb/>
likewise to relieve this miserable victim. This could only <lb/>
be done by escaping from the cavern and returning with <lb/>
seasonable aid. The sobs of the girl were likely to rouse <lb/>
the sleepers. My appearance before her would prompt <lb/>
her to testify her surprise by some exclamation or shriek. <lb/>
What could hence be predicted but that the band would <lb/>
start on their feet, and level their unerring pieces at my head!</p>
<p>I know not why I was insensible to these dangers. My <lb/>
thirst was rendered by these delays intolerable. It took from <lb/>
me, in some degree, the power of deliberation. The <reg orig="mur-|murs">murmurs</reg> <lb/>
which had drawn me hither continued still to be heard. <lb/>
Some torrent or cascade could not be far distant from the <lb/>
entrance of the cavern, and it seemed as if one draught of <lb/>
clear water was a luxury cheaply purchased by death itself. <lb/>
This, in addition to considerations more disinterested, and <lb/>
which I have already mentioned, impelled me forward.</p>
<p>The girl's cheek rested on the hard rock, and her eyes <lb/>
were dim with tears. As they were turned towards me, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
I hoped that my movements would be noticed by her <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="eaf033v3_0166" pid="uva-lib:349898"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">14*</fw></pb>
gradually and without abruptness. This expectation was <lb/>
fulfilled. I had not advanced many steps before she <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg> <lb/>
me. This moment was critical beyond all others <lb/>
in the course of my existence. My life was suspended, as <lb/>
it were, by a spider's thread. All rested on the effect which <lb/>
this discovery should make upon this feeble victim.</p>
<p>I was watchful of the first movement of her eye, which <lb/>
should indicate a consciousness of my presence. I labored, <lb/>
by gestures and looks, to deter her from betraying her <reg orig="emo-|tion">emotion</reg>. <lb/>
My attention was, at the same time, fixed upon the <lb/>
sleepers, and an anxious glance was cast towards the <reg orig="quar-|er">quarer</reg> <lb/>
whence the watchful savage might appear.</p>
<p>I stooped and seized the musket and hatchet. The <lb/>
space beyond the fire was, as I expected, open to the air. <lb/>
I issued forth with trembling steps. The sensations inspired <lb/>
by the dangers which environed me, added to my recent <lb/>
horrors, and the influence of the moon, which had now <lb/>
gained the zenith, and whose lustre dazzled my long <reg orig="be-|nighted">benighted</reg> <lb/>
senses, cannot be adequately described.</p>
<p>For a minute, I was unable to distinguish objects. This <lb/>
confusion was speedily corrected, and I found myself on the <lb/>
verge of a steep. Craggy eminences arose on all sides. On <lb/>
the left hand was a space that offered some footing, and <lb/>
hither I turned. A torrent was below me, and this path <lb/>
appeared to lead to it. It quickly appeared in sight, and all <lb/>
foreign cares were, for a time, suspended.</p>
<p>This water fell from the upper regions of the hill, upon a <lb/>
flat projecture which was continued on either side, and on <lb/>
part of which I was now standing. The path was bounded <lb/>
on the left by an inaccessible wall, and on the right <reg orig="termi-|nated">terminated</reg> <lb/>
at the distance of two or three feet from the wall, in a <lb/>
precipice. The water was eight or ten paces distant, and <lb/>
no impediment seemed likely to rise between us. I rushed <lb/>
forward with speed.</p>
<p>My progress was quickly checked. Close to the falling <lb/>
water, seated on the edge, his back supported by the rock, <lb/>
and his legs hanging over the precipice, I now beheld the <lb/>
savage who left the cave before me. The noise of the <lb/>
cascade and the improbability of interruption, at least from <lb/>
this quarter, had made him inattentive to my motions.</p>
<pb n="154" entity="eaf033v3_0167" pid="uva-lib:349899"/>
<p>I paused. Along this verge lay the only road by which I <lb/>
could reach the water, and by which I could escape. The <lb/>
passage was completely occupied by this antagonist. To <lb/>
advance towards him, or to remain where I was, would <reg orig="pro-|duce">produce</reg> <lb/>
the same effect. I should, in either case, be detected. <lb/>
He was unarmed; but his outcries would instantly summon <lb/>
his companions to his aid. I could not hope to overpower <lb/>
him, and pass him in defiance of his opposition. But if this <lb/>
were effected, pursuit would be instantly commenced. I <lb/>
was unacquainted with the way. The way was <reg orig="unquestion-|ably">unquestionably</reg> <lb/>
difficult. My strength was nearly annihilated; I should <lb/>
be overtaken in a moment, or their deficiency in speed <lb/>
would be supplied by the accuracy of their aim. Their <lb/>
bullets, at least, would reach me.</p>
<p>There was one method of removing this impediment. <lb/>
The piece which I held in my hand was cocked. There <lb/>
could be no doubt that it was loaded. A precaution of this <lb/>
kind would never be omitted by a warrior of this hue. At <lb/>
a greater distance than this, I should not fear to reach the <lb/>
mark. Should I not discharge it, and, at the same moment, <lb/>
rush forward to secure the road which my adversary's <lb/>
death would open to me?</p>
<p>Perhaps you will conceive a purpose like this to have <reg orig="ar-|gued">argued</reg> <lb/>
a sanguinary and murderous disposition. Let it be <lb/>
remembered, however, that I entertained no doubts about <lb/>
the hostile designs of these men. This was sufficiently <reg orig="in-|dicated">indicated</reg> <lb/>
by their arms, their guise, and the captive who <reg orig="at-|tended">attended</reg> <lb/>
them. Let the fate of my parents be, likewise, <lb/>
remembered. I was not certain but that these very men <lb/>
were the assassins of my family, and were those who had <lb/>
reduced me and my sisters to the condition of orphans and <lb/>
dependants. No words can describe the torments of my <lb/>
thirst. Relief to these torments, and safety to my life, were <lb/>
within view. How could I hesitate?</p>
<p>Yet I did hesitate. My aversion to bloodshed was not <lb/>
to be subdued but by the direst necessity. I knew, indeed, <lb/>
that the discharge of a musket would only alarm the <reg orig="ene-|mies">enemies</reg> <lb/>
which remained behind; but I had another and a better <lb/>
weapon in my grasp. I could rive the head of my <reg orig="adver-|sary">adversary</reg>, <lb/>
and cast him headlong, without any noise which should <lb/>
be heard, into the cavern.</p>
<pb n="155" entity="eaf033v3_0168" pid="uva-lib:349900"/>
<p>Still I was willing to withdraw, to re-enter the cave, and <lb/>
take shelter in the darksome recesses from which I had <lb/>
emerged. Here I might remain, unsuspected, till these <reg orig="de-|tested">detested</reg> <lb/>
guests should depart. The hazards attending my <reg orig="re-|entrance">reentrance</reg> <lb/>
were to be boldly encountered, and the torments <lb/>
of unsatisfied thirst were to be patiently endured, rather <lb/>
than imbrue my hands in the blood of my fellow-men. But <lb/>
this expedient would be ineffectual if my retreat should be <lb/>
observed by this savage. Of that I was bound to be <reg orig="incon-|testibly">incontestibly</reg> <lb/>
assured. I retreated, therefore, but kept my eye <lb/>
fixed at the same time upon the enemy.</p>
<p>Some ill fate decreed that I should not retreat unobserved. <lb/>
Scarcely had I withdrawn three paces when he started from <lb/>
his seat, and, turning towards me, walked with a quick pace. <lb/>
The shadow of the rock, and the improbability of meeting <lb/>
an enemy here, concealed me for a moment from his <reg orig="obser-|vation">observation</reg>. <lb/>
I stood still. The slightest motion would have <reg orig="at-|tracted">attracted</reg> <lb/>
his notice. At present, the narrow space engaged <lb/>
all his vigilance. Cautious footsteps, and attention to the <lb/>
path, were indispensable to his safety. The respite was <lb/>
momentary, and I employed it in my own defence.</p>
<p>How otherwise could I act? The danger that impended <lb/>
aimed at nothing less than my life. To take the life of <reg orig="an-|other">another</reg> <lb/>
was the only method of averting it. The means were <lb/>
in my hand, and they were used. In an extremity like this, <lb/>
my muscles would have acted almost in defiance of my <lb/>
will.</p>
<p>The stroke was quick as lightning, and the wound mortal <lb/>
and deep. He had not time to descry the author of his fate; <lb/>
but, sinking on the path, expired without a groan. The <lb/>
hatchet buried itself in his breast, and rolled with him to the <lb/>
bottom of the precipice.</p>
<p>Never before had I taken the life of a human creature. <lb/>
On this head, I had, indeed, entertained somewhat of <reg orig="reli-|gious">religious</reg> <lb/>
scruples. These scruples did not forbid me to <reg orig="de-|fend">defend</reg> <lb/>
myself, but they made me cautious and reluctant to <lb/>
decide. Though they could not withhold my hand, when <lb/>
urged by a necessity like this, they were sufficient to make <lb/>
me look back upon the deed with remorse and dismay.</p>
<p>I did not escape all compunction in the present instance, <lb/>
but the tumult of my feelings was quickly allayed. To <lb/>
<pb n="156" entity="eaf033v3_0169" pid="uva-lib:349901"/>
quench my thirst was a consideration by which all others <lb/>
were supplanted. I approached the torrent, and not only <lb/>
drank copiously, but laved my head, neck, and arms, in <lb/>
this delicious element.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Never</hi> was any delight worthy of comparison with the <lb/>
raptures which I then experienced. Life, that was rapidly <lb/>
ebbing, appeared to return upon me with redoubled <reg orig="vio-|lence">violence</reg>. <lb/>
My languors, my excruciating heat, vanished in a <lb/>
moment, and I felt prepared to undergo the labors of <reg orig="Her-|cules">Hercules</reg>. <lb/>
Having fully supplied the demands of nature in this <lb/>
respect, I returned to reflection on the circumstances of my <lb/>
situation. The path winding round the hill was now free <lb/>
from all impediments. What remained but to precipitate <lb/>
my flight? I might speedily place myself beyond all danger. <lb/>
I might gain some hospitable shelter, where my fatigues <lb/>
might be repaired by repose, and my wounds be cured. I <lb/>
might likewise impart to my protectors seasonable <reg orig="informa-|tion">information</reg> <lb/>
of the enemies who meditated their destruction.</p>
<p>I thought upon the condition of the hapless girl whom <lb/>
I had left in the power of the savages. Was it impossible <lb/>
to rescue her? Might I not relieve her from her bonds, and <lb/>
make her the companion of my flight? The exploit was <lb/>
perilous, but not impracticable. There was something <reg orig="das-|tardly">dastardly</reg> <lb/>
and ignominious in withdrawing from the danger, and <lb/>
leaving a helpless being exposed to it. A single minute <lb/>
might suffice to snatch her from death or captivity. The <lb/>
parents might deserve that I should hazard or even sacrifice <lb/>
my life, in the cause of their child.</p>
<p>After some fluctuation, I determined to return to the <lb/>
cavern, and attempt the rescue of the girl. The success of <lb/>
this project depended on the continuance of their sleep. It <lb/>
was proper to approach with wariness, and to heed the <lb/>
smallest token which might bespeak their condition. I crept <lb/>
along the path, bending my ear forward to catch any sound <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="eaf033v3_0170" pid="uva-lib:349902"/>
that might arise. I heard nothing but the half-stifled sobs <lb/>
of the girl.</p>
<p>I entered with the slowest and most anxious <reg orig="circumspec-|tion">circumspection</reg>. <lb/>
Every thing was found in its pristine state. The <lb/>
girl noticed my entrance with a mixture of terror and joy. <lb/>
My gestures and looks enjoined upon her silence. I stooped <lb/>
down, and taking another hatchet, cut asunder the deer-skin <lb/>
thongs by which her wrists and ancles were tied. I then <lb/>
made signs for her to rise and follow me. She willingly <lb/>
complied with my directions; but her benumbed joints and <lb/>
lacerated sinews, refused to support her. There was no <lb/>
time to be lost; I therefore lifted her in my arms, and, <reg orig="fee-|ble">feeble</reg> <lb/>
and tottering as I was, proceeded with this burthen, <lb/>
along the perilous steep, and over a most rugged path.</p>
<p>I hoped that some exertion would enable her to retrieve <lb/>
the use of her limbs. I set her, therefore, on her feet, <lb/>
exhorting her to walk as well as she was able, and promising <lb/>
her my occasional assistance. The poor girl was not <reg orig="defi-|cient">deficient</reg> <lb/>
in zeal, and presently moved along with light and <lb/>
quick steps. We speedily reached the bottom of the hill.</p>
<p>No fancy can conceive a scene more wild and desolate <lb/>
than that which now presented itself. The soil was nearly <lb/>
covered with sharp fragments of stone. Between these <lb/>
sprung brambles and creeping vines, whose twigs, crossing <lb/>
and intertwining with each other, added to the roughness <lb/>
below, made the passage infinitely toilsome. Scattered <lb/>
over this space were single cedars with their ragged spines <lb/>
and wreaths of moss, and copses of dwarf oaks, which were <lb/>
only new emblems of sterility.</p>
<p>I was wholly unacquainted with the scene before me. <lb/>
No marks of habitation or culture, no traces of the footsteps <lb/>
of men, were discernible. I scarcely knew in what region <lb/>
of the globe I was placed. I had come hither by means so <lb/>
inexplicable, as to leave it equally in doubt, whether I was <lb/>
separated from my paternal abode by a river or an ocean.</p>
<p>I made inquiries of my companion, but she was unable <lb/>
to talk coherently. She answered my questions with <reg orig="weep-|ing">weeping</reg>, <lb/>
and sobs, and entreaties to fly from the scene of her <lb/>
distress. I collected from her, at length, that her father's <lb/>
house had been attacked on the preceding evening, and all <lb/>
the family but herself destroyed. Since this disaster she <lb/>
<pb n="158" entity="eaf033v3_0171" pid="uva-lib:349903"/>
had walked very fast and a great way, but knew not how <lb/>
far or in what direction.</p>
<p>In a wilderness like this, my only hope was to light upon <lb/>
obscure paths, made by cattle. Meanwhile I endeavored <lb/>
to adhere to one line, and to burst through the vexatious <lb/>
obstacles which encumbered our way. The ground was <lb/>
concealed by the bushes, and we were perplexed and <reg orig="fa-|tigued">fatigued</reg> <lb/>
by a continual succession of hollows and prominences. <lb/>
At one moment we were nearly thrown headlong into a pit. <lb/>
At another we struck our feet against the angles of stones. <lb/>
The branches of the oak rebounded in our faces or <reg orig="en-|tangled">entangled</reg> <lb/>
our legs, and the unseen thorns inflicted on us a <lb/>
thousand wounds.</p>
<p>I was obliged, in these arduous circumstances, to support <lb/>
not only myself but my companion. Her strength was <lb/>
overpowered by her evening journey, and the terror of being <lb/>
overtaken, incessantly harassed her.</p>
<p>Sometimes we lighted upon tracks which afforded us an <lb/>
easier footing, and inspired us with courage to proceed. <lb/>
These, for a time, terminated at a brook or in a bog, and <lb/>
we were once more compelled to go forward at random. <lb/>
One of these tracks insensibly became more beaten, and, at <lb/>
length, exhibited the traces of wheels. To this I adhered, <lb/>
confident that it would finally conduct us to a dwelling.</p>
<p>On either side, the undergrowth of shrubs and brambles <lb/>
continued as before. Sometimes small spaces were <reg orig="ob-|served">observed</reg>, <lb/>
which had lately been cleared by fire. At length <lb/>
a vacant space of larger dimensions than had hitherto <reg orig="oc-|curred">occurred</reg>, <lb/>
presented itself to my view. It was a field of some <lb/>
acres, that had, apparently, been upturned by the hoe. <lb/>
At the corner of this field was a small house.</p>
<p>My heart leaped with joy at this sight. I hastened <reg orig="to-|ward">toward</reg> <lb/>
it, in the hope that my uncertainties, and toils, and <lb/>
dangers, were now drawing to a close. This dwelling was <lb/>
suited to the poverty and desolation which surrounded it. <lb/>
It consisted of a few unhewn logs laid upon each other, to <lb/>
the height of eight or ten feet, including a quadrangular <lb/>
space of similar dimensions, and covered by thatch. There <lb/>
was no window, light being sufficiently admitted into the <lb/>
crevices between the logs. These had formerly been <lb/>
loosely plastered with clay, but air and rain had crumbled <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="eaf033v3_0172" pid="uva-lib:349904"/>
and washed the greater part of this rude cement away. <lb/>
Somewhat like a chimney, built of half-burnt bricks, was <lb/>
perceived at one corner. The door was fastened by a <lb/>
leathern thong, tied to a peg.</p>
<p>All within was silence and darkness. I knocked at the <lb/>
door and called, but no one moved or answered. The <lb/>
tenant, whoever he was, was absent. His leave could not <lb/>
be obtained, and I, therefore, entered without it. The <lb/>
autumn had made some progress, and the air was frosty <lb/>
and sharp. My mind and muscles had been, of late, so <lb/>
strenuously occupied, that the cold had not been felt. The <lb/>
cessation of exercise, however, quickly restored my <reg orig="sensi-|bility">sensibility</reg> <lb/>
in this respect, but the unhappy girl complained of <lb/>
being half frozen.</p>
<p>Fire, therefore, was the first object of my search. <reg orig="Hap-|pily">Happily</reg>, <lb/>
some embers were found upon the hearth, together <lb/>
with potatoe stalks and dry chips. Of these, with much <lb/>
difficulty, I kindled a fire, by which some warmth was <reg orig="im-|parted">imparted</reg> <lb/>
to our shivering limbs. The light enabled me, as I <lb/>
sat upon the ground, to survey the interior of this mansion.</p>
<p>Three saplings, stripped of their branches, and bound <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg> <lb/>
at their ends by twigs, formed a kind of bedstead, <lb/>
which was raised from the ground by four stones. Ropes <lb/>
stretched across these, and covered by a blanket, <reg orig="consti-|tuted">constituted</reg> <lb/>
the bed. A board, of which one end rested on the <lb/>
bedstead, and the other was thrust between the logs that <lb/>
composed the wall, sustained the stale fragments of a rye <lb/>
loaf, and a cedar bucket kept entire by withes instead of <lb/>
hoops. In the bucket was a little water, full of droppings <lb/>
from the roof, drowned insects and sand, a basket or two <lb/>
neatly made, and a hoe, with a stake thrust into it by way <lb/>
of handle, made up all the furniture that was visible.</p>
<p>Next to cold, hunger was the most urgent necessity by <lb/>
which we were now pressed. This was no time to give ear <lb/>
to scruples. We, therefore, unceremoniously divided the <lb/>
bread and the water between us. I had now leisure to <reg orig="be-|stow">bestow</reg> <lb/>
some regards upon the future.</p>
<p>These remnants of fire and food convinced me that this <lb/>
dwelling was usually inhabited, and that it had lately been <lb/>
deserted. Some engagement had probably carried the <lb/>
tenant abroad. His absence might be terminated in a few <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="eaf033v3_0173" pid="uva-lib:349905"/>
minutes, or might endure through the night. On his return, <lb/>
I questioned not my power to appease any indignation he <lb/>
might feel at the liberties which I had taken. I was willing <lb/>
to suppose him one who would readily afford us all the <reg orig="in-|formation">information</reg> <lb/>
and succour that we needed.</p>
<p>If he should not return till sunrise, I meant to resume <lb/>
my journey. By the comfortable meal we had made, and <lb/>
the repose of a few hours, we should be considerably <reg orig="in-|vigorated">invigorated</reg> <lb/>
and refreshed, and the road would lead us to <lb/>
some more hospitable tenement.</p>
<p>My thoughts were too tumultuous, and my situation too <lb/>
precarious, to allow me to sleep. The girl, on the <reg orig="con-|trary">contrary</reg>, <lb/>
soon sunk into a sweet oblivion of all her cares. She <lb/>
laid herself, by my advice, upon the bed, and left me to <lb/>
ruminate without interruption.</p>
<p>I was not wholly free from the apprehension of danger. <lb/>
What influence his boisterous and solitary life might have <lb/>
upon the temper of the being who inhabited this hut, I <lb/>
could not predict. How soon the Indians might awake, <lb/>
and what path they would pursue, I was equally unable to <lb/>
guess. It was by no means impossible that they might tread <lb/>
upon my footsteps, and knock, in a few minutes, at the <lb/>
door of this cottage. It behoved me to make all the <reg orig="pre-|paration">preparation</reg> <lb/>
in my power against untoward incidents.</p>
<p>I had not parted with the gun which I had first seized in <lb/>
the cavern, nor with the hatchet which I had afterwards <lb/>
used to cut the bands of the girl. These were, at once, <lb/>
my trophies and my means of defence, which it had been <lb/>
rash and absurd to have relinquished. My present reliance <lb/>
was placed upon these.</p>
<p>I now, for the first time, examined the prize that I had <lb/>
made. Other considerations had prevented me till now, <lb/>
from examining the structure of the piece, but I could not <lb/>
but observe that it had two barrels, and was lighter and <lb/>
smaller than an ordinary musket. The light of the fire <lb/>
now enabled me to inspect it with more accuracy.</p>
<p>Scarcely had I fixed my eyes upon the stock, when I <lb/>
perceived marks that were familiar to my apprehension. <lb/>
Shape, ornaments, and cyphers, were evidently the same <lb/>
with those of a piece which I had frequently handled. <lb/>
The marks were of a kind which could not be mistaken. <lb/>
<pb n="161" entity="eaf033v3_0174" pid="uva-lib:349906"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">15</fw></pb>
This piece was mine; and when I left my uncle's house, it <lb/>
was deposited, as I believed, in the closet of my chamber.</p>
<p>Thou wilt easily conceive the inference which this <reg orig="cir-|cumstance">circumstance</reg> <lb/>
suggested. My hairs rose and my teeth <reg orig="chat-|tered">chattered</reg> <lb/>
with horror. My whole frame was petrified, and I <lb/>
paced to and fro, hurried from the chimney to the door, <lb/>
and from the door to the chimney, with the misguided fury <lb/>
of a maniac.</p>
<p>I needed no proof of my calamity more incontestible than <lb/>
this. My uncle and my sisters had been murdered; the <lb/>
dwelling had been pillaged, and this had been a part of the <lb/>
plunder. Defenceless and asleep, they were assailed by <lb/>
these inexorable enemies, and I, who ought to have been <lb/>
their protector and champion, was removed to an <reg orig="immea-|surable">immeasurable</reg> <lb/>
distance, and was disabled, by some accursed chance, <lb/>
from affording them the succor which they needed.</p>
<p>For a time, I doubted whether I had not witnessed and <lb/>
shared this catastrophe. I had no memory of the <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg> <lb/>
that preceded my awaking in the pit. Had not the <lb/>
cause of my being cast into this abyss some connexion with <lb/>
the ruin of my family? Had I not been dragged hither by <lb/>
these savages, and reduced, by their malice, to that <reg orig="breath-|less">breathless</reg> <lb/>
and insensible condition? Was I horn to a malignant <lb/>
destiny never tired of persecuting? Thus had my parents <lb/>
and their infant offspring perished, and thus completed was <lb/>
the fate of all those to whom my affections cleaved, and <lb/>
whom the first disaster had spared.</p>
<p>Hitherto the death of the savage, whom I had despatched <lb/>
with my hatchet, had not been remembered without some <lb/>
remorse. Now my emotions were totally changed. I was <lb/>
somewhat comforted in thinking that thus much of <reg orig="neces-|sary">necessary</reg> <lb/>
vengeance had been executed. New and more <reg orig="vehe-|ment">vehement</reg> <lb/>
regrets were excited by reflecting on the forbearance <lb/>
I had practised when so much was in my power. All the <lb/>
miscreants had been at my mercy, and a bloody retribution <lb/>
might, with safety and ease, have been inflicted on their <lb/>
prostrate bodies.</p>
<p>It was now too late. What of consolation or of hope <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
to me? To return to my ancient dwelling, now <lb/>
polluted with blood, or perhaps, nothing but a smoking ruin, <lb/>
<pb n="162" entity="eaf033v3_0175" pid="uva-lib:349907"/>
was abhorred. Life, connected with the remembrance of <lb/>
my misfortunes was detestable. I was no longer anxious <lb/>
for flight. No change of the scene but that which <reg orig="termina-|ted">terminated</reg> <lb/>
all consciousness, could I endure to think of.</p>
<p>Amidst these gloomy meditations the idea was suddenly <lb/>
suggested of returning, with the utmost expedition, to the <lb/>
cavern. It was possible that the assassins were still asleep. <lb/>
He who was appointed to watch, and to make, in due season, <lb/>
the signal for resuming their march, was forever silent. <lb/>
Without this signal it was not unlikely that they would sleep <lb/>
till dawn of day. But if they should be roused, they might <lb/>
be overtaken or met, and, by choosing a proper station, two <lb/>
victims might at least fall. The ultimate event to myself <lb/>
would surely be fatal; but my own death was an object of <lb/>
desire rather than of dread. To die thus speedily, and <lb/>
after some atonement was made for those who had already <lb/>
been slain, was sweet.</p>
<p>The way to the mountain was difficult and tedious, but <lb/>
the ridge was distinctly seen from the door of the cottage, <lb/>
and I trusted that auspicious chance would lead me to that <lb/>
part of it where my prey was to be found. I snatched up <lb/>
the gun and tomahawk in a transport of eagerness. On <lb/>
examining the former, I found that both barrels were deeply <lb/>
loaded.</p>
<p>This piece was of extraordinary workmanship. It was <lb/>
the legacy of an English officer, who died in Bengal, to <lb/>
Sarsefield. It was constructed for the purposes not of sport <lb/>
but of war. The artist had made it a congeries of tubes <lb/>
and springs, by which every purpose of protection and <lb/>
offence was effectually served. A dagger's blade was <reg orig="attach-|ed">attached</reg> <lb/>
to it, capable of being fixed at the end, and of <reg orig="answer-|ing">answering</reg> <lb/>
the destructive purpose of a bayonet. On his departure <lb/>
from Solebury, my friend left it, as a pledge of his affection, <lb/>
in my possession. Hitherto I had chiefly employed it in <lb/>
shooting at a mark, in order to improve my sight; now was <lb/>
I to profit by the gift in a different way.</p>
<p>Thus armed, I prepared to sally forth on my adventurous <lb/>
expedition. Sober views might have speedily succeeded to <lb/>
the present tempest of my passions. I might have gradually <lb/>
discovered the romantic and criminal temerity of my <reg orig="pro-|ject">project</reg>, <lb/>
the folly of revenge, and the duty of perserving my <lb/>
<pb n="163" entity="eaf033v3_0176" pid="uva-lib:349908"/>
life for the benefit of mankind. I might have suspected <lb/>
the propriety of my conclusion, and have admitted some <lb/>
doubts as to the catastrophe which I imagined to have <reg orig="be-|fallen">befallen</reg> <lb/>
my uncle and sisters. I might, at least, have <reg orig="consent-|ed">consented</reg> <lb/>
to ascertain their condition with my own eyes; and for <lb/>
this end have returned to the cottage, and have patiently <lb/>
waited till the morning light should permit me to resume my <lb/>
journey.</p>
<p>This conduct was precluded by a new incident. Before <lb/>
I opened the door I looked through a crevice of the wall, <lb/>
and perceived three human figures at the farther end of the <lb/>
field. They approached the house. Though indistinctly <lb/>
seen, something in their port persuaded me that these were <lb/>
the Indians from whom I had lately parted. I was startled, <lb/>
but not dismayed. My thirst of vengeance was still <reg orig="power-|ful">powerful</reg>, <lb/>
and I believed that the moment of its gratification was <lb/>
hastening. In a short time they would arrive and enter the <lb/>
house. In what manner should they be received?</p>
<p>I studied not my own security. It was the scope of my <lb/>
wishes to kill the whole number of my foes; but that being <lb/>
done, I was indifferent to the consequences. I desired not <lb/>
to live to relate or to exult in the deed.</p>
<p>To go forth was perilous and useless. All that remained <lb/>
was to sit upon the ground opposite the door, and fire at <lb/>
each as he entered. In the hasty survey I had taken of <lb/>
this apartment, one object had been overlooked, or imperfectly <lb/>
noticed. Close to the chimney was an aperture, formed by <lb/>
a cavity partly in the wall and in the ground. It was the <lb/>
entrance of an oven, which resembled, on the outside, a <lb/>
mound of earth, and which was filled with dry stalks of <lb/>
potatoes and other rubbish.</p>
<p>Into this it was possible to thrust my body. A sort of <lb/>
screen might be formed of the brush-wood, and more <reg orig="de-|liberate">deliberate</reg> <lb/>
and effectual execution be done upon the enemy. <lb/>
I weighed not the disadvantages of this scheme, but <reg orig="precipi-|tately">precipitately</reg> <lb/>
threw myself into this cavity. I discovered, in an <lb/>
instant, that is was totally unfit for my purpose, but it was <lb/>
too late to repair my miscarriage.</p>
<p>This wall of the hovel was placed near the verge of a <lb/>
sand-bank. The oven was erected on the very brink. <lb/>
This bank being of a loose and mutable soil, could not <reg orig="sus-|tain">sustain</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="164" entity="eaf033v3_0177" pid="uva-lib:349909"/>
my weight. It sunk, and I sunk along with it. The <lb/>
height of the bank was three or four feet, so that, though <lb/>
disconcerted and embarrassed, I received no injury. I still <lb/>
grasped my gun, and resumed my feet in a moment.</p>
<p>What was now to be done? The bank screened me <lb/>
from the view of the savages. The thicket was hard by, <lb/>
and if I were eager to escape, the way was obvious and <lb/>
sure. But though single, though enfeebled by toil, by <reg orig="absti-|nence">abstinence</reg>, <lb/>
and by disease, and though so much exceeded in <lb/>
number and strength, by my foes, I was determined to <lb/>
await and provoke the contest.</p>
<p>In addition to the desperate impulse of passion, I was <lb/>
swayed by thoughts of the danger which beset the sleeping <lb/>
girl, and from which my flight would leave her without <reg orig="pro-|tection">protection</reg>. <lb/>
How strange is the destiny that governs mankind! <lb/>
The consequence of shrouding myself in this cavity had not <lb/>
been foreseen. It was an expedient which courage, and <lb/>
not cowardice suggested, and yet it was the only expedient <lb/>
by which flight had been rendered practicable. To have <lb/>
issued from the door would only have been to confront, and <lb/>
not to elude the danger.</p>
<p>The first impulse prompted me to re-enter the cottage <lb/>
by this avenue, but this could not be done with certainty <lb/>
and expedition. What then remained? While I <reg orig="delibera-|ted">deliberated</reg>, <lb/>
the men approached, and, after a moment's hesitation, <lb/>
entered the house, the door being partly open.</p>
<p>The fire on the hearth enabled them to survey the room. <lb/>
One of them uttered a sudden exclamation of surprise. <lb/>
This was easily interpreted. They had noticed the girl <lb/>
who had lately been their captive lying asleep on the <reg orig="blan-|ket">blanket</reg>. <lb/>
Their astonishment at finding her here, and in this <lb/>
condition, may be easily conceived.</p>
<p>I now reflected that I might place myself, without being <lb/>
observed, near the entrance, at an angle of the building, and <lb/>
shoot at each as he successively came forth. I perceived <lb/>
that the bank conformed to two sides of the house, and that <lb/>
I might gain a view of the front and of the entrance, without <lb/>
exposing myself to observation.</p>
<p>I lost no time in gaining this station. The bank was as <lb/>
high as my breast. It was easy, therefore, to crouch <reg orig="be-|neath">beneath</reg> <lb/>
it, to bring my eye close to the verge, and, laying my <lb/>
<pb n="165" entity="eaf033v3_0178" pid="uva-lib:349910"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">15*</fw></pb>
gun upon the top of it among the grass, with its muzzles <lb/>
pointed to the door, patiently to wait their forthcoming.</p>
<p>My eye and my ear were equally attentive to what was <lb/>
passing. A low and muttering conversation was maintained <lb/>
in the house. Presently I heard a heavy stroke descend. <lb/>
I shuddered, and my blood ran cold at the sound. I <reg orig="enter-|tained">entertained</reg> <lb/>
no doubt but that it was the stroke of a hatchet on the <lb/>
head or breast of the helpless sleeper.</p>
<p>It was followed by a loud shriek. The continuance of <lb/>
these shrieks proved that the stroke had not been instantly <lb/>
fatal. I waited to hear it repeated, but the sounds that now <lb/>
arose were like those produced by dragging somewhat <lb/>
along the ground. The shrieks, meanwhile, were incessant <lb/>
and piteous. My heart faltered, and I saw that mighty <lb/>
efforts must be made to preserve my joints and my nerves <lb/>
steadfast. All depended on the strenuous exertions and the <lb/>
fortunate dexterity of a moment.</p>
<p>One now approached the door, and came forth, dragging <lb/>
the girl, whom he held by the hair, after him. What <reg orig="hin-|dered">hindered</reg> <lb/>
me from shooting at his first appearance, I know not. <lb/>
This had been my previous resolution. My hand touched <lb/>
the trigger, and as he moved, the piece was levelled at his <lb/>
right ear. Perhaps the momentous consequences of my <lb/>
failure, made me wait till his ceasing to move might render <lb/>
my aim more sure.</p>
<p>Having dragged the girl, still piteously shrieking, to the <lb/>
distance of ten feet from the house, he threw her from him <lb/>
with violence. She fell upon the ground, and observing <lb/>
him level his piece at her breast, renewed her supplications <lb/>
in a still more piercing tone. Little did the forlorn wretch <lb/>
think that her deliverance was certain and near. I rebuked <lb/>
myself for having thus long delayed. I fired, and my <reg orig="ene-|my">enemy</reg> <lb/>
sunk upon the ground without a struggle.</p>
<p>Thus far had success attended me in this unequal <reg orig="con-|test">contest</reg>. <lb/>
The next shot would leave me nearly powerless. If <lb/>
that, however, proved as unerring as the first, the chances <lb/>
of defeat were lessened. The savages within, knowing the <lb/>
intentions of their associate with regard to the captive girl, <lb/>
would probably mistake the report which they heard for <lb/>
that of his piece. Their mistake, however, would speedily <lb/>
<pb n="166" entity="eaf033v3_0179" pid="uva-lib:349911"/>
give place to doubts, and they would rush forth to ascertain <lb/>
the truth. It behoved me to provide a similar reception <lb/>
for him that next appeared.</p>
<p>It was as I expected. Scarcely was my eye again fixed <lb/>
upon the entrance, when a tawny and terrific visage was <lb/>
stretched fearfully forth. It was the signal of his fate. His <lb/>
glances cast wildly and swiftly round, lighted upon me, and <lb/>
on the fatal instrument which was pointed at his forehead. <lb/>
His muscles were at once exerted to withdraw his head, <lb/>
and to vociferate a warning to his fellow, but his movement <lb/>
was too slow. The ball entered above his ear. He <reg orig="tum-|bled">tumbled</reg> <lb/>
headlong to the ground, bereaved of sensation, though <lb/>
not of life, and had power only to struggle and mutter.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Think</hi> not that I relate these things with exultation or <lb/>
tranquillity. All my education and the habits of my life <lb/>
tended to unfit me for a contest and a scene like this. But <lb/>
I was not governed by the soul which usually regulates my <lb/>

which had lately happened, a spirit vengeful, unrelenting, <lb/>
and ferocious.</p>
<p>There was now an interval for flight. Throwing my <lb/>
weapons away, I might gain the thicket in a moment. I had <lb/>
no ammunition, nor would time be afforded me to reload <lb/>
my piece. My antagonist would render my poinard and <lb/>
my speed of no use to me. Should he miss me as I fled, <lb/>
the girl would remain to expiate, by her agonies and death, <lb/>
the fate of his companions.</p>
<p>These thoughts passed through my mind in a shorter time <lb/>
than is demanded to express them. They yielded to an <lb/>
expedient suggested by the sight of the gun that had been <lb/>
raised to destroy the girl, and which now lay upon the <lb/>
ground. I am not large of bone, but am not deficient in <lb/>
agility and strength. All that remained to me of these <lb/>
qualities was now exerted; and dropping my own piece, I <lb/>
leaped upon the bank, and flew to seize my prize.</p>
<pb n="167" entity="eaf033v3_0180" pid="uva-lib:349912"/>
<p>It was not till I snatched it from the ground, that the <lb/>
propriety of regaining my former post, rushed upon my <reg orig="ap-|prehension">apprehension</reg>. <lb/>
He that was still posted in the hovel would <lb/>
mark me through the seams of the wall, and render my <lb/>
destruction sure. I once more ran towards the bank, with <lb/>
the intention to throw myself below it. All this was <reg orig="per-|formed">performed</reg> <lb/>
in an instant; but my vigilant foe was aware of his <lb/>
advantage, and fired through an opening between the logs. <lb/>
The bullet grazed my cheek, and produced a benumbing <lb/>
sensation that made me instantly fall to the earth. Though <lb/>
bereaved of strength, and fraught with the belief that I had <lb/>
received a mortal wound, my caution was not remitted. I <lb/>
loosened not my grasp of the gun, and the posture into <lb/>
which I accidentally fell enabled me to keep an eye upon <lb/>
the house and a hand upon the trigger. Perceiving my <lb/>
condition, the savage rushed from his covert in order to <lb/>
complete his work; but at three steps from the threshold, <lb/>
he received my bullet in his breast. The uplifted <reg orig="toma-|hawk">tomahawk</reg> <lb/>
fell from his hand, and, uttering a loud shriek, he <lb/>
fell upon the body of his companion. His cries struck <lb/>
upon my heart, and I wished that his better fortune had <lb/>
cast this evil from him upon me.</p>
<p>Thus I have told thee a bloody and disastrous tale. <lb/>
When thou reflectest on the mildness of my habits, my <reg orig="an-|tipathy">antipathy</reg> <lb/>
to scenes of violence and bloodshed, my <reg orig="unac-|quaintance">unacquaintance</reg> <lb/>
with the use of fire-arms, and the motives of a <lb/>
soldier, thou wilt scarcely allow credit to my story. That <lb/>
one rushing into these dangers, unfurnished with stratagems <lb/>
or weapons, disheartened and enfeebled by hardships and <lb/>
pain, should subdue four antagonists, trained from their <reg orig="in-|fancy">infancy</reg> <lb/>
to the artifices and exertions of Indian warfare, <lb/>
will seem the vision of fancy, rather than the lesson of <lb/>
truth.</p>
<p>I lifted my head from the ground and pondered upon <lb/>
this scene. The magnitude of this exploit made me <reg orig="ques-|tion">question</reg> <lb/>
its reality. By attending to my own sensations, I <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg> <lb/>
that I had received no wound, or at least, none of <lb/>
which there was reason to complain. The blood flowed <lb/>
plentifully from my cheek, but the injury was superficial. <lb/>
It was otherwise with my antagonists. The last that had <lb/>
fallen now ceased to groan. Their huge limbs, inured to <lb/>
<pb n="168" entity="eaf033v3_0181" pid="uva-lib:349913"/>
combat and <hi rend="italic">war-worn,</hi> were useless to their own defence, <lb/>
and to the injury of others.</p>
<p>The destruction that I witnessed was vast. Three beings, <lb/>
full of energy and heroism, endowed with minds strenuous <lb/>
and lofty, poured out their lives before me. I was the <reg orig="in-|strument">instrument</reg> <lb/>
of their destruction. This scene of carnage and <lb/>
blood was laid by me. To this havoc and horror was I <lb/>
led by such rapid footsteps!</p>
<p>My anguish was mingled with astonishment. In spite of <lb/>
the force and uniformity with which my senses were <reg orig="im-|pressed">impressed</reg> <lb/>
by external objects, the transition I had undergone <lb/>
was so wild and inexplicable; all that I had performed; all <lb/>
that I had witnessed since my egress from the pit, were so <lb/>
contradictory to precedent events, that I still clung to the <lb/>
belief that my thoughts were confused by delirium. From <lb/>
these reveries I was at length recalled by the groans of the <lb/>
girl, who lay near me on the ground.</p>
<p>I went to her and endeavored to console her. I found <lb/>
that while lying in the bed, she had received a blow upon <lb/>
the side, which was still productive of acute pain. She was <lb/>
unable to rise or to walk, and it was plain that one or more <lb/>
of her ribs had been fractured by the blow.</p>
<p>I knew not what means to devise for our mutual relief. <lb/>
It was possible that the nearest dwelling was many leagues <lb/>
distant. I knew not in what direction to go in order to <lb/>
find it, and my strength would not suffice to carry my <lb/>
wounded companion thither in my arms. There was no <reg orig="ex-|pedient">expedient</reg> <lb/>
but to remain in this field of blood till the morning.</p>
<p>I had scarcely formed this resolution before the report <lb/>
of a musket was heard at a small distance. At the same <lb/>
moment, I distinctly heard the whistling of a bullet near me. <lb/>
I now remembered that of the five Indians whom I saw in <lb/>
the cavern, I was acquainted with the destiny only of four. <lb/>
The fifth might be still alive, and fortune might reserve for <lb/>
him the task of avenging his companions. His steps might <lb/>
now be tending hither in search of them.</p>
<p>The musket belonging to him who was shot upon the <lb/>
threshold, was still charged. It was discreet to make all <lb/>
the provision in my power against danger. I possessed <lb/>
myself of this gun, and seating myself on the ground, <lb/>
<pb n="169" entity="eaf033v3_0182" pid="uva-lib:349914"/>
looked carefully on all sides, to descry the approach of the <lb/>
enemy. I listened with breathless eagerness.</p>
<p>Presently voices were heard. They ascended from that <lb/>
part of the thicket from which my view was intercepted by <lb/>
the cottage. These voices had something in them that <lb/>
bespoke them to belong to friends and countrymen. As <lb/>
yet I was unable to distinguish words.</p>
<p>Presently my eye was attracted to one quarter, by a <lb/>
sound as of feet trampling down bushes. Several heads <lb/>
were seen moving in succession, and at length, the whole <lb/>
person was conspicuous. One after another leaped over a <lb/>
kind of mound which bordered the field, and made towards <lb/>
the spot where I sat. This band was composed of ten or <lb/>
twelve persons, with each a gun upon his shoulder. Their <lb/>
guise, the moment it was perceived, dissipated all my <reg orig="appre-|hensions">apprehensions</reg>.</p>
<p>They came within the distance of a few paces before <lb/>
they discovered me. One stopped, and bespeaking the <lb/>
attention of his followers, called to know who was there? I <lb/>
answered that I was a friend, who entreated their assistance. <lb/>
I shall not paint their astonishment when, on coming nearer, <lb/>
they beheld me surrounded by the arms and dead bodies <lb/>
of my enemies.</p>
<p>I sat upon the ground, supporting my head with my left <lb/>
hand, and resting on my knee the stock of a heavy musket. <lb/>
My countenance was wan and haggard, my neck and bosom <lb/>
were dyed in blood, and my limbs, almost stripped by the <lb/>
brambles of their slender covering, were lacerated by a <lb/>
thousand wounds. Three savages, two of whom were <lb/>
steeped in gore, lay at a small distance, with the traces of <lb/>
recent life on their visages. Hard by was the girl, venting <lb/>
her anguish in the deepest groans, and entreating relief from <lb/>
the new comers.</p>
<p>One of the company, on approaching the girl, betrayed <lb/>
the utmost perturbation. "Good God!" he cried, "is this <lb/>
a dream? Can it be you? Speak!"</p>
<p>"Ah, my father! my father!" answered she, "it is I <lb/>
indeed."</p>
<p>The company, attracted by this dialogue, crowded round <lb/>
the girl, whom her father, clasping in his arms, lifted from <lb/>
the ground, and pressed, in a transport of joy to his breast. <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="eaf033v3_0183" pid="uva-lib:349915"/>
This delight was succeeded by solicitude respecting her <lb/>
condition. She could only answer his inquiries by <reg orig="com-|plaining">complaining</reg> <lb/>
that her side was bruised to pieces. How came <lb/>
you here?&mdash;Who hurt you?&mdash;Where did the Indians carry <lb/>
you?&mdash;were questions to which she could make no reply <lb/>
but by sobs and plaints.</p>
<p>My own calamities were forgotten in contemplating the <lb/>
fondness and compassion of the man for his child. I <reg orig="de-|rived">derived</reg> <lb/>
new joy from reflecting that I had not abandoned her, <lb/>
and that she owed her preservation to my efforts. The <lb/>
inquiries which the girl was unable to answer, were now put <lb/>
to me. Every one interrogated who I was, whence I had <lb/>
come, and what had given rise to this bloody contest.</p>
<p>I was not willing to expatiate on my story. The spirit <lb/>
which had hitherto sustained me, began now to subside. <lb/>
My strength ebbed away with my blood. Tremors, <reg orig="lassi-|tude">lassitude</reg>, <lb/>
and deadly cold, invaded me, and I fainted on the <lb/>
ground.</p>
<p>Such is the capricious constitution of the human mind. <lb/>
While dangers were at hand, while my life was to be <reg orig="pre-|served">preserved</reg> <lb/>
only by zeal, and vigilance, and courage, I was not <lb/>
wanting to myself. Had my perils continued, or even <reg orig="mul-|tiplied">multiplied</reg>, <lb/>
no doubt my energies would have kept equal pace <lb/>
with them, but the moment that I was encompassed by <reg orig="pro-|tectors">protectors</reg>, <lb/>
and placed in security, I grew powerless and faint. <lb/>
My weakness was proportioned to the duration and intensity <lb/>
of my previous efforts, and the swoon into which I now <lb/>
sunk, was, no doubt, mistaken by the spectators, for death.</p>
<p>On recovering from this swoon, my sensations were not <lb/>
unlike those which I had experienced on awaking in the pit. <lb/>
For a moment a mistiness involved every object, and I was <lb/>
able to distinguish nothing. My sight, by rapid degrees, <lb/>
was restored, my painful dizziness was banished, and I <reg orig="sur-|veyed">surveyed</reg> <lb/>
the scene before me with anxiety and wonder.</p>
<p>I found myself stretched upon the ground. I perceived <lb/>
the cottage and the neighboring thicket, illuminated by a <reg orig="de-|clining">declining</reg> <lb/>
moon. My head rested upon something, which, on <lb/>
turning to examine, I found to be one of the slain Indians. <lb/>
The other two remained upon the earth, at a small distance, <lb/>
and in the attitudes in which they had fallen. Their arms, <lb/>
<pb n="171" entity="eaf033v3_0184" pid="uva-lib:349916"/>
the wounded girl, and the troop who were near me when I <lb/>
fainted, were gone.</p>
<p>My head had reposed upon the breast of him whom I <lb/>
had shot in this part of his body. The blood had ceased <lb/>
to ooze from the wound, but my dishevelled locks were <lb/>
matted and steeped in that gore which had overflowed and <lb/>
choked up the orifice. I started from this detestable pillow, <lb/>
and regained my feet.</p>
<p>I did not suddenly recall what had lately passed, or <reg orig="com-|prehend">comprehend</reg> <lb/>
the nature of my situation. At length, however, <lb/>
late events were recollected.</p>
<p>That I should be abandoned in this forlorn state by these <lb/>
men, seemed to argue a degree of cowardice or cruelty, <lb/>
of which I should have thought them incapable. Presently, <lb/>
however, I reflected that appearances might have easily <lb/>
misled them into a belief of my death. On this <reg orig="supposi-|tion">supposition</reg>, <lb/>
to have carried me away, or to have staid beside me, <lb/>
would be useless. Other enemies might be abroad, or their <lb/>
families, now that their fears were somewhat tranquillized, <lb/>
might require their presence and protection.</p>
<p>I went into the cottage. The fire still burned, and <lb/>
afforded me a genial warmth. I sat before it and began to <lb/>
ruminate on the state to which I was reduced, and on the <lb/>
measures I should next pursue. Day-light could not be very <lb/>
distant. Should I remain in this hovel till the morning, or <lb/>
immediately resume my journey? I was feeble, indeed, but <lb/>
by remaining here should I not increase my feebleness? <lb/>
The sooner I should gain some human habitation the better; <lb/>
whereas watchfulness and hunger would render me, at each <lb/>
minute, less able to proceed than on the former.</p>
<p>This spot might be visited on the next day; but this was <lb/>
involved in uncertainty. The visitants, should any come, <lb/>
would come merely to examine and bury the dead, and <lb/>
bring with them neither the clothing nor the food which my <lb/>
necessities demanded. The road was sufficiently <reg orig="discern-|ible">discernible</reg>, <lb/>
and would, unavoidably, conduct me to some dwelling. <lb/>
I determined, therefore, to set out without delay. Even in <lb/>
this state I was not unmindful that my safety might require <lb/>
the precaution of being armed. Besides the fusil, which <lb/>
had been given me by Sarsefield, and which I had so <reg orig="unex-|pectedly">unexpectedly</reg> <lb/>
recovered, had lost none of its value in my eyes. <lb/>
<pb n="172" entity="eaf033v3_0185" pid="uva-lib:349917"/>
I hoped that it had escaped the search of the troop who <lb/>
had been here and still lay below the bank, in the spot <lb/>
where I had dropped it.</p>
<p>In this hope I was not deceived. It was found. I <reg orig="pos-|sessed">possessed</reg> <lb/>
myself of the powder and shot belonging to one of <lb/>
the savages, and loaded it. Thus equipped for defence, I <lb/>
regained the road, and proceeded, with alacrity, on my <lb/>
way. For the wound in my cheek, nature had provided <lb/>
a styptic, but the soreness was extreme, and I thought of <lb/>
no remedy but water, with which I might wash away the <lb/>
blood. My thirst likewise incommoded me, and I looked <lb/>
with eagerness for the traces of a spring. In a soil like that <lb/>
of the wilderness around me, nothing was less to be <reg orig="expect-|ed">expected</reg> <lb/>
than to light upon water. In this respect, however, my <lb/>
destiny was propitious. I quickly perceived water in the <lb/>
ruts. It trickled hither from the thicket on one side, and, <lb/>
pursuing it among the bushes, I reached the bubbling source. <lb/>
Though scanty and brackish, it afforded me unspeakable <lb/>
refreshment.</p>
<p>Thou wilt think, perhaps, that my perils were now at an <lb/>
end; that the blood I had already shed was sufficient for <lb/>
my safety. I fervently hoped that no new exigence would <lb/>
occur, compelling me to use the arms that I bore in my own <lb/>
defence. I formed a sort of resolution to shun the contest <lb/>
with a new enemy, almost at the expense of my own life. <lb/>
I was satiated and gorged with slaughter, and thought upon <lb/>
a new act of destruction with abhorrence and loathing.</p>
<p>But though I dreaded to encounter a new enemy, I was <lb/>
sensible that an enemy might possibly be at hand. I had <lb/>
moved forward with caution, and my sight and hearing were <lb/>
attentive to the slightest tokens. Other troops, besides that <lb/>
which I encountered, might be hovering near, and of that <lb/>
troop, I remembered that one at least had survived.</p>
<p>The gratification which the spring had afforded me was <lb/>
so great, that I was in no haste to depart. I lay upon a <lb/>
rock, which chanced to be shaded by a tree behind me. <lb/>
From this post I could overlook the road to some distance, <lb/>
and, at the same time, be shaded from the observation of <lb/>
others.</p>
<p>My eye was now caught by movements which appeared <lb/>
like those of a beast. In different circumstances, I should <lb/>
<pb n="173" entity="eaf033v3_0186" pid="uva-lib:349918"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">16</fw></pb>
have instantly supposed it to be a wolf, or panther, or bear. <lb/>
Now my suspicions were alive on a different account, and <lb/>
my startled fancy figured to itself nothing but a human <lb/>
adversary.</p>
<p>A thicket was on either side of the road. That <reg orig="oppo-|site">opposite</reg> <lb/>
to my station was discontinued at a small distance by <lb/>
the cultivated field. The road continued along this field, <lb/>
bounded by the thicket on the one side, and the open space <lb/>
on the other. To this space the being who was now descried, <lb/>
was cautiously approaching.</p>
<p>He moved upon all fours, and presently came near <lb/>
enough to be distinguished. His disfigured limbs, pendants <lb/>
from his ears and nose, and his shorn locks, were <reg orig="indubita-|ble">indubitable</reg> <lb/>
indications of a savage. Occasionally he reared <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
above the bushes, and scanned, with suspicious vigilance, <lb/>
the cottage and the space surrounding it. Then he <reg orig="stoop-|ed">stooped</reg>, <lb/>
and crept along as before.</p>
<p>I was at no loss to interpret these appearances. This <lb/>
was my surviving enemy. He was unacquainted with the <lb/>
fate of his associates, and was now approaching the theatre <lb/>
of carnage, to ascertain their fate.</p>
<p>Once more was the advantage afforded me. From this <lb/>
spot might unerring aim be taken, and the last of this hostile <lb/>
troop be made to share the fate of the rest. Should I fire <lb/>
or suffer him to pass in safety?</p>
<p>My abhorrence of bloodshed was not abated. But I had <lb/>
not foreseen this occurrence. My success hitherto had <lb/>
seemed to depend upon a combination of fortunate <reg orig="inci-|dents">incidents</reg>, <lb/>
which could not be expected again to take place; but <lb/>
now was I invested with the same power. The mark <lb/>
was near; nothing obstructed or delayed; I incurred no <lb/>
danger, and the event was certain.</p>
<p>Why should he be suffered to live? He came hither to <lb/>
murder and despoil my friends; this work he has, no doubt, <lb/>
performed. Nay, has he not borne his part in the <reg orig="destruc-|tion">destruction</reg> <lb/>
of my uncle and my sisters? He will live only to <lb/>
pursue the same sanguinary trade; to drink the blood and <lb/>
exult in the laments of his unhappy foes, and of my own <lb/>
brethren. Fate has reserved him for a bloody and violent <lb/>
<pb n="174" entity="eaf033v3_0187" pid="uva-lib:349919"/>
death. For how long a time soever it may be deferred, <lb/>
it is thus that his career will inevitably terminate.</p>
<p>Should he be spared, he will still roam in the wilderness, <lb/>
and I may again be fated to encounter him. Then our <lb/>
mutual situation may be widely different, and the advantage <lb/>
I now possess may be his.</p>
<p>While hastily revolving these thoughts I was thoroughly <lb/>
aware that one event might take place which would render <lb/>
all deliberation useless. Should he spy me where I lay, <lb/>
my fluctuations must end. My safety would indispensably <lb/>
require me to shoot. This persuasion made me keep a <lb/>
steadfast eye upon his motions, and be prepared to anticipate <lb/>
his assault.</p>
<p>It now most seasonably occurred to me that one essential <lb/>
duty remained to be performed. One operation, without <lb/>
which fire arms are useless, had been unaccountably omitted. <lb/>
My piece was uncocked. I did not reflect that in moving <lb/>
the spring, a sound would necessarily be produced, sufficient <lb/>
to alarm him. But I knew that the chances of escaping <lb/>
his notice, should I be perfectly mute and still, were <reg orig="ex-|tremely">extremely</reg> <lb/>
slender, and that, in such a case, his movements <lb/>
would be quicker than the light; it behoved me, therefore, <lb/>
to repair my omission.</p>
<p>The sound struck him with alarm. He turned and <lb/>
darted at me an inquiring glance. I saw that forbearance <lb/>
was no longer in my power; but my heart sunk while I <reg orig="com-|plied">complied</reg> <lb/>
with what may surely be deemed an indispensable <lb/>
necessity. This faltering, perhaps, it was, that made me <lb/>
swerve somewhat from the fatal line. He was disabled by <lb/>
the wound, but not killed.</p>
<p>He lost all power of resistance, and was, therefore, no <lb/>
longer to be dreaded. He rolled upon the ground, uttering <lb/>
doleful shrieks, and throwing his limbs into those contortions <lb/>
which bespeak the keenest agonies to which ill-fated man <lb/>
is subject. Horror, and compassion, and remorse were <lb/>
mingled into one sentiment, and took possession of my heart. <lb/>
To shut out this spectacle, I withdrew from the spot, but I <lb/>
stopped before I had moved beyond hearing of his cries.</p>
<p>The impulse that drove me from the scene was <reg orig="pusillani-|mous">pusillanimous</reg> <lb/>
and cowardly. The past, however deplorable, could <lb/>
not be recalled; but could not I afford some relief to this <lb/>
<pb n="175" entity="eaf033v3_0188" pid="uva-lib:349920"/>
wretch? Could not I, at least, bring his pangs to a speedy <lb/>
close? Thus he might continue, writhing and calling upon <lb/>
death for hours. Why should his miseries be uselessly <lb/>
prolonged?</p>
<p>There was but one way to end them. To kill him <reg orig="out-|right">outright</reg>, <lb/>
was the dictate of compassion and of duty. I <reg orig="hasti-|ly">hastily</reg> <lb/>
returned, and once more levelled my piece at his head. <lb/>
It was a loathsome obligation, and was performed with <lb/>
unconquerable reluctance. Thus to assault and to mangle <lb/>
the body of an enemy, already prostrate and powerless, was <lb/>
an act worthy of abhorrence; yet it was, in this case, <reg orig="pre-|scribed">prescribed</reg> <lb/>
by pity.</p>
<p>My faltering hand rendered this second bullet ineffectual. <lb/>
One expedient, still more detestable, remained. Having <lb/>
gone thus far, it would have been inhuman to stop short. <lb/>
His heart might easily be pierced by the bayonet, and his <lb/>
struggles would cease.</p>
<p>This task of cruel lenity was at length finished. I <reg orig="drop-|ped">dropped</reg> <lb/>
the weapon and threw myself on the ground, <reg orig="overpow-|ered">overpowered</reg> <lb/>
by the horrors of this scene. Such are the deeds <lb/>
which perverse nature compels thousands of rational beings <lb/>
to perform and to witness! Such is the spectacle, endlessly <lb/>
prolonged and diversified, which is exhibited in every field <lb/>
of battle; of which, habit and example, the temptations of <lb/>
gain, and the illusions of honor, will make us, not reluctant <lb/>
or indifferent, but zealous and delighted actors and <reg orig="be-|holders">beholders</reg>!</p>
<p>Thus, by a series of events, impossible to be computed <lb/>
or foreseen, was the destruction of a band, selected from <lb/>
their fellows for an arduous enterprise, distinguished by <lb/>
prowess and skill, and equally armed against surprise and <lb/>
force, completed by the hand of a boy, uninured to hostility, <lb/>
unprovided with arms, precipitate and timorous! I have <lb/>
noted men who seemed born for no end but by their <reg orig="achieve-|ments">achievements</reg> <lb/>
to belie experience, and bafile foresight, and outstrip <lb/>
belief. Would to God that I had not deserved to be <reg orig="num-|bered">numbered</reg> <lb/>
among these! But what power was it that called <lb/>
me from the sleep of death, just in time to escape the <reg orig="mer-|ciless">merciless</reg> <lb/>
knife of this enemy? Had my swoon continued till <lb/>
he had reached the spot, he would have effectuated my <lb/>
death by new wounds and torn away the skin from my <lb/>
<pb n="176" entity="eaf033v3_0189" pid="uva-lib:349921"/>
brows. Such are the subtile threads on which hang the <lb/>
fate of man and of the universe!</p>
<p>While engaged in these reflections, I perceived that the <lb/>
moonlight had begun to fade before that of the sun. A <lb/>
dusky and reddish hue spread itself over the east. <reg orig="Cheer-|ed">Cheered</reg> <lb/>
by this appearance, I once more resumed my feet and <lb/>
the road. I left the savage where he lay, but made prize <lb/>
of his tomahawk. I had left my own in the cavern; and <lb/>
this weapon added little to my burden. Prompted by some <lb/>
freak of fancy, I stuck his musket in the ground, and left <lb/>
it standing upright in the middle of the road.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I moved</hi> forward with as quick a pace as my feeble limbs <lb/>
would permit. I did not allow myself to meditate. The <lb/>
great object of my wishes was a dwelling where food and <lb/>
repose might be procured. I looked earnestly forward, and <lb/>
on each side, in search of some token of human residence; <lb/>
but the spots of cultivation, the <hi rend="italic">well-pole,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">worm-fence,</hi> <lb/>
and the hay-rick, were no where to be seen. I did not <lb/>
even meet with a wild hog, or a bewildered cow. The <lb/>
path was narrow, and on either side was a trackless <reg orig="wilder-|ness">wilderness</reg>. <lb/>
On the right and left were the waving lines of <reg orig="moun-|tainous">mountainous</reg> <lb/>
ridges which had no peculiarity enabling me to <lb/>
ascertain whether I had ever before seen them.</p>
<p>At length I noticed that the tracks of wheels had <reg orig="disap-|peared">disappeared</reg> <lb/>
from the path that I was treading; that it became <lb/>
more narrow, and exhibited fewer marks of being <reg orig="frequent-|ed">frequented</reg>. <lb/>
These appearances were discouraging. I now <reg orig="sus-|pected">suspected</reg> <lb/>
that I had taken a wrong direction, and instead of <lb/>
approaching, was receding from the habitation of men.</p>
<p>It was wisest, however, to proceed. The road could not <lb/>
but have some origin as well as end. Some hours passed <lb/>
away in this uncertainty. The sun rose, and by noonday I <lb/>
seemed to be farther than ever from the end of my toils. <lb/>
The path was more obscure, and the wilderness more <reg orig="rug-|ged">rugged</reg>. <lb/>
Thirst more incommoded me than hunger, but relief <lb/>
<pb n="177" entity="eaf033v3_0190" pid="uva-lib:349922"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">16*</fw></pb>
was seasonably afforded by the brooks that flowed across <lb/>
the path.</p>
<p>Coming to one of these, and having slaked my thirst, I <lb/>
sat down upon the bank, to reflect on my situation. The <lb/>
circuity of the path had frequently been noticed, and I began <lb/>
to suspect that though I had travelled long, I had not moved <lb/>
far from the spot where I had commenced my pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Turning my eyes on all sides, I noticed a sort of pool, <lb/>
formed by the rivulet, at a few paces distant from the road. <lb/>
In approaching and inspecting it, I observed the footsteps of <lb/>
cattle, who had retired by a path that seemed much beaten; <lb/>
I likewise noticed a cedar bucket, broken and old, lying on <lb/>
the margin. These tokens revived my drooping spirits, and <lb/>
I betook myself to this new track. It was intricate; but, at <lb/>
length, led up a steep, the summit of which was of better <lb/>
soil than that of which the flats consisted. A clover field, <lb/>
and several apple trees, sure attendants of man, were now <lb/>
discovered. From this space I entered a corn field, and at <lb/>
length, to my inexpressible joy, caught a glimpse of a <lb/>
house.</p>
<p>This dwelling was far different from that I had lately left. <lb/>
It was as small and as low, but its walls consisted of boards. <lb/>
A window of four panes admitted the light, and a chimney <lb/>
of brick, well burnt, and neatly arranged, peeped over the <lb/>
roof. As I approached I heard the voice of children, and <lb/>
the hum of a spinning wheel.</p>
<p>I cannot make thee conceive the delight which was <reg orig="af-|forded">afforded</reg> <lb/>
me by all these tokens. I now found myself, <reg orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg>, <lb/>
among beings like myself, and from whom hospitable <lb/>
entertainment might be confidently expected. I compassed <lb/>
the house, and made my appearance at the door.</p>
<p>A good woman, busy at her wheel, with two children <lb/>
playing on the ground before her, were the objects that now <lb/>
presented themselves. The uncouthness of my garb, my <lb/>
wild and weather worn appearance, my fusil and tomahawk, <lb/>
could not but startle them. The woman stopt her wheel, <lb/>
and gazed as if a spectre had started into view.</p>
<p>I was somewhat aware of these consequences, and <reg orig="en-|deavored">endeavored</reg> <lb/>
to elude them, by assuming an air of supplication <lb/>
and humility. I told her that I was a traveller, who had <reg orig="un-|fortunately">unfortunately</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="178" entity="eaf033v3_0191" pid="uva-lib:349923"/>
lost his way, and had rambled in this wild till <lb/>
nearly famished for want. I entreated her to give me some <lb/>
food; any thing however scanty or coarse, would be <reg orig="ac-|ceptable">acceptable</reg>.</p>
<p>After some pause she desired me, though not without <lb/>
some marks of fear, to walk in. She placed before me <lb/>
some brown bread and milk. She eyed me while I eagerly <lb/>
devoured this morsel. It was, indeed, more delicious than <lb/>
any I had ever tasted. At length she broke silence, and <lb/>
expressed her astonishment and commiseration at my <reg orig="seem-|ingly">seemingly</reg> <lb/>
forlorn state, adding, that perhaps I was the man whom <lb/>
the men were looking after who had been there some hours <lb/>
before.</p>
<p>My curiosity was roused by this intimation. In answer <lb/>
to my interrogations, she said, that three persons had lately <lb/>
stopped, to inquire if her husband had not met, within the <lb/>
last three days, a person of whom their description seemed <lb/>
pretty much to suit my person and dress. He was tall, <lb/>
slender, wore nothing but shirt and trowsers, and was <reg orig="wound-|ed">wounded</reg> <lb/>
on the cheek.</p>
<p>What, I asked, did they state the rank or condition of the <lb/>
person to be?</p>
<p>He lived in Solebury. He was supposed to have <reg orig="ram-|bled">rambled</reg> <lb/>
in the mountains, and to have lost his way, or to have <lb/>
met with some mischance. It was three days since he had <lb/>
disappeared, but had been seen, by some one, the last night, <lb/>
at Deb's hut.</p>
<p>What and where was Deb's hut?</p>
<p>It was a hut in the wilderness, occupied by an old Indian <lb/>
woman, known among her neighbors by the name of Old <lb/>
Deb. Some people called her Queen Mab. Her dwelling <lb/>
was eight <hi rend="italic">long</hi> miles from this house.</p>
<p>A thousand questions were precluded, and a thousand <lb/>
doubts solved by this information. <hi rend="italic">Queen Mab</hi> were sounds <lb/>
familiar to my ears; for they originated with myself.</p>
<p>This woman originally belonged to the tribe of <reg orig="Dela-|wares">Delawares</reg>, <lb/>
or Lennilennapee. All these districts were once <lb/>
comprised within the dominions of that nation. About <lb/>
thirty years ago, in consequence of perpetual encroachments <lb/>
of the English colonists, they abandoned their ancient seats <lb/>
and retired to the banks of the Wabash and Muskingum.</p>
<pb n="179" entity="eaf033v3_0192" pid="uva-lib:349924"/>
<p>This emigration was concerted in a general council of the <lb/>
tribe, and obtained the concurrence of all but one female. <lb/>
Her birth, talents, and age, gave her much consideration <lb/>
and authority among her countrymen; and all her zeal and <lb/>
eloquence were exerted to induce them to lay aside their <lb/>
scheme. In this, however, she could not succeed. <reg orig="Find-|ing">Finding</reg> <lb/>
them refractory, she declared her resolution to remain <lb/>
behind and maintain possession of the land which her <reg orig="coun-|trymen">countrymen</reg> <lb/>
should impiously abandon.</p>
<p>The village inhabited by this clan was built upon ground <lb/>
which now constitutes my uncle's barn yard and orchard. <lb/>
On the departure of her countrymen, this female burnt the <lb/>
empty wigwams and retired into the fastnesses of Norwalk. <lb/>
She selected a spot suitable for an Indian dwelling and a <lb/>
small plantation of maize, and in which she was seldom <lb/>
liable to interruption and intrusion.</p>
<p>Her only companions were three dogs, of the Indian or <lb/>
wolf species. These animals differed in nothing from their <lb/>
kinsmen of the forest, but in their attachment and obedience <lb/>
to their mistress. She governed them with absolute sway. <lb/>
They were her servants and protectors, and attended her <lb/>
person or guarded her threshold, agreeable to her <reg orig="direc-|tions">directions</reg>. <lb/>
She fed them with corn and they supplied her and <lb/>
themselves with meat, by hunting squirrels, raccoons, and <lb/>
rabbits.</p>
<p>To the rest of mankind they were aliens or enemies. <lb/>
They never left the desert but in company with their <reg orig="mis-|tress">mistress</reg>, <lb/>
and when she entered a farm-house, waited her return <lb/>
at a distance. They would suffer none to approach them, <lb/>
but attacked no one who did not imprudently crave their <lb/>
acquaintance, or who kept at a respectful distance from their <lb/>
wigwam. That sacred asylum they would not suffer to be <lb/>
violated, and no stranger could enter it but at the imminent <lb/>
hazard of his life, unless accompanied and protected by <lb/>
their dame.</p>
<p>The chief employment of this woman, when at home, <reg orig="be-|sides">besides</reg> <lb/>
plucking the weeds from among her corn; bruising the <lb/>
grain between two stones, and setting her snares, for rabbits <lb/>
and opossums, was to talk. Though in solitude, her tongue <lb/>
was never at rest but when she was asleep; but her <reg orig="conver-|sation">conversation</reg> <lb/>
was merely addressed to her dogs. Her voice was <lb/>
<pb n="180" entity="eaf033v3_0193" pid="uva-lib:349925"/>
sharp and shrill, and her gesticulations were vehement and <lb/>
grotesque. A hearer would naturally imagine that she was <lb/>
scolding; but, in truth, she was merely giving them <reg orig="direc-|tions">directions</reg>. <lb/>
Having no other object of contemplation or subject <lb/>
of discourse, she always found, in their postures and looks, <lb/>
occasion for praise, or blame, or command. The readiness <lb/>
with which they understood, and the docility with which <lb/>
they obeyed her movements and words, were truly <reg orig="won-|derful">wonderful</reg>.</p>
<p>If a stranger chanced to wander near her hut, and <reg orig="over-|hear">overhear</reg> <lb/>
her jargon, incessant as it was, and shrill, he might <lb/>
speculate in vain on the reason of these sounds. If he <lb/>
waited in expectation of hearing some reply, he waited in <lb/>
vain. The strain, always voluble and sharp, was never <lb/>
intermitted for a moment, and would continue for hours at <lb/>
a time.</p>
<p>She seldom left the hut but to visit the neighboring <reg orig="in-|habitants">inhabitants</reg>, <lb/>
and demand from them food and clothing, or <lb/>
whatever her necessities required. These were exacted as <lb/>
her due; to have her wants supplied was her prerogative, <lb/>
and to withhold what she claimed was rebellion. She <reg orig="con-|ceived">conceived</reg> <lb/>
that by remaining behind her countrymen she <reg orig="suc-|ceeded">succeeded</reg> <lb/>
to the government, and retained the possession of <lb/>
all this region. The English were aliens and sojourners, <lb/>
who occupied the land merely by her connivance and <reg orig="per-|mission">permission</reg>, <lb/>
and whom she allowed to remain on no terms but <lb/>
those of supplying her wants.</p>
<p>Being a woman aged and harmless, her demands being <lb/>
limited to that of which she really stood in need, and which <lb/>
her own industry could not procure, her pretensions were a <lb/>
subject of mirth and good humor, and her injunctions obeyed <lb/>
with seeming deference and gravity. To me she early <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
an object of curiosity and speculation. I delighted <lb/>
to observe her habits and humor her prejudices. She <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg> <lb/>
came to my uncle's house, and I sometimes visited <lb/>
her; insensibly she seemed to contract an affection for me, <lb/>
and regarded me with more complacency and <reg orig="condescen-|sion">condescension</reg> <lb/>
than any other received.</p>
<p>She always disdained to speak English, and custom had <lb/>
rendered her intelligible to most in her native language, <lb/>
with regard to a few simple questions. I had taken some <lb/>
<pb n="181" entity="eaf033v3_0194" pid="uva-lib:349926"/>
pains to study her jargon, and could make out to discourse <lb/>
with her on the few ideas which she possessed. This <reg orig="cir-|cumstance">circumstance</reg>, <lb/>
likewise, wonderfully prepossessed her in my <lb/>
favor.</p>
<p>The name by which she was formerly known was Deb; <lb/>
but her pretensions to royalty, the wildness of her aspect <lb/>
and garb, her shrivelled and diminutive form, a constitution <lb/>
that seemed to defy the ravages of time and the influence of <lb/>
the elements; her age, which some did not scruple to affirm <lb/>
exceeded a hundred years, her romantic solitude and <lb/>
mountainous haunts, suggested to my fancy the appellation <lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">Queen Mab.</hi> There appeared to me some rude analogy <lb/>
between this personage and her whom the poets of old time <lb/>
have delighted to celebrate; thou perhaps wilt discover <lb/>
nothing but incongruities between them, but, be that as it <lb/>
may, Old Deb and Queen Mab soon came into <reg orig="indiscrimi-|nate">indiscriminate</reg> <lb/>
and general use.</p>
<p>She dwelt in Norwalk upwards of twenty years. She <lb/>
was not forgotten by her countrymen, and generally received <lb/>
from her brothers and sons an autumual visit; but no <reg orig="soli-|citations">solicitations</reg> <lb/>
or entreaties could prevail on her to return with <lb/>
them. Two years ago, some suspicion or disgust induced <lb/>
her to forsake her ancient habitation, and to seek a new one. <lb/>
Happily she found a more convenient habitation twenty <lb/>
miles to the westward, and in a spot abundantly sterile and <lb/>
rude.</p>
<p>This dwelling was of logs, and had been erected by a <lb/>
Scottish emigrant, who, not being rich enough to purchase <lb/>
land, and entertaining a passion for solitude and <reg orig="indepen-|dence">independence</reg>, <lb/>
cleared a field in the unappropriated wilderness, and <lb/>
subsisted on its produce. After some time he disappeared. <lb/>
Various conjectures were formed as to the cause of his <reg orig="ab-|sence">absence</reg>. <lb/>
None of them were satisfactory; but that which <lb/>
obtained most credit was, that he had been murdered by the <lb/>
Indians, who, about the same period, paid their annual visit <lb/>
to the <hi rend="italic">Queen.</hi> This conjecture acquired some force, by <lb/>
observing that the old woman shortly after took possession <lb/>
of his hut, his implements of tillage, and his corn-field.</p>
<p>She was not molested in her new abode, and her life <lb/>
passed in the same quiet tenor as before. Her periodical <lb/>
rambles, her regal claims, her guardian wolves, and her <reg orig="un-|couth">uncouth</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="182" entity="eaf033v3_0195" pid="uva-lib:349927"/>
volubility, were equally remarkable, but her circuits <lb/>
were new. Her distance made her visits to Solebury more <lb/>
rare, and had prevented me from ever extending my <reg orig="pedes-|trian">pedestrian</reg> <lb/>
excursions to her present abode.</p>
<p>These recollections were now suddenly called up by the <lb/>
information of my hostess. The hut where I had sought <lb/>
shelter and relief was, it seems, the residence of Queen <lb/>
Mab. Some fortunate occurrence had called her away <lb/>
during my visit. Had she and her dogs been at home, I <lb/>
should have been set upon by these ferocious sentinels, and, <lb/>
before their dame could have interfered, have been, together <lb/>
with my helpless companion, mangled or killed. These <reg orig="ani-|mals">animals</reg> <lb/>
never barked, I should have entered unaware of my <lb/>
danger, and my fate could scarcely have been averted by my <lb/>
fusil.</p>
<p>Her absence at this unseasonable hour was mysterious. <lb/>
It was now the time of year when her countrymen were <reg orig="ac-|customed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
to renew their visit. Was there a league between <lb/>
her and the plunderers whom I had encountered?</p>
<p>But who were they by whom my footsteps were so <reg orig="in-|dustriously">industriously</reg> <lb/>
traced? Those whom I had seen at Deb's hut <lb/>
were strangers to me, but the wound upon my face was <lb/>
known only to them. To this circumstance was now added <lb/>
my place of residence and name. I supposed them <reg orig="im-|pressed">impressed</reg> <lb/>
with the belief that I was dead; but this mistake <lb/>
must have speedily been rectified. Revisiting the spot, <lb/>
finding me gone, and obtaining some intelligence of my <reg orig="for-|mer">former</reg> <lb/>
condition, they had instituted a search after me.</p>
<p>But what tidings were these? I was supposed to have <lb/>
been bewildered in the mountains, and three days were said <lb/>
to have passed since my disappearance. Twelve hours had <lb/>
scarcely elapsed since I emerged from the cavern. Had two <lb/>
days and a half been consumed in my subterranean <reg orig="pri-|son">prison</reg>?</p>
<p>These reflections were quickly supplanted by others. I <lb/>
now gained a sufficient acquaintance with the region that <lb/>
was spread around me. I was in the midst of a vale, <reg orig="inclu-|ded">included</reg> <lb/>
between ridges that gradually approached each other, <lb/>
and when joined, were broken up into hollows and steeps, <lb/>
and spreading themselves over a circular space, assumed <lb/>
the appellation of Norwalk. This vale gradually widened <lb/>
<pb n="183" entity="eaf033v3_0196" pid="uva-lib:349928"/>
as it tended to the westward, and was, in this place ten or <lb/>
twelve miles in breadth. My devious footsteps had brought <lb/>
me to the foot of the southern barrier. The outer basis of <lb/>
this was laved by the river, but, as it tended eastward, the <lb/>
mountain and river receded from each other, and one of the <lb/>
cultivable districts lying between them was Solebury, my <lb/>
natal <hi rend="italic">township.</hi> Hither it was now my duty to return with <lb/>
the utmost expedition.</p>
<p>There were two ways before me. One lay along the <reg orig="in-|terior">interior</reg> <lb/>
base of the hill, over a sterile and trackless space, and <lb/>
exposed to the encounter of savages, some of whom might <lb/>
possibly be lurking here. The other was the well frequented <lb/>
road, on the outside and along the river, and which was to <lb/>
be gained by passing over this hill. The practicability of <lb/>
the passage was to be ascertained by inquiries made to my <lb/>
hostess. She pointed out a path that led to the rocky <reg orig="sum-|mit">summit</reg> <lb/>
and down to the river's brink. The path was not easy <lb/>
to be kept in view or to be trodden, but it was undoubtedly <lb/>
to be preferred to any other.</p>
<p>A route, somewhat circuitous, would terminate in the <lb/>
river road. Thenceforward the way to Solebury was level <lb/>
and direct; but the whole space which I had to traverse <lb/>
was not less than thirty miles. In six hours it would be <lb/>
night, and, to perform the journey in that time would <reg orig="de-|mand">demand</reg> <lb/>
the agile boundings of a leopard and the indefatigable <lb/>
sinews of an elk.</p>
<p>My frame was in miserable plight. My strength had <lb/>
been assailed by anguish, and fear, and watchfulness; by <lb/>
toil, and abstinence, and wounds. Still, however, some <lb/>
remnant was left; would it not enable me to reach my home <lb/>
by night fall? I had delighted, from my childhood, in feats <lb/>
of agility and perseverance. In roving through the maze <lb/>
of thickets and precipices, I had put my energies, both moral <lb/>
and physical, frequently to the test. Greater achievements <lb/>
than this had been performed, and I disdained to be <reg orig="out-|done">outdone</reg> <lb/>
in perspicacity by the lynx, in his sure-footed instinct <lb/>
by the roe, or in patience under hardship, and contention <lb/>
with fatigue, by the Mohawk. I have ever aspired to <reg orig="tran-|scend">transcend</reg> <lb/>
the rest of animals in all that is common to the <lb/>
rational and brute, as well as in all by which they are <reg orig="dis-|tinguished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
from each other.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I likewise</hi> burned with impatience to know the <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg> <lb/>
of my family, to dissipate at once their tormenting doubts <lb/>
and my own, with regard to our mutual safety. The evil <lb/>
that I feared had befallen them was too enormous to allow <lb/>
me to repose in suspense, and my restlessness and ominous <lb/>
forebodings would be more intolerable than any hardship or <lb/>
toils to which I could possibly be subjected during this <reg orig="jour-|ney">journey</reg>.</p>
<p>I was much refreshed and invigorated by the food that I <lb/>
had taken, and by the rest of an hour. With this stock of <lb/>
recruited force I determined to scale the hill. After <reg orig="receiv-|ing">receiving</reg> <lb/>
minute directions, and returning many thanks for my <lb/>
hospitable entertainment, I set out.</p>
<p>The path was indeed intricate, and deliberate attention <lb/>
was obliged to be exerted in order to preserve it. Hence <lb/>
my progress was slower than I wished. The first impulse <lb/>
was to fix my eye upon the summit, and to leap from crag <lb/>
to crag till I reached it, but this my experience had taught <lb/>
me was impracticable. It was only by winding through <lb/>
gulleys, and coasting precipices and bestriding chasms, that I <lb/>
could hope finally to gain the top, and I was assured that by <lb/>
one way only was it possible to accomplish even this.</p>
<p>An hour was spent in struggling with impediments, and I <lb/>
seemed to have gained no way. Hence a doubt was <reg orig="sug-|gested">suggested</reg> <lb/>
whether I had not missed the true road. In this <lb/>
doubt I was confirmed by the difficulties which now grew <lb/>
up before me. The brooks, the angles, and the hollows, <lb/>
which my hostess had described, were not to be seen. <reg orig="In-|stead">Instead</reg> <lb/>
of these, deeper dells, more headlong torrents, and <lb/>
wider gaping rifts were incessantly encountered.</p>
<p>To return was as hopeless as to proceed. I consoled <lb/>
myself with thinking that the survey which my informant <lb/>
had made of the hill-side, might prove inaccurate, and that <lb/>
in spite of her predictions, the heights might be reached by <lb/>
other means than by those pointed out by her. I will not <lb/>
enumerate my toilsome expedients, my frequent <reg orig="disappoint-|ments">disappointments</reg> <lb/>
and my desperate exertions. Suffice it to say that I <lb/>
<pb n="185" entity="eaf033v3_0198" pid="uva-lib:349930"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">17</fw></pb>
gained the upper space, not till the sun had dipped beneath <lb/>
the horizon.</p>
<p>My satisfaction at accomplishing thus much was not small, <lb/>
and I hied, with renovated spirits, to the opposite brow. <lb/>
This proved to be a steep that could not he descended. <lb/>
The river flowed at its foot. The opposite bank was five <lb/>
hundred yards distant, and was equally towering and steep <lb/>
as that on which I stood. Appearances were adapted to <lb/>
persuade you that these rocks had formerly joined, but by <lb/>
some mighty effort of nature, had been severed, that the <lb/>
stream might find way through the chasm. The channel, <lb/>
however, was encumbered with asperities over which the <lb/>
river fretted and foamed with thundering impetuosity.</p>
<p>I pondered for a while on these stupendous scenes. They <lb/>
ravished my attention from considerations that related to <lb/>
myself; but this interval was short, and I began to measure <lb/>
the descent, in order to ascertain the practicability of <reg orig="tread-|ing">treading</reg> <lb/>
it. My survey terminated in bitter disappointment. I <lb/>
turned my eye successively eastward and westward. <reg orig="Sole-|bury">Solebury</reg> <lb/>
lay in the former direction, and thither I desired to go. <lb/>
I kept along the verge in this direction, till I reached an <reg orig="im-|passable">impassable</reg> <lb/>
rift. Beyond this I saw that the steep grew lower, <lb/>
but it was impossible to proceed farther. Higher up the <lb/>
descent might be practicable, and though more distant from <lb/>
Solebury, it was better to reach the road, even at that <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg>, <lb/>
than never to reach it.</p>
<p>Changing my course, therefore, I explored the spaces <lb/>
above. The night was rapidly advancing, the grey clouds <lb/>
gathered in the southeast, and a chilling blast, the usual <lb/>
attendant of a night in October, began to whistle among the <lb/>
pigmy cedars that scantily grew upon these heights. My <lb/>
progress would quickly be arrested by darkness, and it <reg orig="be-|hoved">behoved</reg> <lb/>
me to provide some place of shelter and repose. No <lb/>
recess, better than a hollow in the rock, presented itself to <lb/>
my anxious scrutiny.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I would not dismiss the hope of reaching the <lb/>
road, which I saw some hundred feet below, winding along <lb/>
the edge of the river, before daylight should utterly fail. <lb/>
Speedily these hopes derived new vigor from meeting a <lb/>
ledge that irregularly declined from the brow of the hill. It <lb/>
<pb n="186" entity="eaf033v3_0199" pid="uva-lib:349931"/>
was wide enought to allow of cautious footing. On a <reg orig="simi-|lar">similar</reg> <lb/>
stratum, or ledge, projecting still further from the body <lb/>
of the hill, and close to the surface of the river, was the <lb/>
road. This stratum ascended from the level of the stream, <lb/>
while that on which I trod rapidly descended. I hoped <lb/>
that they would speedily be blended, or at least approach so <lb/>
near as to allow me to leap from one to the other without <lb/>
enormous hazard.</p>
<p>This fond expectation was frustrated. Presently I <reg orig="per-|ceived">perceived</reg> <lb/>
that the ledge below began to descend, while that <lb/>
above began to tend upward, and was quickly terminated <lb/>
by the uppermost surface of the cliff. Here it was needful <lb/>
to pause. I looked over the brink and considered whether <lb/>
I might not leap from my present station, without <reg orig="endanger-|ing">endangering</reg> <lb/>
my limbs. The road into which I should fall was a <lb/>
rocky pavement far from being smooth. The descent could <lb/>
not be less than forty or fifty feet. Such an attempt was, <lb/>
to the last degree, hazardous, but was it not better to risk <lb/>
my life by leaping from this eminence, than to remain and <lb/>
perish on the top of this inhospitable mountain. The toils <lb/>
which I had endured, in reaching this height appeared to my <lb/>
panic struck fancy, less easy to be borne again than death.</p>
<p>I know not but that I should have finally resolved to leap, <lb/>
had not different views been suggested by observing that <lb/>
the outer edge of the road was, in like manner, the brow of <lb/>
a steep which terminated in the river. The surface of the <lb/>
road, was twelve or fifteen feet above the level of the <lb/>
stream, which, in this spot was still and smooth. Hence I <lb/>
inferred that the water was not of inconsiderable depth. To <lb/>
fall upon rocky points was, indeed, dangerous, but to plunge <lb/>
into water of sufficient depth, even from a height greater than <lb/>
than that at which I now stood, especially to one to whom <lb/>
habit had rendered water almost as congenial an element as <lb/>
air, was scarcely attended with inconvenience. This <reg orig="expe-|dient">expedient</reg> <lb/>
was easy and safe. Twenty yards from this spot, the <lb/>
channel was shallow, and to gain the road from the stream, <lb/>
was no difficult exploit.</p>
<p>Some disadvantages, however, attended this scheme. <lb/>
The water was smooth, but this might arise from some other <lb/>
cause than its depth. My gun, likewise, must be left <reg orig="be-|hind">behind</reg> <lb/>
me, and that was a loss to which I felt invincible <reg orig="re-|pugnance">repugnance</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="187" entity="eaf033v3_0200" pid="uva-lib:349932"/>
To let it fall upon the road, would put it in my <lb/>
power to retrieve the possession, but it was likely to be <reg orig="irre-|parably">irreparably</reg> <lb/>
injured by the fall.</p>
<p>While musing upon this expedient, and weighing injuries <lb/>
with benefits, the night closed upon me. I now considered <lb/>
that should I emerge in safety from the stream, I should <lb/>
have many miles to travel before I could reach a house. <lb/>
My clothes meanwhile would be loaded with wet. I should <lb/>
be heart-pierced by the icy blast that now blew, and my <lb/>
wounds and bruises would be chafed into insupportable <lb/>
pain.</p>
<p>I reasoned likewise on the folly of impatience and the <reg orig="ne-|cessity">necessity</reg> <lb/>
of repose. By thus long continuance in one <reg orig="pos-|ture">posture</reg>, <lb/>
my sinews began to stiffen, and my reluctance to make <lb/>
new exertions to increase. My brows were heavy, and I <lb/>
felt an irresistible propensity to sleep. I concluded to seek <lb/>
some shelter, and resign myself, my painful recollections, <lb/>
and my mournful presages to sweet forgetfulness. For this <lb/>
end, I once more ascended to the surface of the cliff. I <lb/>
dragged my weary feet forward, till I found somewhat that <lb/>
promised me the shelter that I sought.</p>
<p>A cluster of cedars appeared, whose branches overarched <lb/>
a space that might be called a bower. It was a slight <reg orig="cav-|ity">cavity</reg>, <lb/>
whose flooring was composed of loose stones and a few <lb/>
faded leaves blown from a distance, and finding a temporary <lb/>
lodgment here. On one side was a rock, forming a wall <lb/>
rugged and projecting above. At the bottom of the rock was <lb/>
a rift, somewhat resembling a coffin in shape, and not much <lb/>
larger in dimensions. This rift terminated on the opposite <lb/>
side of the rock, in an opening that was too small for the body <lb/>
of a man to pass. The distance between each entrance <lb/>
was twice the length of a man.</p>
<p>This bower was open to the southeast whence the gale <lb/>
now blew. It therefore imperfectly afforded the shelter of <lb/>
which I stood in need; but it was the best that the place and <lb/>
the time afforded. To stop the smaller entrance of the <lb/>
cavity with a stone, and to heap before the other, branches <lb/>
lopped from the trees with my hatchet, might somewhat <reg orig="con-|tribute">contribute</reg> <lb/>
to my comfort.</p>
<p>This was done, and thrusting myself into this recess, as <lb/>
far as I was able, I prepared for repose. It might have been <lb/>
<pb n="188" entity="eaf033v3_0201" pid="uva-lib:349933"/>
reasonably suspected to be the den of rattlesnakes or <reg orig="pan-|thers">panthers</reg>; <lb/>
but my late contention with superior dangers and <lb/>
more formidable enemies made me reckless of these, but <lb/>
another inconvenience remained. In spite of my <reg orig="precau-|tions">precautions</reg>, <lb/>
my motionless posture and slender covering exposed <lb/>
me so much to the cold that I could not sleep.</p>
<p>The air appeared to have suddenly assumed the <reg orig="tempe-|rature">temperature</reg> <lb/>
of midwinter. In a short time, my extremities were <lb/>
benumbed, and my limbs shivered and ached as if I had <lb/>
been seized by an ague. My bed likewise was dank and <lb/>
uneven, and the posture I was obliged to assume, unnatural <lb/>
and painful. It was evident that my purpose could not be <lb/>
answered by remaining here.</p>
<p>I, therefore, crept forth, and began to reflect upon the <lb/>
possibility of continuing my journey. Motion was the only <lb/>
thing that could keep me from freezing, and my frame was <lb/>
in that state which allowed me to take no repose in the <reg orig="ab-|sence">absence</reg> <lb/>
of warmth; since warmth was indispensable. It <lb/>
now occurred to me to ask whether it were not possible to <lb/>
kindle a fire.</p>
<p>Sticks and leaves were at hand. My hatchet and a <reg orig="peb-|ble">pebble</reg> <lb/>
would enable me to extract a spark. From this, by <lb/>
suitable care and perseverance, I might finally procure <reg orig="suffi-|cient">sufficient</reg> <lb/>
fire to give me comfort and ease, and even enable me <lb/>
to sleep. This boon was delicious, and I felt as if I were <lb/>
unable to support a longer deprivation of it.</p>
<p>I proceeded to execute this scheme. I took the driest <lb/>
leaves, and endeavored to use them as tinder, but the driest <lb/>
leaves were moistened by the dews. They were only to be <lb/>
found in the hollows, in some of which were pools of water <lb/>
and others were dank. I was not speedily discouraged, but <lb/>
my repeated attempts failed, and I was finally compelled to <lb/>
relinquish this expedient.</p>
<p>All that now remained was to wander forth and keep <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg> <lb/>
in motion till the morning. The night was likely to <lb/>
prove tempestuous and long. The gale seemed freighted <lb/>
with ice, and acted upon my body like the points of a <reg orig="thou-|sand">thousand</reg> <lb/>
needles. There was no remedy, and I mustered my <lb/>
patience to endure it.</p>
<p>I returned again, to the brow of the hill. I ranged along <lb/>
it till I reached a place where the descent was <reg orig="perpendicu-|lar">perpendicular</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="189" entity="eaf033v3_0202" pid="uva-lib:349934"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">17*</fw></pb>
and, in consequence of affording no sustenance to trees <lb/>
or bushes, was nearly smooth and bare. There was no road <lb/>
to be seen, and this circumstance, added to the sounds <lb/>
which the rippling current produced, afforded me some <lb/>
knowledge of my situation.</p>
<p>The ledge, along which the road was conducted, <reg orig="disap-|peared">disappeared</reg> <lb/>
near this spot. The opposite sides of the chasm <lb/>
through which flowed the river, approached nearer to each <lb/>
other, in the form of jutting promontories. I now stood <lb/>
upon the verge of that on the northern side. The water <lb/>
flowed at the foot, but, for the space of ten or twelve feet <lb/>
from the rock, was so shallow as to permit the traveller and <lb/>
his horse to wade through it, and thus to regain the road <lb/>
which the receding precipice had allowed to be continued <lb/>
on the farther side.</p>
<p>I knew the nature and dimensions of this ford. I knew <lb/>
that, at a few yards from the rock, the channel was of great <lb/>
depth. To leap into it, in this place, was a less dangerous <lb/>
exploit, than at the spot where I had formerly been tempted <lb/>
to leap. There I was unacquainted with the depth, but here <lb/>
I knew it to be considerable. Still there was some ground <lb/>
of hesitation and fear. My present station was loftier, and <lb/>
how deeply I might sink into this gulph, how far the fall and <lb/>
the concussion would bereave me of my presence of mind, <lb/>
I could not determine. This hesitation vanished, and <reg orig="plac-|ing">placing</reg> <lb/>
my tomahawk and fusil upon the ground, I prepared to <lb/>
leap.</p>
<p>This purpose was suspended, in the moment of its <reg orig="ex-|ecution">execution</reg>, <lb/>
by a faint sound, heard from the quarter whence I <lb/>
had come. It was the warning of men, but had nothing <lb/>
in common with those which I had been accustomed to <lb/>
hear. It was not the howling of a wolf or the yelling of a <lb/>
panther. These had often been overheard by night during <lb/>
my last year's excursion to the lakes. My fears whispered <lb/>
that this was the vociferation of a savage.</p>
<p>I was unacquainted with the number of the enemies who <lb/>
had adventured into this district. Whether those whom I <lb/>
had encountered at <hi rend="italic">Deb's hut</hi> were of that band whom I <lb/>
had met with in the cavern, was merely a topic of conjecture. <lb/>
There might be a half score of troops, equally numerous, <lb/>
<pb n="190" entity="eaf033v3_0203" pid="uva-lib:349935"/>
spread over the wilderness, and the signal I had just heard <lb/>
might betoken the approach of one of these. Yet by what <lb/>
means they should gain this nook, and what prey they <reg orig="ex-|pected">expected</reg> <lb/>
to discover, were not easily conceived.</p>
<p>The sounds, somewhat diversified, nearer and rising from <lb/>
different quarters, were again heard. My doubts and <lb/>
apprehensions were increased. What expedient to adopt <lb/>
for my own safety, was a subject of rapid meditation. <lb/>
Whether to remain stretched upon the ground or to rise <lb/>
and go forward. Was it likely the enemy would coast along <lb/>
the edge of the steep? Would they ramble hither to look <lb/>
upon the ample scene which spread on all sides around the <lb/>
base of this rocky pinnacle? In that case, how should I <lb/>
conduct myself! My arms were ready for use. Could I <lb/>
not elude the necessity of shedding more blood? Could I <lb/>
not anticipate their assault by casting myself without delay <lb/>
into the stream?</p>
<p>The sense of danger demanded more attention to be paid <lb/>
to external objects than to the motives by which my future <lb/>
conduct should be influenced. My post was on a circular <lb/>
projecture, in some degree, detached from the body of the <lb/>
hill, the brow of which continued in a straight line, <reg orig="uninter-|rupted">uninterrupted</reg> <lb/>
by this projecture, which was somewhat higher than <lb/>
the continued summit of the ridge. This line ran at the <lb/>
distance of a few paces from my post. Objects moving <lb/>
along this line could merely be perceived to move, in the <lb/>
present obscurity.</p>
<p>My scrutiny was entirely directed to this quarter. <reg orig="Pre-|sently">Presently</reg> <lb/>
the treading of many feet was heard, and several <lb/>
figures were discovered, following each other in that straight <lb/>
and regular succession which is peculiar to the Indians. <lb/>
They kept along the brow of the hill joining the promontory. <lb/>
I distinctly marked seven figures in succession.</p>
<p>My resolution was formed. Should any one cast his <lb/>
eye hither, suspect, or discover an enemy, and rush towards <lb/>
me, I determined to start upon my feet, fire on my foe as <lb/>
he advanced, throw my piece on the ground, and then leap <lb/>
into the river.</p>
<p>Happily, they passed unobservant and in silence. I <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
in the same posture for several minutes. At length, <lb/>
just as my alarms began to subside, the halloes, before <lb/>
<pb n="191" entity="eaf033v3_0204" pid="uva-lib:349936"/>
heard, arose, and from the same quarter as before. This <lb/>
convinced me that my perils were not at an end. This <lb/>
now appeared to be merely the vanguard, and would <reg orig="speed-|ily">speedily</reg> <lb/>
be followed by others, against whom the same caution <lb/>
was necessary to be taken.</p>
<p>My eye, anxiously bent the only way by which any one <lb/>
could approach, now discerned a figure, which was <reg orig="indubi-|tably">indubitably</reg> <lb/>
that of a man armed, none other appeared in company, <lb/>
but doubtless others were near. He approached, stood <lb/>
still, and appeared to gaze steadfastly at the spot where I <lb/>
lay.</p>
<p>The optics of a <hi rend="italic">Lennilennapee</hi> I knew to be far keener <lb/>
than my own. A log or a couched fawn would never be <lb/>
mistaken for a man, nor a man for a couched fawn or a log. <lb/>
Not only a human being would be instantly detected, but a <lb/>
decision be unerringly made whether it were friend or foe. <lb/>
That my prostrate body was the object on which the <reg orig="atten-|tion">attention</reg> <lb/>
of this vigilant and steadfast gazer was fixed, could <lb/>
not be doubted. Yet, since he continued an inactive gazer, <lb/>
there was ground for a possibility to stand upon, that I was <lb/>
not recognised. My fate therefore, was still in suspense.</p>
<p>This interval was momentary. I marked a movement, <lb/>
which my fears instantly interpreted to be that of levelling a <lb/>
gun at my head. This action was sufficiently conformable <lb/>
to my prognostics. Supposing me to be detected, there <lb/>
was no need for him to change his post. Aim might be <lb/>
too fatally taken, and his prey be secured, from the distance <lb/>
at which he now stood.</p>
<p>These images glanced upon my thought, and put an end <lb/>
to my suspense. A single effort placed me on my feet. I <lb/>
fired with precipitation that precluded the certainty of hitting <lb/>
my mark, dropped my piece upon the ground, and leaped <lb/>
from this tremendous height into the river. I reached the <lb/>
surface, and sunk in a moment to the bottom.</p>
<p>Plunging endlong into the water, the impetus created by <lb/>
my fall from such a height, would be slowly resisted by this <lb/>
denser element. Had the depth been less, its resistance <lb/>
would not perhaps have hindered me from being mortally <lb/>
injured against the rocky bottom. Had the depth been <lb/>
greater, time enough would not have been allowed me to <reg orig="re-|gain">regain</reg> <lb/>
the surface. Had I fallen on my side, I should have <lb/>
<pb n="192" entity="eaf033v3_0205" pid="uva-lib:349937"/>
been bereaved of life or sensibility by the shock which my <lb/>
frame would have received. As it was, my fate was <reg orig="sus-|pended">suspended</reg> <lb/>
on a thread. To have lost my presence of mind, <lb/>
to have forborne to counteract my sinking, for an instant, <lb/>
after I had reached the water, would have made all <reg orig="exer-|tions">exertions</reg> <lb/>
to regain the air, fruitless. To so fortunate a <reg orig="concur-|rence">concurrence</reg> <lb/>
of events, was thy friend indebted for his safety!</p>
<p>Yet I only emerged from the gulf to encounter new perils. <lb/>
Scarcely had I raised my head above the surface, and <reg orig="in-|haled">inhaled</reg> <lb/>
the vital breath, when twenty shots were aimed at me <lb/>
from the precipice above. A shower of bullets fell upon <lb/>
the water. Some of them did not fall further than two <lb/>
inches from my head. I had not been aware of this new <lb/>
danger, and now that it assailed me continued gasping the <lb/>
air, and floundering at random. The means of eluding it <lb/>
did not readily occur. My case seemed desperate and all <lb/>
caution was dismissed.</p>
<p>This state of discomfiting surprise quickly disappeared. I <lb/>
made myself acquainted, at a glance, with the position of <lb/>
surrounding objects. I conceived that the opposite bank <lb/>
of the river would afford me most security, and thither I <lb/>
tended with all the expedition in my power.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my safety depended on eluding the bullets <lb/>
that continued incessantly to strike the water at an arm's <lb/>
length from my body. For this end I plunged beneath the <lb/>
surface, and only rose to inhale fresh air. Presently the <lb/>
firing ceased, the flashes that lately illuminated the bank <lb/>
disappeared, and a certain bustle and murmur of confused <lb/>
voices gave place to solitude and silence.</p>
<ornament type="line"/>

<div1 type="chapter" n="XXI" id="d27">
<head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I reached</hi> without difficulty the opposite bank, but the <lb/>
steep was inaccessible. I swam along the edge in hopes of <lb/>
meeting with some projection or recess where I might, at <lb/>
least, rest my weary limbs, and if it were necessary to <reg orig="re-|cross">recross</reg> <lb/>
the river, to lay in a stock of recruited spirits and <lb/>
strength for that purpose. I trusted that the water would <lb/>
<pb n="193" entity="eaf033v3_0206" pid="uva-lib:349938"/>
speedily become shoal, or that the steep would afford rest <lb/>
to my feet. In both these hopes I was disappointed.</p>
<p>There is no one to whom I would yield the superiority in <lb/>
swimming, but my strength, like that of other human beings, <lb/>
had its limits. My previous fatigues had been enormous, <lb/>
and my clothes, heavy with moisture, greatly encumbered <lb/>
and retarded my movements. I had proposed to free <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg> <lb/>
from this imprisonment, but I foresaw the inconveniences <lb/>
of wandering over this scene in absolute nakedness, and was <lb/>
willing therefore, at whatever hazard, to retain them. I <lb/>
continued to struggle with the current and to search for the <lb/>
means of scaling the steeps. My search was fruitless, and I <lb/>
began to meditate the recrossing of the river.</p>
<p>Surely my fate has never been paralleled! Where was <lb/>
this series of hardships and perils to end? No sooner was <lb/>
one calamity eluded, than I was beset by another. I had <lb/>
emerged from abhorred darkness in the heart of the earth, <lb/>
only to endure the extremities of famine and encounter the <lb/>
fangs of a wild beast. From these I was delivered only to <lb/>
be thrown into the midst of savages, to wage an endless <lb/>
and hopeless war with adepts in killing; with appetites that <lb/>
longed to feast upon my bowels and to quaff my heart's <lb/>
blood. From these likewise was I rescued, but merely to <lb/>
perish in the gulfs of the river, to welter on unvisited shores <lb/>
or to be washed far away from curiosity or pity.</p>
<p>Formerly water was not only my field of sport but my <lb/>
sofa and my bed. I could float for hours on its surface, <reg orig="en-|joying">enjoying</reg> <lb/>
its delicious cool, almost without the expense of the <lb/>
slightest motion. It was an element as fitted for repose as <lb/>
for exercise, but now the buoyant spirit seemed to have <lb/>
flown. My muscles were shrunk, the air and water were <lb/>
equally congealed, and my most vehement exertions were <lb/>
requisite to sustain me on the surface.</p>
<p>At first I had moved along with my wonted celerity and <lb/>
ease, but quickly my forces were exhausted. My pantings <lb/>
and efforts were augmented, and I saw that to cross the <lb/>
river again was impracticable. I must continue, therefore, <lb/>
to search out some accessible spot in the bank along which <lb/>
I was swimming.</p>
<p>Each moment diminished my stock of strength, and it <lb/>
behoved me to make good my footing before another minute <lb/>
<pb n="194" entity="eaf033v3_0207" pid="uva-lib:349939"/>
should escape. I continued to swim, to survey the bank, <lb/>
and to make ineffectual attempts to grasp the rock. The <lb/>
shrubs which grew upon it would not uphold me, and the <lb/>
fragments which, for a moment, inspired me with hope, <lb/>
crumbled away as soon as they were touched.</p>
<p>At length, I noticed a pine, which was rooted in a <reg orig="cre-|vice">crevice</reg> <lb/>
near the water. The trunk, or any part of the root, <lb/>
was beyond my reach, but I trusted that I could catch hold <lb/>
of the branch which hung lowest, and that, when caught, it <lb/>
would assist me in gaining the trunk, and thus deliver me <lb/>
from the death which could not be otherwise averted.</p>
<p>The attempt was arduous. Had it been made when I <lb/>
first reached the bank, no difficulty had attended it, but <lb/>
now, to throw myself some feet above the surface could <lb/>
scarcely be expected from one whose utmost efforts seemed <lb/>
to be demanded to keep him from sinking. Yet this <reg orig="ex-|ploit">exploit</reg>, <lb/>
arduous as it was, was attempted and accomplished. <lb/>
Happily the twigs were strong enough to sustain my weight <lb/>
till I caught at other branches and finally placed myself upon <lb/>
the trunk.</p>
<p>This danger was now past, but I admitted the conviction <lb/>
that others, no less formidable, remained to be encountered <lb/>
and that my ultimate destiny was death. I looked upward. <lb/>
New efforts might enable me to gain the summit of this <lb/>
steep, but, perhaps, I should thus be placed merely in the <lb/>
situation from which I had just been delivered. It was of <lb/>
little moment whether the scene of my imprisonment was a <lb/>
dungeon not to be broken, or a summit from which descent <lb/>
was impossible.</p>
<p>The river, indeed, severed me from a road which was <lb/>
level and safe, but my recent dangers were remembered <lb/>
only to make me shudder at the thought of incurring them <lb/>
a second time, by attempting to cross it. I blush at the <reg orig="re-|collection">recollection</reg> <lb/>
of this cowardice. It was little akin to the spirit <lb/>
which I had recently displayed. It was, indeed, an alien <lb/>
to my bosom, and was quickly supplanted by intrepidity and <lb/>
perseverance.</p>
<p>I proceeded to mount the hill. From root to root, and <lb/>
from branch to branch, lay my journey. It was finished, <lb/>
and I sat down upon the highest brow to meditate on future <lb/>
trials. No road lay along this side of the river. It was <lb/>
<pb n="195" entity="eaf033v3_0208" pid="uva-lib:349940"/>
rugged and sterile, and farms were sparingly dispersed over <lb/>
it. To reach one of these was now the object of my <lb/>
wishes. I had not lost the desire of reaching Solebury <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
morning, but my wet clothes and the coldness of the <lb/>
night seemed to have bereaved me of the power.</p>
<p>I traversed this summit, keeping the river on my right <lb/>
hand. Happily, its declinations and ascents were by no <lb/>
means difficult, and I was cheered in the midst of my <lb/>
vexations, by observing that every mile brought me nearer <lb/>
to my uncle's dwelling. Meanwhile I anxiously looked for <lb/>
some tokens of a habitation. These at length presented <lb/>
themselves. A wild heath, whistled over by October blasts, <lb/>
meagerly adorned with the dry stalks of scented shrubs and <lb/>
the bald heads of the sapless mullen, was succeeded by a <lb/>
fenced field and a corn stack. The dwelling to which these <lb/>
belonged was eagerly sought.</p>
<p>I was not surprised that all voices were still and all lights <lb/>
extinguished, for this was the hour of repose. Having <lb/>
reached a piazza before the house, I paused. Whether, <lb/>
at this drowsy time, to knock for admission, to alarm the <lb/>
peaceful tenants and take from them the rest which their <lb/>
daily toils and their rural innocence had made so sweet, or <lb/>
to retire to what shelter a haystack or barn could afford, <lb/>
was the theme of my deliberations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I looked up at the house. It was the model <lb/>
of cleanliness and comfort. It was built of wood; but the <lb/>
materials had undergone the plane, as well as the axe and <lb/>
the saw. It was painted white, and the windows not only <lb/>
had sashes, but these sashes were supplied, contrary to <lb/>
custom, with glass. In most cases the aperture where glass <lb/>
should be is stuffed with an old hat or a petticoat. The <lb/>
door had not only all its parts entire, but was embellished <lb/>
with mouldings and a pediment. I gathered from these <reg orig="to-|kens">tokens</reg> <lb/>
that this was the abode not only of rural competence <lb/>
and innocence, but of some beings, raised by education <lb/>
and fortune, above the intellectual mediocrity of clowns.</p>
<p>Methought I could claim consanguinity with such beings. <lb/>
Not to share their charity and kindness would be inflicting <lb/>
as well as receiving injury. The trouble of affording <reg orig="shel-|ter">shelter</reg>, <lb/>
and warmth, and wholesome diet to a wretch destitute <lb/>
as I was, would be eagerly sought by them.</p>
<pb n="196" entity="eaf033v3_0209" pid="uva-lib:349941"/>
<p>Still I was unwilling to disturb them. I bethought <reg orig="my-|self">myself</reg> <lb/>
that their kitchen might be entered, and all that my <lb/>
necessities required be obtained without interrupting their <lb/>
slumber. I needed nothing but the warmth which their <lb/>
kitchen hearth would afford. Stretched upon the bricks, I <lb/>
might dry my clothes, and perhaps enjoy some unmolested <lb/>
sleep; in spite of presages of ill and the horrid <reg orig="remem-|brances">remembrances</reg> <lb/>
of what I had performed and endured. I believed <lb/>
that nature would afford a short respite to my cares.</p>
<p>I went to the door of what appeared to be a kitchen. <lb/>
The door was wide open. This circumstance portended <lb/>
evil. Though it be not customary to lock or to bolt, it is <lb/>
still less usual to have entrances unclosed. I entered with <lb/>
suspicious steps, and saw enough to confirm my <reg orig="apprehen-|sions">apprehensions</reg>. <lb/>
Several pieces of wood half burned, lay in the midst <lb/>
of the floor. They appeared to have been removed hither <lb/>
from the chimney, doubtless with a view to set fire to the <lb/>
whole building.</p>
<p>The fire had made some progress on the floor, but had <lb/>
been seasonably extinguished by pails full of water thrown <lb/>
upon it. The floor was still deluged with wet, the pail not <lb/>
emptied of all its contents stood upon the hearth. The <lb/>
earthen vessels and plates whose proper place was the <lb/>
dresser, were scattered in fragments in all parts of the room. <lb/>
I looked around me for some one to explain this scene, <lb/>
but no one appeared.</p>
<p>The last spark of fire was put out, so that had my <reg orig="cu-|riosity">curiosity</reg> <lb/>
been idle, my purpose could not be accomplished. <lb/>
To retire from this scene, neither curiosity nor benevolence <lb/>
would permit. That some mortal injury had been intended <lb/>
was apparent. What greater mischief had befallen, or <lb/>
whether greater might not, by my interposition, be averted, <lb/>
could only be ascertained by penetrating further into the <lb/>
house. I opened a door on one side which led to the main <lb/>
body of the building and entered to a bedchamber. I <lb/>
stood at the entrance and knocked, but no one answered <lb/>
my signals.</p>
<p>The sky was not totally clouded, so that some light <reg orig="per-|vaded">pervaded</reg> <lb/>
the room. I saw that a bed stood in the corner, <lb/>
but whether occupied or not, its curtains hindered me from <lb/>
judging. I stood in suspense a few minutes, when a <reg orig="mo-|tion">motion</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="197" entity="eaf033v3_0210" pid="uva-lib:349942"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">18</fw></pb>
in the bed shewed me that some one was there. I <lb/>
knocked again but withdrew to the outside of the door. <lb/>
This roused the sleeper, who half-groaning and puffing the <lb/>
air through his nostrils, grumbled out in the hoarsest voice <lb/>
that I ever heard, and in a tone of surly impatience&mdash;Who <lb/>
is there?</p>
<p>I hesitated for an answer, but the voice instantly <reg orig="con-|tinued">continued</reg> <lb/>
in the manner of one half asleep and enraged at <lb/>
being disturbed.&mdash;Is 't you Peg? Damn ye, stay away, now; <lb/>
I tell ye stay away, or, by God I will cut your throat&mdash;I <lb/>
will&mdash;He continued to mutter and swear, but without <reg orig="co-|herence">coherence</reg> <lb/>
or distinctness.</p>
<p>These were the accents of drunkenness, and denoted a <lb/>
wild and ruffian life. They were little in unison with the <lb/>
external appearances of the mansion, and blasted all the <lb/>
hopes I had formed of meeting under this roof with <reg orig="gen-|tleness">gentleness</reg> <lb/>
and hospitality. To talk with this being, to attempt <lb/>
to reason him into humanity and soberness, was useless. I <lb/>
was at a loss in what manner to address him, or whether <lb/>
it was proper to maintain any parley. Meanwhile, my <lb/>
silence was supplied by the suggestions of his own <reg orig="distem-|pered">distempered</reg> <lb/>
fancy. Ay, said he, ye will, will ye? well, come <lb/>
on, let's see who's the better at the oak stick. If I part with <lb/>
ye, before I have bared your bones.&mdash;I'll teach ye to be <lb/>
always dipping in my dish, ye devil's dam! ye!</p>
<p>So saying, he tumbled out of bed. At the first step, he <lb/>
struck his head against the bed post, but setting himself <lb/>
upright, he staggered towards the spot where I stood. <lb/>
Some new obstacle occurred. He stumbled and fell at his <lb/>
length upon the floor.</p>
<p>To encounter or expostulate with a man in this state was <lb/>
plainly absurd. I turned and issued forth, with an aching <lb/>
heart, into the court before the house. The miseries which <lb/>
a debauched husband or father inflicts upon all whom their <lb/>
evil destiny allies to him were pictured by my fancy, and <lb/>
wrung from me tears of anguish. These images, however, <lb/>
quickly yielded to reflections on my own state. No <reg orig="ex-|pedient">expedient</reg> <lb/>
now remained, but to seek the barn, and find a <lb/>
covering and a bed of straw.</p>
<p>I had scarcely set foot within the barn yard when I heard <lb/>
<pb n="198" entity="eaf033v3_0211" pid="uva-lib:349943"/>
a sound as of the crying of an infant. It appeared to issue <lb/>
from the barn. I approached softly and listened at the door. <lb/>
The cries of the babe continued, but were accompanied by <lb/>
the entreaties of a nurse or a mother to be quiet. These <lb/>
entreaties were mingled with heart-breaking sobs and <reg orig="excla-|mations">exclamations</reg> <lb/>
of&mdash;Ah! me, my babe! Canst thou not sleep and <lb/>
afford thy unhappy mother some peace? Thou art cold, <lb/>
and I have not sufficient warmth to cherish thee! What will <lb/>
become of us? Thy deluded father cares not if we both <lb/>
perish.</p>
<p>A glimpse of the true nature of the scene seemed to be <lb/>
imparted by these words. I now likewise recollected <reg orig="inci-|dents">incidents</reg> <lb/>
that afforded additional light. Somewhere on this <lb/>
bank of the river, there formerly resided one by name <lb/>
Selby. He was an aged person, who united science and <lb/>
taste to the simple and laborious habits of a husbandman. <lb/>
He had a son who resided several years in Europe, but on <lb/>
the death of his father, returned home, accompanied by <lb/>
a wife. He had succeeded to the occupation of the farm, <lb/>
but rumor had whispered many tales to the disadvantage of <lb/>
his morals. His wife was affirmed to be of delicate and <lb/>
polished manners, and much unlike her companion.</p>
<p>It now occurred to me that this was the dwelling of the <lb/>
Selby's, and I seemed to have gained some insight into the <lb/>
discord and domestic miseries by which the unhappy lady <lb/>
suffered. This was no time to waste my sympathy on <lb/>
others. I could benefit her nothing. Selby had probably <lb/>
returned from a carousal, with all his malignant passions <lb/>
raised into phrenzy by intoxication. He had driven his <lb/>
desolate wife from her bed and house, and to shun outrage <lb/>
and violence she had fled, with her helpless infant, to the <lb/>
barn. To appease his fury, to console her, to suggest a <lb/>
remedy for this distress, was not in my power. To have <lb/>
sought an interview would be merely to excite her terrors <lb/>
and alarm her delicacy, without contributing to alleviate her <lb/>
calamity. Here then was no asylum for me. A place of <lb/>
rest must be sought at some neighboring habitation. It <lb/>
was probable that one would be found at no great <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg>, <lb/>
the path that led from the spot where I stood, through <lb/>
a gate into a meadow, might conduct me to the nearest <lb/>
dwelling, and this path I immediately resolved to explore.</p>
<pb n="199" entity="eaf033v3_0212" pid="uva-lib:349944"/>
<p>I was anxious to open the gate without noise, but I could <lb/>
not succeed. Some creaking of its hinges, was unavoidably <lb/>
produced, which I feared would be overheard by the lady <lb/>
and multiply her apprehensions and perplexities. This <reg orig="in-|convenience">inconvenience</reg> <lb/>
was irremediable. I therefore closed the gate <lb/>
and pursued the footway before me with the utmost <reg orig="expedi-|tion">expedition</reg>. <lb/>
I had not gained the further end of the meadow when <lb/>
I lighted on something which lay across the path, and which, <lb/>
on being closely inspected, appeared to be a human body. <lb/>
It was the corse of a girl, mangled by a hatchet. Her head <lb/>
gory and deprived of its locks, easily explained the kind of <lb/>
enemies by whom she had been assailed. Here was proof <lb/>
that this quiet and remote habitation had been visited, in <lb/>
their destructive progress by the Indians. The girl had <lb/>
been slain by them, and her scalp, according to their savage <lb/>
custom, had been torn away to be preserved as a trophy.</p>
<p>The fire which had been kindled on the kitchen floor was <lb/>
now remembered, and corroborated the inferences which <lb/>
were drawn from this spectacle. And yet that the mischief <lb/>
had been thus limited, that the besotted wretch who lay <lb/>
helpless on his bed, and careless of impending danger, and <lb/>
that the mother and her infant should escape, excited some <lb/>
degree of surprise. Could the savages have been interrupted <lb/>
in their work, and obliged to leave their vengeance unfinished?</p>
<p>Their visit had been recent. Many hours had not elapsed <lb/>
since they prowled about these grounds. Had they wholly <lb/>
disappeared and meant they not to return? To what new <lb/>
danger might I be exposed in remaining thus guideless and <lb/>
destitute of all defence?</p>
<p>In consequence of these reflections, I proceeded with <lb/>
more caution. I looked with suspicious glances, before and <lb/>
on either side of me. I now approached the fence which, <lb/>
on this side, bounded the meadow. Something was discerned <lb/>
or imagined, stretched close to the fence, on the ground, and <lb/>
filling up the pathway. My apprehensions of a lurking <reg orig="en-|emy">enemy</reg>, <lb/>
had been previously awakened, and my fancy instantly <lb/>
figured to itself an armed man, lying on the ground and <lb/>
waiting to assail the unsuspecting passenger.</p>
<p>At first I was prompted to fly, but a second thought <reg orig="shew-|ed">shewed</reg> <lb/>
me that I had already approached near enough to be <lb/>
endangered. Notwithstanding my pause, the form was <lb/>
<pb n="200" entity="eaf033v3_0213" pid="uva-lib:349945"/>
motionless. The possibility of being misled in my <reg orig="conjec-|tures">conjectures</reg> <lb/>
was easily supposed. What I saw might be a log or it <lb/>
might be another victim to savage ferocity. This track was <lb/>
that which my safety required me to pursue. To turn <lb/>
aside or go back would be merely to bewilder myself <lb/>
anew.</p>
<p>Urged by these motives, I went nearer, and at least was <lb/>
close enough to perceive that the figure was human. He <lb/>
lay upon his face, near his right hand was a musket, <reg orig="un-|clenched">unclenched</reg>. <lb/>
This circumstance, his death-like attitude and <lb/>
the garb and ornaments of an Indian, made me readily <reg orig="sus-|pect">suspect</reg> <lb/>
the nature and cause of this catastrophe. Here the <lb/>
invaders had been encountered and repulsed, and one at <lb/>
least of their number had been left upon the field.</p>
<p>I was weary of contemplating these rueful objects. <reg orig="Cus-|tom">Custom</reg>, <lb/>
likewise, even in so short a period, had inured me to <lb/>
spectacles of horror. I was grown callous and immoveable. <lb/>
I staid not to ponder on the scene, but snatching the musket, <lb/>
which was now without an owner, and which might be <reg orig="in-|dispensable">indispensable</reg> <lb/>
to my defence, I hastened into the wood. On <lb/>
this side the meadow was skirted by a forest, but a beaten <lb/>
road led into it, and might therefore be attempted without <lb/>
danger.</p>
<ornament type="line"/>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="XXII" id="d28">
<head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> road was intricate and long. It seemed designed <lb/>
to pervade the forest in every possible direction. I <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg> <lb/>
noticed cut wood, piled in heaps upon either side, <lb/>
and rejoiced in these tokens that the residence of man was <lb/>
near. At length I reached a second fence, which proved to <lb/>
be the boundary of a road still more frequented. I pursued <lb/>
this, and presently beheld, before me, the river and its <reg orig="op-|posite">opposite</reg> <lb/>
barriers.</p>
<p>This object afforded me some knowledge of my situation. <lb/>
There was a ford over which travellers used to pass, and in <lb/>
which the road that I was now pursuing terminated. The <lb/>
stream was rapid and tumultuous, but in this place it did not <lb/>
<pb n="201" entity="eaf033v3_0214" pid="uva-lib:349946"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">18*</fw></pb>
rise higher than the shoulders. On the opposite side was a <lb/>
highway, passable by horses and men, though not by <reg orig="car-|riages">carriages</reg>, <lb/>
and which led into the midst of Solebury. Should <lb/>
I not rush into the stream, and still aim at reaching my <lb/>
uncle's house before morning? Why should I delay?</p>
<p>Thirty hours of incessant watchfulness and toil, of <reg orig="enor-|mous">enormous</reg> <lb/>
efforts and perils, preceded and accompanied by <reg orig="ab-|stinence">abstinence</reg> <lb/>
and wounds, were enough to annihilate the strength <lb/>
and courage of ordinary men. In the course of them, I <lb/>
had frequently believed myself to have reached the verge <lb/>
beyond which my force would not carry me, but experience <lb/>
as frequently demonstrated my error. Though many miles <lb/>
were yet to be traversed, though my clothes were once more <lb/>
to be drenched and loaded with moisture, though every hour <lb/>
seemed to add somewhat to the keenness of the blast; yet <lb/>
how should I know, but by trial, whether my stock of energy <lb/>
was not sufficient for this last exploit?</p>
<p>My resolution to proceed was nearly formed, when the <lb/>
figure of a man moving slowly across the road, at some <reg orig="dis-|tance">distance</reg> <lb/>
before me, was observed. Hard by this ford lived a <lb/>
man by name Bisset, of whom I had slight knowledge. He <lb/>
tended his two hundred acres with a plodding and <reg orig="money-|doating">moneydoating</reg> <lb/>
spirit, while his son overlooked a grist-mill, on the <lb/>
river. He was a creature of gain, coarse and harmless. <lb/>
The man whom I saw before me might be he, or some one <lb/>
belonging to his family. Being armed for defence, I less <lb/>
scrupled a meeting with any thing in the shape of man. I <lb/>
therefore called. The figure stopped and answered me, <lb/>
without surliness or anger. The voice was unlike that of <lb/>
Bisset, but this person's information I believed would be of <lb/>
some service.</p>
<p>Coming up to him, he proved to be a clown, belonging to <lb/>
Bisset's habitation. His panic and surprise on seeing me <lb/>
made him aghast. In my present garb I should not have <lb/>
easily been recognised by my nearest kinsman, and much <lb/>
less easily by one who had seldom met me.</p>
<p>It may be easily conceived that my thoughts, when <lb/>
allowed to wander from the objects before me, were <reg orig="tor-|mented">tormented</reg> <lb/>
with forebodings and inquietudes on account of the <lb/>
ills which I had so much reason to believe had befallen my <lb/>
<pb n="202" entity="eaf033v3_0215" pid="uva-lib:349947"/>
family. I had no doubt that some evil had happened, but <lb/>
the full extent of it was still uncertain. I desired and <lb/>
dreaded to discover the truth, and was unable to interrogate <lb/>
this person in a direct manner. I could deal only in <reg orig="circui-|ties">circuities</reg> <lb/>
and hints. I shuddered while I waited for an answer to <lb/>
my inquiries.</p>
<p>Had not Indians, I asked, been lately seen in this <reg orig="neigh-|borhood">neighborhood</reg>? <lb/>
Were they not suspected of hostile designs? <lb/>
Had they not already committed some mischief? Some <lb/>
passenger, perhaps, had been attacked; or fire had been set <lb/>
to some house? On which side of the river had their steps <lb/>
been observed, or any devastation been committed? Above <lb/>
the ford or below it? At what distance from the river?</p>
<p>When his attention could be withdrawn from my person <lb/>
and bestowed upon my questions, he answered that some <lb/>
alarm had indeed been spread about Indians, and that <reg orig="par-|ties">parties</reg> <lb/>
from Solebury and Chetasko were out in pursuit of <lb/>
them, that many persons had been killed by them, and that <lb/>
one house in Solebury had been rifled and burnt on the night <lb/>
before the last.</p>
<p>These tidings were a dreadful confirmation of my fears. <lb/>
There scarcely remained a doubt; but still my expiring <lb/>
hope prompted me to inquire to whom did the house belong?</p>
<p>He answered that he had not heard the name of the <lb/>
owner. He was a stranger to the people on the other side <lb/>
of the river.</p>
<p>Were any of the inhabitants murdered?</p>
<p>Yes. All that were at home except a girl whom they <lb/>
carried off. Some said that the girl had been retaken?</p>
<p>What was the name? Was it Huntly?</p>
<p>Huntly? yes. No. He did not know. He had <reg orig="for-|gotten">forgotten</reg>.</p>
<p>I fixed my eyes upon the ground. An interval of <lb/>
gloomy meditation succeeded. All was lost, all for whose <lb/>
sake I desired to live, had perished by the hands of these <lb/>
assassins. That dear home, the scene of my sportive <reg orig="child-|hood">childhood</reg>, <lb/>
of my studies, labors and recreations, was ravaged <lb/>
by fire and the sword; was reduced to a frightful ruin.</p>
<p>Not only all that embellished and endeared existence <lb/>
was destroyed, but the means of subsistence itself. Thou <lb/>
knowest that my sisters and I were dependants on the <lb/>
<pb n="203" entity="eaf033v3_0216" pid="uva-lib:349948"/>
bounty of our uncle. His death would make way for the <lb/>
succession of his son, a man fraught with envy and <reg orig="malig-|nity">malignity</reg>; <lb/>
who always testified a mortal hatred to us, merely <lb/>
because we enjoyed the protection of his father. The <lb/>
ground which furnished me with bread was now become the <lb/>
property of one, who, if he could have done it with <reg orig="secu-|rity">security</reg>, <lb/>
would gladly have mingled poison with my food.</p>
<p>All that my imagination or my heart regarded as of value <lb/>
had likewise perished. Whatever my chamber, my closets, <lb/>
my cabinets contained, my furniture, my books, the records <lb/>
of my own skill, the monuments of their existence whom I <lb/>
loved, my very clothing, were involved in indiscriminate <lb/>
and irretrievable destruction. Why should I survive this <lb/>
calamity?</p>
<p>But did not he say that one had escaped? The only <lb/>
females in the family were my sisters. One of these had <lb/>
been reserved for a fate worse than death; to gratify the <lb/>
innate and insatiable cruelty of savages, by suffering all the <lb/>
torments their invention can suggest, or to linger out years <lb/>
of dreary bondage and unintermitted hardship in the bosom <lb/>
of the wilderness. To restore her to liberty; to cherish <lb/>
this last survivor of my unfortunate race, was a sufficient <lb/>
motive to life and to activity.</p>
<p>But soft! Had not rumor whispered that the captive was <lb/>
retaken? Oh! who was her angel of deliverance? Where <lb/>
did she now abide? Weeping over the untimely fall of her <lb/>
protector and her friend. Lamenting and upbraiding the <lb/>
absence of her brother? Why should I not haste to find <lb/>
her? To mingle my tears with hers, to assure her of my <lb/>
safety and expiate the involuntary crime of my desertion, <lb/>
by devoting all futurity to the task of her consolation and <lb/>
improvement?</p>
<p>The path was open and direct. My new motives would <lb/>
have trampled upon every impediment and made me <reg orig="reck-|less">reckless</reg> <lb/>
of all dangers and all toils. I broke from my reverie, <lb/>
and without taking leave or expressing gratitude to my <reg orig="in-|formant">informant</reg>, <lb/>
I ran with frantic expedition towards the river, <lb/>
and plunging into it, gained the opposite side in a moment.</p>
<p>I was sufficiently acquainted with the road. Some twelve <lb/>
or fifteen miles remained to be traversed. I did not fear <lb/>
that my strength would fail in the performance of my <reg orig="jour-|ney">journey</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="204" entity="eaf033v3_0217" pid="uva-lib:349949"/>
It was not my uncle's habitation to which I directed <lb/>
my steps. Inglefield was my friend. If my sister had <reg orig="ex-|istence">existence</reg>, <lb/>
or was snatched from captivity, it was here that an <lb/>
asylum had been afforded to her, and here was I to seek <lb/>
the knowledge of my destiny. For this reason, having <lb/>
reached a spot where the road divided into two branches, <lb/>
one of which led to Inglefield's and the other to Huntly's, <lb/>
I struck into the former.</p>
<p>Scarcely had I passed the angle when I noticed a <reg orig="build-|ing">building</reg>, <lb/>
on the right hand, at some distance from the road. In <lb/>
the present state of my thoughts, it would not have attracted <lb/>
my attention, had not a light gleamed from an upper <reg orig="win-|dow">window</reg>, <lb/>
and told me that all within were not at rest.</p>
<p>I was acquainted with the owner of this mansion. He <lb/>
merited esteem and confidence, and could not fail to be <lb/>
acquainted with recent events. From him I should obtain <lb/>
all the information that I needed, and I should be delivered <lb/>
from some part of the agonies of my suspense. I should <lb/>
reach his door in a few minutes, and the window-light was a <lb/>
proof that my entrance at this hour would not disturb the <lb/>
family, some of whom were stirring.</p>
<p>Through a gate, I entered an avenue of tall oaks, that <lb/>
led to the house. I could not but reflect on the effect <lb/>
which my appearance would produce upon the family. The <lb/>
sleek locks, neat apparel, pacific guise, sobriety and <reg orig="gentle-|ness">gentleness</reg> <lb/>
of aspect by which I was customarily distinguished, <lb/>
would in vain be sought in the apparition which would now <lb/>
present itself before them. My legs, neck, and bosom were <lb/>
bare, and their native hue were exchanged for the livid <lb/>
marks of bruises and scarifications. A horrid scar upon <lb/>
my cheek, and my uncombed locks; hollow eyes, made <lb/>
ghastly by abstinence and cold, and the ruthless passions of <lb/>
which my mind had been the theatre, added to the musket <lb/>
which I carried in my hand, would prepossess them with <lb/>
the notion of a maniac or ruffian.</p>
<p>Some inconveniences might hence arise, which, however, <lb/>
could not be avoided. I must trust to the speed with which <lb/>
my voice and my words should disclose my true character, <lb/>
and rectify their mistake.</p>
<p>I now reached the principal door of the house. It was <lb/>
open, and I unceremoniously entered. In the midst of the <lb/>
<pb n="205" entity="eaf033v3_0218" pid="uva-lib:349950"/>
room stood a German stove, well heated. To thaw my <lb/>
half frozen limbs was my first care. Meanwhile, I gazed <lb/>
around me, and marked the appearances of things.</p>
<p>Two lighted candles stood upon the table. Beside them <lb/>
were cider-bottles and pipes of tobacco. The furniture <lb/>
and room was in that state which denoted it to have been <lb/>
lately filled with drinkers and smokers, yet neither voice, <lb/>
nor visage, nor motion were any where observable. I <reg orig="lis-|tened">listened</reg> <lb/>
but neither above nor below, within or without, could <lb/>
any tokens of a human being be perceived.</p>
<p>This vacancy and silence must have been lately preceded <lb/>
by noise, and concourse, and bustle. The contrast was <reg orig="mys-|terious">mysterious</reg> <lb/>
and ambiguous. No adequate cause of so quick and <lb/>
absolute a transition occurred to me. Having gained some <lb/>
warmth and lingered some ten or twenty minutes in this <reg orig="un-|certainty">uncertainty</reg>, <lb/>
I determined to explore the other apartments of <lb/>
the building. I knew not what might betide in my absence, <lb/>
or what I might encounter in my search to justify precaution, <lb/>
and, therefore, kept the gun in my hand. I snatched a <reg orig="can-|dle">candle</reg> <lb/>
from the table and proceeded into two other apartments <lb/>
on the first floor and the kitchen. Neither was inhabited, <lb/>
though chairs and tables were arranged in their usual order, <lb/>
and no traces of violence or hurry were apparent.</p>
<p>Having gained the foot of the staircase, I knocked, but <lb/>
my knocking was wholly disregarded. A light had <reg orig="appear-|ed">appeared</reg> <lb/>
in an upper chamber. It was not, indeed, in one of <lb/>
those apartments which the family permanently occupied, <lb/>
but in that which, according to rural custom, was reserved <lb/>
for guests; but it indubitably betokened the presence of <lb/>
some being by whom my doubts might be solved. These <lb/>
doubts were too tormenting to allow of scruples and delay. <lb/>
&mdash;I mounted the stairs.</p>
<p>At each chamber door I knocked, but I knocked in vain. <lb/>
I tried to open, but found them to be locked. I at length <lb/>
reached the entrance of that in which a light had been <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg>. <lb/>
Here, it was certain, that some one would be found; <lb/>
but here, as well as elsewhere, my knocking was unnoticed.</p>
<p>To enter this chamber was audacious, but no other <reg orig="expe-|dient">expedient</reg> <lb/>
was afforded me to determine whether the house had <lb/>
any inhabitants. I therefore entered, though with caution <lb/>
and reluctance. No one was within, but there were <reg orig="suffi-|cient">sufficient</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="eaf033v3_0219" pid="uva-lib:349951"/>
traces of some person who had lately been here. On <lb/>
the table stood a travelling escrutoire, open, with pens and <lb/>
inkstand. A chair was placed before it, and a candle on <lb/>
the right hand. This apparatus was rarely seen in this <lb/>
country. Some traveller it seemed occupied this room, <lb/>
though the rest of the mansion was deserted. The prilgrim, <lb/>
as these appearances testified, was of no vulgar order, and <lb/>
belonged not to the class of periodical and every-day guests.</p>
<p>It now occurred to me that the occupant of this <reg orig="apart-|ment">apartment</reg> <lb/>
could not be far off, and that some danger and <reg orig="embar-|rassment">embarrassment</reg> <lb/>
could not fail to accrue from being found, thus <lb/>
accoutred and garbed, in a place sacred to the study and <lb/>
repose of another. It was proper, therefore, to withdraw, <lb/>
and either to resume my journey, or wait for the stranger's <lb/>
return, whom perhaps some temporary engagement had <lb/>
called away, in the lower and public room. The former <lb/>
now appeared to be the best expedient, as the return of this <lb/>
unknown person was uncertain, as well as his power to <reg orig="com-|municate">communicate</reg> <lb/>
the information which I wanted.</p>
<p>Had paper, as well as the implements of writing, lain <lb/>
upon the desk, perhaps my lawless curiosity would not have <lb/>
scrupled to have pryed into it. On the first glance nothing <lb/>
of that kind appeared, but now, as I turned towards the <lb/>
door, somewhat, lying beside the desk, on the side <reg orig="oppo-|site">opposite</reg> <lb/>
the candle, caught my attention. The impulse was <reg orig="in-|stantaneous">instantaneous</reg> <lb/>
and mechanical, that made me leap to the spot, <lb/>
and lay my hand upon it. Till I felt it between my fingers, <lb/>
till I brought it near my eyes and read frequently the <reg orig="in-|scriptions">inscriptions</reg> <lb/>
that appeared upon it, I was doubtful whether my <lb/>
senses had deceived me.</p>
<p>Few, perhaps, among mankind, have undergone <reg orig="vicissi-|tudes">vicissitudes</reg> <lb/>
of peril and wonder equal to mine. The miracles of <lb/>
poetry, the transitions of enchantment, are beggarly and <lb/>
mean compared with those which I had experienced. <reg orig="Pass-|age">Passage</reg> <lb/>
into new forms, overleaping the bars of time and space, <lb/>
reversal of the laws of inanimate and intelligent existence <lb/>
had been mine to perform and to witness.</p>
<p>No event had been more fertile of sorrow and perplexity <lb/>
than the loss of thy brother's letters. They went by means <lb/>
invisible, and disappeared at a moment when foresight would <lb/>
have least predicted their disappearance. They now placed <lb/>
<pb n="207" entity="eaf033v3_0220" pid="uva-lib:349952"/>
themselves before me, in a manner equally abrupt, in a place <lb/>
and by means, no less contrary to expectation. The papers <lb/>
which I now seized were those letters. The parchment <lb/>
cover, the string that tied, and the wax that sealed them, <lb/>
appeared not to have been opened or violated.</p>
<p>The power that removed them from my cabinet, and <lb/>
dropped them in this house, a house which I rarely visited, <lb/>
which I had not entered during the last year, with whose <lb/>
inhabitants I maintained no cordial intercourse, and to whom <lb/>
my occupations and amusements, my joys and my sorrows, <lb/>
were unknown, was no object even of conjecture. But <lb/>
they were not possessed by any of the family. Some <reg orig="stran-|ger">stranger</reg> <lb/>
was here, by whom they had been stolen, or into whose <lb/>
possession, they had, by some incomprehensible chance, <lb/>
fallen.</p>
<p>That stranger was near. He had left this apartment for <lb/>
a moment. He would speedily return. To go hence, <lb/>
might possibly occasion me to miss him. Here then I would <lb/>
wait, till he should grant me an interview. The papers <lb/>
were mine, and were recovered. I would never part with <lb/>
them. But to know by whose force or by whose stratagems <lb/>
I had been bereaved of them thus long, was now the <reg orig="su-|preme">supreme</reg> <lb/>
passion of my soul, I seated myself near a table and <lb/>
anxiously awaited for an interview, on which I was <reg orig="irresisti-|bly">irresistibly</reg> <lb/>
persuaded to believe that much of my happiness <reg orig="de-|pended">depended</reg>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I could not but connect this incident with the <lb/>
destruction of my family. The loss of these papers had <lb/>
excited transports of grief, and yet, to have lost them thus, <lb/>
was perhaps the sole expedient, by which their final <reg orig="preser-|vation">preservation</reg> <lb/>
could be rendered possible. Had they remained in <lb/>
my cabinet, they could not have escaped the destiny which <lb/>
overtook the house and its furniture. Savages are not <lb/>
accustomed to leave their exterminating work unfinished. <lb/>
The house which they have plundered, they are careful to <lb/>
level with the ground. This not only their revenge, but their <lb/>
caution prescribes. Fire may originate by accident as well <lb/>
as by design, and the traces of pillage and murder are <lb/>
totally obliterated by the flames.</p>
<p>These thoughts were interrupted by the shutting of a <lb/>
door below, and by footsteps ascending the stairs. My <lb/>
<pb n="208" entity="eaf033v3_0221" pid="uva-lib:349953"/>
heart throbbed at the sound. My seat became uneasy and <lb/>
I started on my feet. I even advanced half way to the <reg orig="en-|trance">entrance</reg> <lb/>
of the room. My eyes were intensely fixed upon <lb/>
the door. My impatience would have made me guess at <lb/>
the person of this visitant by measuring his shadow, if his <lb/>
shadow were first seen; but this was precluded by the <lb/>
position of the light. It was only when the figure entered, <lb/>
and the whole person was seen, that my curiosity was <reg orig="grati-|fied">gratified</reg>. <lb/>
He who stood before me was the parent and fosterer <lb/>
of my mind, the companion and instructer of my youth, <lb/>
from whom I had been parted for years; from whom I <reg orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg> <lb/>
myself to be forever separated;&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Sarsefield</hi> himself!</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">My</hi> deportment, at an interview so much desired and so <lb/>

with emotion which, had it not found passage at my eyes, <lb/>

if I were an apparition or impostor. He quickly <reg orig="disen-|gaged">disengaged</reg> <lb/>
himself from my arms, and withdrawing a few paces, <lb/>
gazed upon me as on one whom he had never before seen.</p>
<p>These repulses were ascribed to the loss of his affection. <lb/>
I was not mindful of the hideous guise in which I stood <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
him, and by which he might justly be misled to imagine <lb/>
me a ruffian or a lunatic. My tears flowed now on a new <lb/>
account, and I articulated in a broken and faint voice&mdash;My <lb/>
<pb n="209" entity="eaf033v3_0222" pid="uva-lib:349954"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">19</fw></pb>
master! my friend! Have you forgotten! have you ceased <lb/>
to love me?</p>
<p>The sound of my voice made him start and exclaim&mdash;Am <lb/>
I alive? am I awake? Speak again, I beseech you, and <lb/>
convince me that I am not dreaming or delirious.</p>
<p>Can you need any proof, I answered, that it is Edgar <lb/>
Huntly, your pupil, your child that speaks to you?</p>
<p>He now withdrew his eyes from me and fixed them on <lb/>
the floor. After a pause he resumed, in emphatic accents. <lb/>
Well, I have lived to this age in unbelief. To credit or trust <lb/>
in miraculous agency was foreign to my nature, but now I <lb/>
am no longer sceptical. Call me to any bar, and exact <lb/>
from me an oath that you have twice been dead and twice <lb/>
recalled to life; that you move about invisibly, and change <lb/>
your place by the force, not of muscles, but of thought, and <lb/>
I will give it.</p>
<p>How came you hither? Did you penetrate the wall? <lb/>
Did you rise through the floor?</p>
<p>Yet surely 'tis an error. You could not be he whom <lb/>
twenty witnesses affirmed to have beheld a lifeless and <reg orig="man-|gled">mangled</reg> <lb/>
corpse upon the ground, whom my own eyes saw in <lb/>
that condition.</p>
<p>In seeking the spot once more to provide you a grave, <lb/>
you had vanished. Again I met you. You plunged into <lb/>
a rapid stream, from a height from which it was <reg orig="impos-|sible">impossible</reg> <lb/>
to fall and to live; yet, as if to set the limits of nature <lb/>
at defiance; to sport with human penetration, you rose upon <lb/>
the surface; you floated; you swam; thirty bullets were <lb/>
aimed at your head, by marksmen celebrated for the <reg orig="exact-|ness">exactness</reg> <lb/>
of their sight. I myself was of the number, and I never <lb/>
missed what I desired to hit.</p>
<p>My predictions were confirmed by the event. You ceased <lb/>
to struggle; you sunk to rise no more, and yet after these <lb/>
accumulated deaths, you light upon this floor; so far distant <lb/>
from the scene of your catastrophe; over spaces only to be <lb/>
passed, in so short a time as has since elapsed, by those who <lb/>
have wings.</p>
<p>My eyes, my ears bear testimony to your existence now, <lb/>
as they formerly convinced me of your death. What am I <lb/>
to think; what proofs am I to credit?&mdash;There he stopped.</p>
<pb n="210" entity="eaf033v3_0223" pid="uva-lib:349955"/>
<p>Every accent of this speech added to the confusion of my <lb/>
thoughts. The allusions that my friend had made were not <lb/>
unintelligible. I gained a glimpse of the complicated errors <lb/>
by which we had been mutually deceived. I had fainted <lb/>
on the area before Deb's hut. I was found by Sarsefield in <lb/>
this condition, and imagined to be dead.</p>
<p>The man whom I had seen upon the promontory was not <lb/>
an Indian. He belonged to a numerous band of pursuers, <lb/>
whom my hostile and precipitate deportment caused to <reg orig="sus-|pect">suspect</reg> <lb/>
me for an enemy. They that fired from the steep <lb/>
were friends. The interposition that screened me from so <lb/>
many bullets, was indeed miraculous. No wonder that my <lb/>
voluntary sinking, in order to elude their shots, was mistaken <lb/>
for death, and that, having accomplished the destruction of <lb/>
this foe, they resumed their pursuit of others. But how was <lb/>
Sarsefield apprized that it was I who plunged into the river? <lb/>
No subsequent event was possible to impart to him the <lb/>
incredible truth.</p>
<p>A pause of mutual silence ensued. At length, Sarsefield <lb/>
renewed his expressions of amazement at this interview, and <lb/>
besought me to explain why I had disappeared by night from <lb/>
my uncle's house, and by what series of unheard of events <lb/>
this interview was brought about. Was it indeed Huntly <lb/>
whom he examined and mourned over at the threshold of <lb/>
Deb's hut? Whom he had sought in every thicket and cave <lb/>
in the ample circuit of Norwalk and Chetasco? Whom he <lb/>
had seen perish in the current of the Delaware?</p>
<p>Instead of noticing his questions, my soul was harrowed <lb/>
with anxiety respecting the fate of my uncle and sisters. <lb/>
Sarsefield could communicate the tidings which would <reg orig="de-|cide">decide</reg> <lb/>
on my future lot, and set my portion in happiness or <lb/>
misery. Yet I had not breath to speak my inquiries. Hope <lb/>
tottered, and I felt as if a single word would be sufficient <lb/>
for its utter subversion. At length I articulated the name <lb/>
of my uncle.</p>
<p>The single word sufficiently imparted my fears, and these <lb/>
fears needed no verbal confirmation. At that dear name, <lb/>
my companion's features were overspread by sorrow.&mdash;Your <lb/>
uncle, said he, is dead.</p>
<p>Dead? Merciful Heaven! And my sisters too! Both?</p>
<p>Your sisters are alive and well.</p>
<pb n="211" entity="eaf033v3_0224" pid="uva-lib:349956"/>
<p>Nay, resumed I, in faltering accents, jest not with my <lb/>
feelings. Be not cruel in your pity. Tell me the truth.</p>
<p>I have said the truth. They are well, at Mr. Inglefield's.</p>
<p>My wishes were eager to assent to the truth of these <lb/>
tidings. The better part of me was then safe; but how <lb/>
did they escape the fate that overtook my uncle? How <lb/>
did they evade the destroying hatchet and the midnight <reg orig="con-|flagration">conflagration</reg>? <lb/>
These doubts were imparted in a tumultuous <lb/>
and obscure manner to my friend. He no sooner fully <lb/>
comprehended them, than he looked at me, with some <reg orig="in-|quietude">inquietude</reg> <lb/>
and surprise.</p>
<p>Huntly, said he, are you mad&mdash;what has filled you <lb/>
with these hideous prepossessions? Much havoc has indeed <lb/>
been committed in Chetasco and the wilderness; and a log <lb/>
hut has been burnt by design or by accident in Solebury, <lb/>
but that is all. Your house has not been assailed by either <lb/>
fire-brand or tomahawk. Every thing is safe and in its <reg orig="an-|cient">ancient</reg> <lb/>
order. The master indeed is gone, but the old man <lb/>
fell a victim to his own temerity and hardihood. It is thirty <lb/>
years since he retired with three wounds, from the field of <lb/>
Braddock; but time, in no degree, abated his adventurous <lb/>
and military spirit. On the first alarm, he summoned his <lb/>
neighbors, and led them in pursuit of the invaders. Alas! <lb/>
he was the first to attack them, and the only one who fell <lb/>
in the contest.</p>
<p>These words were uttered in a manner that left me no <lb/>
room to doubt of their truth. My uncle had already been <reg orig="la-|mented">lamented</reg>, <lb/>
and the discovery of the nature of his death, so <lb/>
contrary to my forebodings, and of the safety of my girls, <lb/>
made the state of my mind partake more of exultation and <lb/>
joy, than of grief or regret.</p>
<p>But how was I deceived? Had not my fusil been found <lb/>
in the hands of an enemy? Whence could he have <reg orig="plunder-|ed">plundered</reg> <lb/>
it but from my own chamber? It hung against the wall <lb/>
of a closet; from which no stranger could have taken it <reg orig="ex-|cept">except</reg> <lb/>
by violence. My perplexities and doubts were not at <lb/>
an end, but those which constituted my chief torment were <lb/>
removed. I listened to my friend's entreaties to tell him the <lb/>
cause of my elopement, and the incidents that terminated in <lb/>
the present interview.</p>
<p>I began with relating my return to consciousness in the <lb/>
<pb n="212" entity="eaf033v3_0225" pid="uva-lib:349957"/>
bottom of the pit; my efforts to free myself from this <reg orig="ab-|horred">abhorred</reg> <lb/>
prison; the acts of horror to which I was impelled <lb/>
by famine, and their excruciating consequences; my <reg orig="gain-|ing">gaining</reg> <lb/>
the outlet of the cavern, the desperate expedient by <lb/>
which I removed the impediment to my escape, and the <lb/>
deliverance of the captive girl; the contest I maintained <lb/>
before Deb's hut; my subsequent wanderings; the banquet <lb/>
which hospitality afforded me; my journey to the river <lb/>
bank; my meditations on the means of reaching the road; <lb/>
my motives for hazarding my life, by plunging into the <lb/>
stream; and my subsequent perils and fears till I reached the <lb/>
threshold of this habitation.</p>
<p>Thus, continued I, I have complied with your request. <lb/>
I have told all that I, myself, know. What were the <reg orig="inci-|dents">incidents</reg> <lb/>
between my sinking to rest at my uncle's, and my <lb/>
awaking in the chambers of the hill; by what means and <lb/>
by whose contrivance, preternatural or human, this <reg orig="transi-|tion">transition</reg> <lb/>
was effected, I am unable to explain; I cannot even <lb/>
guess.</p>
<p>What has eluded my sagacity may not be beyond the <lb/>
reach of another. Your own reflections on my tale, or <lb/>
some facts that have fallen under your notice, may enable <lb/>
you to furnish a solution. But, meanwhile, how am I to <lb/>
account for your appearance on this spot? This meeting <lb/>
was unexpected and abrupt to you, but it has not been less <lb/>
so to me. Of all mankind, Sarsefield was the farthest <lb/>
from my thoughts, when I saw these tokens of a traveller <lb/>
and a stranger.</p>
<p>You were imperfectly acquainted with my wanderings. <lb/>
You saw me on the ground before Deb's hut. You saw me <lb/>
plunge into the river. You endeavored to destroy me <lb/>
while swimming; and you knew, before my narrative <lb/>
was heard, that Huntly was the object of your enmity. <lb/>
What was the motive of your search in the desert, and <lb/>
how were you apprized of my condition? These things <lb/>
are not less wonderful than any of those which I have <lb/>
already related.</p>
<p>During my tale the features of Sarsefield betokened the <lb/>
deepest attention. His eye strayed not a moment from <lb/>
my face. All my perils and forebodings, were fresh in my <lb/>
remembrance, they had scarcely gone by; their skirts, so <lb/>
<pb n="213" entity="eaf033v3_0226" pid="uva-lib:349958"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">19*</fw></pb>
to speak, were still visible. No wonder that my eloquence <lb/>
was vivid and pathetic, that I portrayed the past as if it <lb/>
were the present scene; and that not my tongue only, but <lb/>
every muscle and limb, spoke.</p>
<p>When I had finished my relation, Sarsefield sunk into <lb/>
thoughtfulness. From this, after a time, he recovered and <lb/>
said; your tale, Huntly, is true; yet did I not see you <reg orig="be-|fore">before</reg> <lb/>
me, were I not acquainted with the artlessness and <reg orig="rec-|titude">rectitude</reg> <lb/>
of your character, and, above all, had not my own <lb/>
experience, during the last three days, confirmed every <reg orig="inci-|dent">incident</reg>, <lb/>
I should question its truth. You have amply gratified <lb/>
my curiosity, and deserve that your own should be gratified <lb/>
as fully. Listen to me.</p>
<p>Much has happened since we parted, which shall not be <lb/>
now mentioned. I promised to inform you of my welfare <lb/>
by letter, and did not fail to write, but whether my letters <lb/>
were received, or any were written by you in return, or if <lb/>
written were ever transmitted, I cannot tell; none were ever <lb/>
received.</p>
<p>Some days since, I arrived, in company with a lady who <lb/>
is my wife, in America. You have never been forgotten by <lb/>
me. I knew your situation to be little in agreement with <lb/>
your wishes, and one of the benefits which fortune has <reg orig="late-|ly">lately</reg> <lb/>
conferred upon me, is the power of snatching you from <lb/>
a life of labor and obscurity; whose goods, scanty as they <lb/>
are, were transient and precarious; and affording you the <lb/>
suitable leisure and means of intellectual gratification and <lb/>
improvement.</p>
<p>Your silence made me entertain some doubts concerning <lb/>
your welfare, and even your existence. To solve these <lb/>
doubts, I hastened to Solebury; some delays upon the road, <lb/>
hindered me from accomplishing my journey by daylight. <lb/>
It was night before I entered the Norwalk path, but my <reg orig="an-|cient">ancient</reg> <lb/>
rambles with you made me familiar with it, and I was <lb/>
not afraid of being obstructed or bewildered.</p>
<p>Just as I gained the southern outlet, I spied a passenger <lb/>
on foot, coming towards me with a quick pace. The <reg orig="inci-|dent">incident</reg> <lb/>
was of no moment, and yet the time of night, the <reg orig="seem-|ing">seeming</reg> <lb/>
expedition of the walker, recollection of the mazes and <lb/>
obstacles which he was going to encounter, and a vague <lb/>
<pb n="214" entity="eaf033v3_0227" pid="uva-lib:349959"/>
conjecture that, perhaps, he was unacquainted with the <reg orig="dif-|ficulties">difficulties</reg> <lb/>
that awaited him, made me eye him with attention <lb/>
as he passed.</p>
<p>He came near, and I thought I recognised a friend in this <lb/>
traveller. The form, the gesture, the stature bore a <reg orig="pow-|erful">powerful</reg> <lb/>
resemblance to those of Edgar Huntly. This <reg orig="resem-|blance">resemblance</reg> <lb/>
was so strong, that I stopped, and after he had gone <lb/>
by, called him by your name. That no notice was taken <lb/>
of my call proved that the person was mistaken, but even <lb/>
though it were another, that he should not even hesitate or <lb/>
turn at a summons which he could not but perceive to be <lb/>
addressed, though erroneously, to him, was the source of <lb/>
some surprise. I did not repeat my call, but proceeded on <lb/>
my way.</p>
<p>All had retired to repose in your uncle's dwelling. I did <lb/>
not scruple to rouse them, and was received with <reg orig="affection-|ate">affectionate</reg> <lb/>
and joyous greetings. That you allowed your uncle to <lb/>
rise before you, was a new topic of reflection. To my <reg orig="in-|quiries">inquiries</reg> <lb/>
concerning you, answers were made that accorded <lb/>
with my wishes. I was told that you were in good health <lb/>
and were then in bed. That you had not heard and risen at <lb/>
my knocking, was mentioned with surprise, but your uncle <lb/>
accounted for your indolence by saying that during the last <lb/>
week you had fatigued yourself by rambling night and day, <lb/>
in search of some maniac, or visionary who was supposed to <lb/>
have retreated into Norwalk.</p>
<p>I insisted upon awakening you myself. I anticipated the <lb/>
effect of this sudden and unlooked for meeting, with some <lb/>
emotions of pride as well as of pleasure. To find, in <reg orig="open-|ing">opening</reg> <lb/>
your eyes, your old preceptor standing by your bedside <lb/>
and gazing in your face, would place you, I conceived, in an <lb/>
affecting situation.</p>
<p>Your chamber door was open, but your bed was empty. <lb/>
Your uncle and sisters were made acquainted with this <reg orig="cir-|cumstance">circumstance</reg>. <lb/>
Their surprise gave way to conjectures that <lb/>
your restless and romantic spirit, had tempted you from your <lb/>
repose, that you had rambled abroad on some phantastic <lb/>
errand, and would probably return before the dawn. I <lb/>
willingly acquiesced in this opinion, and my feelings being <lb/>
too thoroughly aroused to allow me to sleep, I took <reg orig="posses-|sion">possession</reg> <lb/>
of your chamber, and patiently awaited your return.</p>
<pb n="215" entity="eaf033v3_0228" pid="uva-lib:349960"/>
<p>The morning returned, but Huntly made not his <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg>. <lb/>
Your uncle became somewhat uneasy at this <reg orig="unsea-|sonable">unseasonable</reg> <lb/>
absence. Much speculation and inquiry, as to the <lb/>
possible reasons of your flight was made. In my survey of <lb/>
your chamber, I noted that only part of your clothing <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
beside your bed. Coat, hat, stockings and shoes <lb/>
lay upon the spot where they had probably been thrown <lb/>
when you had disrobed yourself, but the pantaloons, which <lb/>
according to Mr. Huntly's report, completed your dress, <lb/>
were no where to be found. That you should go forth on <lb/>
so cold a night so slenderly apparelled, was almost incredible. <lb/>
Your reason or your senses had deserted you, before so rash <lb/>
an action could be meditated.</p>
<p>I now remembered the person I had met in Norwalk. <lb/>
His resemblance to your figure, his garb, which wanted hat, <lb/>
coat, stockings and shoes, and your absence from your bed <lb/>
at that hour, were remarkable coincidences; but why did <lb/>
you disregard my call? Your name, uttered by a voice that <lb/>
could not be unknown, was surely sufficient to arrest your <lb/>
steps.</p>
<p>Each hour added to the impatience of your friends; to <lb/>
their recollections and conjectures, I listened with a view to <lb/>
extract from them some solution of this mystery. At length, <lb/>
a story was alluded to, of some one who, on the preceding <lb/>
night, had been heard walking in the long room; to this was <lb/>
added, the tale of your anxieties and wonders occasioned <lb/>
by the loss of certain manuscripts.</p>
<p>While ruminating upon these incidents, and endeavoring <lb/>
to extract from this intelligence a clue, explanatory of your <lb/>
present situation, a single word, casually dropped by your <lb/>
uncle, instantly illuminated my darkness and dispelled my <lb/>
doubts.&mdash;After all, said the old man, ten to one, but Edgar <lb/>
himself was the man whom we heard walking, but the lad <lb/>
was asleep, and knew not what he was about.</p>
<p>Surely said I, this inference is just. His manuscripts <lb/>
could not be removed by any hands but his own, since the <lb/>
rest of mankind were unacquainted not only with the place <lb/>
of their concealment, but with their existence. None but <lb/>
a man, insane or asleep, would wander forth so slightly <lb/>
dressed, and none but a sleeper would have diregarded my <lb/>
calls. This conclusion was generally adopted, but it gave <lb/>
<pb n="216" entity="eaf033v3_0229" pid="uva-lib:349961"/>
birth in my mind, to infinite inquietudes. You had roved <lb/>
into Norwalk, a scene of inequalities, of prominences and <lb/>
pits, among which, thus destitute of the guidance of your <lb/>
senses, you could scarcely fail to be destroyed, or at least, <lb/>
irretrievably bewildered. I painted to myself the dangers <lb/>
to which you were subjected. Your careless feet would <lb/>
bear you into some whirlpool or to the edge of some <reg orig="preci-|pice">precipice</reg>, <lb/>
some internal revolution or outward shock would <lb/>
recall you to consciousness at some perilous moment. <lb/>
Surprise and fear would disable you from taking seasonable <lb/>
or suitable precautions, and your destruction be made sure.</p>
<p>The lapse of every new hour, without bringing tidings of <lb/>
your state, enhanced these fears. At length, the propriety <lb/>
of searching for you occurred; Mr. Huntly and I <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg> <lb/>
to set out upon this pursuit, as well as to commission <lb/>
others. A plan was laid by which every accessible part of <lb/>
Norwalk, the wilderness beyond the flats of Solebury, and <lb/>
the valley of Chetasco, should be traversed and explored.</p>
<p>Scarcely had we equipped ourselves for this expedition, <lb/>
when a messenger arrived, who brought the disastrous news <lb/>
of Indians being seen within these precincts, and on the <lb/>
last night a farmer was shot in his fields, a dwelling in <reg orig="Che-|tasco">Chetasco</reg> <lb/>
was burnt to the ground, and its inhabitants murdered <lb/>
or made captives. Rumor and inquiry had been busy, and <lb/>
a plausible conjecture had been formed, as to the course <lb/>
and number of the enemies. They were said to be divided <lb/>
into bands, and to amount in the whole to thirty or forty <lb/>
warriors. This messenger had come to warn us of danger <lb/>
which might impend, and to summon us to join in the <reg orig="pur-|suit">pursuit</reg> <lb/>
and extirpation of these detestable foes.</p>
<p>Your uncle, whose alacrity and vigor age had not abated, <lb/>
eagerly engaged in this scheme. I was not averse to <reg orig="con-|tribute">contribute</reg> <lb/>
my efforts to an end like this. The road which we <lb/>
had previously designed to take, in search of my fugitive <lb/>
pupil, was the same by which we must trace or intercept <lb/>
the retreat of the savages. Thus two purposes, equally <lb/>
momentous, would be answered by the same means.</p>
<p>Mr. Huntly armed himself with your fusil; Inglefield <lb/>
supplied me with a gun; during our absence the dwelling <lb/>
was closed and locked, and your sisters placed under the <lb/>
protection of Inglefield, whose age and pacific sentiments <lb/>
<pb n="217" entity="eaf033v3_0230" pid="uva-lib:349962"/>
unfitted him for arduous and sanguinary enterprises. A <lb/>
troop of rustics was collected, half of whom remained to <lb/>
traverse Solebury, and the other, whom Mr. Huntly and I <lb/>
accompanied, hastened to Chetasco.</p>
<ornament type="line"/>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="XXIV" id="d30">
<head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> was noonday before we reached the theatre of action. <lb/>
Fear and revenge combined to make the people of Chetasco <lb/>
diligent and zealous in their own defence. The havoc <reg orig="al-|ready">already</reg> <lb/>
committed had been mournful. To prevent a <reg orig="repe-|tition">repetition</reg> <lb/>
of the same calamities, they resolved to hunt out <lb/>
the hostile footsteps and exact a merciless retribution.</p>
<p>It was likely that the enemy, on the approach of day, <lb/>
had withdrawn from the valley and concealed themselves in <lb/>
the thickets, between the parallel ridges of the mountain. <lb/>
This space, which, according to the object with which it is <lb/>
compared is either a vale or the top of a hill, was obscure <lb/>
and desolate. It was undoubtedly the avenue by which the <lb/>
robbers had issued forth, and by which they would escape <lb/>
to the Ohio. Here they might still remain, intending to <lb/>
emerge from their concealment on the next night, and <reg orig="per-|petrate">perpetrate</reg> <lb/>
new horrors.</p>
<p>A certain distribution was made of our number, so as to <lb/>
move in all directions at the same time. I will not dwell <lb/>
upon particulars. It will suffice to say that keen eyes and <lb/>
indefatigable feet, brought us at last to the presence of the <lb/>
largest number of these marauders. Seven of them were <lb/>
slain by the edge of a brook, where they sat wholly <reg orig="un-|conscious">unconscious</reg> <lb/>
of the danger which hung over them. Five <reg orig="es-|caped">escaped</reg>, <lb/>
and one of these secured his retreat by wresting <lb/>
your fusil from your uncle, and shooting him dead. <reg orig="Be-|fore">Before</reg> <lb/>
our companion could be rescued or revenged, the <reg orig="as-|sassin">assassin</reg>, <lb/>
with the remnant of the troop, disappeared, and bore <lb/>
away with him the fusil as a trophy of his victory.</p>
<p>This disaster was deplored, not only on account of that <lb/>
life which had thus been sacrificed, but because a sagacious <lb/>
guide and intrepid leader was lost. His acquaintance with <lb/>
<pb n="218" entity="eaf033v3_0231" pid="uva-lib:349963"/>
the habits of the Indians, and his experience in their wars <lb/>
made him trace their footsteps with more certainty than any <lb/>
of his associates.</p>
<p>The pursuit was still continued, and parties were so <lb/>
stationed that the escape of the enemy was difficult, if not <lb/>
impossible. Our search was unremitted, but during twelve <lb/>
or fourteen hours, unsuccessful. Queen Mab did not elude <lb/>
all suspicion. Her hut was visited by different parties, but <lb/>
the old woman and her dogs had disappeared.</p>
<p>Meanwhile your situation was not forgotten. Every one <lb/>
was charged to explore your footsteps as well as those of <lb/>
the savages, but this search was no less unsuccessful than <lb/>
the former. None had heard of you or seen you.</p>
<p>This continued till midnight. Three of us made a pause <lb/>
at a brook, and intended to repair our fatigues by a respite <lb/>
of a few hours, but scarcely had we stretched ourselves on <lb/>
the ground when we were alarmed by a shot which seemed <lb/>
to have been fired at a short distance. We started on our <lb/>
feet and consulted with each other on the measures to be <lb/>
taken. A second, a third and a fourth shot, from the same <lb/>
quarter, excited our attention anew. Mab's hut was known <lb/>
to stand at the distance and in the direction of this sound, <lb/>
and hither we resolved to repair.</p>
<p>This was done with speed but with the utmost <reg orig="circum-|spection">circumspection</reg>. <lb/>
We shortly gained the road that leads near this <lb/>
hut and at length gained a view of the building. Many <lb/>
persons were discovered, in a sort of bustling inactivity, <lb/>
before the hut. They were easily distinguished to be <lb/>
friends, and were therefore approached without scruple.</p>
<p>The objects that presented themselves to a nearer view, <lb/>
were five bodies stretched upon the ground. Three of <lb/>
them were savages. The fourth was a girl, who though <lb/>
alive seemed to have received a mortal wound. The fifth, <lb/>
breathless and mangled and his features almost concealed <lb/>
by the blood that overspread his face, was Edgar; the <lb/>
fugitive for whom I had made such anxious search.</p>
<p>About the same hour on the last night I had met you <lb/>
hastening into Norwalk. Now were you, lying in the <lb/>
midst of savages, at the distance of thirty miles from your <lb/>
home, and in a spot, which it was impossible for you to <lb/>
have reached unless by an immense circuit over rocks and <lb/>
<pb n="219" entity="eaf033v3_0232" pid="uva-lib:349964"/>
thickets. That you had found a rift at the basis of a hill, <lb/>
and thus penetrated its solidities, and thus precluded so <lb/>
tedious and circuitous a journey as must otherwise have <lb/>
been made, was not to be imagined.</p>
<p>But whence arose this scene? It was obvious to <reg orig="con-|clude">conclude</reg> <lb/>
that my associates had surprised their enemies in this <lb/>
house, and exacted from them the forfeit of their crimes, <lb/>
but how you should have been confounded with their foes, <lb/>
or whence came the wounded girl was a subject of <reg orig="as-|tonishment">astonishment</reg>.</p>
<p>You will judge how much this surprise was augmented <lb/>
when I was informed that the party whom we found had been <lb/>
attracted hither by the same signals, by which we had been <lb/>
alarmed. That on reaching this spot you had been <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg>, <lb/>
alive, seated on the ground and still sustaining the <lb/>
gun with which you had apparently completed the <reg orig="destruc-|tion">destruction</reg> <lb/>
of so many adversaries. In a moment after their <lb/>
arrival you sunk down and expired.</p>
<p>This scene was attended with inexplicable circumstances. <lb/>
The musket which lay beside you appeared to have belonged <lb/>
to one of the savages. The wound by which each had died <lb/>
was single. Of the four shots we had distinguished at a <lb/>
distance, three of them were therefore fatal to the Indians <lb/>
and the fourth was doubtless that by which you had fallen, <lb/>
yet three muskets only were discoverable.</p>
<p>The arms were collected, and the girl carried to the <lb/>
nearest house in the arms of her father. Her situation was <lb/>
deemed capable of remedy, and the sorrow and wonder <lb/>
which I felt at your untimely and extraordinary fate, did not <lb/>
hinder me from endeavoring to restore the health of this <reg orig="un-|fortunate">unfortunate</reg> <lb/>
victim. I reflected likewise that some light might <lb/>
be thrown upon transactions so mysterious, by the <reg orig="informa-|tion">information</reg> <lb/>
which might be collected from her story. Numberless <lb/>
questions and hints were necessary to extract from her a <lb/>
consistent or intelligible tale. She had been dragged, it <lb/>
seems, for miles, at the heels of her conquerors, who at <lb/>
length, stopped in a cavern for the sake of some repose; all <lb/>
slept but one, who sat and watched. Something called him <lb/>
away, and, at the same moment, you appeared at the bottom <lb/>
of the cave half naked and without arms. You instantly <lb/>
supplied the last deficiency, by seizing the gun and <reg orig="toma-|hawk">tomahawk</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="220" entity="eaf033v3_0233" pid="uva-lib:349965"/>
of him who had gone forth, and who had negligently <lb/>
left his weapons behind. Then stepping over the bodies of <lb/>
the sleepers, you rushed out of the cavern.</p>
<p>She then mentioned your unexpected return, her <reg orig="de-|liverance">deliverance</reg> <lb/>
and flight, and arrival at Deb's hut. You watched <lb/>
upon the hearth and she fell asleep upon the blanket. From <lb/>
this sleep she was aroused by violent and cruel blows. She <lb/>
looked up;&mdash;you were gone and the bed on which she lay <lb/>
was surrounded by the men from whom she had so lately <lb/>
escaped. One dragged her out of the hut and levelled his <lb/>
gun at her breast. At the moment when he touched the <lb/>
trigger, a shot came from an unknown quarter, and he fell <lb/>
at her feet. Of subsequent events she had an incoherent <lb/>
recollection. The Indians were successively slain, and you <lb/>
came to her, and interrogated and consoled her.</p>
<p>In your journey to the hut you were armed. This in <lb/>
some degree accounted for appearances, but where were <lb/>
your arms? Three muskets only were discovered and these <lb/>
undoubtedly belonged to your enemies.</p>
<p>I now had leisure to reflect upon your destiny. I had <reg orig="ar-|rived">arrived</reg> <lb/>
soon enough on this shore merely to witness the <reg orig="catas-|trophe">catastrophe</reg> <lb/>
of two beings whom I most loved. Both were <reg orig="over-|taken">overtaken</reg> <lb/>
by the same fate, nearly at the same hour. The <lb/>
same hand had possibly accomplished the destruction of <lb/>
uncle and nephew.</p>
<p>Now, however, I began to entertain a hope that your <lb/>
state might not be irretrievable. You had walked and <lb/>
spoken after the firing had ceased, and your enemies had <lb/>
ceased to contend with you. A wound had, no doubt, been <lb/>
previously received. I had hastily inferred that the wound <lb/>
was mortal, and that life could not be recalled. Occupied <lb/>
with attention to the wailings of the girl, and full of sorrow <lb/>
and perplexity I had admitted an opinion which would have <lb/>
never been adopted in different circumstances. My <reg orig="ac-|quaintance">acquaintance</reg> <lb/>
with wounds would have taught me to regard <lb/>
sunken muscles, lividness and cessation of the pulse as mere <lb/>
indications of a swoon, and not as tokens of death.</p>
<p>Perhaps my error was not irreparable. By hastening <lb/>
to the hut, I might ascertain your condition and at least <lb/>
transport your remains to some dwelling and finally secure <lb/>
to you the decencies of burial.</p>
<pb n="221" entity="eaf033v3_0234" pid="uva-lib:349966"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">20</fw></pb>
<p>Of twelve savages, discovered on the preceding day, ten <lb/>
were now killed. Two at least remained, after whom the <lb/>
pursuit was still zealously maintained. Attention to the <lb/>
wounded girl, had withdrawn me from the party, and I had <lb/>
now leisure to return to the scene of these disasters. The <lb/>
sun had risen, and, accompanied by two others, I repaired <lb/>
thither.</p>
<p>A sharp turn in the road, at the entrance of a field, set <lb/>
before us a startling spectacle. An Indian, mangled by <reg orig="re-|peated">repeated</reg> <lb/>
wounds of bayonet and bullet, was discovered. His <lb/>
musket was stuck in the ground, by way of beacon <reg orig="attract-|ing">attracting</reg> <lb/>
our attention to the spot. Over this space I had gone a <lb/>
few hours before, and nothing like this was then seen. The <lb/>
parties abroad had hied away to a distant quarter. Some <lb/>
invisible power seemed to be enlisted in our defence and to <lb/>
preclude the necessity of our arms.</p>
<p>We proceeded to the hut. The savages were there, but <lb/>
Edgar had risen and flown! Nothing now seemed to be <lb/>
incredible. You had slain three foes, and the weapon with <lb/>
which the victory had been achieved had vanished. You <lb/>
had risen from the dead, had assailed one of the surviving <lb/>
enemies, had employed bullet and dagger in his destruction, <lb/>
with both of which you could only be supplied by <reg orig="super-|natural">supernatural</reg> <lb/>
means, and had disappeared. If any inhabitant of <lb/>
Chetasco had done this, we should have heard of it.</p>
<p>But what remained? You were still alive. Your strength <lb/>
was sufficient to bear you from this spot. Why were you <lb/>
still invisible and to what dangers might you not be exposed, <lb/>
before you could disinvolve yourself from the mazes of this <lb/>
wilderness?</p>
<p>Once more I procured indefatigable search to be made <lb/>
after you. It was continued till the approach of evening, <lb/>
and was fruitless. Inquiries were twice made at the house <lb/>
where you were supplied with food and intelligence. On <lb/>
the second call I was astonished and delighted by the tidings <lb/>
received from the good woman. Your person, and <reg orig="de-|meanor">demeanor</reg>, <lb/>
and arms were described, and mention made of <lb/>
your resolution to cross the southern ridge, and traverse the <lb/>
Solebury road with the utmost expedition.</p>
<pb n="222" entity="eaf033v3_0235" pid="uva-lib:349967"/>
<p>The greater part of my inquietudes were now removed. <lb/>
You were able to eat and to travel, and there was little <lb/>
doubt that a meeting would take place between us on the <lb/>
next morning. Meanwhile, I determined to concur with <lb/>
those who pursued the remainder of the enemy. I followed <lb/>
you, in the path that you were said to have taken, and <lb/>
quickly joined a numerous party who were searching for <lb/>
those who, on the last night, had attacked a plantation that <lb/>
lies near this, and destroyed the inhabitants.</p>
<p>I need not dwell upon our doublings and circuities. The <lb/>
enemy was traced to the house of Selby. They had <reg orig="en-|tered">entered</reg>, <lb/>
they had put fire on the floor, but were compelled to <lb/>
relinquish their prey. Of what number they consisted <lb/>
could not be ascertained, but one, lingering behind his <reg orig="fel-|lows">fellows</reg>, <lb/>
was shot, at the entrance of the wood, and on the spot <lb/>
where you chanced to light upon him.</p>
<p>Selby's house was empty, and before the fire had made <lb/>
any progress we extinguished it. The drunken wretch <lb/>
whom you encountered, had probably returned from his <lb/>
nocturnal debauch, after we had left the spot.</p>
<p>The flying enemy was pursued with fresh diligence. <lb/>
They were found, by various tokens, to have crossed the <lb/>
river, and to have ascended the mountain. We trod closely <lb/>
on their heels. When we arrived at the promontory, <reg orig="de-|scribed">described</reg> <lb/>
by you, the fatigues of the night and day rendered <lb/>
me unqualified to proceed, I determined that this should be <lb/>
the bound of my excursions. I was anxious to obtain an <lb/>
interview with you, and unless I paused here, should not be <lb/>
able to gain Inglefield's as early in the morning as I wished. <lb/>
Two others concurred with me in this resolution and <reg orig="pre-|pared">prepared</reg> <lb/>
to return to this house, which had been deserted by <lb/>
its tenants till the danger was past, and which had been <reg orig="se-|lected">selected</reg> <lb/>
as the place of rendezvous.</p>
<p>At this moment, dejected and weary, I approached the <lb/>
ledge which severed the head-land from the mountain. I <lb/>
marked the appearance of some one stretched upon the <lb/>
ground where you lay. No domestic animal would wander <lb/>
hither and place himself upon this spot. There was <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
likewise in the appearance of the object that bespoke <lb/>
it to be man, but if it were man, it was, incontrovertibly, a <lb/>
<pb n="223" entity="eaf033v3_0236" pid="uva-lib:349968"/>
savage and a foe. I determined therefore to rouse you by <lb/>
a bullet.</p>
<p>My decision was perhaps absurd. I ought to have gained <lb/>
more certainty before I hazarded your destruction. Be that <lb/>
as it will, a moment's lingering on your part would have <lb/>
probably been fatal. You started on your feet, and fired. <lb/>
See the hole which your random shot made through my <lb/>
sleeve! This surely was a day destined to be signalized by <lb/>
hair-breadth escapes.</p>
<p>Your action seemed incontestibly to confirm my <reg orig="prognos-|tics">prognostics</reg>. <lb/>
Every one hurried to the spot and was eager to <reg orig="de-|stroy">destroy</reg> <lb/>
an enemy. No one hesitated to believe that some of <lb/>
the shots aimed at you, had reached their mark, and that <lb/>
you had sunk to rise no more.</p>
<p>The gun which was fired and thrown down was taken <lb/>
and examined. It had been my companion in many a <reg orig="toil-|some">toilsome</reg> <lb/>
expedition. It had rescued me and my friends from <lb/>
a thousand deaths. In order to recognise it, I needed only <lb/>
to touch and handle it. I instantly discovered that I held in <lb/>
my hand the fusil which I had left with you on parting, with <lb/>
which your uncle had equipped himself, and which had <lb/>
been ravished from him by a savage. What was I hence <lb/>
to infer respecting the person of the last possessor?</p>
<p>My inquiries respecting you of the woman whose milk <lb/>
and bread you had eaten, were minute. You entered, she <lb/>
said, with a hatchet and gun in your hand. While you ate, <lb/>
the gun was laid upon the table. She sat near, and the <lb/>
piece became the object of inquisitive attention. The stock <lb/>
and barrels were described by her in such terms as left no <lb/>
doubt that this was the <hi rend="italic">fusil.</hi></p>
<p>A comparison of incidents enabled me to trace the <reg orig="man-|ner">manner</reg> <lb/>
in which you came into possession of this instrument. <lb/>
One of those whom you found in the cavern was the <reg orig="assas-|sin">assassin</reg> <lb/>
of your uncle. According to the girl's report, on issuing <lb/>
from your hiding place, you seized a gun that was <reg orig="unoccu-|pied">unoccupied</reg>, <lb/>
and this gun chanced to be your own.</p>
<p>Its two barrels were probably the cause of your success <lb/>
in that unequal contest at Mab's hut. On recovering from <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">deliquium,</hi> you found it where it had been dropped by you, <lb/>
out of sight and unsuspected by the party that had <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
arrived. In your passage to the river, had it once <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="eaf033v3_0237" pid="uva-lib:349969"/>
more fallen into hostile hands, or, had you missed the way, <lb/>
wandered to this promontory, and mistaken a troop of friends <lb/>
for a band of Indian marauders?</p>
<p>Either supposition was dreadful. The latter was the <lb/>
most plausible. No motives were conceivable by which <lb/>
one of the fugitives could be induced to post himself here, <lb/>
in this conspicuous station; whereas, the road which led <lb/>
you to the summit of the hill, to that spot where descent to <lb/>
the river road was practicable, could not be found but by <lb/>
those who were accustomed to traverse it. The directions <lb/>
which you had exacted from your hostess, proved your <reg orig="pre-|vious">previous</reg> <lb/>
unacquaintance with these tracts.</p>
<p>I acquiesced in this opinion with a heavy and desponding <lb/>
heart. Fate had led us into a maze, which could only <reg orig="ter-|minate">terminate</reg> <lb/>
in the destruction of one or of the other. By the <lb/>
breadth of a hair had I escaped death from your hand. <lb/>
The same fortune had not befriended you. After my <reg orig="te-|dious">tedious</reg> <lb/>
search, I had lighted on you, forlorn, bewildered, <lb/>
perishing with cold and hunger. Instead of recognising <lb/>
and affording you relief, I compelled you to leap into the <lb/>
river, from a perilous height, and had desisted from my <reg orig="per-|secution">persecution</reg> <lb/>
only when I had bereaved you of life, and plunged <lb/>
you to the bottom of the gulf.</p>
<p>My motives in coming to America were numerous and <lb/>
mixed. Among these was the parental affection with which <lb/>
you had inspired me. I came with fortune, and a better <lb/>
gift than fortune in my hand. I intended to bestow both <lb/>
upon you, not only to give you competence, but one who <lb/>
would endear to you that competence, who would enhance, <lb/>
by participating, every gratification.</p>
<p>My schemes were now at an end. You were gone, <reg orig="be-|yond">beyond</reg> <lb/>
the reach of my benevolence and justice. I had <reg orig="rob-|bed">robbed</reg> <lb/>
your two sisters of a friend and guardian. It was some <lb/>
consolation to think that it was in my power to stand, with <lb/>
regard to them, in your place, that I could snatch them from <lb/>
the poverty, dependence, and humiliation, to which your <lb/>
death, and that of your uncle had reduced them.</p>
<p>I was now doubly weary of the enterprise in which I was <lb/>
engaged, and returned with speed, to this rendezvous. My <lb/>
companions have gone to know the state of the family who <lb/>
<pb n="225" entity="eaf033v3_0238" pid="uva-lib:349970"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">20*</fw></pb>
resided under this roof, and left me to beguile the tedious <lb/>
moments in whatever manner I pleased.</p>
<p>I have omitted mentioning one incident that happened <lb/>
between the detection of your flight and our expedition to <lb/>
Chetasco. Having formed a plausible conjecture as to him <lb/>
who walked in the long-room, it was obvious to conclude <lb/>
that he who purloined your manuscripts and the walker <lb/>
was the same personage. It was likewise easily inferred <lb/>
that the letters were secreted in the cedar chest or in some <lb/>
other part of the room. Instances similar to this have <reg orig="here-|tofore">heretofore</reg> <lb/>
occurred. Men have employed anxious months in <lb/>
search of that which, in a freak of noctambulation, was <reg orig="hid-|den">hidden</reg> <lb/>
by their own hands.</p>
<p>A search was immediately commenced, and your letters <lb/>
were found, carefully concealed between the rafters and <lb/>
shingles of the roof, in a spot, where, if suspicion had not <lb/>
been previously excited, they would have remained till the <lb/>
vernal rains and the summer heats, had insensibly destroyed <lb/>
them. This packet I carried with me, knowing the value <lb/>
which you set upon it, and there being no receptacle <lb/>
equally safe, but your own cabinet, which was locked.</p>
<p>Having, as I said, reached this house, and being left alone, <lb/>
I bethought me of the treasure I possessed. I was <reg orig="unac-|quainted">unacquainted</reg> <lb/>
with the reasons for which these papers were so <lb/>
precious. They probably had some momentous and <reg orig="inti-|mate">intimate</reg> <lb/>
connexion with your own history. As such, they <lb/>
could not be of little value to me, and this moment of <reg orig="inoc-|cupation">inoccupation</reg> <lb/>
and regrets, was as suitable as any other to the <lb/>
task of perusing them. I drew them forth, therefore, and <lb/>
laid them on the table in this chamber.</p>
<p>The rest is known to you. During a momentary absence <lb/>
you entered. Surely no interview of ancient friends ever <lb/>
took place in so unexpected and abrupt a manner. You <lb/>
were dead. I mourned for you, as one whom I loved, and <lb/>
whom fate had snatched forever from my sight. Now, in a <lb/>
blissful hour, you had risen, and my happiness in thus <reg orig="em-|bracing">embracing</reg> <lb/>
you, is tenfold greater than would have been <reg orig="expe-|rienced">experienced</reg>, <lb/>
if no uncertainties and perils had protracted our <lb/>
meeting.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Here</hi> ended the tale of Sarsefield. Humiliation and joy <lb/>
were mingled in my heart. The events that preceded my <lb/>
awakening in the cave were now luminous and plain. What <lb/>
explication was more obvious? What but this solution ought <lb/>
to have been suggested by the conduct I had witnessed in <lb/>
Clithero?</p>
<p>Clithero! Was not this the man whom Clithero had <reg orig="rob-|bed">robbed</reg> <lb/>
of his friend? Was not this the lover of Mrs. Lorimer, <lb/>
the object of the persecutions of Wiatte? Was it not now <lb/>
given me to investigate the truth of that stupendous tale? <lb/>
To dissipate the doubts which obstinately clung to my <reg orig="ima-|gination">imagination</reg> <lb/>
respecting it?</p>
<p>But soft! Had not Sarsefield said that he was married? <lb/>
Was Mrs. Lorimer so speedily forgotten by him, or was the <lb/>
narrative of Clithero the web of imposture or the raving of <lb/>
insanity?</p>
<p>These new ideas banished all personal considerations <lb/>
from my mind. I looked eagerly into the face of my friend, <lb/>
and exclaimed in a dubious accent&mdash;How say you? <reg orig="Mar-|ried">Married</reg>? <lb/>
When? To whom?</p>
<p>Yes, Huntly, I am wedded to the most excellent of <reg orig="wo-|men">women</reg>. <lb/>
To her am I indebted for happiness, and wealth, and <lb/>
dignity and honor. To her do I owe the power of being <lb/>
the benefactor and protector of you and your sisters. She <lb/>
longs to embrace you as a son. To become truly her son, <lb/>
will depend upon your own choice, and that of one who <lb/>
was the companion of our voyage.</p>
<p>Heavens! cried I, in a transport of exultation and <reg orig="aston-|ishment">astonishment</reg>. <lb/>
Of whom do you speak. Of the mother of <lb/>
Clarice? The sister of Wiatte? The sister of the ruffian <lb/>
who laid snares for her life? Who pursued you and the <lb/>
unhappy Clithero, with the bitterest animosity?</p>
<p>My friend started at these sounds as if the earth had <lb/>
yawned at his feet. His countenance was equally <reg orig="signifi-|cant">significant</reg> <lb/>
of terror and rage. As soon as he regained the power <lb/>
of utterance, he spoke&mdash;Clithero! Curses light upon thy <lb/>
lips for having uttered that detested name! Thousands of <lb/>
<pb n="227" entity="eaf033v3_0240" pid="uva-lib:349972"/>
miles have I flown to shun the hearing of it. Is the <reg orig="mad-|man">madman</reg> <lb/>
here? Have you set eyes upon him? Does he yet <lb/>
crawl upon the face of the earth? Unhappy? Unparalleled, <lb/>
unheard of, thankless miscreant! Has he told his execrable <lb/>
falsehoods here? Has he dared to utter names so sacred as <lb/>
those of Euphemia Lorimer and Clarice?</p>
<p>He has; he has told a tale, that had all the appearances <lb/>
of truth&mdash;</p>
<p>Out upon the villain! The truth! Truth would prove <lb/>
him to be unnatural, devilish; a thing for which no language <lb/>
has yet provided a name! He has called himself unhappy? <lb/>
No doubt, a victim to injustice! Overtaken by unmerited <lb/>
calamity. Say! Has he fooled thee with such tales?</p>
<p>No. His tale was a catalogue of crimes and miseries of <lb/>
which he was the author and sufferer. You know not his <lb/>
motives, his horrors:&mdash;</p>
<p>His deeds were monstrous and infernal. His motives <lb/>
were sordid and flagitious. To display all their ugliness <lb/>
and infamy was not his province. No; he did not tell you <lb/>
that he stole at midnight to the chamber of his mistress; <lb/>
a woman who astonished the world by her loftiness and <lb/>
magnanimity; by indefatigable beneficence and unswerving <lb/>
equity; who had lavished on this wretch, whom she snatched <lb/>
from the dirt, all the goods of fortune; all the benefits of <lb/>
education; all the treasures of love; every provocation to <lb/>
gratitude; every stimulant to justice.</p>
<p>He did not tell you that in recompense for every benefit, <lb/>
he stole upon her sleep and aimed a dagger at her breast. <lb/>
There was no room for flight, or ambiguity, or prevarication. <lb/>
She whom he meant to murder stood near, saw the lifted <lb/>
weapon, and heard him confess and glory in his purposes.</p>
<p>No wonder that the shock bereft her, for a time, of life. <lb/>
The interval was seized by the ruffian to effect his escape. <lb/>
The rebukes of justice, were shunned by a wretch conscious <lb/>
of his inexpiable guilt. These things he has hidden from <lb/>
you, and has supplied their place by a tale specious as false.</p>
<p>No. Among the number of his crimes, hypocrisy is not <lb/>
to be numbered. These things are already known to me; <lb/>
he spared himself too little in the narrative. The <reg orig="excellen-|cies">excellencies</reg> <lb/>
of his lady; her claims to gratitude and veneration, <lb/>
were urged beyond their true bounds. His attempts upon <lb/>
<pb n="228" entity="eaf033v3_0241" pid="uva-lib:349973"/>
her life, were related. It is true that he desired and <reg orig="en-|deavored">endeavored</reg> <lb/>
to destroy her.</p>
<p>How? Has he told you this?</p>
<p>He has told me all. Alas! the criminal intention has <lb/>
been amply expiated&mdash;</p>
<p>What mean you? Whence and how came he hither. <lb/>
Where is he now? I will not occupy the same land, the same <lb/>
world with him. Have this woman and her daughter lighted <lb/>
on the shore haunted by this infernal and implacable enemy?</p>
<p>Alas! It is doubtful whether he exists. If he lives, he <lb/>
is no longer to be feared; but he lives not. Famine and <lb/>
remorse have utterly consumed him.</p>
<p>Famine? Remorse? You talk in riddles.</p>
<p>He has immured himself in the desert. He has abjured <lb/>
the intercourse of mankind. He has shut himself in <reg orig="cav-|erns">caverns</reg> <lb/>
where famine must inevitably expedite that death for <lb/>
which he longs as the only solace of his woes. To no <lb/>
imagination are his offences blacker and more odious than <lb/>
to his own. I had hopes of rescuing him from this fate, <lb/>
but my own infirmities and errors have afforded me <reg orig="suffi-|cient">sufficient</reg> <lb/>
occupation.</p>
<p>Sarsefield renewed his imprecations on the memory of <lb/>
that unfortunate man; and his inquiries as to the <reg orig="circum-|stances">circumstances</reg> <lb/>
that led him into this remote district. His inquiries <lb/>
were not to be answered by one in my present condition. <lb/>
My languors and fatigues had now gained a pitch that was <lb/>
insupportable. The wound in my face had been chafed, <lb/>
and inflamed by the cold water and the bleak air; and the <lb/>
pain attending it, would no longer suffer my attention to <lb/>
stray. I sunk upon the floor, and entreated him to afford <lb/>
me the respite of a few hours repose.</p>
<p>He was sensible of the deplorableness of my condition, <lb/>
and chid himself for the negligence of which he had <reg orig="al-|ready">already</reg> <lb/>
been guilty. He lifted me to the bed, and <reg orig="delibe-|rated">deliberated</reg> <lb/>
on the mode he should pursue for my relief. Some <lb/>
molifying application to my wound, was immediately <reg orig="neces-|sary">necessary</reg>; <lb/>
but in our present lonely condition, it was not at hand. <lb/>
It could only be procured from a distance. It was proper <lb/>
therefore to hasten to the nearest inhabited dwelling, which <lb/>
belonged to one, by name Walton, and supply himself with <lb/>
such medicines as could be found.</p>
<pb n="229" entity="eaf033v3_0242" pid="uva-lib:349974"/>
<p>Meanwhile there was no danger of molestation and <reg orig="in-|trusion">intrusion</reg>. <lb/>
There was reason to expect the speedy return of <lb/>
those who had gone in pursuit of the savages. This was <lb/>
their place of rendezvous, and hither they appointed to <reg orig="re-|assemble">reassemble</reg> <lb/>
before the morrow's dawn. The distance of the <lb/>
neighboring farm was small, and Sarsefield promised to be <lb/>
expeditious. He left me to myself and my own <reg orig="rumina-|tions">ruminations</reg>.</p>
<p>Harassed by fatigue and pain, I had yet power to <reg orig="rumi-|nate">ruminate</reg> <lb/>
on that series of unparalleled events, that had lately <lb/>
happened. I wept, but my tears flowed from a double <lb/>
source; from sorrow, on account of the untimely fate of <lb/>
my uncle, and from joy, that my sisters were preserved, <lb/>
that Sarsefield had returned and was not unhappy.</p>
<p>I reflected on the untoward destiny of Clithero. Part of <lb/>
his calamity consisted in the consciousness of having killed <lb/>
his patronness; but it now appeared, though by some <reg orig="in-|fatuation">infatuation</reg>, <lb/>
I had not previously suspected, that the first <reg orig="im-|pulse">impulse</reg> <lb/>
of sorrow in the lady, had been weakened by reflection <lb/>
and by time. That the prejudice persuading her that her <lb/>
life and that of her brother were to endure and to terminate <lb/>
together, was conquered by experience or by argument. <lb/>
She had come, in company with Sarsefield and Clarice, to <lb/>
America. What influence might these events have upon <lb/>
the gloomy meditations of Clithero. Was it possible to <lb/>
bring them together; to win the maniac from his solitude, <lb/>
wrest from him his fatal purposes, and restore him to <reg orig="com-|munion">communion</reg> <lb/>
with the beings whose imagined indignation is the <lb/>
torment of his life.</p>
<p>These musings were interrupted by a sound from below, <lb/>
which was easily interpreted into tokens of the return of <lb/>
those with whom Sarsefield had parted at the promontory, <lb/>
voices were confused and busy but not turbulent. They <lb/>
entered the lower room and the motion of chairs and tables <lb/>
shewed that they were preparing to rest themselves after <lb/>
their toils.</p>
<p>Few of them were unacquainted with me, since they <lb/>
probably were residents in this district. No inconvenience, <lb/>
therefore, would follow from an interview, though, on their <lb/>
part, wholly unexpected. Besides, Sarsefield would speedily <lb/>
<pb n="230" entity="eaf033v3_0243" pid="uva-lib:349975"/>
return and none of the present visitants would be likely to <lb/>
withdraw to this apartment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I lay upon the bed, with my face turned <lb/>
towards the door, and languidly gazing at the ceiling and <lb/>
walls. Just then a musket was discharged in the room <reg orig="be-|low">below</reg>. <lb/>
The shock affected me mechanically, and the first <lb/>
impulse of surprise, made me almost start upon my feet.</p>
<p>The sound was followed by confusion and bustle. Some <lb/>
rushed forth and called on each other to run different ways, <lb/>
and the words, "That is he"&mdash;"Stop him," were spoken <lb/>
in a tone of eagerness, and rage. My weakness and pain <lb/>
were for a moment forgotten, and my whole attention was <lb/>
bent to discover the meaning of this hubbub. The musket <lb/>
which I had brought with me to this chamber, lay across <lb/>
the bed. Unknowing of the consequences of this affray, <lb/>
with regard to myself, I was prompted by a kind of <reg orig="self-|preserving">self-preserving</reg> <lb/>
instinct, to lay hold of the gun, and prepare to <lb/>
repel any attack that might be made upon me.</p>
<p>A few moments elapsed when I thought I heard light <lb/>
footsteps in the entry leading to this room. I had no time <lb/>
to construe these signals, but watching fearfully the entrance, <lb/>
I grasped my weapon with new force, and raised it so <lb/>
as to be ready at the moment of my danger. I did <lb/>
not watch long. A figure cautiously thrust itself forward. <lb/>
The first glance was sufficient to inform me that this <reg orig="in-|truder">intruder</reg> <lb/>
was an Indian, and, of consequence, an enemy. He <lb/>
was unarmed. Looking eagerly on all sides, he at last <lb/>
spied me as I lay. My appearance threw him into <reg orig="con-|sternation">consternation</reg>, <lb/>
and after the fluctuation of an instant, he darted <lb/>
to the window, threw up the sash, and leaped out upon <lb/>
the ground.</p>
<p>His flight might have been easily arrested by my shot, <lb/>
but surprise, added to my habitual antipathy to bloodshed, <lb/>
unless in cases of absolute necessity, made me hesitate. <lb/>
He was gone, and I was left to mark the progress of the <lb/>
drama. The silence was presently broken by firing at a <lb/>
distance. Three shots, in quick succession, were followed <lb/>
by the deepest pause.</p>
<p>That the party, recently arrived, had brought with them <lb/>
one or more captives, and that by some sudden effort, the <lb/>
prisoners had attempted to escape, was the only supposition <lb/>
<pb n="231" entity="eaf033v3_0244" pid="uva-lib:349976"/>
that I could form. By what motives either of them could <lb/>
be induced to seek concealment in my chamber, could not <lb/>
be imagined.</p>
<p>I now heard a single step on the threshold below. Some <lb/>
one entered the common room. He traversed the floor <lb/>
during a few minutes, and then, ascending the staircase, he <lb/>
entered my chamber. It was Sarsefield. Trouble and <lb/>
dismay were strongly written on his countenance. He <lb/>
seemed totally unconscious of my presence, his eyes were <lb/>
fixed upon the floor, and as he continued to move across <lb/>
the room, he heaved forth deep sighs.</p>
<p>This deportment was mournful and mysterious. It was <lb/>
little in unison with those appearances which he wore at our <lb/>
parting, and must have been suggested by some event that <lb/>
had since happened. My curiosity impelled me to recall <lb/>
him from his reverie. I rose and seizing him by the arm, <lb/>
looked at him with an air of inquisitive anxiety. It was <lb/>
needless to speak.</p>
<p>He noticed my movement, and turning towards me, <lb/>
spoke in a tone of some resentment. Why did you deceive <lb/>
me? Did you not say Clithero was dead?</p>
<p>I said so because it was my belief. Know you any thing <lb/>
to the contrary? Heaven grant that he is still alive, and that <lb/>
our mutual efforts may restore him to peace.</p>
<p>Heaven grant, replied my friend, with a vehemence that <lb/>
bordered upon fury. Heaven grant, that he may live <lb/>
thousands of years, and know not, in their long course, <lb/>
a moment's respite from remorse and from anguish; but this <lb/>
prayer is fruitless. He is not dead, but death hovers over <lb/>
him. Should he live, he will live only to defy justice and <lb/>
perpetrate new horrors. My skill might perhaps save him, <lb/>
but a finger shall not be moved to avert his fate.</p>
<p>Little did I think, that the wretch whom my friends <reg orig="res-|cued">rescued</reg> <lb/>
from the power of the savages, and brought wounded <lb/>
and expiring hither was Clithero. They sent for me in <lb/>
haste to afford him surgical assistance. I found him <lb/>
stretched upon the floor below, deserted, helpless and <reg orig="bleed-|ing">bleeding</reg>. <lb/>
The moment I beheld him, he was recognised. The <lb/>
last of evils was to look upon the face of this assassin, but <lb/>
that evil is past, and shall never be endured again.</p>
<p>Rise and come with me. Accommodation is prepared <lb/>
<pb n="232" entity="eaf033v3_0245" pid="uva-lib:349977"/>
for you at Walcot's. Let us leave this house, and the <reg orig="mo-|ment">moment</reg> <lb/>
you are able to perform a journey, abandon forever <lb/>
this district.</p>
<p>I could not readily consent to this proposal. Clithero <lb/>
had been delivered from captivity, but was dying for want of <lb/>
that aid which Sarsefield was able to afford. Was it not <lb/>
inhuman to desert him in this extremity? What offence had <lb/>
he committed that deserved such implacable vengeance? <lb/>
Nothing I had heard from Sarsefield was in contradiction to <lb/>
his own story. His deed, imperfectly observed, would <reg orig="ap-|pear">appear</reg> <lb/>
to be atrocious and detestable, but the view of all its <lb/>
antecedent and accompanying events and motives, would <lb/>
surely place it in the list not of crimes, but of misfortunes.</p>
<p>But what is that guilt which no penitence can expiate? <lb/>
Had not Clithero's remorse been more than adequate to <lb/>
crimes far more deadly and enormous than this? This, <lb/>
however, was no time to argue with the passions of <reg orig="Sarse-|field">Sarsefield</reg>. <lb/>
Nothing but a repetition of Clithero's tale, could <reg orig="van-|quish">vanquish</reg> <lb/>
his prepossessions and mollify his rage, but this <reg orig="re-|petition">repetition</reg> <lb/>
was impossible to be given by me, till a moment of <lb/>
safety and composure.</p>
<p>These thoughts made me linger, but hindered me from <lb/>
attempting to change the determination of my friend. He <lb/>
renewed his importunities for me to fly with him. He <lb/>
dragged me by the arm, and, wavering and reluctant, I <reg orig="fol-|lowed">followed</reg> <lb/>
where he chose to lead. He crossed the common <lb/>
room, with hurried steps and eyes averted from a figure, <lb/>
which instantly fastened my attention.</p>
<p>It was, indeed, Clithero, whom I now beheld, supine, <lb/>
polluted with blood, his eyes closed and apparently <reg orig="insensi-|ble">insensible</reg>. <lb/>
This object was gazed at with emotions that rooted me <lb/>
to the spot. Sarsefield, perceiving me determined to <reg orig="re-|main">remain</reg> <lb/>
where I was, rushed out of the house, and disappeared.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">I hung</hi> over the unhappy wretch, whose emaciated form <lb/>
and rueful features sufficiently bespoke that savage hands <lb/>
<pb n="233" entity="eaf033v3_0246" pid="uva-lib:349978"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">21</fw></pb>
had only completed that destruction which his miseries had <lb/>
begun. He was mangled by the tomahawk in a shocking <lb/>
manner, and there was little hope that human skill could <lb/>
save his life.</p>
<p>I was sensible of nothing but compassion. I acted <reg orig="with-|out">without</reg> <lb/>
design, when seating myself on the floor I raised his <lb/>
head and placed it on my knees. This movement awakened <lb/>
his attention, and opening his eyes he fixed them on my <lb/>
countenance. They testified neither insensibility, nor horror, <lb/>
nor distraction. A faint emotion of surprise gave way to <lb/>
an appearance of tranquillity. Having perceived these tokens <lb/>
of a state less hopeless than I at first imagined, I spoke to <lb/>
him; My friend! How do you feel? Can any thing be <lb/>
done for you?</p>
<p>He answered me, in a tone more firm and with more <lb/>
coherence of ideas than previous appearances had taught me <lb/>
to expect. No, said he, thy kindness good youth, can avail <lb/>
me nothing. The end of my existence here is at hand. <lb/>
May my guilt be expiated by the miseries that I have <reg orig="suf-|fered">suffered</reg>, <lb/>
and my good deeds only attend me to the presence of <lb/>
my divine judge.</p>
<p>I am waiting, not with trembling or dismay, for this close <lb/>
of my sorrows. I breathed but one prayer, and that prayer <lb/>
has been answered. I asked for an interview with thee, <lb/>
young man, but feeling as I now feel, this interview, so much <lb/>
desired, was beyond my hope. Now thou art come, in due <lb/>
season, to hear the last words that I shall need to utter.</p>
<p>I wanted to assure thee that thy efforts for my benefit <lb/>
were not useless. They have saved me from murdering <lb/>
myself, a guilt more inexpiable than any which it was in my <lb/>
power to commit.</p>
<p>I retired to the innermost recess of Norwalk, and gained <lb/>
the summit of a hill, by subterranean paths. This hill I <lb/>
knew to be on all sides inaccessible to human footsteps, <lb/>
and the subterranean passages were closed up by stones. <lb/>
Here I believed my solitude exempt from interruption and <lb/>
my death, in consequence of famine, sure.</p>
<p>This persuasion was not taken away by your appearance <lb/>
on the opposite steep. The chasm which severed us I knew <lb/>
to be impassable. I withdrew from your sight.</p>
<pb n="234" entity="eaf033v3_0247" pid="uva-lib:349979"/>
<p>Some time after, awakening from a long sleep, I found <lb/>
victuals beside me. He that brought it was invisible. For <lb/>
a time, I doubted whether some messenger of heaven <lb/>
had not interposed for my salvation. How other than by <lb/>
supernatural means, my retreat should be explored, I was <lb/>
unable to conceive. The summit was encompassed by dizzy <lb/>
and profound gulfs, and the subterranean passages were still <lb/>
closed.</p>
<p>This opinion, though corrected by subsequent reflection, <lb/>
tended to change the course of my desperate thoughts. My <lb/>
hunger, thus importunately urged, would not abstain, and I <lb/>
ate of the food that was provided. Henceforth I determined <lb/>
to live, to resume the path of obscurity and labor, which I <lb/>
had relinquished, and wait till my God should summon me <lb/>
to retribution. To anticipate his call, is only to redouble our <lb/>
guilt.</p>
<p>I designed not to return to Inglefield's service, but to choose <lb/>
some other and remoter district. Meanwhile, I had left in <lb/>
his possession, a treasure, which my determination to die, <lb/>
had rendered of no value, but which, my change of <reg orig="resolu-|tion">resolution</reg>, <lb/>
restored. Enclosed in a box at Inglefield's, were the <lb/>
mmoirs of Euphemia Lorimer, by which in all my <reg orig="vicissi-|tudes">vicissitudes</reg>, <lb/>
I had been hitherto accompanied, and from which I <lb/>
consented to part only because I had refused to live. My <lb/>
existence was now to be prolonged, and this manuscript was <lb/>
once more to constitute the torment and the solace of my <lb/>
being.</p>
<p>I hastened to Inglefield's by night. There was no need <lb/>
to warn him of my purpose. I desired that my fate should <lb/>
be an eternal secret to my ancient master and his neighbors. <lb/>
The apartment, containing my box, was well known, and <lb/>
easily accessible.</p>
<p>The box was found, but broken and rifled of its treasure. <lb/>
My transports of astonishment, and indignation, and grief <lb/>
yielded to the resumption of my fatal purpose. I hastened <lb/>
back to the hill, and determined anew to perish.</p>
<p>This mood continued to the evening of the ensuing day. <lb/>
Wandering over rocks and pits, I discovered the manuscript, <lb/>
lying under a jutting precipice. The chance that brought <lb/>
it hither was not less propitious and miraculous than that by <lb/>
which I had been supplied with food. It produced a <reg orig="simi-|lar">similar</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="235" entity="eaf033v3_0248" pid="uva-lib:349980"/>
effect upon my feelings, and, while in possession of this <lb/>
manuscript I was reconciled to the means of life. I left the <lb/>
mountain, and traversing the wilderness, stopped in <reg orig="Chetas-|co">Chetasco</reg>. <lb/>
That kind of employment which I sought was instantly <lb/>
procured; but my new vocation was scarcely assumed when <lb/>
a band of savages invaded our security.</p>
<p>Rambling in the desert, by moonlight, I encountered <lb/>
these foes. They rushed upon me, and after numerous <lb/>
wounds which, for the present, neither killed nor disabled <lb/>
me, they compelled me to keep pace with them in their <lb/>
retreat. Some hours have passed since the troop was <lb/>
overtaken, and my liberty redeemed. Hardships, and <reg orig="re-|peated">repeated</reg> <lb/>
wounds, inflicted at the moment when the invaders <lb/>
were surprised and slain, have brought me to my present <lb/>
condition. I rejoice that my course is about to terminate.</p>
<p>Here the speaker was interrupted by the tumultuous <reg orig="en-|trance">entrance</reg> <lb/>
of the party, by whom he had been brought hither. <lb/>
Their astonishment at seeing me, sustaining the head of the <lb/>
dying man, may be easily conceived. Their surprise was <lb/>
more strongly excited by the disappearance of the captive <lb/>
whom they had left in this apartment, bound hand and foot. <lb/>
It now appeared that of the savage troop who had <reg orig="adven-|tured">adventured</reg> <lb/>
thus far in search of pillage and blood, all had been <lb/>
destroyed but two, who, had been led hither as prisoners. <lb/>
On their entrance into this house, one of the party had been <lb/>
sent to Walcot's to summon Sarsefield to the aid of the <lb/>
wounded man, while others had gone in search of cords to <lb/>
secure the arms and legs of the captives, who had hitherto <lb/>
been manacled imperfectly.</p>
<p>The cords were brought and one of them was bound, but <lb/>
the other, before the same operation was begun upon him, <lb/>
broke, by a sudden effort, the feeble ligatures by which he <lb/>
was at present constrained, and seizing a musket that lay <lb/>
near him, fired on his enemies, and then rushed out of doors. <lb/>
All eagerly engaged in the pursuit. The savage was fleet <lb/>
as a deer and finally eluded his pursuers.</p>
<p>While their attention was thus engaged abroad, he that <lb/>
remained found means to extricate his wrists and ancles <lb/>
from his bonds and betaking himself to the stairs, escaped, <lb/>
as I before described, through the window of the room <lb/>
which I had occupied. They pestered me with their <reg orig="curi-|osity">curiosity</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="236" entity="eaf033v3_0249" pid="uva-lib:349981"/>
and wonder, for I was known to all of them; but <reg orig="wav-|ing">waving</reg> <lb/>
the discussion of my own concerns I entreated their <reg orig="as-|sistance">assistance</reg> <lb/>
to carry Clithero to the chamber and the bed which <lb/>
I had just deserted.</p>
<p>I now in spite of pain, fatigue, and watchfulness, set out to <lb/>
go to Walton's. Sarsefield was ready to receive me at the <lb/>
door, and the kindness and compassion of the family were <lb/>
active in my behalf. I was conducted to a chamber and <lb/>
provided with suitable attendance and remedies.</p>
<p>I was not unmindful of the more deplorable condition of <lb/>
Clithero. I incessantly meditated on the means for his <reg orig="re-|lief">relief</reg>. <lb/>
His case stood in need of all the vigilance and skill of <lb/>
a physician, and Sarsefield was the only one of that <reg orig="profes-|sion">profession</reg> <lb/>
whose aid could be seasonably administered. <reg orig="Sarse-|field">Sarsefield</reg> <lb/>
therefore must be persuaded to bestow this aid.</p>
<p>There was but one mode of conquering his abhorrence <lb/>
of this man. To prepossess my friend with the belief of the <lb/>
innocence of Clithero, or to soothe him into pity by a picture <lb/>
of remorse and suffering. This could best be done, and in <lb/>
the manner most conformable to truth, by a simple recital <lb/>
of the incidents that had befallen, and by repeating the <reg orig="con-|fession">confession</reg> <lb/>
which had been extorted from Clithero.</p>
<p>I requested all but my friend to leave my chamber, and <lb/>
then, soliciting a patient hearing, began the narrative of <lb/>
Waldegrave's death! of the detection of Clithero beneath the <lb/>
shade of the elm! of the suspicions which were thence <reg orig="pro-|duced">produced</reg>; <lb/>
and of the forest interview to which these suspicions <lb/>
gave birth; I then repeated, without variation or addition, <lb/>
the tale which was then told. I likewise mentioned my <lb/>
subsequent transactions in Norwalk, so far as they illustrated <lb/>
the destiny of Clithero.</p>
<p>During this recital, I fixed my eyes upon the <reg orig="counte-|nance">countenance</reg> <lb/>
of Sarsefield, and watched every emotion as it arose or <lb/>
declined. With the progress of my tale, his indignation and <lb/>
his fury grew less, and at length gave place to horror and <lb/>
compassion.</p>
<p>His seat became uneasy, his pulse throbbed with new <reg orig="ve-|hemence">vehemence</reg>. <lb/>
When I came to the motives which prompted <lb/>
the unhappy man to visit the chamber of his mistress, he <lb/>
started from his seat, and sometimes strode across the floor <lb/>
in a troubled mood, and sometimes stood before me, with <lb/>
<pb n="237" entity="eaf033v3_0250" pid="uva-lib:349982"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">21*</fw></pb>
his breath almost suspended in the eagerness of his attention. <lb/>
When I mentioned the lifted dagger, the shriek from behind, <lb/>
and the apparition that interposed, he shuddered and drew <lb/>
back, as if a dagger had been aimed at his breast.</p>
<p>When the tale was done, some time elapsed in mutual <lb/>
and profound silence. My friend's thoughts were involved <lb/>
in a mournful and indefinable reverie. From this he at <lb/>
length recovered and spoke.</p>
<p>It is true. A tale like this could never be the fruit of <lb/>
invention, or be invented to deceive. He has done himself <lb/>
injustice. His character was spotless and fair. All his <lb/>
moral properties seemed to have resolved themselves into <lb/>
gratitude, fidelity and honor.</p>
<p>We parted at the door, late in the evening, as he <reg orig="men-|tioned">mentioned</reg>, <lb/>
and he guessed truly that subsequent reflection <lb/>
had induced me to return and to disclose the truth to Mrs. <lb/>
Lorimer. Clarice, relieved by the sudden death of her <lb/>
friend, and unexpectedly by all, arrived at the same hour.</p>
<p>These tidings astonished, afflicted, and delighted the lady. <lb/>
Her brother's death had been long believed by all but <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>. <lb/>
To find her doubts verified, and his existence <reg orig="ascer-|tained">ascertained</reg> <lb/>
was the dearest consolation that he ever could bestow. <lb/>
She was afflicted at the proofs that had been noted of the <lb/>
continuance of his depravity, but she dreaded no danger to <lb/>
herself from his malignity or vengeance.</p>
<p>The ignorance and prepossessions of this woman were <lb/>
remarkable. On this subject only she was perverse, <reg orig="head-|strong">headstrong</reg>, <lb/>
obstinate. Her anxiety to benefit this arch-ruffian <lb/>
occupied her whole thoughts, and allowed her no time to <lb/>
reflect upon the reasonings or remonstrances of others. <lb/>
She could not be prevailed on to deny herself to his visits, <lb/>
and I parted from her in the utmost perplexity.</p>
<p>A messenger came to me at midnight entreating my <reg orig="im-|mediate">immediate</reg> <lb/>
presence. Some disaster had happened, but of <lb/>
what kind the messenger was unable to tell. My fears <lb/>
easily conjured up the image of Wiatte. Terror scarcely <lb/>
allowed me to breathe. When I entered the house of Mrs. <lb/>
Lorimer, I was conducted to her chamber. She lay upon <lb/>
the bed in a state of stupefaction, that arose from some <lb/>
mental cause. Clarice sat by her, wringing her hands, and <lb/>
<pb n="238" entity="eaf033v3_0251" pid="uva-lib:349983"/>
pouring forth her tears without intermission. Neither could <lb/>
explain to me the nature of the scene. I made inquiries <lb/>
of the servants and attendants. They merely said that the <lb/>
family as usual had retired to rest, but their lady's bell rung <lb/>
with great violence, and called them in haste to her <reg orig="cham-|ber">chamber</reg>, <lb/>
where they found her in a swoon upon the floor, and <lb/>
the young lady in the utmost affright and perturbation.</p>
<p>Suitable means being used, Mrs. Lorimer had, at length, <lb/>
recovered, but was still nearly insensible. I went to <reg orig="Cli-|thero's">Clithero's</reg> <lb/>
apartments, but he was not to be found, and the <lb/>
domestics informed me that since he had gone with me, he <lb/>
had not returned. The doors between this chamber and <lb/>
the court were open; hence that some dreadful interview <lb/>
had taken place, perhaps with Wiatte, was an unavoidable <lb/>
conjecture. He had withdrawn, however, without <reg orig="commit-|ting">committing</reg> <lb/>
any personal injury.</p>
<p>I need not mention my reflections upon this scene. All <lb/>
was tormenting doubt and suspense, till the morning arrived, <lb/>
and tidings were received that Wiatte had been killed in the <lb/>
streets. This event was antecedent to that which had <reg orig="oc-|casioned">occasioned</reg> <lb/>
Mrs. Lorimer's distress and alarm. I now <reg orig="re-|membered">remembered</reg> <lb/>
that fatal prepossession, by which the lady was <lb/>
governed, and her frantic belief that her death and that of <lb/>
her brother were to fall out at the same time. Could some <lb/>
witness of his death have brought her tidings of it? Had <lb/>
he penetrated, unexpected and unlicensed to her chamber, <lb/>
and were these the effects produced by the intelligence?</p>
<p>Presently I knew that not only Wiatte was dead, but that <lb/>
Clithero had killed him. Clithero had not been known to <lb/>
return, and was no where to be found. He then was the <lb/>
bearer of these tidings, for none but he could have found <lb/>
access or egress without disturbing the servants.</p>
<p>These doubts were at length at an end. In a broken and <lb/>
confused manner, and after the lapse of some days, the <lb/>
monstrous and portentous truth was disclosed. After our <lb/>
interview, the lady and her daughter had retired to the same <lb/>
chamber; the former had withdrawn to her closet, and the <lb/>
latter to bed. Some one's entrance alarmed the lady, and <lb/>
coming forth after a moment's pause, the spectacle which <lb/>
Clithero has too faithfully described, presented itself.</p>
<pb n="239" entity="eaf033v3_0252" pid="uva-lib:349984"/>
<p>What could I think? A life of uniform hypocrisy, or a <lb/>
sudden loss of reason, were the only suppositions to be <lb/>
formed. Clithero was the parent of fury and abhorrence <lb/>
in my heart. In either case I started at the name. I <reg orig="shud-|dered">shuddered</reg> <lb/>
at the image of the apostate or the maniac.</p>
<p>What? Kill the brother whose existence was interwoven <lb/>
with that of his benefactress and his friend? Then hasten <lb/>
to her chamber, and attempt her life? Lift a dagger to <lb/>
destroy her who had been the author of his being and his <lb/>
happiness?</p>
<p>He that could meditate a deed like this was no longer <lb/>
man. An agent from hell had mastered his faculties. He <lb/>
was become the engine of infernal malice, against whom it <lb/>
was the duty of all mankind to rise up in arms and never to <lb/>
desist till, by shattering it to atoms, its power to injure was <lb/>
taken away.</p>
<p>All inquiries to discover the place of his retreat were vain. <lb/>
No wonder, methought, that he wrapt himself in the folds <lb/>
of impenetrable secrecy. Curbed, checked, baffled in the <lb/>
midst of his career, no wonder that he shrunk into <reg orig="obscu-|rity">obscurity</reg>, <lb/>
that he fled from justice and revenge, that he dared not <lb/>
meet the rebukes of that eye, which, dissolving in <reg orig="tender-|ness">tenderness</reg> <lb/>
or flashing with disdain, had ever been irresistible.</p>
<p>But how shall I describe the lady's condition? Cilthero <lb/>
she had cherished from his infancy. He was the stay, the <lb/>
consolation, the pride of her life. His projected alliance <lb/>
with her daughter, made him still more dear. Her eloquence <lb/>
was never tired of expatiating on his purity and rectitude. <lb/>
No wonder that she delighted in this theme, for he was her <lb/>
own work. His virtues were the creatures of her bounty.</p>
<p>How hard to be endured was this sad reverse? She can <lb/>
be tranquil, but never more will she be happy. To promote <lb/>
her forgetfulness of him, I persuaded her to leave her <reg orig="coun-|try">country</reg>, <lb/>
which contained a thousand memorials of past calamity, <lb/>
and which was lapsing fast into civil broils. Clarice has <lb/>
accompanied us, and time may effect the happiness of <lb/>
others, by her means, though she can never remove the <lb/>
melancholy of her mother.</p>
<p>I have listened to your tale, not without compassion. <lb/>
What would you have me to do? To prolong his life, <lb/>
would be merely to protract his misery.</p>
<pb n="240" entity="eaf033v3_0253" pid="uva-lib:349985"/>
<p>He can never be regarded with complacency by my <lb/>
wife. He can never be thought of without shuddering by <lb/>
Clarice. Common ills are not without a cure less than <lb/>
death, but here, all remedies are vain. Consciousness itself <lb/>
is the malady; the pest; of which he only is cured who <lb/>
ceases to think.</p>
<p>I could not but assent to this mournful conclusion; yet <lb/>
though death was better to Clithero than life, could not some <lb/>
of his mistakes be rectified? Euphemia Lorimer, contrary to <lb/>
his belief, was still alive. He dreamed that she was dead, <lb/>
and a thousand evils were imagined to flow from that death. <lb/>
This death and its progeny of ills, haunted his fancy, and <lb/>
added keenness to his remorse. Was it not our duty to <lb/>
rectify this error?</p>
<p>Sarsefield reluctantly assented to the truth of my <reg orig="argu-|ments">arguments</reg> <lb/>
on this head. He consented to return, and afford <lb/>
the dying man, the consolation of knowing that the being <lb/>
whom he adored as a benefactor and parent, had not been <lb/>
deprived of existence, though bereft of peace by his act.</p>
<p>During Sarsefield's absence my mind was busy in <reg orig="revolv-|ing">revolving</reg> <lb/>
the incidents that had just occurred. I ruminated on the <lb/>
last words of Clithero. There was somewhat in his <reg orig="narra-|tive">narrative</reg> <lb/>
that was obscure and contradictory. He had left the <lb/>
manuscript, which he so much and so jutsly prized, in <lb/>
his cabinet. He entered the chamber in my absence, and <lb/>
found the cabinet unfastened and the manuscript gone. It <lb/>
was I by whom the cabinet was opened, but the manuscript <lb/>
supposed to be contained in it, was buried in the earth beneath <lb/>
the elm. How should Clithero be unacquainted with its <lb/>
situation, since none but Clithero could have dug for it this <lb/>
grave?</p>
<p>This mystery vanished when I reflected on the history <lb/>
of my own manuscript. Clithero had buried his treasure <lb/>
with his own hands, as mine had been secreted by myself, <lb/>
but both acts had been performed during sleep. The deed <lb/>
was neither prompted by the will, nor noticed by the senses <lb/>
of him, by whom it was done. Disastrous and humiliating <lb/>
is the state of man! By his own hands, is constructed <lb/>
the mass of misery and error in which his steps are forever <lb/>
involved.</p>
<pb n="241" entity="eaf033v3_0254" pid="uva-lib:349986"/>
<p>Thus it was with thy friend. Hurried on by phantoms <lb/>
too indistinct to be now recalled, I wandered from my <reg orig="cham-|ber">chamber</reg> <lb/>
to the desert. I plunged into some unvisited cavern, <lb/>
and easily proceeded till I reached the edge of a pit. <lb/>
There my step was deceived, and I tumbled headlong from <lb/>
the precipice. The fall bereaved me of sense, and I <lb/>
continued breathless and motionless during the remainder of <lb/>
the night and the ensuing day.</p>
<p>How little cognizance have men over the actions and <lb/>
motives of each other? How total is our blindness with <lb/>
regard to our own performances! Who would have sought <lb/>
me in the bowels of this mountain? Ages might have <reg orig="pass-|ed">passed</reg> <lb/>
away, before my bones would be discovered in this tomb, <lb/>
by some traveller whom curiosity had prompted to explore it.</p>
<p>I was roused from these reflections by Sarsefield's return. <lb/>
Inquiring into Cilthero's condition; he answered that the <lb/>
unhappy man was insensible, but that, notwithstanding <reg orig="nu-|merous">numerous</reg> <lb/>
and dreadful gashes, in different parts of his body, it <lb/>
was possible, that by submitting to the necessary treatment, <lb/>
he might recover.</p>
<p>Encouraged by this information, I endeavored to awaken <lb/>
the zeal and compassion of my friend in Clithero's behalf. <lb/>
He recoiled with involuntary shuddering from any task <lb/>
which would confine him to the presence of this man. <lb/>
Time and reflection, he said, might introduce different <reg orig="sen-|timents">sentiments</reg> <lb/>
and feelings, but at present he could not but regard <lb/>
this person as a maniac, whose disease was irremediable, <lb/>
and whose existence could not be protracted, but to his own <lb/>
misery and the misery of others.</p>
<p>Finding him irreconcilably averse to any scheme, <reg orig="con-|nected">connected</reg> <lb/>
with the welfare of Clithero, I began to think that <lb/>
his assistance as a surgeon was by no means necessary. He <lb/>
had declared that the sufferer needed nothing more than <lb/>
common treatment, and to this the skill of a score of aged <lb/>
women in this district, furnished with simples culled from <lb/>
the forest, and pointed out, of old time, by Indian <hi rend="italic">leeches</hi> <lb/>
was no less adequate than that of Sarsefield. These women <lb/>
were ready and officious in their charity, and none of them <lb/>
were prepossessed against the sufferer by a knowledge of <lb/>
his genuine story.</p>
<pb n="242" entity="eaf033v3_0255" pid="uva-lib:349987"/>
<p>Sarsefield, meanwhile, was impatient for my removal to <lb/>
Inglefield's habitation, and that venerable friend was no less <lb/>
impatient to receive me. My hurts were superficial, and <lb/>
my strength sufficiently repaired by a night's repose. Next <lb/>
day I went thither, leaving Clithero to the care of his <reg orig="im-|mediate">immediate</reg> <lb/>
neighbors.</p>
<p>Sarsefield's engagements compelled him to prosecute his <lb/>
journey into Virginia, from which he had somewhat <reg orig="devi-|ated">deviated</reg>, <lb/>
in order to visit Solebury. He proposed to return in <lb/>
less than a month, and then to take me in his company to <lb/>
New York. He has treated me with paternal tenderness, <lb/>
and insists upon the privilege of consulting for my interest, <lb/>
as if he were my real father. Meanwhile, these views <lb/>
have been disclosed to Inglefield, and it is with him that I <lb/>
am to remain, with my sisters, until his return.</p>
<p>My reflections have been various and tumultuous. They <lb/>
have been busy in relation to you, to Weymouth, and <reg orig="es-|pecially">especially</reg> <lb/>
to Clithero. The latter, polluted with gore and <lb/>
weakened by abstinence, fatigue, and the loss of blood, <lb/>
appeared in my eyes, to be in a much more dangerous <lb/>
condition than the event proved him to be. I was <reg orig="punctu-|ally">punctually</reg> <lb/>
informed of the progress of his cure, and proposed in <lb/>
a few days to visit him. The duty of explaining the truth, <lb/>
respecting the present condition of Mrs. Lorimer, had <reg orig="de-|volved">devolved</reg> <lb/>
upon me. By imparting this intelligence, I hoped <lb/>
to work the most auspicious revolutions in his feelings, and <lb/>
prepared, therefore, with alacrity, for an interview.</p>
<p>In this hope I was destined to be disappointed. On the <lb/>
morning on which I intended to visit him, a messenger arrived <lb/>
from the house in which he was entertained, and informed <lb/>
us that the family on entering the sick man's apartment, <lb/>
had found it deserted. It appeared that Clithero had, <lb/>
during the night, risen from his bed, and gone secretly <lb/>
forth. No traces of his flight have since been discovered.</p>
<p>But O! my friend, the death of Waldegrave, thy <lb/>
brother, is at length divested of uncertainty and mystery. <lb/>
Hitherto, I had been able to form no conjecture <reg orig="respect-|ing">respecting</reg> <lb/>
it, but the solution was found shortly after this time.</p>
<p>Queen Mab, three days after my adventure, was seized <lb/>
in her hut on suspicion of having aided and counselled her <lb/>
countrymen, in their late depredations. She was not to be <lb/>
<pb n="243" entity="eaf033v3_0256" pid="uva-lib:349988"/>
awed or intimidated by the treatment she received, but <lb/>
readily confessed and gloried in the mischief she had done; <lb/>
and accounted for it by enumerating the injuries which she <lb/>
had received from her neighbors.</p>
<p>These injuries consisted in contemptuous or neglectful <lb/>
treatment, and in the rejection of groundless and absurd <lb/>
claims. The people of Chetasco were less obsequious to <lb/>
her humors than those of Solebury, her ancient <reg orig="neighbor-|hood">neighborhood</reg>, <lb/>
and her imagination brooded for a long time, over <lb/>
nothing but schemes of revenge. She became sullen, <reg orig="iras-|cible">irascible</reg>, <lb/>
and spent more of her time in solitude than ever.</p>
<p>A troop of her countrymen at length visited her hut. <lb/>
Their intentions being hostile, they concealed from the <reg orig="in-|habitants">inhabitants</reg> <lb/>
their presence in this quarter of the country. <lb/>
Some motives induced them to withdraw and postpone, for <lb/>
the present, the violence which they meditated. One of <lb/>
them, however, more sanguinary and audacious than the <lb/>
rest would not depart, without some gratification of his <reg orig="ven-|geance">vengeance</reg>. <lb/>
He left his associates and penetrated by night into <lb/>
Solebury, resolving to attack the first human being whom he <lb/>
should meet. It was the fate of thy unhappy brother to <reg orig="en-|counter">encounter</reg> <lb/>
this ruffian, whose sagacity made him forbear to tear <lb/>
away the usual trophy from the dead, lest he should afford <lb/>
grounds for suspicion as to the authors of the evil.</p>
<p>Satisfied with this exploit, he rejoined his companions, <lb/>
and after an interval of three weeks returned with a more <lb/>
numerous party, to execute a more extensive project of <reg orig="de-|struction">destruction</reg>. <lb/>
They were counselled and guided, in all their <lb/>
movements, by Queen Mab, who now explained these <reg orig="par-|ticulars">particulars</reg>, <lb/>
and boldly defied her oppressors. Her usual <reg orig="ob-|stinacy">obstinacy</reg> <lb/>
and infatuation induced her to remain in her ancient <lb/>
dwelling and prepare to meet the consequences.</p>
<p>This disclosure awakened anew all the regrets and <reg orig="an-|guish">anguish</reg> <lb/>
which flowed from that disaster. It has been <reg orig="pro-|ductive">productive</reg>, <lb/>
however, of some benefit. Suspicions and doubts, <lb/>
by which my soul was harassed, and which were injurious <lb/>
to the innocent, are now at an end. It is likewise some <reg orig="im-|perfect">imperfect</reg> <lb/>
consolation to reflect, that the assassin has himself <lb/>
been killed, and probably by my own hand. The shedder <lb/>
of blood no longer lives to pursue his vocation, and justice <lb/>
is satisfied.</p>
<pb n="244" entity="eaf033v3_0257" pid="uva-lib:349989"/>
<p>Thus have I fulfilled my promise to compose a minute <lb/>
relation of my sufferings. I remembered my duty to thee, <lb/>
and as soon as I was able to hold a pen, employed it to <reg orig="in-|form">inform</reg> <lb/>
thee of my welfare. I could not at that time enter <lb/>
into particulars, but reserved a more copious narrative till a <lb/>
period of more health and leisure.</p>
<p>On looking back, I am surprised at the length to which my <lb/>
story has run. I thought that a few days would suffice to <lb/>
complete it, but one page has insensibly been added to <lb/>
another, till I have consumed weeks and filled volumes. <lb/>
Here I will draw to a close; I will send you what I have <lb/>
written, and discuss with you in conversation, my other <reg orig="im-|mediate">immediate</reg> <lb/>
concerns, and my schemes for the future. As soon <lb/>
as I have seen Sarsefield, I will visit you. <hi rend="small-caps">Farewell.</hi></p>

<head type="main">LETTER II.</head>
<head type="sub"><hi rend="italic">To the Same.</hi></head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">I will</hi> now relate the particulars which I yesterday <lb/>
promised to send you. You heard through your neice of <lb/>
my arrival at Inglefield's in Solebury; my inquiries, you <lb/>
may readily suppose, would turn upon the fate of my friend's <lb/>
servant, Clithero, whose last disappearance was so strange <lb/>
and abrupt, and of whom, since that time, I had heard <reg orig="noth-|ing">nothing</reg>. <lb/>
You are indifferent to his fate, and are anxious only <lb/>
that his existence and misfortunes may be speedily forgotten. <lb/>
I confess that it is somewhat otherwise with me. I pity <lb/>
him; I wish to relieve him, and cannot admit the belief that <lb/>
his misery is without a cure. I want to find him out. I <lb/>
want to know his condition, and if possible to afford him <lb/>
comfort and inspire him with courage and hope.</p>
<p>Inglefield replied to my questions. O yes! He has <reg orig="ap-|peared">appeared</reg>. <lb/>
The strange being is again upon the stage. Shortly <lb/>
after he left his sick bed, I heard from Philip Beddington, <lb/>
of Chetasco, that Deb's hut had found a new tenant. At <lb/>
first, I imagined that the Scotsman who built it had returned, <lb/>
but making closer inquiries, I found that the new tenant was <lb/>
my servant. I had no inclination to visit him myself, but <lb/>
frequently inquired respecting him of those, who lived or <lb/>
passed that way, and find that he still lives there.</p>
<p>But how, said I, what is his mode of subsistence. The <lb/>
winter has been no time for cultivation, and he found, I <reg orig="pre-|sume">presume</reg>, <lb/>
nothing in the ground.</p>
<p>Deb's hut, replied my friend, is his lodging and his place <lb/>
of retirement, but food and clothing he procures by <reg orig="labor-|ing">laboring</reg> <lb/>
on a neighboring farm. This farm is next to that of <lb/>
Beddington, who consequently knows something of his <lb/>
present situation. I find little or no difference in his present <lb/>
deportment, and those appearances which he assumed, <lb/>
while living with me, except that he retires every night to <lb/>
his hut, and holds as little intercourse as possible with the <lb/>
rest of mankind. He dines at his employer's table, but his <lb/>
supper, which is nothing but rye bread, he carries home with <lb/>
<pb n="246" entity="eaf033v3_0259" pid="uva-lib:349991"/>
him, and at all those times, when disengaged from <reg orig="employ-|ment">employment</reg>, <lb/>
he secludes himself in his hut, or wanders nobody <lb/>
knows whither.</p>
<p>This was the substance of Inglefield's intelligence. I <lb/>
gleaned from it some satisfaction. It proved the condition <lb/>
of Clithero to be less deplorable and desperate than I had <lb/>
previously imagined. His fatal and gloomy thoughts seemed <lb/>
to have somewhat yielded to tranquillity.</p>
<p>In the course of my reflections, however, I could not but <lb/>
perceive, that his condition, though eligible when compared <lb/>
with what it once was, was likewise disastrous and <reg orig="humilia-|ting">humiliating</reg>, <lb/>
compared with his youthful hopes and his actual merits. <lb/>
For such a one to mope away his life in this unsocial and <lb/>
savage state, was deeply to be deplored. It was my duty, <lb/>
if possible, to prevail on him to relinquish his scheme. And <lb/>
what would be requisite, for that end, but to inform him of <lb/>
the truth?</p>
<p>The source of his dejection was the groundless belief that <lb/>
he had occasioned the death of his benefactress. It was this <lb/>
alone that could justly produce remorse or grief. It was a <reg orig="dis-|tempered">distempered</reg> <lb/>
imagination both in him and in me, that had given <lb/>
birth to this opinion, since the terms of his narrative, <reg orig="impar-|tially">impartially</reg> <lb/>
considered, were far from implying that catastrophe. <lb/>
To him, however, the evidence which he possessed was <reg orig="in-|contestible">incontestible</reg>. <lb/>
No deductions from probability could overthrow <lb/>
his belief. This could only be affected by similar and <reg orig="coun-|ter">counter</reg> <lb/>
evidence. To apprize him that she was now alive, in <lb/>
possession of some degree of happiness, the wife of <reg orig="Sarse-|field">Sarsefield</reg>, <lb/>
and an actual resident on this shore, would dissipate the <lb/>
sanguinary apparition that haunted him; cure his diseased <lb/>
intellects, and restore him to those vocations for which his <lb/>
talents, and that rank in society for which his education had <lb/>
qualified him. Influenced by these thoughts, I determined <lb/>
to visit his retreat. Being obliged to leave Solebury the <lb/>
next day, I resolved to set out the same afternoon, and <reg orig="stop-|ping">stopping</reg> <lb/>
in Chetasco, for the night, seek his habitation at the <lb/>
hour when he had probably retired to it.</p>
<p>This was done. I arrived at Beddington's, at night-fall. <lb/>
My inquiries respecting Clithero obtained for me the same <lb/>
intelligence from him, which I had received from Inglefield. <lb/>
Deb's hut was three miles from this habitation, and thither, <lb/>
<pb n="247" entity="eaf033v3_0260" pid="uva-lib:349992"/>
when the evening had somewhat advanced, I repaired. This <lb/>
was the spot which had witnessed so many perils during the <lb/>
last year, and my emotions, on approaching it, were awful. <lb/>
With palpitating heart and quick steps I traversed the road, <lb/>
skirted on each side by thickets, and the area before the <lb/>
house. The dwelling was by no means in so ruinous a state <lb/>
as when I last visited it. The crannies between the logs <lb/>
had been filled up, and the light within was perceivable only <lb/>
at a crevice in the door.</p>
<p>Looking through this crevice, I perceived a fire in the <lb/>
chimney, but the object of my visit was no where to be seen. <lb/>
I knocked and requested admission, but no answer was <lb/>
made. At length I lifted the latch and entered. Nobody <lb/>
was there.</p>
<p>It was obvious to suppose that Clithero had gone abroad <lb/>
for a short time, and would speedily return, or perhaps some <lb/>
engagement had detained him at his labor, later than usual. <lb/>
I therefore seated myself on some straw near the fire, which, <lb/>
with a woollen rug, appeared to constitute his only bed. <lb/>
The rude bedstead which I formerly met with, was gone. <lb/>
The slender furniture, likewise, which had then engaged my <lb/>
attention, had disappeared. There was nothing capable of <lb/>
human use, but a heap of faggots in the corner, which <lb/>
seemed intended for fuel. How slender is the <reg orig="accommoda-|tion">accommodation</reg> <lb/>
which nature has provided for man, and how scanty is <lb/>
the portion which our physical necessities require.</p>
<p>While ruminating upon this scene, and comparing past <lb/>
events with the objects before me, the dull whistling of the <lb/>
gale without gave place to the sound of footsteps. Presently <lb/>
the door opened, and Clithero entered the apartment. His <lb/>
aspect and guise were not essentially different from those <lb/>
which he wore when an inhabitant of Solebury.</p>
<p>To find his hearth occupied by another, appeared to <lb/>
create the deepest surprise. He looked at me without <lb/>
any tokens of remembrance! His features assumed a more <lb/>
austere expression, and after scowling on my person for a <lb/>
moment, he withdrew his eyes, and placing in a corner, a <lb/>
bundle which he bore in his hand, he turned and seemed <lb/>
preparing to withdraw.</p>
<p>I was anxiously attentive to his demeanor, and as soon as <lb/>
I perceived his purpose to depart, leaped on my feet to <lb/>
<pb n="248" entity="eaf033v3_0261" pid="uva-lib:349993"/>
prevent it. I took his hand, and affectionately pressing it, <lb/>
said, do you not know me? Have you so soon forgotten <lb/>
me who is truly your friend?</p>
<p>He looked at me with some attention, but again withdrew <lb/>
his eyes, and placed himself in silence on the seat which <lb/>
I had left. I seated myself near him, and a pause of <reg orig="mu-|tual">mutual</reg> <lb/>
silence ensued.</p>
<p>My mind was full of the purpose that brought me hither, <lb/>
but I knew not in what manner to communicate my purpose. <lb/>
Several times I opened my lips to speak, but my perplexity <lb/>
continued, and suitable words refused to suggest themselves. <lb/>
At length, I said, in a confused tone;</p>
<p>I came hither with a view to benefit a man, with whose <lb/>
misfortunes his own lips have made me acquainted, and <lb/>
who has awakened in my breast the deepest sympathy. I <lb/>
know the cause and extent of his dejection. I know the <lb/>
event which has given birth to horror and remorse in his <lb/>
heart. He believes that, by his means, his patroness and <lb/>
benefactress has found an untimely death.</p>
<p>These words produced a visible shock in my companion, <lb/>
which evinced that I had at least engaged his attention. I <lb/>
proceeded:</p>
<p>This unhappy lady was cursed with a wicked and <reg orig="un-|natural">unnatural</reg> <lb/>
brother. She conceived a disproportionate <reg orig="af-|fection">affection</reg> <lb/>
for this brother, and erroneously imagined that her <lb/>
fate was blended with his; that their lives would <reg orig="neces-|sarily">necessarily</reg> <lb/>
terminate at the same period, and that therefore, <reg orig="who-|ever">whoever</reg> <lb/>
was the contriver of his death, was likewise, by a <lb/>
fatal and invincible necessity, the author of her own.</p>
<p>Clithero was her servant, but was raised by her bounty, <lb/>
to the station of her son and the rank of her friend. <reg orig="Cli-|thero">Clithero</reg>, <lb/>
in self-defence, took away the life of that unnatural <lb/>
brother, and, in that deed, falsely but cogently believed, <lb/>
that he had perpetrated the destruction of his benefactress.</p>
<p>To ascertain the truth, he sought her presence. She <lb/>
was found, the tidings of her brother's death were <reg orig="commu-|nicated">communicated</reg>, <lb/>
and she sunk breathless at his feet.</p>
<p>At these words Clithero started from the ground, and <lb/>
cast upon me looks of furious indignation.&mdash;And come you <lb/>
hither, he muttered, for this end; to recount my offences, <lb/>
and drive me again to despair?</p>
<pb n="249" entity="eaf033v3_0262" pid="uva-lib:349994"><fw type="sig" place="bottom-center">22*</fw></pb>
<p>No, answered I, with quickness, I come to outroot a <lb/>
fatal, but powerful illusion. I come to assure you that the <lb/>
woman, with whose destruction you charge yourself, is <hi rend="italic">not <lb/>
dead.</hi></p>
<p>These words, uttered with the most emphatical solemnity, <lb/>
merely produced looks in which contempt was mingled with <lb/>
anger. He continued silent.</p>
<p>I perceive, resumed I, that my words are disregarded. <lb/>
Would to Heaven I were able to conquer your incredulity, <lb/>
could show you not only the truth, but the probability of my <lb/>
tale. Can you not confide in me? that Euphemia Lorimer <lb/>
is now alive, is happy, is the wife of Sarsefield; that her <lb/>
brother is forgotten and his murderer regarded without <lb/>
enmity or vengeance?</p>
<p>He looked at me with a strange expression of contempt. <lb/>
&mdash;Come, said he, at length, make out thy assertion to be <lb/>
true. Fall on thy knees and invoke the thunder of heaven <lb/>
to light on thy head if thy words be false. Swear that <reg orig="Eu-|phemia">Euphemia</reg> <lb/>
Lorimer is alive; happy; forgetful of Wiatte and <lb/>
compassionate of me. Swear that thou hast seen her; <lb/>
talked with her; received from her own lips the confession <lb/>
of her pity for him who aimed a dagger at her bosom. <lb/>
Swear that she is Sarsefield's wife.</p>
<p>I put my hands together, and lifting my eyes to heaven, <lb/>
exclaimed; I comply with your conditions; I call the <reg orig="om-|niscient">omniscient</reg> <lb/>
God to witness that Euphemia Lorimer is alive; <lb/>
that I have seen her with these eyes; have talked with her; <lb/>
have inhabited the same house for months.</p>
<p>These asseverations were listened to with shuddering. He <lb/>
laid not aside, however, an air of incredulity and contempt. <lb/>
Perhaps, said he, thou canst point out the place of her <lb/>
abode. Canst guide me to the city, the street, the very <lb/>
door of her habitation?</p>
<p>I can. She resides at this moment in the city of New <lb/>
York; in Broadway; in a house contiguous to the ...........</p>
<p>'Tis well, exclaimed my companion, in a tone, loud, <lb/>
abrupt, and in the utmost degree, vehement. 'Tis well. <lb/>
Rash and infatuated youth. Thou hast ratified, beyond <lb/>
appeal or forgiveness, thy own doom. Thou hast once more <lb/>
let loose my steps, and sent me on a fearful journey. Thou <lb/>
<pb n="250" entity="eaf033v3_0263" pid="uva-lib:349995"/>
hast furnished the means of detecting thy imposture. I <lb/>
will fly to the spot which thou describest. I will ascertain <lb/>
thy falsehood with my own eyes. If she be alive, then am <lb/>
I reserved for the performance of a new crime. My evil <lb/>
destiny will have it so. If she be dead, I shall make <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> <lb/>
expiate.</p>
<p>So saying, he darted through the door, and was gone in <lb/>
a moment, beyond my sight and my reach. I ran to the <lb/>
road, looked on every side, and called; but my calls were <lb/>
repeated in vain. He had fled with the swiftness of a deer.</p>
<p>My own embarrassment, confusion, and terror were <reg orig="inex-|pressible">inexpressible</reg>. <lb/>
His last words were incoherent. They denoted <lb/>
the tumult and vehemence of phrenzy. They intimated his <lb/>
resolution to seek the presence of your wife. I had <reg orig="fur-|nished">furnished</reg> <lb/>
a clue, which could not fail to conduct him to her <lb/>
presence. What might not be dreaded from the interview? <lb/>
Clithero is a maniac. This truth cannot be concealed. <lb/>
Your wife can with difficulty preserve her tranquillity, when <lb/>
his image occurs to her remembrance. What must it be <lb/>
when he starts up before her in his neglected and ferocious <lb/>
guise, and armed with purposes, perhaps as terrible as those, <lb/>
which had formerly led him to her secret chamber, and her <lb/>
bedside?</p>
<p>His meaning was obscurely conveyed. He talked of a <lb/>
deed, for the performance of which his malignant fate had <lb/>
reserved him; which was to ensue their meeting, and which <lb/>
was to afford disastrous testimony of the infatuation which <lb/>
had led me hither.</p>
<p>Heaven grant that some means may suggest themselves <lb/>
to you of intercepting his approach. Yet I know not what <lb/>
means can be conceived. Some miraculous chance may <lb/>
befriend you; yet this is scarcely to be hoped. It is a <reg orig="vis-|ionary">visionary</reg> <lb/>
and fantastic base on which to rest our security.</p>
<p>I cannot forget that my unfortunate temerity has created <lb/>
this evil. Yet who could foresee this consequence of my <lb/>
intelligence. I imagined that Clithero was merely a victim <lb/>
of erroneous gratitude, a slave of the errors of his <reg orig="educa-|tion">education</reg>, <lb/>
and the prejudices of his rank, that his understanding <lb/>
was deluded by phantoms in the mask of virtue and duty, and <lb/>
not as you have strenuously maintained, utterly subverted.</p>
<p>I shall not escape your censure, but I shall, likewise, gain <lb/>
<pb n="251" entity="eaf033v3_0264" pid="uva-lib:349996"/>
your compassion. I have erred, not through sinister or <lb/>
malignant intentions, but from the impulse of misguided, <reg orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg>, <lb/>
but powerful benevolence.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">After</hi> the fatigues of the day, I returned home. As I <lb/>
entered, my wife was breaking the seal of a letter, but, on <lb/>
seeing me, she forbore, and presented the letter to me.</p>
<p>I saw, said she, by the superscription of this letter, who <lb/>
the writer was. So agreeably to your wishes, I proceeded <lb/>
to open it, but you have come just time enough to save me <lb/>
the trouble.</p>
<p>This letter was from you. It contained information <reg orig="rela-|tive">relative</reg> <lb/>
to Clithero. See how imminent a chance it was that <lb/>
saved my wife from a knowledge of its contents. It <reg orig="re-|quired">required</reg> <lb/>
all my efforts to hide my perturbation from her, and <lb/>
excuse myself from showing her the letter.</p>
<p>I know better than you the character of Clithero, and <lb/>
the consequences of a meeting between him and my wife. <lb/>
You may be sure that I would exert myself to prevent a <lb/>
meeting.</p>
<p>The method for me to pursue was extremely obvious. <lb/>
Clithero is a madman, whose liberty is dangerous, and who <lb/>
requires to be fettered and imprisoned as the most atrocious <lb/>
criminal.</p>
<p>I hastened to the chief magistrate, who is my friend, and <lb/>
by proper representations, obtained from him authority to <lb/>
seize Clithero wherever I should meet with him, and <reg orig="effec-|tually">effectually</reg> <lb/>
debar him from the perpetration of new mischiefs.</p>
<p>New York does not afford a place of confinement for <lb/>
lunatics, as suitable to his case as Pennsylvania. I was <lb/>
desirous of placing him as far as possible from the place of <lb/>
my wife's residence. Fortunately there was a packet for <lb/>
Philadelphia, on the point of setting out on her voyage. <lb/>
<pb n="252" entity="eaf033v3_0265" pid="uva-lib:349997"/>
This vessel I engaged to wait a day or two, for the purpose <lb/>
of conveying him to Pennsylvania hospital. Meanwhile, <lb/>
proper persons were stationed at Powles-hook, and at the <lb/>
quays where the various stageboats from Jersey arrive.</p>
<p>These precautions were effectual. Not many hours after <lb/>
the receipt of your intelligence, this unfortunate man applied <lb/>
for a passage at Elizabethtown, was seized the moment he <lb/>
set his foot on shore, and was forthwith conveyed to the <lb/>
packet, which immediately set sail.</p>
<p>I designed that all these proceedings should be concealed <lb/>
from the women, but unfortunately neglected to take suitable <lb/>
measures for hindering the letter, which you gave me reason <lb/>
to expect on the ensuing day, from coming into their hands. <lb/>
It was delivered to my wife in my absence, and opened <reg orig="im-|mediately">immediately</reg> <lb/>
by her.</p>
<p>You know what is, at present, her personal condition. <lb/>
You know what strong reasons I had to prevent any danger <lb/>
or alarm from approaching her. Terror could not assume <lb/>
a shape more ghastly than this. The effects have been what <lb/>
might have been easily predicted. Her own life has been <lb/>
imminently endangered, and an untimely birth has blasted <lb/>
my fondest hope. Her infant, with whose future existence <lb/>
so many pleasures were entwined, <hi rend="italic">is dead.</hi></p>
<p>I assure you, Edgar, my philosophy has not found itself <lb/>
lightsome and active under this burden. I find it hard to <lb/>
forbear commenting on your rashness in no very mild terms. <lb/>
You acted in direct opposition to my counsel, and to the <lb/>
plainest dictates of propriety. Be more circumspect and <lb/>
more obsequious for the future.</p>
<p>You knew the liberty that would be taken of opening my <lb/>
letters; you knew of my absence from home, during the <lb/>
greatest part of the day, and the likelihood, therefore, that <lb/>
your letters would fall into my wife's hands before they <lb/>
came into mine. These considerations should have prompted <lb/>
you to send them under cover to Whitworth or Harvey, with <lb/>
directions to give them immediately to <hi rend="italic">me.</hi></p>
<p>Some of these events happened in my absence, for I <reg orig="de-|termined">determined</reg> <lb/>
to accompany the packet myself, and see the <reg orig="mad-|man">madman</reg> <lb/>
safely delivered to the care of the hospital.</p>
<p>I will not torture your sensibility by recounting the <reg orig="inci-|dents">incidents</reg> <lb/>
of his arrest and detention. You will imagine that <lb/>
<pb n="253" entity="eaf033v3_0266" pid="uva-lib:349998"/>
his strong, but perverted reason exclaimed loudly against <lb/>
the injustice of his treatment. It was easy for him to <reg orig="out-|reason">out-reason</reg> <lb/>
his antagonist, and nothing but force could subdue <lb/>
his opposition. On me devolved the province of his jailor <lb/>
and his tyrant; a province which required a heart more <lb/>
steeled by spectacles of suffering and the exercise of cruelty <lb/>
than mine had been.</p>
<p>Scarcely had we passed The Narrows, when the lunatic, <lb/>
being suffered to walk the deck, as no apprehensions were <lb/>
entertained of his escape in such circumstances, threw <lb/>
himself overboard, with a seeming intention to gain the <lb/>
shore. The boat was immediately manned, the fugitive <lb/>
was pursued, but at the moment, when his flight was <reg orig="over-|taken">overtaken</reg>, <lb/>
he forced himself beneath the surface, and was seen <lb/>
no more.</p>
<p>With the life of this wretch, let our regrets and our <reg orig="fore-|bodings">forebodings</reg> <lb/>
terminate. He has saved himself from evils, for <lb/>
which no time would have provided a remedy, from <reg orig="linger-|ing">lingering</reg> <lb/>
for years in the noisome dungeon of a hospital. Having <lb/>
no reason to continue my voyage, I put myself on board a <lb/>
coasting sloop, and regained this city in a few hours. I <lb/>
persuade myself that my wife's indisposition will be <reg orig="tempo-|rary">temporary</reg>. <lb/>
It was impossible to hide from her the death of <reg orig="Cli-|thero">Clithero</reg>, <lb/>
and its circumstances. May this be the last arrow <lb/>
in the quiver of adversity! Farewell.</p>
