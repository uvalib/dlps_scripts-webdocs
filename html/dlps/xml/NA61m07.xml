                <p> Addie describes a recent visit with George Moore who brought news of Charlie's
                    own Company H, and provides details of an unwanted evening visit from James
                    Beebe. She mentions her plans for the upcoming Winter and Spring, and becomes
                    passionate when describing a lecture she attended by missionary Rev. Dr.
                    (Cooley?), reflecting on the possibility that the present war might free America
                    from &ldquo;the curse of slavery&rdquo;. </p>

                    <salute>Dear <name type="recipient">Charlie</name>
                    </salute>
                    <lb/>
                </opener>

                <p> Do you not think I should<lb/> be thankful for the long list of letters<lb/> I
                    have received from Mr. Tenney during<lb/> the past two months? Have you not<lb/>
                    written to me? I think I have not<lb/> been the happy recipient of one
                    letter<lb/> from my friend Charlie since Capt.<lb/> Aspen returned to his
                    company.<lb/> I thought it strange. If Hal had<lb/> not been with you I should
                    have thought<lb/> you <unclear>was</unclear> ill.<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> Mr. George Moore was here yesterday. he said<lb/> you were well. I inquired of
                    all those<lb/> I know in Co. H. We spoke of you<lb/> (now don't feel flattered)
                    in very pleasing<lb/>
                    <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0310"/> terms. I showed him the sketch of<lb/>
                    Weston that you sent me. He pronounced<lb/> it very natural with the exception
                    of<lb/> an old log back of the Camp<del hand="h1">that</del> where<lb/>
                    Wash. <unclear/> slept one night. He then<lb/> related the circumstance which,
                    perhaps<lb/> you know better than myelf.<lb/> Camp Dennison, he said looked
                    almost<lb/> like home.<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> Oh, Charlie I had some sport the other<lb/> evening. James Beebe came here. I
                    was busily<lb/> reading one of Hal's letters when I heard<lb/> a rather timid
                    rap on the door. I arose<lb/> and opened when who should appear but<lb/> said
                    Beebe. I seated a chair for him and<lb/> resumed my reading - You know how
                    I<lb/> detest him - He hemmed a few times took<lb/> his hat and laid on the
                    floor then drew<lb/> his chair near the table and took up<lb/> an ambrotype,
                    which he had seen time<lb/>
                    <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0311"/> after time. But he must do
                    something<lb/> I presume he felt more like a man with<lb/> that before him than
                    waiting in awkward<lb/> silence for me to make a move. But not<lb/> long did he
                    wait. I arose with &ldquo;Do you<lb/> wish to see my father! I will call
                    him.&ldquo;<lb/> And stepped toward the door.
                    &ldquo;<unclear>Ahem</unclear><lb/> Miss Addie,&rdquo; he stammered out,
                    I turned<lb/> &ldquo;I - I thought I'd call and see if you'd<lb/> let me
                    stay with you a little while&rdquo;<lb/> he at last said. I told him -
                    well<lb/> guess what. At that moment he<lb/> heard father coming toward the
                    door<lb/> when he sprang and went out like<lb/> a deer, leaving me so
                    convulsed<lb/> with laughter that it was some<lb/> time after father came in
                    before<lb/> I could explain to him.<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> Would that I could describe that <sic corr="man's">mans</sic><lb/> looks as he
                    sat by the table<lb/>
                </p>

                <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0312"/>
                <p> I shall live at my aunt's and<lb/> attend school at east Mecca this winter<lb/>
                    and in the spring go to Oberlin.<lb/> I had thought I should go to O<lb/> this
                    winter but found I could not prepare<lb/> myself. I was some what disappointed
                    when<lb/> I found I could not go. But we have to<lb/> meet disappointments.<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> I attended a lecture a few evenings<lb/> since of one of our missionaries.
                    And<lb/> it seemed as if I never heard of<lb/> such a mind as that man
                    possessed<lb/> The quick thoughts glowing with poetic<lb/> imagery. the fervid
                    eloquence seemed<lb/> to lift the hearer to some lofty stand<lb/> point and I
                    could almost see the<lb/> far <unclear>famed</unclear> luxuriance of Eastern<lb/>
                    chimes, or behold the vast crowds held<lb/> in thralldom of debasing errors
                    till<lb/> my heart glowed to stretch forth my hand<lb/> to those perishing ones
                    and pluck them<lb/> as &ldquo;<unclear>brands</unclear> from the
                    burning&rdquo;<lb/>
                </p>

                <p> And thus I compared them with the<lb/> vast numbers of slaves held in
                    subjugation<lb/> in my own country. This beautiful America!<lb/> It was then
                        I <hi rend="underline">prayed</hi> that this war<lb/> might <hi
                        rend="underline">never</hi> close<del hand="h1"
                    >sh</del> <unclear>until</unclear> our land<lb/> should be freed from the curse of<lb/>
                    <pb n="5" entity="DSSR_000000766_0313"/> slavery. The gentleman's<lb/> name was
                    Rev. Mr. <unclear>Cooley</unclear>.<lb/> As I gazed on that man<lb/> I thought
                    &ldquo;How many noble sentiments<lb/> are cherished in the heart which
                    are<lb/> never brought to light, because the<lb/> energy necessary to carry them
                    into<lb/> effect is wanting. A few untoward<lb/> circumstances are enough to
                    dampen<lb/> the zeal and put an end to the finest<lb/>
                    suggestions.&rdquo;<lb/>
                </p>
