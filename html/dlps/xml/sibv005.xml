<p>The creation of a literary executor spawns difficulties, but for
the literary executor himself one problem comes first. It is not
simply that he will be doomed to anonymity. Literary historians,
though they frequently owe a debt to literary executors, seldom
mention them. But literary executors are not always forgotten, as
in the case of the triumvirate who acted as trustees for the
Boswell papers, or that of the Rev. Dr. Rufus Wilmot Griswold who
became infamous as the posthumous bedeviler of Edgar Allan Poe.
Among shades like these the literary executor may hope to seek his
modest immortality. This is the hope of a future existence. Yet the
chief problem for the practising literary executor is that only too
often he faces the actuality of a present non-existence.</p>

<p>The typical last will and testament of a writer mentions
specifically the person or persons to whose care he entrusts the
disposition and use of his literary remains. Realizing that there
will still be unpublished manuscripts after his decease, as well as
correspondence and other personal material relating to his career,
and recognizing&mdash;even hoping for&mdash;biographical and critical
studies dependent on these, the writer looking toward posterity
relies on a designated literary executor to be responsible and
loyal to his memory. Since such a literary executor should be
skilled as well as sympathetic, the proper person for the task is
not always to be found in the immediate family of the writer or
among his heirs. Too much is at stake for the nomination to be made
carelessly. Normally he will search among his friends for the right
one; sometimes he will turn to an acquaintance.</p>

<p>A typical designation of a literary executor is that made by
Mrs. Edith Wharton in her will, which reads:

<q>I nominate and appoint Gaillard Lapsley Fellow of Trinity
College of Cambridge England to be my literary executor, and I
hereby direct him to carry out this task in accordance with
instructions left by me in my papers and with the assistance of
anyone he may choose to call upon.</q>

<pb n="005.004"/>

A responsibility has been created in such an instance, but not a
legal existence. Under this or any similar nomination there is no
such thing at law as a literary executor. Under such circumstances
he has no legal standing, he does not execute, and he has no
powers. Literary remains are property, and are merely one
part&mdash;though frequently a chief part&mdash;of the total property of
the estate. As such, literary remains can be executed only by the
true executors of the estate. At best the "literary executor"&mdash;to
use that improper terminology, when he is not fully empowered as an
executor&mdash;exists only in an advisory capacity. He may, as an
expert both in literary problems and the wishes of the deceased,
help the executors or beneficiaries in the disposition of the
property concerned. But if the executors or heirs are, for one
reason or another, unfriendly to the nominee, they may disregard
him entirely and act toward the shadow of a wish as though he were
merely a shadow.
The fact that he has been designated in the will is not irrelevant
but it is not binding.</p>

<p>This situation is a matter of considerable surprise to many
writers who may already have appointed or are contemplating the
appointment of a literary executor on terms similar to those by
which Mrs. Wharton named Gaillard Lapsley. It may also be, though
hardly in her case, a matter of potential danger. For the writer is
not always given the protection after death, which he thinks he has
ensured. It is also a matter of significance to scholars and to
institutions. What it means is that no literary executor of this
type can himself give legal permission either for the use of or
disposition of literary property, but that such legal permission
for use or such legal deed of gift can be obtained only from the
true executors or the beneficiaries of the estate, whose interests
may be financially or otherwise affected.</p>

<p>There is more than idle possibility of difference of opinion
between a literary executor and others concerned with the estate.
The gift of literary remains to an institution may, though it
ultimately benefits the reputation of the writer, deprive the
residual estate of immediate financial benefits possibly to be
derived from their sale. The appropriate disposition of material of
a sensational nature is another case in possible issue. Even the
matter of using non-sensational material may occasion dispute, as
in the instance of a choice among applicants for the privilege of
writing a biography. Or one might cite, as specifically
representative of more general problems, an instance in which some
well-known dramatist might leave among his papers a manuscript play
which has purposely remained unproduced and unpublished. There are
various and understandable reasons for such a postponement: the
play might have seemed to be of a too personal though
non-sensational nature,
or the author might simply but shrewdly have been moved by the
possibility of providing an inheritance

<pb n="005.005"/>

without undue burden of taxation. If the literary executor held
final powers in himself, he might decide (a) that the prestige
given by an eventual first production would be of immeasurable help
to some little theatre or theatrical festival in which the
dramatist had been or might have been interested; or (b) that the
artistic prestige of the playwright required its initial production
by a distinguished theatrical company but at lower financial
returns than other companies would offer; or (c) that the
spectacular fees from Hollywood or the television studios would,
despite the necessary temporary revisions of the script, more than
compensate for artistic considerations. But in this case as in
others easy to conjecture, the ordinarily designated literary
executor cannot decide; he can only advise, and have for his
slender consolation the fact that because he has no legal existence
he cannot be sued either for damages or in restraint of action.</p>

<p>There are other potential problems affected by his legal status
or lack of it. In the case of Mrs. Wharton's will, she mentioned
specifically that her literary executor was "to carry out this task
in accordance with instructions left by me in my papers." Precisely
what those instructions were I do not know, but one can assume
their nature from the instructions which accompanied the gift of
her papers to the Yale University Library. These read:

<q>The correspondence and other letters and papers of a
biographical sort shall not be accessible until thirty years after
they have been received by the University Library.</q>

There is no question as to Mrs. Wharton's intent. She felt that the
facts of her life would be of interest to the future, and that they
might be of altogether too much interest to the present. Yet since
these wishes were not apparently a part of the actual will but
existed only in a supplementary letter of instruction, they were in
no way legally binding either on the true executors or the heirs,
and might therefore have been ignored. Under certain circumstances,
financial or otherwise, even the worthiest efforts of a
non-implemented literary executor might have been fruitless.</p>

<p>In instances where there have been instructions for the
destruction of manuscripts, or the prevention of their publication,
whether permanently or for a limited period, only a specific clause
in the will to that effect would have made the instructions legally
binding. There are of course numerous instances where a decision
has been necessary. Emily Dickinson's sister, Lavinia, destroyed
most of her sister's correspondence immediately after her death,
believing this to be her sister's wish. Somewhat later, however,
she found large quantities of poems, and made every effort to
preserve these and arrange for their publication. Edward Taylor,
the American poet who died in 1729, is said in Sibley's
<hi rend="italic">Biographical</hi>

<pb n="005.006"/>

<hi rend="italic">Sketches of Graduates of Harvard University</hi>&mdash;there
is no
documentary instruction&mdash;to have given "orders that his heirs
should never publish any of his writings," although Taylor
obviously did not call for the destruction of the manuscripts
themselves. Eventually in 1937 these were in part published, but
only after the legal opinion was given that "there is no present
legal force to such an instruction if it existed, and that if the
University lawfully possesses these manuscripts the instruction
does not legally interfere with their publication." "Personally,"
the legal counsel continued, "I can see no moral obligations after
such a lapse of time." The moral situation is obvious; the legal
situation has perhaps been helped by the passage of time. Franz
Kafka left instructions to Max Brod, his literary executor, that
his unfinished novels were to be destroyed. They were not; and if
on publication these did not seem to be Kafka's masterpieces, they
are at least cherished.
Perhaps the most intriguing solution of a problem in this category
was that made in the case of a nineteenth-century literary figure
who left instructions that his manuscripts were to be destroyed.
Among his papers was much unpublished writing of obvious merit.
What in fact happened was that the heirs made copies of all these
papers and then burned the originals. One can sympathize with the
heirs and be grateful to them, but one does not know whether the
author's wish was revealed orally, by written letter of
instruction, or by a clause in the will. It might have made a
difference to everyone, even to the deceased. I can sympathize also
with the heirs of a well-known writer, still living, who has made
it clear that he wishes no biography of himself. But since, as
Serge Koussevitzky discovered, biographies cannot be prevented even
in lifetime (though biographical novels may be regarded as
invasions of privacy), biographies of this writer will certainly be
written.
Are these heirs to help to make these inevitable biographies as
accurate as possible by their assistance, or are they, following
his wish, to permit the biographers to proceed in darkness?
Sometimes there appear to be considerations beyond the particular
quirks or even the modesty of the deceased. But at least it should
be evident that the writer who wishes to enforce his own intentions
on the future may not always be able to do so through the simple
nomination of an instructed literary executor, or at best to do so
only within limits. For all decisions must be confirmed by the
estate or heirs, under the limitations binding the average literary
executor. The literary executor who is only that, can demand
nothing (not even the sight of documents) as by his right, and he
exists only by courtesy.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, for a writer to act more definitively
than he usually does, by eliminating the distinction between the
"literary executor" and the other or true executors, or between him
and the heirs. He

<pb n="005.007"/>

may, for example, in order to effect the latter solution, make the
literary executor a beneficiary by bequeathing to him the physical
possession of properly defined literary remains, with powers to use
them at his discretion. This may be done with or without giving
this beneficiary the financial proceeds from the copyright aspects
of the remains. But the literary executor whose physical property
the papers now under these circumstances become, and to whom access
to the papers cannot be denied (as is otherwise possible), can as
their owner dispose of this physical property as he may choose, or
permit their publication by right of the directive phrase: "at his
discretion." The revenue from publication may flow to other heirs,
but such a legal right obviates any discussion over the
appropriateness of the financial returns. It will not, of course,
remove the possibility of controversy or suit in relation to the
possibility of libel,
for which the literary executor under these circumstances may be
sued if libel against any living person, including descendents, can
be proved to result from publication.</p>

<p>An alternative solution, in order to effect the elimination of
the distinction between literary executor and true executor, would
be to designate as a co-executor of the estate&mdash;that is, not
simply as literary executor&mdash;someone whose particular
<hi rend="italic">forte</hi>
is his knowledge of literary affairs. He will then be, so to speak,
a specialist on an executive board, but one endowed with the
fullest powers possible to any single executor. The limitation or
definition of the powers of any individual executor may vary from
state to state, but in any instance far more than merely advisory
power will be given. There are certain pleasant or appropriate
advantages to such an arrangement which go beyond the question of
power, for by this procedure one can ensure to the literary
executor the compensation normally received for executorial duties.
It should be remembered, however, that such a full executorial
appointment gives, in many instances,
powers over matters beyond the purely literary, and warning might
be taken if there are dangers in too celibate a literary skill
unwedded to other capabilities. Sinclair Lewis was certainly aware
of the fact that though he chose a poet as one of his true
executors, the poet was also a lawyer and a member of the firm
which handled his legal affairs. But in any event, or at least not
uncommonly, even when the literary executor becomes a true
executor, he will if there are other executors have only one vote
in decisions; and although "one on the side of the Lord" may, as
idealists used to repeat, be "a divine majority," more mundane
decisions are not made in this fashion. Nothing has been ensured
definitively. The independent decision of a specialist on literary
matters may be irresistible but is not of itself always final.</p>




<p>An interesting recognition both of the powers and the
limitations in

<pb n="005.008"/>

respect to a future situation is to be found in the will of Miss
Willa Cather, the seventh paragraph of which reads as follows:

<q>I direct that my Executors and Trustee shall not lease, license
or otherwise dispose of the following rights in literary properties
written by me, viz: dramatization, whether for the purpose of
spoken stage presentation or otherwise, motion picture, radio
broadcasting, television and rights of mechanical reproduction,
whether by means now in existence or which may hereafter be
discovered or perfected; and I further direct that neither my
Executors nor my Trustee shall consent to, or permit, the
publication in any form whatsoever, of the whole, or any part of
any letter or letters written by me in my lifetime, nor the use,
exploitation or disposal of any other right therein.</q>

<q>Realizing that certain of said rights in literary properties
written by me may vest in my legatees under the provisions of this
Will upon the renewal of copyrights therein, and that the right to
publish letters written by me, and other rights in said letters,
may ultimately vest in my legatees or distributees, I earnestly
request such of my legatees and distributees as may acquire said
rights neither to lease, license or otherwise dispose of any of
them, nor to permit others to exercise such rights. It is not my
intention, however, in making the provisions set forth in this
paragraph "Seventh", to charge either my Executors, Trustee,
legatees or distributees with the duty of bringing legal
proceedings to restrain the unauthorized use of said rights, but I
leave it to the sole and uncontrolled discretion of my Executors
and Trustee in each instance, whether to proceed by legal action to
prevent the exercise of any of such rights.</q>

Miss Cather was a woman of public reticence and of strong will.
Like Mrs. Wharton she wished to avoid any public viewing of
herself, but Miss Cather's will recognizes certain difficulties in
regard to the future. This difficulty is indicated in the shift
from her initial "I direct" to the second and precatory "I
earnestly request." For when by the renewal of copy-rights the
title to her literary properties rests with the legatees or
distributees, or when the property rights to both paper and words
rest squarely in them, theirs is the right to say what is done with
this property, and theirs is the decision as to whether her
"earnest request" is to be respected. The future must make its own
decisions. All Miss Cather could do was to make the future as
remote as possible.</p>

<p>The way of a properly designated executor is comparatively sure;
but the average "literary executor" can follow the path only by
courtesy extended to him. Yet, fortunately, such courtesy is
common. If the law is against him, ordinary practice is for him.
Both the true executors and the heirs are customarily only too
willing to place the burden of judgment, and frequently what is
tantamount to responsibility for its exercise, upon the one named
in the will to carry out such matters. The literary executor may
not in many instances have any legal status, but he has an immense
moral responsibility both to the living and to the dead. In most
instances, except when he is a true executor, he receives no fee.
Yet because

<pb n="005.009"/>

he has an occupation of his own, the time and thought which he must
spend as literary executor is at the expense either of his
occupation or his leisure. What he does, he does willingly; but it
is under a handicap.</p>

<p>Since the chief concern of the deceased was usually his writing,
the literary executor takes on as his side-line what is the virtual
administration of some one else's chief line. The literary papers
must be gone over and put into order. This in itself can be a
full-time occupation for many months. Titles and copyrights ought
to be put into order also, often when there are no funds for
clerical or legal assistance. Most of all there is the writer's
literary reputation to be preserved and enhanced. There is always
the question of posthumous publication: whether it should be made,
when it should be made, and how it can be made. There are critical
articles and studies to be encouraged. Happily, these will, as in
the case of F. Scott Fitzgerald, result in the achievement of a
stature never known in the writer's own lifetime. The writer's
miscellaneous published works ought to be brought together and made
generally available.
<hi rend="italic">The Collected Poems of John Peale Bishop</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
Collected Essays of John Peale Bishop</hi> were the consequence of
literary executorship. The critical essays published on him after
his death, as well as the reviews of the collections just
mentioned, were not only tributes but services. They helped to
establish the public memory of him. Gertrude Stein never enjoyed
the critical interest in her lifetime which her work is now
beginning to receive. After establishing the portrait of her
magnetic character, an emphasis is now being made on the substance
of her work. The result is not an accident, and it is not a
miracle. Nor is it undeserved, but time is being helped.</p>

<p>There is also the problem for the literary executor of the
proper biography which most, though not all, writers both yearn for
and expect. It is not a question of "first come, first served," as
many enthusiastic suitors are unhappily surprised to discover. But
it is not always appropriate for the literary executor to wait. One
recalls the unfortunate consequences for Herman Melville. The
privilege promised by Mrs. Melville to a friend was never
accomplished; then the enthusiasm of another and younger man waned;
other subsequent attempts were never carried through. Perhaps it
might be argued that in Melville's case the resultant mystery
helped. The normal literary executor of the normal literary writer
could hardly, however, be expected to count on this; and the past
is full of anonymous shades.</p>

<p>Finally, because death will come for the literary executor too,
and perhaps because having no existence he cannot appoint a
successor to himself, there is the problem of the eventual
disposition of the actual papers in such a way that both the writer
and the public will best be served

<pb n="005.010"/>

in the limitless years which stretch ahead. All these tasks of the
literary executor are not thankless ones, but they are
considerable.</p>

<p>The mass of papers, literary manuscripts and other memorabilia
which the average writer leaves among his remains is formidable.
One can suggest many reasons why this problem should be an
increasing one. The painstaking collection and analysis of literary
documents of the past has, on the part of scholars, pointed up the
value of such material, and has led writers to the day-by-day
preservation of documents whose importance is constantly emphasized
to them by collectors, scholars, and the alluring examples of book
catalogues and auction records. Any writer is likely to regard
himself not only as a Boswell but his heirs like Boswell's. Thus
not only final manuscripts and literary correspondences have been
saved, but, because of the interest in the study of the creative
process, early notes and drafts are preserved which might once have
been destroyed as no longer useful to the writer.
The careful study by scholars of every scrap referring to
biographical incidents or family influences, as well as an
increasing lack of reticence on the part of writers and scholars,
have led to the preservation of certain categories of documentation
beyond perhaps even the consequences of the natural instinct of
anyone to squirrel away souvenirs of the past. The waste-basket has
been replaced by the literary muniment-room.</p>

<p>A letter from Hervey Allen, written to me very shortly before
his death, gives some idea of what his literary executor must have
faced. "Actually," he wrote, "<hi rend="italic">my</hi> problem is quite a complex
one."</p>

<q>I am a very methodical person in regard to records and
correspondence. Over the years there has been an unbelievable
number&mdash;thousands&mdash;of letters from people all over the world,

literary and otherwise, and these have all been kept in carefully
annotated and organized files, together with the replies. Amongst
these letters are quite a number from most of my contemporaries. In
addition to that, there are all the manuscripts of the several
books, and the complete story of their publication,&mdash;reviews,
comments, and all that goes with it. Scattered through this are all
the business files of the administration of my own and several
family estates. At the present time, part of this horde is stored
at West Palm Beach, Florida [Mr. Allen was then living at Miami],
representing the files and materials of about ten years at
"Bonfield," on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. I am now engaged in
arranging for a shed in which to store this material down here,
and get it all together with the correspondence of the war years,
and the publication of books that have taken place since. In other
words, to get the whole mass of material together and properly
arranged in its sequence of monthly and yearly files. In doing
that, I am calling in from Rinehart and Company, and other places,
certain material which they have. Part of this is forced upon me
because I must have, easily available and on hand, the records of
the past years, in order to satisfy the Internal Revenue
Department, which is forever pestering me with questions that must
be completely and intimately answered as to why I did certain
things in the past. As at the present time I am

<pb n="005.011"/>

paying income taxes and agents' fees, etc. etc., in some twenty-one
countries, you can see how complex it is, and yet how
necessary.<ref target="f005.01.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref></q>


<p>Hervey Allen was unusually methodical, and in many ways was his
own literary executor, doing himself what anyone else, without the
advantage of his intimate knowledge of himself, would have been
forced to do for him. Most writers are not so methodical, but their
problems are similarly complex and ultimately compelling. Normally
there are left, for the literary executor, simply crammed trunks,
paper cartons in corners of attics, or miscellany in incredible
closets like that which William Rose Ben&eacute;t used to refer to as
his "glory hole." The papers of Alfred Stieglitz contained over
fifty thousand items from more than ten thousand correspondents.
The letters to Gertrude Stein now occupy eight well-filled drawers
of filing cabinets; no one has ever had time to count them. Her
literary manuscripts occupy shelf upon library shelf of black
boxes. The papers of Mabel Dodge Luhan, who has wisely given up any
even unwitting emulation of Hervey Allen,
can be calculated only in terms of the 1575 pounds of literary
remains which arrived at the Yale Library, and which are still
being added to. These figures are of course niggardly in comparison
to the 500,000 individual documents left by Josephus Daniels; or
the 1,500,000 by Gifford Pinchot; or the approximately 3,000,000 by
Franklin D. Roosevelt. But though not so deep as the Grand Canyon,
nor so broad as some frontiers, "'twill do" for the literary
executor.</p>

<p>What does this mean in terms of his task? It means that until
the literary executor knows what exists, he cannot use it properly.
It means that the best he can hope to do at the beginning is to
toss every letter to the deceased into one pile, and every
manuscript by the deceased into another. This is at least a
beginning. The literary executor can only pray for the postponement
of the inevitable day when he will begin to receive requests by
mail, or even visitors at his doorstep, who wish to use the letters
which the deceased received or is thought to have received from
whoever it is about whom the applicant is writing a biography or
critical examination, a dissertation or an article. Then comes for
the literary executor the task either of providing copies (which
must of course be true copies) or of risking the originals to
unknown hands. Frequently the request has seemed modest to him who
has made it:
he asks only that the literary executor sort out the letters (being
sure that nothing has been omitted), and then study them in order
to confirm or deny the questioner in whatever may independently
have been deduced. Superficially regarded,

<pb n="005.012"/>

such requests might seem easily denied. When a doctoral candidate
has requested the shipment of all correspondence and manuscripts
either directly to him or, "for safe-keeping," to the local public
library in the hamlet where he teaches high school, in order for
him to do a "definitive critical biography," the decision is less
difficult. But it must be remembered that in order to keep the name
of the deceased before the public, and emphasize the importance of
his relationships and hence of himself, one of the best means is to
have him cited as frequently as possible. Most requests are both
legitimate and welcome. So, sooner or later, the correspondence
must be ordered and the literary executor must become a research
assistant for others.</p>

<p>In the past it was not uncommon for correspondence to a writer
to be returned to the originator. Such a propriety was observed,
for example, by Horace Walpole, whose will requested "that all such
manuscript letters which shall be in my possession at my death that
shall not concern or relate to my estate or effects and shall be
written by any person who shall be living at that time may be
returned to the person or persons by whom the same were written. .
. ." Today, however, all categories of letters to a writer are more
commonly regarded as an aspect of his own personality, and retained
among the whole.</p>

<p>There is also the second pile of papers consisting of the
manuscripts of the author's own composition. Starting to work with
these, the literary executor must determine what has already been
published and what has not, or whether a particular manuscript is
an earlier draft of a work or a later, definitive revision. There
is nothing easy about discovering what an author has published,
especially if he is a poet or a contributor to periodicals. While
most writers mean to keep track of things, few of them actually do.
Comparatively few authors have had the distinction of
bibliographies prepared during their life. Consequently one of the
first tasks of the literary executor is to turn bibliographer, or
if not that then at least a check-lister. Otherwise, and awkwardly,
he may publish something which has already appeared in print. There
are innumerable possibilities of error,
not forgetting the recent incident when a poem "written by Miss
Millay when she was twelve" turned out on publication in a magazine
actually to have been her transcript of "Nest Egg" from Stevenson's
<hi rend="italic">A Child's Garden of Verses</hi>. As Vincent Sheean somewhat
tortuously explained in the next issue of <hi rend="italic">Vogue:</hi> "On the
death of any real person innumerable phenomena ensue. Amongst these
is the tendency on the part of all who have known that person to
exaggerate the reality which has set the true one apart." The
consequences may be occasionally unhappy, but there are few
practising literary executors who will be without sympathy for the
errors.</p>

<pb n="005.013"/>

<p>The importance of the check-list becomes more imperatively
evident, however, in terms of the possibility that the literary
executor, without it as guide, may permit copyright to lapse. Since
the question of copyright is of the utmost significance, the
literary executor must make himself at least an amateur on
copyright matters.</p>

<p>American copyright law is based on the power of Congress,
outlined in Article One, section eight, of the Constitution:

<q>To promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing
for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive rights to
their respective writings and discoveries.</q>

This copyright period, or monopoly, extends for twenty-eight years
after the initial copyright has been taken out, with the right of
renewal for a similar period on the part of the author or his
immediate heirs. After this second period, or after the first if
the initial copyright is not renewed, the writing enters into the
public domain and may be printed without fee or permission. Since
the American philosophy of copyright law is based not on the
principle of protecting the author but rather, ultimately, of
protecting public interest while giving the period of monopoly
simply as an inducement to the author to contrive the expression of
ideas, there is no sympathy for anyone who has failed to follow the
letter of the law. The intent of the copyright monopoly was
pointedly expressed by the late Chief Justice Hughes when he said:
"The sole interest of the United States and the primary object in
conferring the monopoly lie in the general benefits derived by the
public from the labors of authors" (<hi rend="italic">Fox Film Corp.</hi> v.
<hi rend="italic">Doyal,</hi> 286 U.S. 123, 127; 52 S. Ct. 546, 547; 45 L. Ed.
1010). The failure, therefore, to renew the copyright of a book
originally published by a now defunct firm, obviously unable to
remind the writer of his heirs that it is later than they think,
puts the text in the public domain. In the case of publication by
small presses&mdash;as early works so often are&mdash;such an
eventuality
is not at all uncommon. The later appearance of the same text or
texts in subsequently copyrighted books (whose copyright may even
have been renewed) will have no effect on anyone using the earlier
appearance or arrangement. The appearance of an individual
contribution to a composite work,
such as a journal or magazine, may or may not be copyrighted either
as a whole or in the name of the composite author. Each poem,
story, or the like, which appears in a journal or periodical must
have its initial copyright renewed (if it exists at all), if the
item is not to enter the public domain and be free for all. Again,
its subsequent appearance without alteration in a copyrighted book
will not legally alter its status; although it is perfectly true
that, in practice, publishing houses wishing to include such a
technically free item

<pb n="005.014"/>

in an anthology, generally (perhaps lest dog eventually be eaten by
dog) treat the item as though it were properly copyright. It is not
every writer who, to avoid loss, revises texts in order to give
prolonged copyright life to the revised version.</p>

<p>In England the philosophy of copyright is more definitely to
protect the writer, and for that reason overall copyright extends
for a period of fifty years after the death of the writer, before
any item enters the public domain. This applies to all writings by
a particular author, no matter when any one of them may have been
published during his lifetime. On the other hand, in Italy the
copyright reverts after expiration into the hands of the State,
which thereafter licenses all publication. The ideal literary
executor, therefore, will know foreign copyright law as well as his
own. But there are limits to endurance as well as capacity. In the
case of those writers whose works have a considerable market value,
such matters can often be left in the hands of a paid literary
agent. In most cases, especially that of poetry where the returns
are slight and the difficulties many, it is not easy to persuade an
agent to take on such a commission.
The practical literary executor will wish to read some such book as
Ralph R. Shaw's <hi rend="italic">Literary Property in the United States</hi>
(Washington, D. C., Scarecrow Press, 1950), and then turn to a
lawyer. To repeat a chestnut: "'He who is his own lawyer has a fool
as client."</p>

<p>The question of common law literary property rights is somewhat
simpler. A reasonable definition of this aspect of the use of
unpublished texts has been given as "the right to control the
public use of a manuscript up to the moment when it is first
generally published." In the case of unpublished texts written by
the deceased it is clear that the right either to publish or to
prevent publication rests in the hands of the legally designated
literary executor or of the heirs, and this right extends by law
for perpetuity. The limitless endurance of this property right is
of course constantly violated, in the letter of the law, by
scholars, libraries, and the like. In the case, however, of
substantial manuscripts written by Samuel Clemens but now in other
hands, the prevention of publication by others than the heirs is
still maintained. The basic considerations generally to be observed
both by custodians and violators would seem to be those of
financial return,
invasion of privacy, or simply distance of time from the moment of
creation. If the problem is not likely to be great for the literary
executor handling the texts of the deceased, he should however be
aware of the dangers of using correspondence written to the
deceased, if published without the consent of the original writer
of the letter or his heirs. The estate of the deceased owns the
paper and the ink of the letter; it does not own the words in their
particular arrangement. The converse will be true in regard to
letters written by the deceased

<pb n="005.015"/>

to others, permission to use the text of which must be given by the
literary executor or the estate. That is, the recipient may dispose
of the physical property in any way he chooses, even if this means
the destruction of the words; he may not however publish these
words without permission.</p>

<p>The question of what to do with unpublished manuscripts has its
serious aspects as well as embarrassments. Most writers and
families of writers believe, even if secretly, in the merit of
everything that he has set on paper. But not all publishers will
irresistibly agree with them. Financial and critical judgments do
not always coincide even when each is sound. In the case of
Gertrude Stein the amount of unpublished material was considerable.
William Carlos Williams, in his autobiography, gives an amusing
account of his visit to Miss Stein's apartment in Paris:

<q>Tea was served, after or during which Miss Stein went to the
small cabinet, opened it and began to take out her manuscripts, one
at a time, telling us the titles and saying that she hoped some day
to see them printed. I can't remember the exact sequence of what
followed, but one way or another she asked me what I would do were
the unpublished books mine and I were faced with the difficulty she
was experiencing.</q>

<q>It must have been that I was in one of my more candid moods or
that the cynical opinion of Pound and others of my friends about
Miss Stein's work was uppermost in my mind, for my reply was, "If
they were mine, having so many, I should probably select what I
thought were the best and throw the rest into the fire."</q>

<q>The result of my remark was instantaneous. There was a shocked
silence out of which I heard Miss Stein say, "No doubt. But then
writing is not, of course, your <hi rend="italic">m&eacute;tier."</hi></q>

<q>That closed the subject. . . .</q>

But it would not close the subject for a literary executor. Miss
Stein, as it happened, made things easier in her case by providing
in her will for the funds out of which, if necessary, everything
could be published. But such funds do not always exist, though
equivalents of her belief in herself do. It is then that the
literary executor must go about with manuscripts in hand, or seem
to fail both the responsibility to the deceased and the
expectations of the family. It is easy to shift the burden by a
confidence in future generations, but posterity is not
infallible.</p>

<p>Nevertheless to bring everything before the public, even when it
is possible to do so, may not be advisable in terms of the critical
response. No one will ever know whether or not it was better for
Bridges to wait with the manuscripts of Gerard Manley Hopkins. At
moments certain manners of writing are out of critical fashion.
When they are, they are passed over without notice. How is the
literary executor to know what is best to do? Yet in any event some
attention must be called to the writer,

<pb n="005.016"/>

and to this end both friends and students can be stimulated to
help. Sometimes the students and scholars and critics come without
bidding. Should the arms of the literary executor be opened, and
his eyes closed? If the treatment of the writer is sluggishly done,
yet encompasses the majority of fresh data, better men may be
scared off. Particularly in a time when the scholarly profession is
eager for publication, a literary executor is flooded with requests
for material, without any proper idea of what the result will be.
Altogether too often one suspects that he who asks is moved not so
much by interest in the subject as by self-interest. Altogether too
often, also, the suppliant heart is pure but the critical strength
is not the strength of ten. The literary executor is not always the
proper person himself for the precise task at hand, but he is hard
pressed to find the right one for it. And if he does,
he cannot always give <hi rend="italic">carte blanche,</hi> nor can he answer
minute questions speedily and with ease. He seems therefore to
block the way for others, and willy-nilly he slumps, or stumbles
through his shadowy career.</p>

<p>From these many problems the literary executor cannot escape,
nor are they problems to be escaped (indirectly) by persons who
wish to deal with any aspect of a more or less contemporary writer.
But in the handling of the great bulk of material which I have
mentioned as increasingly characteristic, and those demands made on
the literary executor both for ordering and servicing it, there are
possible solutions. The average apartment-dwelling author, no less
than his heirs or his executors, finds it increasingly difficult
simply to house such material, quite apart from the expense of time
and money involved in properly caring for it. For this reason, as
well as for advantages of taxation, an astonishingly large number
of writers are turning over manuscripts and correspondences to
university libraries even during their own life times. Even when
this has not been done, the estate acting through or on the advice
of the literary executor is apt to do the same and for the same
reasons.
Generally speaking, only the physical property rights are conveyed,
while the common law literary property rights or copyrights are
maintained by the estate. Certain advantages are clear. For without
expense to the heirs or to the literary executor, a university
library will put the material into order, and, following the
instructions given to them, will take over the substantial
correspondence about it which inevitably follows as others wish in
one way or another to exploit the material. They will also see, to
further their own interests as well as in gratitude for the
privilege of housing the manuscripts, that the collection is
increased in scope from time to time as opportunities are
presented. They will provide proper working facilities for those
scholars who are privileged to use them, as against the necessary

<pb n="005.017"/>

invasion of the privacy of the literary executor's own study or
office. The university library will even have closing hours, and be
shut on Sundays.</p>

<p>At least the public repository will provide these advantages to
the literary executor, if the proper one has been chosen. The
choice is not always easy. A local historical society, in the
region where the author himself lived in pleasant isolation, may
seem sentimentally appropriate. Local pride will demand the deposit
of material there on the basis of loyalty. But sentiment is not
enough, if there are not proper funds nor skilled personnel to care
for the material as it should be cared for. Nor will the reputation
of the writer be maintained if the chosen library is so remote that
great expense must be incurred by any great number who wish to
consult the materials. Each generation may write its own biography,
and such a biographer will certainly travel anywhere and stay there
until his book is done. But for every biography there can be
hundreds of articles, or references to the writer in minor but
significant connections,
and it is for the authors of these that distance does not lend
enchantment. In such cases the scholar is only too likely to be
unable to go at all. A writer may have been the chief literary
figure of a remote state; a collection of his papers there may give
its aid to the cultivational development of the state, but the
decision in terms of the writer's national reputation (or of
general public interest) will not be an open-and-shut matter. For
writers do belong to the nation as well as to a township.</p>

<p>Nor will the reputation of the writer be helped, no matter where
his papers are placed, if it is the policy of the university
library to restrict the use of the material chiefly to its own
students. Yet such a policy is understandable even if it is somehow
lamentable. Not only are most universities weak in their ability to
provide exploitable material for their students and faculties, but
the expenses which they inevitably and to a substantial degree
incur as custodians must be justified in terms of that library's
particular budget. The donors of papers, like donors of buildings,
must realize that the cost of maintenance cannot often be ignored.
And it is equally true that librarians, like university
administrators, ought constantly to be aware of the implications of
expense which arise from the acceptance of a physical gift. These
are, at any rate, matters for the literary executor to clarify in
his own mind as well as to ensure clarification in the mind of the
donee.
What the literary executor and the estate can themselves escape
through this partial shift of burden to the shoulders of libraries,
the libraries only take on themselves. It is for this reason that
one hears more and more frequently the suggestion that perhaps
libraries in time will insist on either the eventual right to a
proportion of the financial return from the publication of
manuscripts

<pb n="005.018"/>

or at least the immediate funds necessary for an ordering of the
papers. The resolution of the problem of justifying library expense
by restricting the use of manuscripts to a local faculty or their
students seems, in terms of the reputation of the author, often
less than satisfactory.</p>

<p>The matter of regarding the literary papers in a writer's estate
as a marketable asset cannot be ignored by the literary executor,
although it is likely to develop as one of his chief
embarrassments. Many writers have looked on their papers as their
chief benefaction to their heirs. Many writers unfortunately have
little estate beyond these papers. The difficulties attendant upon
marketing these papers are, however, many; and the tension arising
between their status as monument and as financial asset is great
and not easily to be resolved. If the physical possession of the
papers passes through sale into strange and private hands, the
papers are no longer available to the literary executor for those
services which distinguish his duties from those of the ordinary
executor of average property. For the private purchaser of these
papers, their continued use by a literary executor would be to
deprive him of a chief asset as a collector of rarities. Nor will
the papers inevitably be available to scholars or critics for
whatever services they may render to the reputation of the
deceased. The private owner of occasional papers of an author may
be willing to make these available, but it is the unlikely
purchaser of a total literary estate who will either be willing or
able to house and service them in the necessary manner indicated
earlier in this paper. In actual fact it is difficult to find the
individual collector who is willing to take on the burden of such
a collection, especially since he has not usually been able to
purchase the literary rights to this property, and therefore owns
only the paper and ink. How difficult it can be, as well as how
comparatively unrewarding, is indicated in the incident related by
Mr. David Randall, who in his capacity as head of Scribner's rare
book department was asked to market the papers of Thomas Wolfe.
Having vainly peddled the 35,000 pages of Wolfe's own manuscripts
and the 10,000 letters and telegrams for &dollar;5,000, he finally was
able to sell them to a private collector for &dollar;3,000. The collector,
apparently faced with the demands attendant upon owning them, soon
presented the collection to Harvard. Occasionally benefactors are
to be found. The Hervey Allen papers were purchased by the
University of Pittsburgh under a grant from The Buhl Foundation;
the Emily Dickinson papers came to Harvard through the generosity
of an alumnus. A certain degree of luck is, however, necessary for
the sale of any literary estate as a whole. Libraries themselves
are almost never able out of their own limited funds to purchase
what they would so much like to acquire. I can think of at least
three major and desirable literary estates of famous

<pb n="005.019"/>

American authors which are, and in two instances have been for some
years, going begging.</p>

<p>The wish to sell papers as a lot (so that they will preserve the
monumental value of the whole) in order to advantage the heirs
seems generally doomed to disappointment. And if they are sold as
a whole to anyone except to a public institution, there cannot of
course be any real guarantee that the private collector or his
heirs will maintain them as a whole. The papers have become his
physical property, or that of his estate, and he can do with them
what he will. The papers are not likely to be destroyed (though
they could be), but they are likely to be offered for sale in lots.
This, then, would be only to postpone what the literary executor
may have wished to avoid: the damage of the scattering winds of
chance. It is easy, and sometimes profitable, for the literary
executor or the estate simply to split up the papers into lots for
sale on the open market, or to profit from the sale of the more
desirable items. But the monument has disappeared,
and all the advantages that go with it. Once the dispersal takes
place, then it will require a Wilmarth Lewis for a Walpole, or a
Beinecke for a Robert Louis Stevenson, to bring the papers together
again.</p>

<p>There can be no absolute advice on the advantage or propriety of
the sale of literary remains. Everything must inevitably depend
both upon circumstances and exigencies. It is perhaps useful,
however, to suggest how often literary executors and heirs,
sometimes after disappointing attempts to sell the papers or after
they have weighed the advantages to the estate against the
advantages to the memory of the deceased, come in the end to place
them in public institutions where they can do the most good to the
memory of the man who created them and whose monument they
become.</p>

<p>No matter how much the law may emphasize that literary remains
are simply property, like other property, the problems connected
with their use and eventual disposition are special ones. For the
writer, like his products, occupies a peculiar position both in
life and afterwards. The author has had his own life, but in a very
real sense he himself because of his genius has become public
property. Public interest as well as private interest are therefore
involved. Perhaps the principle of copyright provides an analogy to
the situation which the literary executor faces. The writer is
protected to some extent during his lifetime, as though by the
first period of copyright, and for another span afterwards by the
agency of his literary executor who serves in the guise of a
renewal of privacy and monopoly. Thereafter the writer and all his
literary remains actually enter more and more into the public
domain. It is in order to make as easy as possible

<pb n="005.020"/>

the metamorphosis from first stage to last that the literary
executor exists. The execution of this duty is the basic problem
with which the literary executor must be concerned, but for many
others as well as for himself the literary executor is the
embodiment of the problem. <hi rend="italic">Quod erat

<p>It was fifteen years ago this month that I first saw the
manuscript volume which Edward Taylor had assembled during his long
life as pastor in Westfield, Massachusetts. He had labeled it his
"Poetical Works," and bequeathed it at the time of his death in
1729 to his descendants with the injunction that the poems should
never be published. At the time, I thought the problems ahead were
very challenging. And so, no doubt, they were. First of all, would
scholars and lay critics share my belief that Taylor deserved to be
published? Would the Corporation of Yale University&mdash;the legal
heirs&mdash;grant permission in the light of Taylor's prohibition?
Could one learn to read Taylor's handwriting? Most important, would
the pattern of a poet emerge? As I say, this was several years ago,
and seems at this remove, when all the questions are answered, a
simple story. For there was but one heir: a notable institution
that seeks advancement of learning. There was but one manuscript:
a 400-page volume assembled by the author in orderly fashion. The
handwriting was never, or almost never, an obstacle. And there was
no copyright problem at all.</p>

<p>With Emily Dickinson I again feel challenged, and all the
problems seem even more complicated. Perhaps they are. Or perhaps
I'm beginning again. In either event, I accept the challenge and
enjoy the fun. Though Dickinson never requested that her poetry
remain unpublished, the fact is that at the time of her death in
1886 her poems were still in manuscript. The mere handful published
before then either were issued surreptitiously or were anonymous.
She bequeathed them, along with her other effects, to her sister
Lavinia, who with passionate singleness of purpose determined that
they should be known, since to her, at least, Emily was a poet. Had
the poems been left untouched until 1950, then to be transferred
intact to a

<pb n="005.022"/>

learned institution, the parallel with Taylor would be reasonably
obvious. At this point the analogy breaks down.</p>

<p>All who have had access to material touching upon Emily
Dickinson's life and writing agree&mdash;I think without
exception&mdash;that she knew during her twenties that she was
uncommonly gifted; that by the time she was thirty-one, when she
sought advice from Thomas Wentworth Higginson in the now famous
letters written in April, 1862, she did indeed crave assurance
regarding a talent which at times literally overwhelmed her. "Alone
I cannot be," she wrote at this time in a remarkable poem:

<q>
<l>Alone I cannot be;</l>
<l>The hosts do visit me,</l>
<l>Recordless company</l>
<l>Who baffle key.</l>
</q>

How was this gift to be shared? She must have been somewhat
prepared to accept Higginson's hesitation to advise publication,
for it matched the opinion of other writers and critics whom she
knew and respected, gentlemen who knew something of her writing,
notably Samuel Bowles and Josiah Gilbert Holland. She should delay
submitting any letters to the world, they all told her in effect,
until she had learned "control." Since she could no more "control"
the quality of the hosts who visited her than she could alter her
wren-like size, she must therefore, in her own lifetime at any
rate, sublimate her desire for public recognition, however
compelling the wish for it may have been. That the longing was
present seems beyond doubt. In the first place, it was within the
months just preceding her first letter to Higginson that she began
to make copies of her poems, presumably from original drafts that
were then destroyed.
These early original drafts do not now exist and there is no record
that they survived her. Perhaps she disposed of them as, one by
one, she transcribed them into packets or fascicles.</p>

<p>Written fair, these assemblages of anywhere from ten to twenty
transcribed verses are the gatherings, threaded loosely at the
spine, which she laid away in her cherry bureau. The number of
poems so transcribed during the years 1861-62-63 is very large
indeed. On the evidence of stationery and of handwriting&mdash;and much
will be said about both later&mdash;this large body of verse, fully
half of all her extant poems, belongs in these three years. A
packet or two may have been completed as early as 1858, but there
are none at all for the years preceding. In fact there is not to my
knowledge a single poem which in its present transcription can be
safely assigned an earlier date.</p>

<p>The conclusion therefore is inevitable either that she wrote
verses at white heat for a period of three or four years at the
turn of the decade as

<pb n="005.023"/>

she passed her thirtieth year, or that the packets assembled at
that time represent fair copies made from drafts which had been
accumulating for the previous eight or ten years, roughly from the
time she was twenty. Unless the originals, which certainly must
have existed, are recoverable&mdash;and there is no reason to think
they are&mdash;the issue can never be resolved by direct evidence. It
is outside the province of this paper to try conclusions, and the
process of editing the Dickinson papers has not yet advanced to the
point where final speculations are warranted. I cite the problem,
however, as a major example of the nature of the work involved in
establishing a provenance of Emily Dickinson's poetry and the order
of its composition. The task is further complicated by the fact
that she seems to have had no discoverable design in the order of
the packets or of the poems within a packet,
and that since her death the packets have been handled, separated,
and reassembled by several hands. The possibility of confusing the
original order&mdash;if one did in fact exist&mdash;has been multiplied
by
each handling. If these packets represent Emily Dickinson's copying
of her earlier drafts, and if the earlier drafts are irrecoverable,
then an exact chronology of actual composition can never be
established. A <hi rend="italic">terminus ad quem</hi> date must therefore,
certainly for the most part, be all that we can expect for the
poems which we conjecture she composed in her twenties.</p>

<p>So far I have emphasized Emily Dickinson's compulsion to write
poetry and to preserve it as she wrote it, with its half-rimes,
broken stanzas, unexpected figures, even though the advisers she
consulted counseled greater smoothness and regularity, with fewer
oddities of thought. I have pointed out the difficulties that beset
an editor of her poems who attempts to establish chronology, at
least down to 1863 when she seems to have been convinced that
publication in her own lifetime was out of the question. At about
this time she began to develop a new medium for her verse, and a
way of sharing it with her friends. She incorporated whole poems or
parts of them in almost every letter she wrote. Such had not been
markedly true earlier. She had always been a notable letter writer,
from the time that her earliest extant letter, written to her
brother Austin when she was eleven, shadowed forth the sensitive
perceptiveness and originality which are her special genius.
By the time she was thirty her contact with the world, except for
the few members of her immediate family, was almost solely through
correspondence. This she now freighted with poetry. Complete poems
might thus be conveyed. Or it might be but two lines, or a quatrain
from some longer poem recently transcribed into a packet, but here
adapted by the change of a pronoun to apply to a particular
recipient or situation. Sometimes the poems are archly disguised as
prose.</p>

<pb n="005.024"/>

<p>From an editorial point of view such readings must be treated as
variants. Often a letter is solely a poem; it usually is without
salutation, but is signed "Emily." The text of one such was
recently acquired by the Library of Congress. It consists of two
quatrains, and the handwriting as well as the content suggest that
it was inspired by a homesick mood during her enforced stay in
Cambridge where in 1864 she underwent eye treatment. It is written
in pencil, because during these months the physician forbade her to
use a pen.</p>

<p>The poem was first published in the 1894 edition of the
<hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> among those, Mrs. Todd notes, "sent to the Hollands
at various times." Presumably all the Holland letters published in
1894 were returned to Mrs. Holland and subsequently destroyed, but
the poem as it appears in the 1931 edition of the <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> is
printed as two quatrains (not as in 1894 as a single eight-line
stanza), and offers an alternative reading for the fourth line.
Presumably therefore Mrs. Todd had seen another version before she
brought out the 1931 edition.</p>

<p>She sent this letter-poem to some member of her family in
Amherst, probably to Sue, her brother Austin's wife. It presents a
textual problem that is not unusual, and one that is especially
interesting because it may never be satisfactorily solved. The
Library of Congress holograph is the only manuscript version I know
to be extant. It differs from the published versions chiefly in its
fourth line which reads "Is easy, possibly." ("An Emigrant to be /
In a Metropolis of Homes / Is easy, possibly"&mdash;not "Is common
possibility.") And it offers no alternative reading.</p>

<p>At this point an editorial footnote is demanded, and unless
further information alters the conclusion, it will go something
like this: "The letters to Dr. and Mrs. J. G. Holland, published in
1894, were returned to Mrs. Holland after they were transcribed,
and presumably were destroyed. Access to a second manuscript, with
an alternate reading offered for the fourth line, must have
occurred before 1931. The single-stanza version Dickinson sent the
Hollands probably substituted <hi rend="italic">common</hi> for
<hi rend="italic">easy</hi>, and
may have shown no stanza division. Such variants in

<pb n="005.025"/>

wording and stanzaic form are not exceptional when the same
letter-poem is written to more than one correspondent. Unless the
hypothetical second manuscript proves to be extant, and can confirm
the reading of the 1931 text, one queries the substitution of
<hi rend="italic">possibility</hi> for <hi rend="italic">possibly</hi>. Is it a copyist's or
printer's error? It renders the line meaningless and destroys the
meter."</p>

<p>The purpose of any editorial task is to establish as definitive
a text as possible, and to give it a chronology. For Emily
Dickinson, it will be to edit all poems and letters known to exist,
to give them order, and to place in context, as far as possible,
those which, once published, were ultimately destroyed. Of the near
2000 poems known to have been written&mdash;most of them already
published&mdash;a very large number exist in holograph. Of the some
1200 letters, a much greater percentage are still unpublished; and
of those in print, a great many were lost or destroyed subsequent
to publication. For example, Emily Dickinson's correspondence with
her cousins, Fanny and Lou Norcross, was fairly voluminous. It
covered many years and was particularly intimate on a domestic
level. The spinster cousins, shy by nature, permitted use of the
letters for the 1894 edition with the proviso that every personal
allusion to them or to others be deleted.
On that basis the letters appeared, so blue-penciled as at times to
be fairly uninterpretable. They were then returned to the sisters,
and in the manner deemed proper for families of their status, were
destroyed at the time of their death. Much that would help
interpret other letters, or give better insight into Emily herself,
is thus irrecoverable. The Norcross letters, and others which
suffered a like fate, will continue to tantalize, never explain.
But the large number of letters that do still exist are not only
intrinsically important (for Emily Dickinson takes rank as a letter
writer) but are of tremendous importance in understanding her verse
and helping to give it a chronology.</p>

<p>Probably no part of the editing of the Dickinson papers is more
exacting than that which involves establishing chronology. Emily
dated nothing after 1850, and after her death Lavinia with
characteristic thoroughness burned all letters written <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
Emily. Three possibilities are open for assigning dates to the
letters. First there is internal evidence. If it is direct, it is
conclusive: "Father died a year ago today." But it often is
circumstantial. "Perhaps the flowers wilted," she says in a letter
written presumably in late summer, 1880, "because they did not like
the Pelham water." The Amherst water supply was first piped in from
Pelham earlier in that summer. Second, there is the handwriting.
And finally there is the paper that she used. The degree to which
these latter two possibilities can be effective is proportionate to
the mass of manuscripts which can be studied. For Dickinson the
volume is large. I do not hesitate to conjecture

<pb n="005.026"/>

that her manuscripts can be dated within a twelvemonth, when the
handwriting is checked against the evidence of the paper groups. I
will shortly discuss paper groups. Let me say something here about
Emily Dickinson's handwriting.</p>

<p>A scholar's first reaction to placing dependence upon
handwriting as a guide to dating a manuscript is apprehensive
skepticism. Of course handwriting changes, but can the changes be
interpreted in a chronology? I knew at the start that I would be
compelled to seek an answer to the question, but I began with no
assurance I would be led to conclusions which could be accepted.
There are too many human factors. People are subject to moods which
handwriting reflects. You write one way when you are rested, or
another when you are in haste. The size of letters may vary with
the size of the sheet written on, depending on how much you wish to
say in a given space. The form and shape of the characters depend
also upon the implement you use, as well as the quality of the
stationery. A sharp, stiff pen gives results very different from
those formed by a stubby pencil. A glossy ledger sheet permits a
movement of arm, hand, and fingers that rough, resistant linen will
not allow.
Absorbent foolscap is something different still. Finally, I
thought, let anyone allow a manuscript of his own, which he has no
recollection of ever writing, to be placed before him for dating
solely on the basis of the calligraphy; how close can he come?
Within five years? within ten? Perhaps not even that. And if not,
the use of handwriting will be more of a hazard than a help in
attempting to establish a chronology for a poet, where the purpose
is no less than to discover the growth of an artist.</p>

<p>Yet when I had begun the task, which I knew was necessary to
undertake even though the results after many tedious and
discouraging hours might only lead into a blind alley, I found
trustworthy patterns emerging. And now, after a year of intensive
study of the Dickinson handwriting, covering the span of her years,
I feel confident that great reliability can be placed upon a
chronology that derives from it. Bear in mind that we are not
working in a vacuum. Though no poem is ever dated, and no letter
dated after 1850, there are many, many letters that can be assigned
exact dates, either on a given day, or within a week or a month.
For our purposes, that must be considered as close as we can ever
get. Next, there is always the check we can apply by arranging
manuscripts into paper groups. For the undated documents these
three forms of evidence are the only possible ones which can be
used. In many instances,
that is, where no internal evidence is possible and where the paper
is unidentifiable, the handwriting alone must furnish the clue. In
such cases the degree of reliability is lessened. Yet it often
happens that a poem, identifiable only by handwriting, is exactly
duplicated in

<pb n="005.027"/>

another manuscript that can be precisely dated. These cross-checks
appear with enough frequency to buttress the confidence I have in
our procedure. Let me now explain the way the Dickinson handwriting
can be made to tell its story.</p>

<p>First of all, I repeat that the effectiveness with which any
handwriting can be used is proportionate to the mass and coverage
available. We have both here. And obviously one proceeds from the
known to the unknown. Setting the poetry aside to begin with, let
us consider only the letters to which dates can be assigned through
internal evidence. (And here may I digress long enough to say that
photostatic reproductions for such work are essential. They are
expendable. They can be handled, arranged, cut, and pasted onto
charts for purposes of comparing formation of letter, line slants,
the length of ascenders and descenders of g's, f's, p's, and so on;
and in Emily Dickinson's case they tellingly reveal the story of
her linked and unlinked letters.)</p>

<p>My preliminary conclusion, reached after a tentative examination
of all datable letters, is one I still hold: That it will be
possible to assign a given year to any manuscript of sufficient
length from evidence of handwriting alone. Such a calendar year
must be assumed to extend a few months backward or forward. But
with those reservations in mind, a chronology is possible within
fairly limited periods in which manuscripts&mdash;and this is
important&mdash;may be given their <hi rend="italic">relative association</hi>. The

second conclusion was that all writing in ink could be judged by
commonly applicable rules, but that another set of rules applies to
the writing in pencil. I prepared a loose-leaf notebook which would
allow incorporation of specimens of four pieces of writing from
each year of undated material&mdash;from 1850 to 1886. The plan was to
place a photostat of two handwriting samples in ink and two in
pencil,
each representative of different periods in each year, chosen
always from manuscripts that could be dated by internal evidence.
The more samples per page the better, for thus one could determine
whether variations were trivial or significant. Some pages still
remain blank. For instance, there are several samples in pencil of
writing in the latter part of the year 1864 and early 1865, but
none in ink. Since these are the months she was under orders not to
use a pen, it is unlikely that she would have done so. By
extension, and because I believe she followed her doctor's orders,
I doubt whether any document in ink will be found in that period.
Similarly for the period after 1878. Why this abrupt
adaptation?</p>

<p>One cannot pursue a study of the handwriting without considering
the problem of her eyes and the general state of her health. Why
did the character of the letters balloon so in the 'seventies, and
the letters unlink? Emily Dickinson's death was due to some form of
nephritis. It may

<pb n="005.028"/>

never be possible to establish the exact nature of the affliction,
though it was then diagnosed simply as Bright's disease. But there
are hypotheses that cannot be overlooked, even though they may
ultimately remain suggestive only, for lack of sufficient proof.
One not uncommon cause of a fatal nephritis is now known to be a
deepseated streptococcic infection that becomes recurrent. The
evidence for such in Emily Dickinson's case is striking. She was
withdrawn from Mount Holyoke very suddenly and against her wish in
the spring of 1848 by her parents, who sent Austin to fetch her
home quite unceremoniously. They had heard indirectly that she was
suffering from a severe throat infection that her letters home had
tried to belittle. The recurrences were so continual through the
next spring and summer that the family effectively prevailed in
their demand that she give up thought of returning to the seminary.
The letters she wrote during the 'fifties indicate her
susceptibility to nose and throat colds. Injury to the kidneys was
perhaps begun, though probably not known. It happens that this
could have a great deal to do with her handwriting.</p>

<p>Such organic injury, where it does exist, can in its early
stages produce a partial blindness or periods of visual aberration
that doom the victim to impaired sight. With Emily Dickinson it
certainly had progressed far enough by 1864 to compel her trips to
Boston, to doctor's orders that she use a soft pencil in place of
a fine-pointed pen, and to an acceptance&mdash;later modified&mdash;of
darkened rooms. As years pass, her neuroticism becomes clear
enough, but the degree of its basis in a physical handicap is not
clear and may never be established. By 1867 her writing certainly
has increased in size and the letters within words are broken to a
point that one reckons, not in terms of linked words or syllables,
but in terms of those that are unlinked, so general has become the
separation of letters. The process was so steadily continuous that
by 1875 only an occasional <hi rend="italic">of, th,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mr</hi>.
remained fastened. She was still writing most of her letters in
ink, however. In this year the size of the letters she formed with
her pen reached a maximum. By 1878 she evidently found it necessary
to forego ink altogether, and no part of any word is linked after
that year. But the size of letter decreased when she used only a
pencil. From her nervous collapse in the early 'eighties till her
death in 1886 the progressive changes become increasingly
marked.</p>




<p>I have inquired of physicians whether this increased size and
gradual unlinking could have relationship to her vision and
fatality. The evidence at the moment is inconclusive. But the
bearing of her medical history upon the problem of her handwriting
cannot be ignored, and the ultimate verdict will certainly include
a study of her health.</p>

<p>There are two areas into which handwriting changes fall: the
general

<pb n="005.029"/>

and the particular. The general includes characteristics involving
five to eight-year periods. During the 1850's all words are linked,
the writing is small and flowing, marked by a roundness that is
almost copybook in its style. In these years she often signs her
name "Emilie". The unlinking of letters begins in the early
'sixties and is well along to completion ten years later. The
letters become progressively more angular, and the pages show a
sense of drive and forcefulness. The "ie" for "Emily" is
permanently discarded after 1861. In the 'seventies the size of the
letters reaches a maximum, the use of a pencil is more frequent,
and in the later years of the decade supplants the pen
altogether.</p>

<p>Particular changes are far more complicated and overlapping.
Charts made of each individual capital letter for each successive
year tell a story quite easy to follow, for each year some capital
letters undergo striking changes not found in other letters. The
same phenomena are observable in lower-case letters, with the
further advantage that the alterations in the small letters can be
subdivided according to their use initially, medially, and finally.
For example, in 1859 her final "d" is formed by an upswept ascender
curving right. In the years preceding and following it sweeps left.
From '55 to '58 the small "h" used initially is hooked to the left.
The list of these minute variations through the years is very
extensive, and each serves as a reference to and a check upon the
others. Given a sufficient number of words in any document, it is
possible to assign a probable date within comparatively narrow
limits.</p>

<p>Since I have never tried before to study handwriting with the
purpose in mind of dating a manuscript by characteristic changes in
it, I cannot say whether all handwriting is so subtly variable. The
progressive unlinking of letters, in this case over an
eighteen-year period, is enormously useful, and made possible by a
physiological change that perhaps is comparatively rare. In her
case I believe it theoretically possible, if enough manuscript
existed, and if each manuscript used enough letters in sufficient
combination, to track down dates of composition within the limits
of a given week. But the quantity of manuscripts is wanting, and
even if they existed it would take years to compute and equate the
frequencies without the aid of an electric eye and a robot
tabulator. Our laborsome method of charts must remain but a very
rough estimate where handwriting alone is the clue. At best, it
must allow a margin of error measured in serveral months.
At worst, as in instances where the documents are so brief that
tell-tale combinations of letters do not appear, the probable
limits of error can extend through two to three years. It is at
this point particularly that we turn to paper groups for aid.</p>

<p>Emily Dickinson was fastidious in her stationery selection.
Whether it was wove or laid paper, it is almost invariably of an
identifiable quality,

<pb n="005.030"/>

and though over the years there is a great variety of it, when the
types have been identified and grouped, a distinct paper pattern
emerges. I suggest that for the moment we consider the rule, not
the exception. It is true that she had several paper types at her
desk at one time, and that she might on occasion use a sheet in
1875 left over from a batch presumably exhausted in the 'fifties.
Such exceptions are easy to spot, and when they occur they rule out
the aid which paper groups often can give.</p>

<p>The task of arranging paper into groups is tedious in the
extreme, and has not yet been completed. It involves identifying
whenever possible (and it is possible 95 per cent of the time)
every paper type that she used, measuring it, matching the groups,
and sub-dividing them according to their millimeter measurements.
Since the identification of a document by its group is desirable as
a check on the handwriting, this work must be pursued with no
reference whatever to handwriting or other identifying quality.</p>

<p>Much of the laid paper she used was embossed with, say, a head
of Minerva, or a capitol dome, or a basket of fruit, or the name of
a stationer or manufacturer. The wove paper is generally
watermarked and often dated. Let us suppose that all Weston's Linen
1868 paper has been identified and grouped, and that it totals 75
items. Millimeter measurements show that it falls into three
sub-groups. That is to say, the sheets have all been folded once,
to make four pages, with the spine vertical on the left, the way
boxed stationery usually is sold. When we open it out for
measurement, we find that the four outer corners for the entire
quantity are identical in size. But the middle vertical
measurements&mdash;the part that becomes the spine when
folded&mdash;are in
three distinct divisions: group A measures 180 mm; group B, 183 mm;
group C, 177 mm. These groups, then, were trimmed folded, and
represent three distinct batches.
Let us say that the number of sheets in each group is roughly even,
about 25 in each. Turn now to absolutely identifiable documents in
each group. There are five in group A&mdash;all in the year 1872; ten
in group B&mdash;covering 1874-75; eight in group C&mdash;all 1877-78.
Turn
back to group A. Of the remaining items in it, 20 had been dated
about 1872-73 on the basis of handwriting; and three are
unmistakably later. The remaining two are too brief to guess at
closely from handwriting. They are clearly not later than 1876 nor
earlier than '73. All that can be said of them is that they belong
with group A, and fall within a pattern common to that batch.</p>

<p>Now group B, where the ten identifiable items fall within the
years 1874-75. Let us suppose that 12 of the 15 items remaining
have been assigned dates, on the basis of handwriting, ranging from
1874 to '78. The remaining three had been classified as doubtful,
with a tentative range of dates between 1872-74. I think it
reasonable at this point to

<pb n="005.031"/>

assume 1872 is too early a date for any paper in group B. It seems
more likely that group A was purchased from the stationer and used
sometime before group B; that group B, the same <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> of
stationery but from a different batch, was purchased later; that
therefore the evidence of the group as a whole points to a date not
earlier than 1874 for the three doubtful items.</p>

<p>Similarly in group C, if but one item were conjectured to fall
before 1877, I should think the burden of convincing us of the
possibility would be more difficult, once the pattern of the group
is shown to extend forward from that year, not back of it.</p>

<p>For purposes of clarity, the illustration has been simplified,
but it is representative of the use to which paper groups may be
put. Evidence from it can never be final, nor can it be used except
in conjunction with other evidence. But where it exists, it must be
considered.</p>

<p>I think it important to underline at this point that I am
presenting problems, not reaching conclusions. To establish a text
for Emily Dickinson, particularly of her poems, in terms of exact
chronology will never be possible, for all the reasons that have
been set forth. The evidence must derive solely from handwriting
and from paper groups, and whether taken separately or together,
they cannot do more than suggest areas of time. The most that can
be done is to give the physical evidence in the greatest possible
detail.</p>

<p>It remains finally to say something about the text of the
poetry. There would obviously be no problem if every poem were left
in a single and final version. But such is not the case. At a rough
estimate, I should say that 80 per cent of the poems exist in
finished versions, copied fair, with no alternate lines or variant
readings suggested. Of the remaining 20 per cent&mdash;some 400
poems&mdash;she offers variant readings, for the most part with no
indication which reading she might ultimately have selected in a
final version. Any editorial choice therefore becomes impossible in
a definitive edition, since it can represent only an editorial
preference.</p>

<p>In one instance I thought she herself had provided a solution.
One of the poems which she copied into a packet had several
suggested readings for eight different words in the course of the
five stanzas, but with no indication of her choice. (Sometimes,
though infrequently, her choice is indicated by an underlining of
the word she prefers, or by a deletion of the one she has
rejected.) Then I found the same poem included in a letter to
Higginson with choices made in every instance. Here, then, seemed
proof that she had established her final version. But in another
letter to another correspondent, written at substantially the same
time, she has included the same poem&mdash;also evidently a final
version&mdash;wherein she adopted six of the choices made in the
Higginson letter, but

<pb n="005.032"/>

selected two from among her variants in the remaining instances. If
any conclusion is to be drawn from this citation, it would seem to
be that there are no <hi rend="italic">final</hi> versions of the poems for which
she allowed alternate readings to stand in the packets.</p>

<p>Later when anthologists are compiling selections for lay
readers, they may do what they wish about selecting the
"appropriate" version. The text for my edition in preparation must
simply record the lines as she wrote them, noting the alternates
and the variant readings. It would be misleading to give the
impression that many such exist. Even of the 300 or 400 poems that
show them, by far the largest part offer alternates for but one or
two words in any poem.</p>

<p>Some dozen or so work sheets exist: those scraps of paper which
represent the first draft of a poem&mdash;often potentially a great
one. They are the jottings which throw brilliant flashes upon the
creative spirit in travail. Such is the poem "Two butterflies went
out at noon," which has been reproduced in facsimile in <hi rend="italic">Bolts of
Melody</hi>. So far as I know, it never proceeded beyond the
work-sheet stage. What shape she might finally have given it! But
we sit, helpless to gain her insight, knowing only that such
speculations "tease us past thought, as doth eternity."</p>

<p>Here then are the problems. Our tools are method only. As we
crave solutions, daydreaming what we might learn from Dickinson
herself if we could visit the Stygian world and hold parley with
her Shade, I am reminded of a story told me some years ago of
William Lyon Phelps. "Will Rhett Butler return to Scarlett O'Hara?"
a student queried after finishing <hi rend="italic">Gone with the Wind</hi>. "That
is an interesting question," he answered. "I am dining with
Margaret Mitchell tonight, and I will try to bring you back the
answer." "And what did she say?" the student asked next day: "What
was Rhett's choice?" "She said," replied the professor, "that she
hadn't the slightest idea."</p>

<div2 type="section"><head/>
<p>The "Envoy to Alison," a ballade of 27 lines, is extant in two
fifteenth-century manuscripts and in seven of the black-letter
editions of Chaucer's works. I shall attempt to work out the
relationship among these nine texts, trying to limit the problem by
studying the distributional and geneological evidence that is
available.<ref target="f005.03.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref></p>


<p>The two manuscripts containing "Alison" are Fairfax 16 and
Tanner 346, both in the Bodleian Library. The handwriting of both
has been dated as being of the fifteenth century, and the date 1450
is written on the flyleaf of Fairfax 16 in an apparently

"Alison" is quite legible. In Tanner 346 a number of graphemes in
"Alison" are badly faded or blurred; these were illegible in 1898,

<p>Black-letter editions of Chaucer which contain "Alison" are
Thynne's 1532 and 1542 editions, his undated edition, Stow's
edition of 1561, and Speght's three editions&mdash;1598, 1602, and
1687.</p>

<p>I shall refer hereafter to the nine texts of "Alison" by the
following abbreviations:

<list>
<item>Fairfax 16:        F</item>

<item>Tanner 346:        T</item>

<item>Thynne 1532:     Th1</item>

</p>

<p>In studying the relation of these texts to each other I shall
first consider the distributional evidence derived from a
compilation of all variants. This compilation will make possible a
statistical statement of the

<pb n="005.034"/>

resemblances of the texts to one another. As an accessory to such
statistics I shall where possible use the method of looking for
runs of identical readings in pairs of texts; where two texts show
such a run of considerable length, the likelihood of kinship is
increased, for a number of consecutive agreements is much less
likely to be due to mere chance than an equal number of
non-consecutive ones.</p>

<p>Distributional evidence may be expected at least to limit the
number of possible trees. When it has been exhausted, I shall turn
to geneological evidence, if it can be found, for further aid.</p>

<p>In the texts of "Alison" the number of substantive variants
(<hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, those involving meaning) is exceedingly small. It is
therefore necessary to consider also minute differences in spelling
and orthography. In order to assign proper value to variants of
different degrees of minuteness, I arranged them according to the
following classification. Beside each type I have indicated the
number of variants of that type that occur.</p>

<list>
<item>I. Substantive variants (7)
	<list>
	<item>A. Lexically different words (6)</item>

	<item>B. Add-omissions (1)</item>
  	</list></item>
<item>II. Non-substantive variants (242)
  	<list>
	<item>A. Non-significant variation in morphemes (3) (All of these
	involve actual difference in pronunciation, but without lexical
	difference.)</item>

	<item>B. Presence or absence of final &mdash;<hi rend="italic">e</hi>
	(50)</item>

	<item>C. Significant difference in graphemes without morphemic
	difference (91) (These do not include words differing only in final
	&mdash;<hi rend="italic">e.</hi>)</item>

	<item>D. Difference in allographs of the same grapheme, <hi rend="italic">viz.,
	v:u, &thorn;:th,</hi> lower-case letter: capital letter, and
	<hi rend="italic">ff:F</hi> (43)</item>

	<item>E. Difference in suprasegmental phonemes, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>,
	punctuation marks: slant, period, and comma. (55)</item>
	</list></item>
</list>

<p>In compiling the specimens of the several types I made no
attempt to avoid overlapping. Therefore a word whose readings
contain differences in final -<hi rend="italic">e,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">y,</hi>
and in &thorn; and <hi rend="italic">th</hi> appears three times. Ordinarily, however,
each word appears only once or twice. The illegible graphemes in
Tanner were recorded as blanks. The occurrence of such a blank was
not considered a variant in itself.</p>

<p>The relation of the seven black-letter texts to each other was
considered first. Within this group there are only three
substantive variants. The first of these is in line 2, where Th3
and St read <hi rend="italic">thus</hi> and other texts read <hi rend="italic">thou</hi>. The
minority reading makes little sense and could hardly have occurred
without direct influence of one of the two dissenting texts on the
other. Since St is the later, this variant is evidence that St was

<pb n="005.035"/>

derived from Th3. The fact that the usual reading <hi rend="italic">thou</hi>
reappears in Sp1 is of no evidential value, for Speght not only
might have used one of the texts earlier than St to correct the
suspicious-looking <hi rend="italic">thus</hi> but also had the verb
<hi rend="italic">haste</hi>
calling for <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> as subject.</p>

<p>The second substantive variant is in line 6, where St and the
three Speghts have <hi rend="italic">abiyng</hi> (spelled <hi rend="italic">abying</hi> in
Sp2 and
Sp3) and the three earlier texts have various spellings of
<hi rend="italic">obeying</hi>.<ref target="f005.03.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> This seems
to
indicate that Sp1 is derived from St.</p>


<p>The third substantive variant is <hi rend="italic">brought</hi> in Sp1 against
<hi rend="italic">through</hi> in all other texts. This has no value whatever.</p>

<p>All that can be extracted from these three variants, then, is
their evidence that St is from Th3 and that Sp1 is from St.</p>

<p>Turning to the non-substantive variants, we find that in Class
IIA there are only three and that these indicate merely a gradual
modernizing of spelling in successive editions.</p>

<p>The non-substantive variants of the other four classes are
numerous enough to give significant statistical results.</p>

<p>With regard to all four of these classes, each of the Speght
editions resembles its immediate chronological predecessor more
than it resembles any previous edition.<ref target="f005.03.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> The substantive variant
<hi rend="italic">obeying:
abiyng,</hi> indicating derivation of Sp1 from St, does not
contradict these findings. We may place the four latest texts,
then, in straight-line derivational arrangement in order of
date.</p>


<p>When agreements among the three Thynne editions are examined, it
is found that Th3 agrees with Th1 a total of 224 times (out of a
possible 239) and with Th2 only 201 times. This indicates that Th2
and Th3 must have been derived independently from Th1. This
relationship is indicated not only by the total for the four
classes but also by the figures for each of the individual classes,
except for IIE, which consists of differences in punctuation.
However, if slants in Th1 are equated with commas in Th3, these two
texts are found to agree perfectly; that is, they are punctuated in
exactly the same places, whereas between Th2 and Th3 this
correspondence is not quite perfect.</p>

<p>A check on the statement that Th3 resembles Th1 more than it
resembles Th2 was made by looking for long continuous passages in
which two of these texts were identical. It was found that Th1 and
Th3 are exactly alike for 71 consecutive words, including 29
variants (from <hi rend="italic">haste,</hi> line 2, through <hi rend="italic">O,</hi> line
12).
Also there is a run of 43 consecutive

<pb n="005.036"/>

words, including 12 variants, in these two texts from <hi rend="italic">for,</hi>
line 14, through <hi rend="italic">is,</hi> line 19. When Th2 and Th3 were
compared
thus, however, no run longer than 17 words, including 3 variants,
was found.</p>

<p>The probability of a derivational relationship between two texts
is enormously increased by the occurrence of such runs as occur in
Th1 and Th3. The principle involved may be illustrated simply. If
a given variant occurs in three forms throughout a set of texts,
the chance that a certain two texts will agree thereon is one in
three. If the next variant occurs in four forms, the chance that
the two texts will agree on it is one in four. The chance that they
will agree on both variants is one in three times four, or one in
twelve. Thus, in a run, the chance of continuous agreement is one
in a number equal to the product of the number of forms for each
variant in the run. This product reaches astronomical size in a run
of considerable length, and the presence of such a run is very
strong evidence of derivational relationship between the two
texts.</p>

<p>Therefore the occurrence of the runs described removes all doubt
that Th3 is more closely related to Th1 than to Th2. In the face of
such evidence it is impossible for Th2 to be intermediary between
Th1 and Th3. This instance demonstrates clearly the value of
looking for runs as a method in distributional study. Where
extensive runs are found, they add substantially to the evidence
from statistics of number of agreements and may resolve cases
undecided by such statistics.</p>

<p>Looking for runs is most likely to prove valuable when the
student is dealing with minute variants, which occur consecutively
or close together, rather than substantive ones, which are usually
fairly far apart. The frequency of minute variants of course makes
it more likely that runs will occur and that significant ones may
be detected in passages only a few lines in length.</p>

<p>The question may be raised as to whether Th2 might have been
derived from T or F rather than from Th1. But the table of
agreements gives no support to such a conclusion; Th2 is more like
Th1 than it is like any other text.</p>

<p>We may, then, arrange the Thynne texts thus:<ref target="f005.03.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref>

 <!-- <figure entity="sb05361"></figure> --></p>


<p>To complete the tree for the black-letters, we now need to know
from what text Stow was derived.</p>

<pb n="005.037"/>

<p>It will be recalled that the sharing of the reading <hi rend="italic">thus</hi>
in line 2 by St and Th3 was taken as evidence that St was derived
from Th3. Let us see how this evidence compares with the testimony
of the non-substantive variants. With which of the Thynne editions
does St agree most often?</p>

<p>On the three IIA variants the three Thynne texts agree
perfectly, so that those variants are worthless.</p>

<p>For IIB-IIE variants, agreements of Stow with the Thynne texts
are as follows:

</p>

<p>These figures show that St agrees most often with Th3; thus they
corroborate the evidence of the <hi rend="italic">thus: thou</hi> variant. When the
method of looking for runs of consecutive identical words was
applied to these four texts, no significant results emerged.
Therefore, we may conclude that St is from Th3,<ref target="f005.03.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> and the complete tree for the
black-letter editions is as follows:

 <!-- <figure entity="sb05371"></figure> --></p>


<p>The major problem in establishing the text of "Alison" is to
determine the relationships among the three oldest versions of the
poem &mdash; F, T, and Th1.</p>

<p>Some important evidence emerges when the arrangement of the poem
with regard to what precedes it and what follows it in each of the
three texts is observed. In F it is preceded by "The Book of the

<pb n="005.038"/>

Duchess," from which it is separated only by the line "Explicit the
boke of the Duchesse," and at the end of "Alison" is no "Explicit,"
as the heading of the next poem, "Balade upon the Chaunse of the
Dyse," follows immediately.</p>

<p>In T "Alison" is immediately preceded by "The Cuckoo and the
Nightingale," with only the line "Explicit" separating the two
poems. At the end of "Alison" is the line "Explicit &thorn;e Cuck. &amp;
&thorn;e Nighting." in a hand different from the rest of the text, and
the remainder of the page is left blank. On the next page begins
"The Book of the Duchess" (Hammond, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p.
337).</p>

<p>The Thynne text, like T, is preceded by "The Cuckoo and the
Nightingale" with only "Explicit" between the poems. Following
"Alison" is "Explicit" and the heading and beginning of the next
poem, "Scogan unto the lordes . . ."</p>

<p>It should also be noted that between the third stanza and the
fourth is the heading "The lenvoye" in T and "&para; Lenuoye." in
Th1, whereas in F there is no heading at this point.</p>

<p>It appears that since both T and Th1 are preceded by the same
poem and share the "Lenvoy" heading there must be some sort of
kinship between them.</p>

<p>The variant readings in the three texts must now be examined for
distributional evidence.</p>

<p>Within these texts there are only three substantive variants:

<table>
<row>
<cell><hi rend="italic">Line</hi></cell>
<cell><hi rend="italic">F</hi></cell>
<cell><hi rend="italic">T</hi></cell>
<cell><hi rend="italic">Th1</hi></cell>
</row>

<row>
<cell>1</cell>
<cell>foole</cell>
<cell>foole</cell>
<cell>foule<ref target="f005.03.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref></cell>
</row>

<cell>12</cell>

<row>
<cell>24</cell>
<cell>and of goodnesse</cell>
<cell>and goodnes</cell>
<cell>and goodnesse</cell>
</row>
</table>
</p>


<p>In these three variants, F and T agree against Th1 once, and T
and Th1 agree against F twice. So the odds are two to one in favor
of a closer relationship between T and Th1 than between either of
them and F. This conclusion is consistent with the testimony of the
order of material and the envoy headings, as mentioned above.</p>

<p>Agreements among the three texts with regard to non-substantive
variants are summarized in the following figures:<ref target="f005.03.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref>

<pb n="005.039"/>

</p>


<p>These figures agree with the other evidence in showing a
divergence between F and T, but they contradict the evidence for
kinship between T and Th1, for T and Th1 agree only 50 times,
whereas F and Th1 agree 74 times. Further, this similarity between
F and Th1 is attested by four out of five of the classes of small
variants.</p>

<p>However, the value of these statistics should be carefully
weighed before they are allowed to counterbalance the evidence of
the connection with "The Cuckoo and the Nightingale," the envoy
headings, and the substantive variants.</p>

<p>The non-substantive variants on which F and Th1 agree can be
explained as due to coincidence and do not necessarily indicate
kinship between these two texts. There are 74 such agreements,
constituting only 41 per cent of the total of 181 non-substantive
variants in the three texts. Further, in the IID group, 19 of the
27 agreements of F and Th1 against T are due to the use of the
thorn (&thorn;the three texts. Further, in the IID group, 19 of the 27
agreements of F and Th1 against T are due to the use of the thorn
(&thorn;) in T; and three such agreements in IIC variants are due to
the use of the yogh (&yogh;) in T. But fifteenth-century printers did
not use &thorn; and &yogh;, and Th1 would not have shown them even if its
printer had been copying directly from T. These 22 agreements
involving &thorn; and &yogh; are therefore valueless, and if they are
disregarded there are only 52 agreements of F and Th1 in 159
variants, or 33 per cent.</p>

<p>These remaining agreements might be of some value if they
revealed the two texts sharing even a few unusual spellings. But
the <hi rend="italic">NED</hi> shows all the shared spellings to be commonplace
ones, occurring frequently in the texts cited by the dictionary.
That F and Th1 should coincide in about one out of three common
spellings is no more than could be expected from chance.<ref target="f005.03.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref></p>


<p>In these three texts no help is to be had from runs of identical
readings, as there are no such runs of appreciable length.</p>

<p>It seems best, then, to reject the evidence of the small
variants and, on the basis of the larger considerations, to call T
and Th1 a subfamily apart from F. A tentative tree can be drawn
thus:

<pb n="005.040"/>

 <!-- <figure entity="sb05401a"></figure> --></p>

<p>Can this tree be simplified by identifying either T or Th1 as x?
To answer this we must return to the substantive variants. In these
F and Th1 never agree, and T agrees with F once and with Th1 twice.
Th1 has one unique reading <hi rend="italic">(foule),</hi> F has two unique
readings <hi rend="italic">(me</hi> and <hi rend="italic">of goodnesse),</hi> and T has no
unique
readings. Therefore only T can be placed as an intermediary. T,
then, could be x in the above tree, but Th1 could not, for if Th1
were x, it would be difficult to explain the appearance of
<hi rend="italic">foole</hi> in F and T, since Th1 has <hi rend="italic">foule</hi>. But no
such
difficulty arises from making T the ancestor of Th1, and simplicity
is gained. The tree can therefore be changed to the following,
which, however, is still tentative:

 <!-- <figure entity="sb05401b"></figure> --></p>

<p>We now have a two-forked tree and a state of affairs in which
the text of O cannot satisfactorily be reconstructed. Obviously,
for any reading on which F and T disagree, each text has equal
authority with the other. It would be desirable, in order to
resolve this conflict and achieve greater simplicity, to make
either F or T the archetype if possible.</p>

<p>In the light of the evidence of the substantive variants, the
envoy headings, and the relation to "The Cuckoo and the
Nightingale," it is possible for either T or F to be archetype.
This possibility is not disturbed by the fact that only T can be
intermediary. These two trees are equally consistent with the
distributional evidence:

 <!-- <figure entity="sb05401c"></figure> --></p>

<pb n="005.041"/>

<p>Further, since the tentative tree with x was based on the
kinship of T and Th1 and the necessity that T be intermediary, a
third alternative is also theoretically possible:

 <!-- <figure entity="sb05411"></figure> --></p>

<p>Thus, with T as intermediary, any one of the three texts could
be the archetype as far as the evidence so far shown is
concerned.</p>

<p>This is as far as distributional evidence can take us.
Geneological evidence should next be sought, but in the texts of
"Alison" such evidence is found to be so meager that it is of no
value.</p>

<p>If further evidence is to be produced, it must come from a
comparative study of the entire Fairfax and Tanner manuscripts, not
from examination of "Alison" alone.</p>

<p>This study of the texts of "Alison" has not produced evidence
sufficient to establish an authoritative text. However, it has
partially solved the problem of the relationship among the nine
versions, and these results may be stated:

<list>
<item>1. The relationship of the black-letter texts may be
established by means of distributional evidence.</item>

<item>2. T and Th1 are more closely related to each other than
either is related to F; therefore the probable relation among the
three texts is not simple radiation from an archetype.</item>

<item>3. Any tree not using a hypothetical manuscript must show T
as intermediary.</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>Of greater value than these specific results concerning "Alison"
are the conclusions as to methods of textual study of manuscripts
that have emerged. These are as follows:

<list>
<item>1. When the texts being studied show so few substantive
variants that it is necessary to attach great importance to
non-substantive variants, it is useful to classify the variants
according to minuteness so that appropriate evidential value may be
assigned to them. The classification used in the present study is
a workable one.</item>

<item>2. As an auxiliary to statistics of agreements, a
consideration of runs of identical readings is valuable.
Consecutive agreements are of more significance than scattered
ones, and the presence of identical runs of considerable length is
strong evidence of kinship between texts. The

<pb n="005.042"/>

value of such runs was demonstrated in the case of the Thynne
texts, where the derivation of the Th3 directly from Th1 was firmly
established by the discovery of long runs linking these two
texts.</item>

<item>3. The need for studying the entire texts of the Fairfax and
Tanner manuscripts, in order to establish decisively the text of a
short poem contained in those manuscripts, suggests an important
principle for editors. The case of "Alison" demonstrates the
paucity of variation that is frequently encountered in short texts,
even when they exist in a considerable number of versions. When the
piece under consideration is surrounded by material which may also
be compared and studied, the evidence of this material should be
used. Minor poems may not be edited safely in isolation from the
larger units of text that contain them.</item>

<p>In 1496, when Wynkyn de Worde planned to reprint the <hi rend="italic">editio
princeps</hi> (1486) of the <hi rend="italic">Boke of St. Albans,</hi> today often

referred to as the <hi rend="italic">Book of Hawking, Hunting and Heraldry,</hi>
it
was his intention to include some new material and to make certain
physical improvements. The latter consisted in adding a title-page
and a number of woodcuts<ref target="f005.04.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> and in
modernizing the phrasing and spelling. But on the whole, De Worde
followed his model closely, even, one might say to a semblance of
type, since he employed a rather heavy square letter obtained from
Govaert van Ghemen (Godfried van Os), a printer of Gouda in South
Holland, about 1491 when the latter removed to Copenhagen.<ref target="f005.04.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> In later years, the initials and
woodcuts reappeared frequently but the type, apparently considered
unsuitable for English books,<ref target="f005.04.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref>
was not used again by De Worde or by any other sixteenth-century
English printer.</p>




<p>Although De Worde launched his 1496 first edition in a small
folio, he seems to have changed the format subsequently, for all
later recorded texts of the <hi rend="italic">Boke of St. Albans</hi> from his
press were brought out in a handy quarto, a size increasingly
favored by the establishment "At the Sign of the Sun." For the most
part, the texts of these quartos inevitably contain some slight
alterations in spelling but suffer chiefly from omissions of words
and phrases in printing.</p>

<pb n="005.044"/>

<p>Since De Worde was a popular printer, he must have reckoned the
practicality of a pocket-sized edition soon after 1496, but there
is a gap of approximately nineteen years before we can pick up the
thread of De Worde's printing of the <hi rend="italic">Boke of St. Albans</hi>. The

earliest recorded quarto is preserved only as a fragment of three
leaves and is Bodleian Rawl. 4&deg; 598.8, catalogued as a separate
printing of <hi rend="italic">The boke of huntynge,</hi> the text of the fragment.
Fortunately, one of the leaves has the signature E.i. and the
catch-title "Huntynge," two workable clues for tracing this
edition. As there are 33-34 lines to a page, we may start with the
text on E1 and work backwards, in comparison with the 1496
edition,<ref target="f005.04.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> to conjecture that this
is a quarto edition of the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> work and that presumably
"Huntynge" was the catch-title throughout as found in the Schwerdt
quarto described later.</p>


<p>From type criteria, the only basis offered, this Bodleian quarto
might be dated <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 1515<ref target="f005.04.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>
an assignment determined by (1) fig. 6 of Isaac's<ref target="f005.04.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> classification of De Worde's types;
(2)
a close examination of the type<ref target="f005.04.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> of
De Worde's dated publications 1513 to 1518, a range limited by
Isaac's Fig. 6; and (3) by its closest resemblance to the
type-pages of the <hi rend="italic">Chronicles of England</hi> dated 1515.</p>




<p>The 1515 edition must have gone well, for not long afterwards,
some three years perhaps, another quarto appeared "At the Sign of
the Sun." This, fortunately, is extant in a perfect though undated
copy, the <hi rend="italic">unicum</hi> formerly in the celebrated collection of
sporting literature formed by C.F.G.R. Schwerdt<ref target="f005.04.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> of Alresford, Hants. The extreme
importance of the Schwerdt quarto is determined by the fact that we
become acquainted

<pb n="005.045"/>

for the first and <hi rend="italic">only</hi> time, with a complete text of a De
Worde quarto of the <hi rend="italic">Boke of St. Albans;</hi> and since no other
perfect De Worde quarto of this text is known to exist, its status
is that of a bibliographical monument.</p>


<p>The title of the Schwerdt reads: <hi rend="italic">The boke of hawkynge</hi>
|
<hi rend="italic">and huntynge</hi> | <hi rend="italic">and fysshynge</hi>. This might well
have
been the wording of the Bodleian quarto, from which it could have
been printed, unless there was a lost intermediate edition. The
colophon adds a little more to its contents: "Here endeth the boke
of hawkynge h&umacr;tynge and fysshynge | and with many other dyuer
maters. Inpr&ymacr;ted in Flete strete at y<hi rend="super">e</hi> sygne of
y<hi rend="super">e</hi> sonne
| by W&ymacr;kyn de Worde." The text is an abridgement, for the
Schwerdt quarto indicates that when the change of format was under
consideration, from a folio containing 74 leaves, to a quarto size,
two extensive treatises on heraldry occupying some 33 leaves were
dropped, presumably because they would have made the volume too
bulky to be taken into the field by falconers, hunstmen, and
anglers. In fact, the heraldic tracts, <hi rend="italic">Liber armorum</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">The blasynge of armes</hi> with its numerous woodcuts of
shields,
never again made their appearance over De Worde's imprint or
device<ref target="f005.04.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> though the "importance of
heraldry as a subject of polite study and speculation" was of
absorbing interest in the fifteenth and even more so in the
sixteenth centuries considering the remains dating from this early
Tudor Age.</p>


<p>Broadly, the Schwerdt quarto can be placed between the years
1518 and 1521;<ref target="f005.04.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> the earlier date is
more acceptable to Mr. F. S. Ferguson, for whose examination Mr.
Schwerdt personally brought the little volume up to London: "As a
result I am able to tell you that the book was printed [c.
1518-1521]. . . . Personally I incline to the earlier date, but I
have no unalterable reason for doing so&mdash;it may have been printed
as late as 1521, but I should think this must be the limit."<ref target="f005.04.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> Since the

<pb n="005.046"/>

volume is perfect it offers various typographical "points" for
arriving at a year of publication: (1) the wording in the colophon:
"In Flete strete at y<hi rend="super">e</hi> sygne of y<hi rend="super">e</hi> sonne,"
dates it after
1501,<ref target="f005.04.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> for at the turn of the
century De Worde moved to this new address; (2) the device beneath
the colophon is McKerrow no. 25<ref target="f005.04.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref>
who has determined its use from 1508 to 1531; (3) the state of the
large title-cut<ref target="f005.04.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref> representing the
falconer with his attendants demonstrates that the original block
freshly cut for De Worde's folio in 1496 had been cut down to fit
the quarto page; moreover, this block shows signs of cracking in
two places, a condition never seen in the folio cut, but which
might indicate its use in other lost quartos before the surmised
date 1518, and finally (4)
the letter-press is Isaac's 95 textura<ref target="f005.04.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> as reproduced in his fig. 7 and is
precisely the same as the types in publications dated 1517 and
1518.<ref target="f005.04.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref></p>








<p>The little Schwerdt volume concludes this review of the known De
Worde quarto editions of the <hi rend="italic">Boke of St. Albans</hi>. After the
printer's death in 1534, to 1596 when this book of sport appeared
for the last time in the sixteenth century, there were issued
upwards of fourteen editions.<ref target="f005.04.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> It
is probable that two or three of these are, instead, issues for
different stationers, each having his name attached to his quota of
copies from the same edition.<ref target="f005.04.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref> They

all bore the same wording in the title: "The boke of hawkynge
huntynge and fysshynge with all the properties and medecynes that
are necessary to be kept," or the same wording in the colophon:
"The boke of Haukynge, Huntynge and Fysshynge, with other dyuers
matters." And the progenitor of all these texts was, of course, the
singularly popular De Worde quarto.</p>



<p>Since the <hi rend="italic">Boke of St. Albans</hi> contained practical
information on the several pastimes extensively practised, De Worde
saw the good sense of issuing each "manual of sport" in a size
convenient for the pockets of each genus of sportsman. Whether this
was done simultaneously with his issuing of the quartos of the
whole work, there are no records to substantiate.

<pb n="005.047"/>

But after 1518, the assigned date of the latest known quarto, two
examples of "separates" whose texts originally appeared in De
Worde's folio of the <hi rend="italic">Boke of St. Albans,</hi> are known. In point
of time, the first separate quarto is the unique<ref target="f005.04.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> imperfect copy in the University
Library, Cambridge, Sel.5.57 (formerly AB.5.37<hi rend="super">8</hi>). Sayle<ref target="f005.04.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref> supplied the title <hi rend="italic">Treatise
of Hunting by Juliana Berners</hi> since it lacks the title-page and
there is no colophon from which a title might be extracted. The
versified text is the book of hunting followed by the miscellanea
including the poem "A Faythfull frende wolde I fayne fynde", the
same which occupies leaves c6 recto to e5 verso of the folio, but
here (at this late date) either reprinted from an earlier lost
quarto "separate" or a missing quarto edition of the folio later
than the Schwerdt. On the verso of the title-page of the Cambridge
quarto,
the text must have begun with an introductory paragraph, and the
beginning of the hunting treatise itself had the heading "Bestys of
Venery."</p>



<p>Sayle dates the Cambridge quarto [1530?]; accepted by STC under
no. 3318. According to Isaac's classification it might be dated
slightly earlier, <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 1526 to 1530 as determined by the
letter-press: the sole use of s<hi rend="super">3</hi> with the curling serifs,
which
was the only s used after 1521; w<hi rend="super">3</hi> frequently employed
in the
middle and at the end of words as well as at the beginning,
precisely in the manner seen in the type-pages of two dated books:
<hi rend="italic">The thre kynges of coleyne</hi>, 1526 (Morgan 20896) and
<hi rend="italic">The
destruccyon of Jherusalem,</hi> 1528 (Morgan 21134), and the
infrequent use of y<hi rend="super">1</hi> which became rare in 1530.</p>

<p>The full title of De Worde's folio partially discloses the
divers subjects treated: <hi rend="italic">This present boke shewyth the manere of
hawkynge &amp; huntynge: and also of diuysynge of Cote armours It
shewyth also a good matere belongynge to horses: wyth other
c&omacr;mendable treatyses. And ferdermore of the blasynge of armys:
as here after it maye appere</hi>.<ref target="f005.04.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref>

In this long intitulation, we find the treatises on Hawking,
Hunting, and the two on Heraldry are named, but an extensive new
addition is not mentioned, though it may be covered by the phrase
"wyth other c&omacr;mendable treatyses". This unnamed tract, however,
is itself conspicuously entitled: <hi rend="italic">Here begynnyth the treatyse of
fysshynge wyth an Angle</hi> and

<pb n="005.048"/>

it is accompanied by a lively woodcut: Hodnett's <hi rend="italic">English
Woodcuts,</hi> 897.</p>


<p>Oddly enough, this treatise is found between two heraldic essays
at the end of the volume. But this "insertion" may have been
unintentional, for originally De Worde had planned not to print the
second heraldic treatise but later changed his mind. This treatise
<hi rend="italic">Here begynneth the blasynge of armes</hi> with its numerous
colored woodcut coats of arms and its own set of signatures (a-c in
6's plus d in 8's), the printer may have intended to handle as a
separate (see also footnote 9).</p>

<p>The obvious appeal of the special subject matter to all classes
would have made a profitable business venture to bring out in
pocket-size editions. But the records, meager in the extreme, yield
up only one separate printing of the <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Fishing</hi> in
a handy quarto size, which is to be dated as late as <hi rend="italic">circa</hi>
1532 to 1534. This edition is today represented by the unique
perfect copy in the Pierpont Morgan Library (Morgan 20894) and it
occupies therefore a niched position among the <hi rend="italic">separate</hi>
printings from the De Worde folio of the <hi rend="italic">Boke of St. Albans</hi>
as the Schwerdt copy occupies among the quarto editions of the
<hi rend="italic">whole</hi> work. In a sense, the Morgan separate is of slightly
greater magnitude, for it is the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> proof, thus far, of De
Worde's separate printing on fishing and the earliest known
<hi rend="italic">pocket manual</hi> on that subject in all the literature of sport
in England.</p>

<p>It is, then, as a new addition to De Worde's folio 1496 reprint
of the <hi rend="italic">Boke of St. Albans</hi> that the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Treatise
on
Fishing with an Angle</hi> made its first appearance and became the
earliest printed essay in English on the subject.</p>

<p>The original text took up some 12 folios. De Worde, or his
editor, must have thought the subject fully covered, for he
described it as a "compendyous treatyse," whereas the author said
"this symple treatyse" and wrote it for "al you that ben vertuous:
gentyll: and free borne", the same public for whom the compilation
was first conceived.</p>

<p>The treatise is devoted to the art of "anglynge wyth a rodde:
and a lyne and a hoke" as against all other manner of fishing. It
is introduced by some general observations on the sport, but on the
whole its character is technical, with seventeen woodcuts
illustrating the making of fishing tackle. A comparison of these
with the woodcuts in the 1496 folio discloses that the first, a
representation of the fishing rod (B1 recto) is new in this
separate edition; two instruments, the "Hamour" and "Knyfe" are
missing from the original row of eight "for to make of your hookes"
(B3 verso); a whole new set (four instead of five) of fishing-lines
were cut to illustrate them (B4 verso); and the set of fish-hooks
has been entirely omitted.</p>

<pb n="005.049"/>

<p>The title of the Fishing quarto remained unchanged from its
first printing: <hi rend="italic">Here begynneth a treatyse of fysshynge with an
Angle,</hi> reiterated in the colophon: "Here endeth the boke of
Fysshynge | With other dyuers maters. Imprynted at London by Wynkyn
de Worde | dwellynge in Flete strete at the sygne of the Sonne."
Once more we find an undated colophon necessitating dependence upon
typographical particulars: (1) the printer's address places the
publication after 1501; (2) De Worde's mark beneath the colophon is
the tripartite device (McKerrow no. 21) used from 1528 to 1534; (3)
the letter-press discloses the frequent use of w<hi rend="super">3</hi> and the
sole
use of s<hi rend="super">3</hi>, which brings us up between 1522 and 1528;
another
letter y<hi rend="super">1</hi> which Isaac states was rare in 1530 does not
appear at
all; and finally the textura type used in the first line of the
title is first found in 1532, Isaac's fig. 9. Resolving these
minutiae,
we may assign the date of the Morgan quarto to <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 1532
to
1534.</p>

<p>The text of the Morgan separate quarto was the one that was
reprinted with minor differences many years after De Worde's death.
In modern times, however, it is the pure text as it was first
published in 1496 that has been reprinted and facsimiled <hi rend="italic">in
extenso</hi> at various periods.</p>

<p>De Worde's long title for the folio also exhibits another
misleading promise: "It shewyth also a good matere belongynge to
horses." Since the other treatises mentioned in the title are of
considerable length, one is led to expect that a "good matere
belongynge to horses" indicates a more extensive text on the horse
than only the nine lines on folio e3, with the rubric "The
proprytees of a good horse", listing simply fifteen essential
conditions. It does not seem likely that De Worde would have
singled out these nine lines from all the other just as fragmentary
and miscellaneous pieces in the middle of the volume to be
specified in his title had he not under consideration more
comprehensive matter relating to horses.</p>

<p>However, De Worde did not cast aside altogether the "good matere
belongynge to horses," for that may well be the quarto bearing the
title <hi rend="italic">Here begynneth the Proprytees and medycynes for hors</hi>
extant in the unique imperfect copy in the Huntington Library (no.
59359).<ref target="f005.04.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref> On folio A3 in that
edition is a similar list of the fifteen points of a good horse
which De Worde printed in his folio of 1496.</p>


<p>The Huntington quarto may be dated <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 1504 to
1506. A
specific test

<pb n="005.050"/>

is found in the letter-press which is Isaac fig. 2, the 95 textura
for 1501.<ref target="f005.04.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref> However, to Isaac's
determinant letters in this textura must be added a small k with a
large top loop brought in 1500 to the Sign of the Sun but not found
in the Huntington quarto. This archaic k was used exclusively after
1500 in dated publications such as Alcock's <hi rend="italic">Mons
perfectionis,</hi> 27 May 1501; <hi rend="italic">Thordynary of crysten
men,</hi>
1502; and Le Fevre's <hi rend="italic">Recuyles of Troye,</hi> 1503. After 1503,
it
drops out entirely.<ref target="f005.04.24" n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref> By other
typographical standards,<ref target="f005.04.25" n="25"><hi rend="super">25</hi></ref> such as
the type used in the chapter-headings and the state of the
Crucifixion woodcut, De Worde's treatise on the horse has
heretofore been wrongly dated from 1500 to 1502.</p>




<p>The Huntington "separate" quarto contains the first twelve
leaves out of an original sixteen and therefore lacks the end of
the text including the colophon-leaf which contained a device.
Ames<ref target="f005.04.26" n="26"><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref> saw a perfect copy, for after
quoting the above title he gives the colophon: "And here we shall
leue to treate ferthermore in this sayd mater whyche is dylygently
corrected and made after a sufficyent copy directed vnto me by a
certen person whyche as hym thought rygt necessary to be knowen to
gentlemen and men of honour as to seruysable and rustyck people."
The wording of that colophon clearly places the <hi rend="italic">Proprytees and
medycynes for hors</hi> in the same category as the other treatises
which make up the <hi rend="italic">Boke of St. Albans</hi>.</p>


<p>It remained for another Tudor printer, Robert Wyer, to prove
what De Worde set out to do: knowledge of horses belonged in a book
compiled primarily for gentlemen. In <hi rend="italic">Here be Certayne Questyons
of Kynge Bocthus of the maners</hi> | <hi rend="italic">tokyns</hi> | <hi rend="italic">and

condycions of men</hi> | <hi rend="italic">with the answeres made to the same by
the Phylosopher Sydrac,</hi><ref target="f005.04.27" n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref>
Wyer
brings together with this dialogue wholly based on the <hi rend="italic">Boke of
St. Albans,</hi> "The Propertyes of a good Horse" which, to every
appearance, has as its archetype the De Worde quarto at Huntington.
Even as late as 1567, De Worde's tract was

<pb n="005.051"/>

still in circulation in a text printed by William Copland with the
title <hi rend="italic">Mediciues</hi> (sic) <hi rend="italic">for Horses,</hi> preserved in
the
unique imperfect copy at Trinity College, Cambridge.<ref target="f005.04.28" n="28"><hi rend="super">28</hi></ref></p>



<p>The small-format volumes, the quarto size De Worde found so
profitable in the fields of romances and schoolbooks, and suitably
adapted for his treatises on the sports, proved for the
bibliographer of today <hi rend="italic">le mod&egrave;le fatal</hi>. Because of its
size, works of this type were easily lost, and copies are either
extremely rare or, as seen in this review, the record is narrowed
down to unique copies; the whole class of De Worde's "sporting
literature for gentlemen" almost perished.</p>

<p>One other branch of sport which might have appeared in a
separate quarto by De Worde is the sport of flight&mdash;falconry, or
the knowledge of and hunting with hawks, the first in the set of
treatises in his folio. Assuredly compositions on this subject were
in wide circulation in De Worde's own time. Some day perhaps a
fragment will determine a quarto of his printing.<ref target="f005.04.29" n="29"><hi rend="super">29</hi></ref></p>


<p>Fowling is a sport mentioned by the author of the <hi rend="italic">Treatise on
Fishing:</hi> "And therefore now woll I chose of foure good
disportes &amp; honeste gamys | that is to wyte: of huntynge:
hawkynge: fysshynge: &amp; foulynge." The last subject, thus ranked
among the four major field sports of England, was unfortunately not
included in the compilation of the schoolmaster printer of St.
Albans or "inserted" by Wynkyn de Worde.</p>

II</hi></name>

<name type="author">Richard E. Hasker</name>
</head>

<div2 type="section"><head/>
<p>The appearance of Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">Richard II</hi> in the first
Folio in 1623 was preceded by five quarto editions, one in 1597,
two in 1598, and one each in 1608 and 1615, the first deriving
ultimately from the author's manuscript and each of the others
being a reprint of its immediate predecessor. It has been generally
accepted that an exemplum of the last of these, prepared and
corrected, served as copy for the First Folio compositors, since
the Folio and the 1615 quarto have in common a small number of
readings which none of the other quartos share. When, however, in
the early part of the present century Henrietta C. Bartlett first
showed that there were two 1598 editions instead of one and that
the apparently unique copy then owned by W. A. White of New York
represented the later of the two, Alfred W. Pollard, on the basis
of certain similarities between the text of the newly identified
edition and that of the First Folio, queried whether this new
quarto,
possibly with some leaves supplied from the 1615 edition, might
have been the copy used for the Folio. After weighing the evidence
on both sides, Pollard concluded that the traditional answer was
the correct one, although he left the matter in some doubt.<ref target="f005.05.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref></p>


<p>By a combined study of the agreements and differences in the
substantives and accidentals in the First Folio and the two quartos
in question I propose to show that Pollard's rejected supposition,
that the copy for the Folio was an exemplum of Q3 containing some
leaves from a copy of Q5, was indeed correct.</p>

<p>Q1 was entered in the <hi rend="italic">Stationers' Register</hi> by Andrew
Wise
on August 29, 1597, and was printed for him in the same year by
Valentine Simmes. Since this represents a 'good' text, was
regularly entered in the <hi rend="italic">Register,</hi>

<pb n="005.054"/>

and shows no signs of having been surreptitiously acquired, Wise
must have purchased his printing rights from the Lord Chamberlain's
Servants, to which company of actors Shakespeare belonged, and the
quarto must be derived, either directly or through intermediate
transcriptions, from the author's own manuscript. In 1598 Wise
brought out a second edition (Q2), which is shown to be a reprint
of Q1 by its repetition of most of the ostensible errors of the
1597 quarto, and which, by Pollard's calculation, introduced 123
new errors of a substantive nature. Q3, a line-for-line reprint of
Q2 printed in the same year, was distinguished by Miss Bartlett as
a separate edition rather than a variant state or reissue of Q2 by
the discovery of dissimilarities on every page of the two quartos
and by the fact that the type was entirely reset. That the two
editions of 1598 are not independently derived from Q1 is evidenced
by the fact that they share on
the one hand most of the errors introduced by Q2 (Q3 corrected a
few obvious Q2 errors) and on the other all of the corrections of
Q1 substantive errors which Q2 had made. To show that Q3 is the
later of the two 1598 editions, Pollard called attention first to
two passages (b6<hi rend="super">rb</hi> 32-36 and c2<hi rend="super">va</hi> 60 ff.)<ref target="f005.05.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> 
 which were corrupted in Q2 and
which Q3
tampered with in an effort to restore meaning to them, and secondly
to another (c4<hi rend="super">vb</hi> 51), bibliographically more important, in
which
Q1 reads <hi rend="italic">for,</hi> Q2 reads <hi rend="italic">for</hi> with the
<hi rend="italic">f</hi> so
poorly printed that little remains of it, and Q3 reads <hi rend="italic">or</hi>
through the compositor's failure to recognize the existence of the
broken letter in Q2.</p>


<p>The <hi rend="italic">Stationers' Register</hi> shows that on June 25, 1603,
Andrew Wise "by consent of the Company . . . sett over" to Matthew
Lawe his rights to <hi rend="italic">Richard II, Richard III, Henry IV</hi> (Part
I), and two religious or moral items. Lawe did not have <hi rend="italic">Richard
II</hi> printed until 1608, at which time he added the scene of
Richard's forced abdication, the so-called "deposition scene,"
which had been censored from the play for political reasons before
the printing of Q1 in 1597. The question of Lawe's copy for this
new matter will be discussed later. The title-page of this 1608
quarto (Q4), which was printed for Lawe by William White, is found
in two states, the original making no mention of the material now
published for the first time, but the cancellans heralding these
"new additions" and noting the change of name of the company of
players from the Lord Chamberlain's Servants to the King's
Majesty's Servants. The perpetuation in
Q4 of errors originated by Q3 establishes Wise's last quarto as the
printing source of Lawe's 1608 edition, and the same sort of
evidence

<pb n="005.055"/>

proves Lawe's 1615 quarto (Q5), perhaps printed by Thomas
Purfoot,<ref target="f005.05.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> to have been derived from
Q4.<ref target="f005.05.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref></p>



<p>The claim of the First Folio editors that their plays were
"Published according to the True Originall Copies" is interpreted
by Sir Walter Greg to mean that playhouse manuscripts either were
used as copy or were consulted to verify the readings of other
editions from which the compositors were working.<ref target="f005.05.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> The text of <hi rend="italic">Richard
II</hi> supports
this theory. As it appears in the Folio, this play reprints errors
and variant readings accumulated during the entire history of the
quarto editions. Yet the Folio version introduces many new readings
throughout and supplies a number of omissions in the "deposition
scene," and despite the errors it retains from all five quartos and
the new ones which it inevitably introduces itself, it corrects for
the first time 24&frac12; of the presumable errors<ref target="f005.05.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> of Q1,
58 of Q2, 15 of Q3, 14 of Q4, and 33 of Q5 (Pollard, p. 51). These
circumstances indicate that some source in addition to the quartos
as we know them influenced the readings of the Folio text. Pollard
(pp. 89ff.) suggested that this source was a copy of Q1 which had
been used by the players as a prompt-copy and annotated
accordingly. First of all, this would explain the restoration of Q1
readings which had been corrupted by the later quartos. In
addition, exclusive Folio readings other than manifest errors could
be considered notations and changes made in the prompt-copy in
accordance with the players' practice, and the fifty lines omitted
by the Folio, except the two instances of the omission of a single
line, which are most likely the compositor's eye-skips, would thus
probably represent cuts scored out in the annotated quarto.
However, a prompt-copy in manuscript,
derived ultimately from the same source as the copy for Q1, and
thus having many of Q1's readings, would likewise explain these
characteristics of the Folio, the chief difference being that the
exclusive Folio readings then might be changes made in accordance
with the actors' habits, as Pollard believed, differences
introduced in the copying of the manuscript, compositors' variants,
or original readings corrupted by Q1 or its copy. But Pollard felt
that a manuscript prompt-copy would be

<pb n="005.056"/>

abandoned for a printed quarto as soon as the latter was available,
for, he thought, the printed copy would be easier to handle and to
read. In either case, the retention in the Folio of so many errors
from the quartos would indicate the imperfect care with which the
additional source and the copy were compared. As evidence in
support of the use of Q1 in this respect, Pollard noted the
restoration in the Folio of Q1's archaic reading of <hi rend="italic">brothers</hi>
for <hi rend="italic">brother</hi> in the phrase "my brothers <hi rend="italic">Edwards</hi>
sonne"
(c3<hi rend="super">ra</hi> 39), but this could have come from a manuscript text

having the same source as Q1.</p>



<p>Greg, arguing that a printed quarto would not ordinarily have
been used in the theatre as a prompt-copy, finds it unlikely that
"a prompter, accustomed to a manuscript 'book' with fifty to eighty
lines on a page, would have found much convenience in a printed
quarto of about half the size,"<ref target="f005.05.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref>
for the larger manuscript would put more of the play, including
coming entrances, exits, and other stage business, before the eyes
of the prompter at one time. However, there is now specific
evidence that printed quartos were indeed used as prompt-books. C.
J. Sisson has shown that many early plays were printed with the
prospect of use as prompt-copies by their purchasers and that a
provincial company in the reign of James I, whose repertory
included <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pericles,</hi> customarily
used
printed quartos as prompt-books. He cites also an extant copy of
<hi rend="italic">A Looking Glass for London and England</hi> (1594) which has
been
annotated with manuscript notes and stage-directions for such a use
by a London company on tour in the early seventeenth century.<ref target="f005.05.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> Berta Sturman has found that the
second
quarto (1625) of <hi rend="italic">A King and No King,</hi> already an old play
by
the time it was first published in 1619, was set up from a copy of
the first quarto which had been used in the theatre as the official
prompt-book by His Majesty's Servants.<ref target="f005.05.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> Here then is an example of
Shakespeare's own company using a printed quarto for its official
book. Finally, Pollard many years ago pointed out evidence in the
Folio stage-directions in <hi rend="italic">Much Ado About Nothing</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Midsummer-Night's Dream</hi> which suggests that the quartos
used
as copy for the Folio text of these plays had been employed in
the theatre as prompt-books.<ref target="f005.05.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> An
important fact to be noted in connection with these examples of
printed prompt-books is that none of them seems to have been in use
until the play was old. Since most plays were not at this time
printed before they were acted, the original prompt-book

<pb n="005.057"/>

would have to be a manuscript. It does not seem likely that a
company would abandon a satisfactory manuscript and go to the
trouble of transferring its annotations to a printed copy as long
as the manuscript was in good condition. Thus it is improbable that
Q1 of <hi rend="italic">Richard II,</hi> published when the play was still not very
old, would have been taken over immediately as the prompt-book. It
is perhaps safest, therefore, to assume that a manuscript, rather
than a printed, prompt-copy was used in the comparison of official
book with printed quarto which undoubtedly lies behind the Folio
text of <hi rend="italic">Richard II</hi>. Pollard believed that the collation was
made at the instance of the Folio editors when copy was being
prepared for their edition, but another hypothesis, to be proposed
later, may displace this traditional theory.</p>





<p>Pollard was certainly correct in his belief that the prompt-book
which was collated with the printed quarto chosen as copy for the
Folio was not available for use in Jaggard's printing-house, but
that the quarto had been compared with it in the theatre. "We have
first the fact that while some 120 of its readings<ref target="f005.05.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> were restored, about 100 others
were
left in the state to which the subsequent Quartos had reduced them;
and, secondly, we have a little handful of instances (I.i.77;
II.ii.3; V.iii.63) where we find the Folio editor wrestling with
the bad readings he found in Q5 and botching them as best he could,
in a way which forbids us to suppose that he had a copy of the
First Quarto<ref target="f005.05.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> at his elbow all the
time. I.i.77 reads in the First Quarto 'What I haue &longs;poke, or
thou can&longs;t worfe deui&longs;e'. Q2 spoilt it by omitting 'wor&longs;e';
Q3 mended it by repeating 'what' before 'thou', and the Folio
editor varied the botching by omitting this second 'what' and
changing '&longs;poke' to '&longs;poken'.<ref target="f005.05.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref>
In II.ii.3, where the First and Second Quartos have the phrase
'life-harming heauines' the Folio reads '&longs;elfe-harming', and this
seems to have originated in a gallant attempt to improve on the
absurd 'halfe-harming' of the three later Quartos. So again, in
V.iii.63, where the First and Second Quartos read 'held his
current' and the Folio 'had his current', this very poor variant is
clearly due to puzzlement caused by the three later Quartos
spelling 'held' as 'hald'."<ref target="f005.05.14" n="14"><hi rend="super">14</hi></ref></p>





<pb n="005.058"/>

<p>In the absence of the actual prompt-copy from which certain
Folio readings must originally derive, one can estimate the extent
of its use only by an examination of the readings of Q1 which the
Folio either succeeded in restoring or failed to restore, because
the manuscript can be presumed to have been closer to Q1 than to
any of the reprints, though of course it cannot reasonably be held
to resemble that quarto in every respect. The number of errors
originating in each of the quartos and later cleaned up by the
Folio has already been given above.<ref target="f005.05.15" n="15"><hi rend="super">15</hi></ref> There then remains the
accumulation of
100 or so of these uncorrected errors from quartos subsequent to Q1
to show that although the editorial work of the Folio was in many
respects exceedingly good,
it was not, however, performed without some degree of carelessness.
Thus when the Folio reproduces a reading that first occurred in a
quarto other than the First, then in a critical edition the reading
of Q1 must be followed; but when the Folio has a reading which has
not appeared before, an editor must determine from the evidence
accompanying each individual case whether he is confronted with a
compositor's or editor's corruption<ref target="f005.05.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> or with some other type of variant.
If
the latter appears to be the case, he must then decide from the
same evidence which reading is more likely to be authorial.<ref target="f005.05.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref></p>




<p>With the establishment of Q3 among the quarto reprints it was
discovered that despite the Folio's retention of a considerable
number of errors originated by the first three quartos, it does not
reproduce most of those introduced by Q4 and Q5. Pollard showed
that the Folio text has inherited 20 of the 69 presumable errors of
Q1, 59 of the 123 errors of Q2, and 18 of the 35 in Q3, but only 1
of the 18 variants of Q4 and only 4 of the 38 of Q5.<ref target="f005.05.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref> Previous to the differentiation of
Q3,
this quarto's errors were necessarily believed to originate with
Q4, and the Folio was therefore thought to embody a large number of
errors from the 1608 edition as well as from the earlier ones,
although the remarkable freedom from Q5 errors was recognized.
Although he rejected the hypothesis (if somewhat

<pb n="005.059"/>

uncertainly), Pollard felt that "the unusually complete success
with which the First Folio succeeded in evading the new errors
introduced by Q4 and Q5 would be very prettily explained if it
could be shown that it was in fact set up from an edition in which
these errors do not occur," namely Q3. He presented the case as
follows:

<q>The chief evidence on which, before the discovery of [Q3], the
Folio text was held to be based on [Q5] rather than [Q4] was the
recurrence in the Folio of the misspelling 'formerly' for
'formally' in I.iii.29, and of the three variations 'ever' for
'never', 'wer't' for 'art', and 'thine' for 'thy' which come close
together in V.v.70, 99, and 106. 'Formerly' for 'formally' is
neatly balanced by the recurrence in the Folio of [Q3's] 'unpruind'
for 'unprund' in III.iv.45 ('Her fruit trees all unpruind, her
hedges ruind') after it had been corrected in [Q4] and [Q5], the
one being a common misspelling, and the other possibly suggested
twice over by 'ruind' at the end of the line. The three variants of
[Q5] repeated in the Folio in V.v. come so suspiciously close
together, that we may be reminded that the Fifth Quarto of
<hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi> is said to have been printed from copy made up
from the [Third and] Fourth . . . and be tempted to suppose the
Folio set up from a copy of [Q3] with
the last two leaves supplied from [Q5]. But the Folio follows [Q5]
in reproducing in I.iii.167 the curious misspelling 'percullist'
for 'portcullist', which occurs in [Q4] but not in Mr. White's copy
of [Q3], and though, with the variants in different copies of [Q1]
before us, it cannot be denied that 'percullist' may have occurred
in the copy of [Q3] followed by [Q4], though not in Mr. White's, an
hypothesis which makes such large assumptions is worthless. Despite
'unpruind' and the suspiciously complete success with which the
Folio eliminates the errors of [Q4] and [Q5], I am not prepared to
challenge the derivation of the Folio from the Quarto of 1615,
though the case on the other side is only a little less strong
(Pollard, pp. 52-53).</q></p>


<p>A collation of the substantive readings of Q3 and Q5 with those
of the Folio, excluding for the moment all considerations of
spelling as in <hi rend="italic">unpruin'd</hi> and <hi rend="italic">percullist,</hi> shows
that
of the 62 times that Q3 and Q5 disagree between themselves the
Folio agrees with Q3 in 47 cases and with Q5 in 13.<ref target="f005.05.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> On the remaining two of these
occasions
it agrees with neither. One of these cases is of no concern here
because the Folio is not emending one quarto as opposed to the
other;<ref target="f005.05.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref> but the second, although
not a clearcut case, may suggest that the editor was working from
a copy of Q3. The Folio reading (c3<hi rend="super">ra</hi> 27)

<q><l>Landlord of England art thou, and not King:</l></q>

<pb n="005.060"/>

corrects the metrics of the line that appears in Qq 1-3 as

<q><l>Landlord of England art thou now not, not King,</l></q>

and in Q5 as

<q><l>Land-lord of England art thou now not, nor King.</l></q>

The Folio reading is here slightly closer to Q3 than to Q5 and thus
occurs more easily as an emendation of the earlier quarto.</p>



<p>The instances in which the Folio shares a reading with one of
these quartos, but differs from the other, include agreements in
the correction of obvious misprints<ref target="f005.05.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref> [F-Q3 <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> Q5
<hi rend="italic">is</hi> (d4<hi rend="super">va</hi>
52); F-Q5 <hi rend="italic">thy,</hi> Q3 <hi rend="italic">they</hi> (c3<hi rend="super">ra</hi>
20)], agreements in
readings which are manifestly right from the context [F-Q3
<hi rend="italic">my,</hi> Q5 <hi rend="italic">thy</hi> (c4<hi rend="super">vb</hi> 34); F-Q5
<hi rend="italic">sits,</hi> Q3 <hi rend="italic">sits
not</hi> (d2<hi rend="super">ra</hi> 52)], and agreements which seem to be
neither more
nor less correct than the variant of the other quarto [F-Q3 <hi rend="italic">a
word,</hi> Q5 <hi rend="italic">one word</hi> (c2<hi rend="super">ra</hi> 30); F-Q5
<hi rend="italic">thine owne,</hi>
Q3 <hi rend="italic">thy owne</hi> (c1<hi rend="super">ra</hi> 32)]. However, the
significance of
these figures&mdash;especially their overwhelming preponderance in
favor of Q3 as the copy-text &mdash;is very badly shaken as positive
evidence when it is found that in all but one of the Folio-Q3
agreements and in 5 of the 13 Folio-Q5 agreements,
Q1 has the same reading as the Folio. These Q1 readings being the
variants that the manuscript prompt-copy undoubtedly contained,
they could as easily appear in the Folio by way of that document as
by the use of one quarto instead of the other for the copy-text.
Therefore, since they are not significant, an exhaustive list of
them is not given here.</p>


<p>Furthermore, half of the eight Folio-Q5 agreements which remain
can be dismissed as having little more significance than the
readings for which there is precedent in Q1. <hi rend="italic">Com'st</hi>
(c1<hi rend="super">rb</hi>
50) is only a correction or modernization of <hi rend="italic">comes</hi>;
<hi rend="italic">night</hi> (c2<hi rend="super">ra</hi> 37) corrects the obviously wrong

<hi rend="italic">nights</hi>, since it should rhyme with <hi rend="italic">light</hi> in the
preceding line; and the addition of the article in the phrase <hi rend="italic">as
a moate</hi> (c2<hi rend="super">vb</hi> 25) regularizes the meter. Any
editor (and
most compositors) could be expected to make these changes without
consulting a source. Finally, the phrase <hi rend="italic">Let it be so, and
loe</hi> occurs in the first three quartos immediately after the cut
which removed the "deposition scene" and would seem to have been
added to Q1 to achieve transition after the deletion. The censored
text has:

<q>
<sp>
<speaker><hi rend="italic">Bul</hi>.</speaker>
<l>Let it be so, and loe on wednesday next,</l>
<l>We solemnely proclaime our Coronation,</l>
<l>Lords be ready all.</l>
</sp>
</q>

<pb n="005.061"/>

The passage in the Folio reads:

<q>
<sp>
<speaker><hi rend="italic">Bull</hi>.</speaker>
<l>On Wednesday next, we solemnly set downe</l>
<l>Our Coronation: Lords, prepare your selues. (d2<hi rend="super">vb</hi>
57-58)</l>
</sp>
</q>

When the "deposition scene" was restored in Q4, the introductory
phrase was struck out, presumably on the authority of the source
from which the restored passage was acquired. The same origin
applies also to the Folio readings <hi rend="italic">set downe</hi> (for
<hi rend="italic">proclaime</hi>) and <hi rend="italic">prepare your selues</hi> (for
<hi rend="italic">be ready
all</hi>), which occur in the words immediately following. All of
these Q5 readings one might expect to find in the Folio, whatever
the quarto used as copy.</p>

<p>Thus there remain in significant support of Q3 as the copy for
the Folio <hi rend="italic">Richard II</hi> the one substantive reading of the
old-fashioned <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> for <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
(d1<hi rend="super">vb</hi> 65), which Pollard
did not take into account, and the fact&mdash;negative evidence, it is
true&mdash;that the Folio repeats 97 errors that had accumulated by the
time Q3 was published, but only four variants that first occurred
in the later quartos. To these may be added the emendation in
c3<hi rend="super">ra</hi> 27 which seems to be based on the Q3 reading. In
contrast
to this there are the Folio-Q5 agreements: <hi rend="italic">formerly</hi> for
<hi rend="italic">formally</hi> (c1<hi rend="super">rb</hi> 46), <hi rend="italic">euer</hi> for
<hi rend="italic">neuer</hi> (d4<hi rend="super">vb</hi>
44), <hi rend="italic">wer't</hi> for <hi rend="italic">art</hi> (d5<hi rend="super">ra</hi> 9),
and <hi rend="italic">thine</hi> for
<hi rend="italic">thy</hi> (d5<hi rend="super">ra</hi> 18). If, as Pollard suggests,
<hi rend="italic">formerly</hi>
can be written off as a common error, it is found that the Folio-Q5
readings cluster together in the last three columns of
the Folio edition in lines which in Q3 occupy the two final leaves,
I3 and I4, and which in Q5 are found on the last three type-pages,
K1<hi rend="super">v</hi>-K2<hi rend="super">v</hi>. This grouping suggested to
Pollard the possibility
(even though he rejected it) that the copy was Q3 with the last two
leaves supplied from an exemplum of Q5.</p>

<p>At this point the spelling variants can be considered. The form
<hi rend="italic">percullist</hi> near the beginning of the play
(c1<hi rend="super">vb</hi> 48),
which the Folio has in common with Q5 and which is the only variant
originating in Q4 to appear in the Folio, is not the obstacle that
Pollard felt it to be, for the <hi rend="italic">NED</hi> records it as a variant,
especially in the noun form <hi rend="italic">percullis</hi>, of the more usual
<hi rend="italic">portcullist</hi>. This is also true of the Folio-Q5
<hi rend="italic">impresse</hi> for <hi rend="italic">impreese</hi> (c5<hi rend="super">rb</hi>
44). Conversely then,
the Q3 spelling <hi rend="italic">unpruind</hi> (d1<hi rend="super">rb</hi> 57),
occurring in the
major section of the play in which there is the great lack of Q5
variants, is evidence (especially since it is the repetition by the
Folio of a unique Q3 error) that the Folio compositors were here
following Q3. It is not necessarily surprising to find the Folio
avoiding other unusual Q3 spellings,
for the orthography of that quarto is archaic in comparison with
the consistently more modern First Folio. One other instance of
spelling further suggests a made-up copy. In d4<hi rend="super">vb</hi> 27,
which
precedes the first of

<pb n="005.062"/>

the cluster of Q5 agreements by just seventeen lines and which
falls within the lines which Q5 would have supplied if the two
final leaves of Q3 had been missing, the Folio has the later
quarto's abnormal <hi rend="italic">tels,</hi> whereas Q3 has <hi rend="italic">tells,</hi>
the
normal spelling in all three editions. The proximity of this
variant to the group of Q5 substantives is very convincing. In
general, however, other spelling variations do not occur in such a
way as to indicate which quarto the compositors were using.</p>

<p>If the copy for the Folio <hi rend="italic">Richard II</hi> was indeed a mixed

quarto, it is necessary to attempt to determine the point at which
the compositor began to set up his text from Q5, though one cannot
with absolute certainty fix the precise line which was the first to
be taken from that quarto. If the last two leaves (I3 and I4) were
missing from the copy of Q3, three leaves (K1-3) would have to be
supplied from a copy of Q5, since the last line of I2<hi rend="super">v</hi> in
Q3 is
line 9 on K1<hi rend="super">v</hi> of Q5. Admittedly, it would be awkward for
a
compositor to pick up within the verso of a leaf; yet since there
is no evidence that more than the last two leaves of Q3 were
missing from the copy being used, it is more logical to believe
that he would follow this quarto as far as it went and then pick up
at the following line in the Q5 leaves, rather than that he would
leave off in Q3, say after line 32 of I2,
in order to begin at the top of the recto of the first leaf taken
from Q5. It would have been even more awkward to leave Q3 at line
29 of I2<hi rend="super">v</hi> in order to begin at the top of
K1<hi rend="super">v</hi> in the Q5
leaves. In the absence of more exact evidence it seems best,
therefore, to assume that d4<hi rend="super">va</hi> 56, which corresponds to
the
final line of I2<hi rend="super">v</hi> in Q3, was the last Folio line to be set
from
Q3.</p>

<p>Support for the evidence supplied by the substantives and
spelling that the copy for <hi rend="italic">Richard II</hi> was a made-up quarto
comes primarily from the punctuation. Capitalization and
italicization are of no help. The Folio makes extensive use of
capitals and is fairly consistent in italicizing titles and proper
names. On the other hand, Q5 makes considerable use of capitals and
italics, though not so extensively as the Folio, whereas Q3 makes
little use of either. The system in the Folio seems to be due to
the compositors' habits and to bear no relation to either quarto,
for not even in the Folio's lapses is there any indication of
quarto influence.</p>

<p>A comparison of the punctuation in the three editions is
somewhat more helpful. It is, of course, true again that the Folio
has its own heavy system, which is applied fairly consistently;
that the punctuation of Q5 is somewhat lighter; and that the
punctuation of Q3 is lighter still. There are, for example, 28
cases in which at the same point in the text a clause is ended in
the Folio by a colon, in Q5 by a semicolon, and in Q3 by a comma.
There are 14 in which the Folio has a period where Q5 has a

<pb n="005.063"/>

colon and where Q3 has a comma, and 6 in which a Folio period is
paralleled by a semicolon in Q5 and a comma in Q3. In addition,
where the Folio makes extensive use of commas, the quartos (Q3 more
so than Q5) use them more sparingly, sometimes omitting them in
connection with vocatives and interjections. Finally, the countless
times that all three editions are in agreement naturally supply no
information. Any information regarding the copy to be derived from
the punctuation must therefore be concerned with variations and
lapses within the punctuation systems of the three editions and
must revolve largely around the heavier punctuation marks. As a
result, nothing can be learned from the instances in which the
Folio and Q5 have heavy punctuation (not necessarily the same) and
Q3 has a comma,
or from the cases in which heavy punctuation in the Folio and Q3
(again not necessarily the same) is paralleled by a comma in Q5,
for here the Folio might well be editing according to its own
practice.<ref target="f005.05.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref> It can be assumed that
the early prompt-book, although it supplied certain readings, had
no influence whatever on the Folio punctuation. If the collation
were, as Pollard thought, a part of the Folio editors' preparation
of copy, the punctuation of the prompt would hardly have been
incorporated into that copy since an entirely different system was
to be used in the new edition; or if, as will be suggested later,
the quarto was annotated some years earlier for use in the theatre,
no attention would have been given to punctuation as long as it did
not radically alter the sense,
for theatrical manuscripts were very lightly punctuated. In
punctuation the manuscript prompt-book may not, then, have been
very different from Q1, which is also very lightly punctuated. In
contrast to the grammatical punctuation in all the subsequent
editions, Q1 in its set speeches makes use of dramatic punctuation,
which led Pollard (p. 64) to believe that it represents
Shakespeare's own system.</p>


<p>The most significant fact a study of the punctuation yields is
that on 48 occasions the Folio agrees with Q3 in using a comma
where Q5 has a colon or semicolon and where the Folio would be
expected to have heavy punctuation also. One of these cases is
particularly meaningful because the punctuation determines the
grammatical relationship of the words and hence the meaning of the
line. Richard, realizing that all is lost, says in the Folio text:

<pb n="005.064"/>

<q>
<l>Goe to Flint Castle, there Ile pine away,</l>
<l>A King, Woes slaue, shall Kingly Woe obey:</l>
<l>That power I haue, discharge, and let'em goe</l>
<l>To eare the Land, that hath some hope to grow,</l>
<l>For I haue none.</l>
<l>(c6<hi rend="super">rb</hi> 22-26)</l>
</q>

In the third line of this passage the Folio and Q3 have a comma
after <hi rend="italic">haue</hi>, but Q5 has a semicolon, so that in the latter
the words <hi rend="italic">That power I haue</hi> form an independent clause
referring to the preceding thought, whereas in Q3 and the Folio
they are a dependent clause used as the object of
<hi rend="italic">discharge</hi>.</p>

<p>Since compositor's convenience has already indicated that the
matter for which the substantives suggest Q5 as copy-text begins at
d4<hi rend="super">va</hi> 57, it is to be noted that none of these Folio-Q3
agreements occurs after line 45 of the same column, although, it is
true, there are also five earlier pages (c1<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
c4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, c5<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
c6<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and d3<hi rend="super">r</hi>)<ref target="f005.05.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref> on which none
of these particular agreements is found. Individual examples are
untrustworthy because of the possibility of coincidence, but the
occurrence of two of these agreements in this column
(d4<hi rend="super">va</hi> 3 and
45, which correspond respectively to I2:33 and I2<hi rend="super">v</hi>:27 in
Q3)
indicates further that Q3 was the copy through d4<hi rend="super">va</hi> 56.
(It is
true that in line 47 the Folio agrees with Q5 in using a semicolon
where Q3 has a colon, which somewhat weakens the evidence of the
two commas, but information derived from a choice among heavy
punctuation marks is perhaps less conclusive
than that from Folio commas standing in contrast to heavier
punctuation in a given quarto. The evidence for the last line to be
set up from Q3 is at best only suggestive.)</p>


<p>On the other hand, before d4<hi rend="super">va</hi> 57 there are only
two
instances in which the Folio shares a comma with Q5 as opposed to
heavier punctuation (a colon in one case and a period in the other)
in Q3. The first of these occurs on b6<hi rend="super">v</hi>, which has eleven
of the
Folio-Q3 agreements; the other, on c1, which has three of the
Folio-Q3 agreements. In such a situation these two isolated cases
are surely fortuitous. Although it is true that in view of the
relationship of the punctuation in these three editions chance
would make lapses in the Folio system agree more frequently with
the much lighter punctuation of Q3, the totals and proportions in
this instance cannot possibly be due to coincidence. Within these
same pages the occasions on which the Folio and one quarto agree in
the use of a colon or semicolon against the other punctuation mark
in the differing quarto are

<pb n="005.065"/>

nearly balanced, but if added to the figures already given, they
certainly do nothing to destroy their evidence. The Folio and Q3
twice have colons and twice have semicolons in common where Q5 has
the other of the two marks, and the Folio and Q5 twice have colons
and once have semicolons where Q3 disagrees by using the other
mark. This makes a total of 52 Folio-Q3 agreements in comparison
with 5 Folio-Q5 agreements in this major section of the play.</p>

<p>As has been stated, the occurrence of commas in relation to
other commas or to a lack of punctuation is generally unreliable
for information regarding the copy. Nevertheless, there is a
handful of instances in which the Folio fails to use a comma where
it would normally be expected to have one and in so doing agrees
with the punctuation of one of the quartos against the other. Three
times the Folio is in agreement with Q3. The first of these, by far
the most significant, occurs in b6<hi rend="super">va</hi> 16, which begins the
passage

<q>
<l>Which blood, like sacrificing <hi rend="italic">Abels</hi> cries,</l>
<l>(Euen from the toonglesse cauernes of the earth)</l>
<l>To me for iustice, and rough chasticement:</l>
</q>

A comma after <hi rend="italic">Abels,</hi> which appears in Q5, immediately
makes
it clear that <hi rend="italic">cries</hi> is a verb rather than a noun, but both
the Folio and Q3 omit it.</p>

<p>For what they are worth two other lines may be given:

<q>
<sp>
<speaker><hi rend="italic">Ser</hi>.</speaker>
<l>What are they dead? (d1<hi rend="super">va</hi> 1)</l>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker><hi rend="italic">Yor</hi>.</speaker>
<l>I will be satisfied: let me see it I say. (d3<hi rend="super">vb</hi> 3)</l>
</sp>
</q>

The Folio and Q3 have no comma after the interjection <hi rend="italic">what</hi>
in the first of these or before the parenthetical <hi rend="italic">I say</hi> in
the second, whereas in both cases Q5 does have a comma.</p>

<p>The only similar Folio-Q5 agreement is the omission of a
clarifying comma before <hi rend="italic">holliday</hi> in c5<hi rend="super">rb</hi> 63:


<q><l>A while to worke, and after holliday.</l></q>

Here Q3 has the punctuation. This omission, however, is not nearly
so serious as the one in connection with <hi rend="italic">Abels,</hi> and that
particular Folio-Q3 agreement remains by far the more
significant.</p>

<p>All instances involving parentheses or hyphens occur well within
the section set up from Q3. By themselves the parentheses show
little, but in conjunction with the other punctuation they throw
their weight in support of this quarto as the copy. It is, of
course, true that there are many cases where the Folio uses
parentheses though neither quarto does, and a few in which the
Folio has other punctuation even though both quartos have
parentheses. Nevertheless, on the five occasions when the two
quartos

<pb n="005.066"/>

disagree in the use of these marks, the Folio always agrees with Q3
in omitting them.</p>

<p>The evidence of the hyphens is less conclusive, but argues for
Q3 when added to other facts. Again, as in the case of all
punctuation, the Folio uses hyphens more frequently than either
quarto, and very occasionally it will omit them where both quartos
have them. Where Q3 and Q5 are not in agreement, the Folio agrees
with the latter seven times in having hyphens, which is what would
be expected since it is in keeping with Folio practice. However, on
seven other occasions the Folio agrees with Q3 in omitting them,
although there too it might have been expected to use them in
accordance with its general tendency.<ref target="f005.05.24" n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref></p>


<p>One group of contradictory evidence must be accounted for. On
fifteen occasions, elsewhere than at the end of a speech, Q3 and Q5
disagree in the use of a period as opposed to some other
punctuation mark and the Folio agrees with one of them&mdash;in nine of
these cases with Q5; in only six, with Q3. This group needs to be
considered by itself rather than to be included in other
Folio-quarto agreements in heavy punctuation because it is a
relatively infrequent type of punctuation. In the light of the
evidence of the other punctuation, however, this one-fifth majority
in favor of Q5 is undoubtedly due to the fact that the more
frequent use of heavy punctuation in Q5 than in Q3 would make the
still more heavily punctuated Folio more likely to agree with the
later quarto in all cases where chance could be operating.</p>

<p>The Folio punctuation of c6<hi rend="super">ra</hi> 15 is similar:

<q>
<l>Againe uncurse their Soules; their peace is made</l>
<l>With Heads, and not with Hands: those whom you curse</l>
<l>Haue felt the worst of Deaths destroying hand, (c6<hi rend="super">ra</hi>
15-17)</l>
</q>

Q3 has:

<q>
<l>Againe uncurse their soules, their peace is made.</l>
<l>With head, and not with hands, those whom you curse</l>
<l>Haue felt the worst of deaths destroying wound,</l>
</q>

<pb n="005.067"/>

Q5 reads:

<q>
<l>Againe uncurse their soules, their peace is made</l>
<l>With head, and not with hands, those whom you curse</l>
<l>Haue felt the worst of deaths destroying wound,</l>
</q>

The difficulty lies in the Folio's failure to repeat the period
after <hi rend="italic">made</hi> if Q3 was indeed the copy. The Folio
<hi rend="italic">Heads</hi>
for the quarto <hi rend="italic">head</hi> must be a correction from the
prompt-copy, for Q1 here agrees with the Folio.<ref target="f005.05.25" n="25"><hi rend="super">25</hi></ref> Therefore, if the postulated
manuscript
prompt-book can be assumed to have had more or less the same
punctuation as Q1, it is possible that this is an exceptional case
of the influence of the prompt on the punctuation of the Folio
copy. Q1 has only commas, but they give the same grammatical
relationship as the stops found in the Folio:

<q>
<l>Againe, uncurse their soules, their peace is made</l>
<l>With heads and not with hands, those whom you curse</l>
<l>Haue felt the worst of deathes destroying wound,</l>
</q>

When in the collation of the prompt-book and Q3 the word
<hi rend="italic">head</hi> was made plural, the reader, noticing that the
punctuation of the quarto disagreed with the sense of the prompt,
could have struck out the period after <hi rend="italic">made</hi>. It is perhaps
significant that each compositor after Q3 tinkered with the
punctuation at this point. Q4 has a comma, and Q5, as already
shown, nothing.</p>


<p>Finally, in the passage (c4<hi rend="super">va</hi> 64-66)

<q>
<sp>
<speaker><hi rend="italic">Bull</hi>.</speaker>
<l>Euermore thankes, th'Exchequer of the poore,</l>
<l>Which till my infant-fortune comes to yeeres,</l>
<l>Stands for my Bountie:</l>
</sp>
</q>

the Folio agrees in line 64 with Q5 in the form <hi rend="italic">thankes</hi>
followed by a comma, where Q3 follows the earlier quartos with
<hi rend="italic">thanke's</hi> without a comma. As a correction or modernization,

the Folio reading does not necessarily require precedent, and the
comma is, of course, in keeping with normal Folio practice.</p>

<p>The evidence of the punctuation must be considered collectively,
for individual cases, except those commented upon, are too subject
to chance to mean much until they are seen in the aggregate. Taken
as a whole, then, the punctuation of the Folio edition of
<hi rend="italic">Richard II</hi> shows in all but approximately the last three
columns of the text the influence of Q3. That this major portion of
the play was set from Q3 has already been indicated

<pb n="005.068"/>

by the repetition in the Folio of the Q3 error <hi rend="italic">unpruin'd</hi> and
the Q3 reading <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> and by the lack of unexplainable
agreements with Q4 or Q5. Added to this, the evidence of the
punctuation makes it certain that up to approximately d4<hi rend="super">va</hi>
57 Q3
was the copy for the Folio.</p>

<p>Similar evidence shows that from approximately
d4<hi rend="super">va</hi> 57 to the
end of the play the lines were set up from the last three leaves of
Q5, from which fact it must be assumed that the two final leaves of
Q3 were missing or mutilated beyond use. The major evidence here is
the three Q5 substantives which come so close together: <hi rend="italic">euer</hi>
(d4<hi rend="super">vb</hi> 44), <hi rend="italic">wer't</hi> (d5<hi rend="super">ra</hi> 9),
and <hi rend="italic">thine</hi> (d5<hi rend="super">ra</hi>
18). These are reinforced by the repetition in d4<hi rend="super">vb</hi> 27 of
Q5's
abnormal spelling <hi rend="italic">tels</hi>. The punctuation variants in this
section are uninformative. The two Folio-Q3 agreements in the use
of a colon (d4<hi rend="super">vb</hi> 35 and d5<hi rend="super">rb</hi> 15), where
Q5 has a period in
one case and a semicolon in the other, are outweighed by the other
evidence, although there is no similar Folio-Q5 agreement to
balance them. It is quite true that this latter section of the
Folio play contains four substantive readings in agreement with Q3,
from which Q5 differs. However, not only are they all corrections
which a careful editor might make: <hi rend="italic">eare</hi> for
<hi rend="italic">care</hi>
(d4<hi rend="super">vb</hi> 17), <hi rend="italic">their</hi> for <hi rend="italic">there</hi>
(d4<hi rend="super">vb</hi> 24),
<hi rend="italic">haue</hi> for <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> (d4<hi rend="super">vb</hi> 34), and
<hi rend="italic">Towne of
Ciceter</hi> for <hi rend="italic">towne Ciceter</hi> (d5<hi rend="super">ra</hi> 41);
but more
important still, they are also readings which are found in Q1 and
thus most likely were in the manuscript prompt-copy. Thus for the
last three columns, probably beginning actually at d4<hi rend="super">va</hi> 57,
Q5
must have been the copy, and Pollard's suggestion that the Folio
<hi rend="italic">Richard II</hi> might have been set from a made-up copy proves
to
be true.</p>

<p>There remains to be briefly considered the "deposition scene,"
which begins in the Folio at d2<hi rend="super">rb</hi> 18 and ends on
d2<hi rend="super">vb</hi> 56 and
which comprises almost one-third of the single scene of Act Four.
Political conditions at the end of the sixteenth century had made
any suggestion of the dethroning of a monarch dangerous. Most
literary historians believe that the passage was excised for this
reason, though Richard technically abdicates and the lines actually
enlist sympathy on his side. Pollard, who thought that the play
gained dramatically from the omission, felt that artistic
considerations also influenced the excision (p. 63). When Matthew
Lawe acquired the rights to the play and brought out Q4 in 1608, he
restored the long passage (calling it "new additions"), presumably
because it was by then being acted in the play and he wanted his
edition to be up to date. P. A.
Daniel's suggestion (p. xi) that Andrew Wise had acquired these
lines along with the rest of the play, had kept them in manuscript,
and then handed them over to Lawe when the latter bought the play
is highly speculative. It is unlikely that Wise would have kept
such material if indeed he had ever had it.</p>

<pb n="005.069"/>

<p>Moreover, the condition of the passage in Q4 and Q5 indicates a
memorial reconstruction, for the quarto text has a considerable
amount of incorrect line-division and omits six half-lines and one
complete line. The Folio corrects the lineation and supplies the
omissions. There are also a number of variant readings in the texts
of this scene, some of which occur in connection with the omissions
in the quarto version. It is safe to assume that the quarto
readings in these cases are also due to the memorial reconstruction
of the text and that the Folio variants were supplied by the copy,
but there is no direct bibliographical evidence to show whether the
Folio text of this passage was set up from a manuscript or from
corrected pages of Q5.
Since the "deposition scene" occurs in the section of the play set
from Q3, which lacks this passage, leaves could have been taken
from the copy of Q5 which supplied the last leaves of the made-up
copy-text, or a transcript of the lines could have been made when
Q3 was compared with the manuscript prompt-book. The Folio and Q5
compositors each maintain their own policies regarding the
accidentals, and the scene fails to shed the light on the rest of
the play that one would hope for. One might expect that a few lines
immediately before and after the material missing from Q3 would
have been set from the same source as this material if the copy had
been Q5 leaves and would have left traces of the nature of their
copy. Not only is such evidence lacking,
but in d2<hi rend="super">vb</hi> 60, only two lines beyond the last line
supplied in
connection with the "deposition scene," there is one of the
Folio-Q3 agreements in the use of a comma as against a Q5
semi-colon. The absence of the evidence desired may be due to the
convenience with which the extra material could be inserted into
Q3. The deletion occurs within three lines of the bottom of
H1<hi rend="super">r</hi>
of Q3, and those three lines, being the ones that had been
rewritten to cover the omission, had to be supplied anew with the
rest of the "deposition scene." Hence the compositor could set from
the quarto to what was thus in effect the bottom of H1<hi rend="super">r</hi>,
then
make the necessary additions, and finally take up again in Q3 at
the top of H1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, exactly where he had left off.</p>

<p>It becomes necessary to explain why the copy for the First Folio
<hi rend="italic">Richard II</hi> should have been a made-up quarto, for it is
fantastic to think that Jaggard was able to get hold only of two
fragmentary quartos and had to piece them together. A mutilated
quarto would have to be of some importance for anyone to bother to
fill it out with leaves from another exemplum or for a printer to
use it for copy when he presumably would have little trouble in
finding another that was complete.</p>

<p>Professor Fredson Bowers has recently suggested to me that if
the copy of Q3 used by the Folio compositors were itself the
official prompt-book

<pb n="005.070"/>

of the King's Company, it would fulfill this condition. Q5 leaves
might be used to restore a lacuna either by a book-keeper who did
not want to go to the trouble to annotate a whole new quarto (or
transcribe extra leaves) or by an editor who wanted to uphold his
claim that he was publishing "according to the True Originall
Copies." This hypothesis also has the advantage of offering a much
simpler history of the omission of certain lines from the Folio
text: because these passages were scored out of the prompt-book
which the compositor was using, he likewise left them out of the
Folio as a result of a too scrupulous following of copy. According
to Pollard's alternate theory, one would be faced with the less
desirable circumstance that the editor, confronted with both a
complete text and an abridged one, had chosen to follow the
latter.</p>

<p>The use of Q1 as a prompt-book as early as 1597 has previously
been rejected on the grounds that it seems unlikely that the
prompter would have abandoned a good manuscript prompt-copy just
because a printed quarto had appeared. Nevertheless, the manuscript
would in time become too worn for use, and it would then be cheaper
and easier to replace it by annotating a printed text already in
existence than to have a new transcript made by a scribe. If this
can be assumed to have happened in the case of Q3, then the
collation of that quarto and the early prompt-book was made not, as
Pollard believed, at the time of the preparation of copy for the
Folio, but presumably some years before, and is thus one step
removed in time from the editing of the Folio. It has already been
suggested that the incompleteness and unevenness of the collation
indicate that Jaggard did not have the early prompt-copy in his
shop.
As according to the new hypothesis no first-hand use of the
original prompt-book would seem to have been made in the Folio,
that early document may have been lost or destroyed after it was
succeeded by an annotated copy of Q3.</p>

<p>Q3 would probably have been chosen for the prompt-copy because
it was the most readily available edition when a new book was
needed. One can speculate that the need arose before the
publication of Q4 in 1608, for a copy of Q3 used as a prompt-book
would involve the rather awkward circumstance of having to preserve
or copy the "deposition scene" in manuscript and insert it in the
presumably smaller quarto for performances in which these lines
were restored. If Q4 or Q5 had been published by the time a new
prompt was needed, one or the other would have been a far more
convenient quarto to use by virtue of its already having the
previously omitted material, although the state of this section of
the text would have necessitated extensive and possibly cramped
annotation. Therefore the theory that the made-up copy was a
theatrical prompt-book

<pb n="005.071"/>

may carry the further implication that the "deposition scene" as it
appears in the Folio was set up from a manuscript rather than from
annotated leaves of Q5.</p>

<p>In speculating on the relationship of the time of the accident
which mutilated the Q3 prompt-book to the time of the printing of
the Folio, one is faced with several possibilities. The accident
could have occurred in the theatre, or it might have happened after
the quarto was brought to the printing-house. Although one would
ordinarily expect the damage to be repaired as soon as it was done,
it would even be possible, however, that the leaves were lost in
the theatre, but through carelessness or the removal of the play
from the active repertory were not replaced until the quarto became
printer's copy. A stage-direction in the Folio may suggest a
solution to this problem. In the margin at d4<hi rend="super">vb</hi> 10 the
Folio has
for its stage-direction the one word <hi rend="italic">Musick</hi>,
whereas the corresponding direction in Q5 reads
<hi rend="italic">Musicksplaies</hi>.<ref target="f005.05.26" n="26"><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref> and
occurs
three lines farther along in the speech, at the point at which
Richard first mentions that he hears music in the distance.
Considerations of space do not seem to have dictated the change of
position or of form. In the first place, because of the amount of
text still to be set up, the compositor could have been
entertaining no thought of finishing the play on this type-page.
Furthermore, although other stage-directions in this part of the
play have been shortened or reworded, the purpose does not in any
instance seem to have been to save space. All of those that consist
of more than one word are put into the column as separate lines
rather than relegated to the margin,
and one or two directions have been expanded beyond the quarto
readings. Even if the compositor had abbreviated this particular
stage-direction in order to put it into the margin, there is no
reason for his having moved it to the line beside which it stands
in the Folio. Not only is this line slightly longer than the one
next to which the direction originally occurred in the quartos, but
between the two there is a line much shorter than either of them,
which would have been a much more likely choice if the compositor
had thought that he did not have room for the stage-direction in
its original place. Both the brevity and the anticipatory position
of the Folio stage-direction

<pb n="005.072"/>

suggest as copy a prompt-book annotated in such a way that the
prompter would be warned ahead of time that his sound effects must
be ready. In the light of this example, the change of the Q5
direction <hi rend="italic">Enter one to Richard with meat</hi>. to the Folio
reading, <hi rend="italic">Enter Keeper with a Dish.</hi> (d5<hi rend="super">ra</hi> 3),
may also
indicate a prompt-book. It may follow, therefore, that the other
Folio variants of Q5 stage-directions are likewise due to the
nature of the copy, although all the rest, including the removal of
<hi rend="italic">Enter Keeper with a Dish.</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">Enter
Northumberland</hi>. (d5<hi rend="super">ra</hi> 43) from their incorrect
positions in
Q5 to correct ones in the Folio, are well within the powers of an
editor's independent emendation.</p>


<p>If this speculation is correct, then the Q5 leaves were supplied
when the exemplum of Q3 was being used in the theatre as a prompt,
and the accident antedates the use of the quarto as printer's copy.
The theatrical use of this made-up prompt-book further implies that
<hi rend="italic">Richard II</hi> was still being acted as late as 1615, the date
of the publication of Q5.</p>

</head>

<div2 type="section"><head/>
<p>The methods of determining the compositors of the Shakespeare
First Folio (1623) by spelling tests have become well-known to
bibliographers. The first suggestion for such a determination was
advanced in 1920 by Thomas Satchell, who noted that
orthographically the Folio <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> fell in two distinct
divisions, (1) from the beginning of the play to III.iii (216-col.
a, 2m5), and (2) from III.iv to the end of the play (col. b,
2m5-2n4).<ref target="f005.06.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> With the exception of
one page (2m2), the first portion of the play contains the forms
<hi rend="italic">doe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">goe</hi>, whereas the latter portion uses the

forms <hi rend="italic">do</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">doo</hi>) and <hi rend="italic">go</hi>. Mr.
Satchell
supports this division of the play by a list of thirty-three other
words which are consistent in each half of the play, but differ in
the two halves.<ref target="f005.06.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> He was unable to
determine whether these findings were best explained by supposing
that two compositors worked on the play or
that two copyists worked on the manuscript from which the play was
printed.</p>



<p>It remained for E. E. Willoughby in <hi rend="italic">The Printing of the First
Folio</hi> (1932) p. 56ff. to demonstrate from the printing of other
plays in the Folio that Mr. Satchell's conjecture that two
compositors were used was correct. Using the <hi rend="italic">doe/do</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">goe/go</hi> forms as a basis, he selected three other "especially
significant words not peculiar to <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>":
<hi rend="italic">cousin/cosin</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">cosine, cozen</hi>),
<hi rend="italic">here/heere</hi>,
and <hi rend="italic">traytor/traitor</hi>. Using these five words, Mr. Willoughby
confirmed Mr. Satchell's division of the play: one compositor, whom
he labelled "A," set from the beginning of the play through

<pb n="005.074"/>

2m1<hi rend="super">v</hi>; the second compositor, "B," set one page (2m2),
but
immediately following this page the typesetting was resumed by A,
who set from 2m2<hi rend="super">v</hi> through column a, 2m5; compositor
B returned
to the setting and continued from column b, 2m5, through the end of
the play. With the same test, Mr. Willoughby identified two
compositors at work in <hi rend="italic">Richard II, Julius Caesar,</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>. He further showed that the two compositors were at
work in <hi rend="italic">The Tempest,</hi> the first play to be printed, and that
compositor A set up the present first page of <hi rend="italic">Troilus</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Cressida,</hi> the last play to be printed. But he introduced the
possibility that another compositor or another pair of compositors
participated in setting type within the Folio, particularly in <hi rend="italic">A
Midsummer Night's Dream, The Merchant of Venice,</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Romeo
and Juliet</hi> which "show no evidence . . . of having been
composed by either <hi rend="italic">A</hi> or <hi rend="italic">B"</hi> (p. 58).</p>

<p>When we apply Mr. Willoughby's test to <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> in
the
Folio, it could appear at first sight that the unknown compositors
were at work, as the following distribution of variants shows:

<p>Here it appears that compositor B was responsible for pages 2q2,
2q3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, 2q4, 2q5, 2r1, 2r2, 2r2<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
2r3<hi rend="super">v</hi>, 2r4, 2r4<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
2r5<hi rend="super">v</hi>, 2r6, 2r6<hi rend="super">v</hi>, 2s1,
2s1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, 2s2, 2s2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and 2s3, where
the proportion is four or more characteristic B-forms to one
characteristic A-form. But in the remaining nine pages
(2q2<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
2q3, 2q4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, 2q5<hi rend="super">v</hi>, 2q6,
2q6<hi rend="super">v</hi>, 2r1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, 2r3, and 2r5) we have
a higher proportion of A-forms,

<pb n="005.075"/>

and in two instances (2q3 and 2q6) they outnumber the B-forms. Thus
we should assign these pages either to the unknown compositor(s) or
to compositor A. Yet in these pages appear words other than <hi rend="italic">do,
go</hi> and <hi rend="italic">here</hi> which are spelled in compositor B's
characteristic way; for example, on 2q2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, a doubtful page,
we
have <hi rend="italic">maiesty,</hi> B's characteristic spelling, three times. And
on 2q3, where the A-forms outnumber the B-forms, we have the
characteristic B spelling <hi rend="italic">deerest</hi>. In the light of this, Mr.
Willoughby's admittedly "simple" test can be trusted only where
preponderant evidence reveals the compositor. In instances where
the evidence is doubtful, other tests must be used to determine the
responsible compositor.</p>

<p>Another test for the determination of compositors is that
evolved by Charlton Hinman, who published an account of his
technique in 1940.<ref target="f005.06.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> Briefly, the
test gathers evidence from significant variant spellings and, by an
appeal to "coincidence of position," determines the compositor who
is at work. But an examination of 600 variant spellings of 142
words in the Folio text of <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> failed to bring to light any
demonstrable two-compositor pattern. Indeed, from all the evidence
derived from this test it appeared most likely that only one
compositor was at work during the setting of the play.<ref target="f005.06.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> Because characteristic forms do
not
appear "on distinct groups of pages" we are justified in evaluating
this evidence as indicating only one compositor.</p>



<p>If only one compositor is responsible for <hi rend="italic">Lear,</hi> the next

question concerns his identity. Since the last part of the play can
be shown by Mr. Willoughby's test most probably to have been set by
compositor B, it follows that the whole play was set by him.
However, this simple test needs confirmation. Fortunately, several
additional pieces of evidence can be advanced to identify the
compositor of <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> with the compositor B of the rest of the
Folio. Although individually these details are not irrefutable in
themselves, the cumulative weight of them all shows conclusively
that this compositor is B. This evidence can be drawn from two
sources, the plays surrounding <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> and from
<hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>
itself.</p>

<p>First, evidence from the simple compositor-determination test
shows clearly that the plays surrounding <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> were set by
identifiable compositors. The following table shows the
compositorial assignments in these neighboring plays:

<p><hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> then, ends with compositor B setting type;
<hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> opens with the same compositor at work;
<hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>
intervenes. It was not a practice of the Folio compositors to
change at the beginning of a play; they set by pages rather than by
act, scene, or play. Their usual habit was to continue from one
play to another unless they were at the end of a gathering or a
section. There are only two demonstrable changes of compositors at
the beginning of a play that is not also the beginning of a new
gathering or section: at the beginning of <hi rend="italic">1 Henry IV,</hi>
compositor A takes over from B (04), and at the beginning of
<hi rend="italic">Macbeth,</hi> compositor A again takes over from B (2l6);
against
these two instances we have at least fifteen occasions when the
compositor who set the latter part of a play continued to set the
beginning of the following play.<ref target="f005.06.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref>
It is not impossible but indeed more likely that compositor B,
who set the last pages of <hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> should continue to set the
beginning pages of <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>.</p>


<p>Nor must one believe it would be impossible for one compositor
to set a whole play. Compositor A, early in the setting of the
Folio, had set <hi rend="italic">Two Gentlemen of Verona</hi> in its entirety, and
compositor B had set all of <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Timon</hi>.
The situation of a compositor setting four plays consecutively is
unique in the Folio but not unlikely.</p>

<pb n="005.077"/>

<p>From this evidence, found in plays surrounding <hi rend="italic">Lear,</hi>
one
notes that in the four plays preceding <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> compositor B set
72 pages to A's 23 pages. Since B set more and more pages until
finally he was setting three plays alone, it seems not unlikely
that the pattern which is clearly established in the plays of
<hi rend="italic">Othello, Antony,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cymbeline</hi> had its
beginning in
<hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>. All of the large groups of pages from
<hi rend="italic">Timon</hi>
through <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> are by compositor B: he set 24 pages
(2g3<hi rend="super">v</hi>-2h5<hi rend="super">v</hi>) in his largest group.
Compositor A, on the other
hand, set only 5&frac12; pages in his largest group
(2m2<hi rend="super">v</hi>-col. a,
2m5). Certainly the preponderantly large groups set by any one
compositor in this section are those by compositor B.</p>

<p>Moreover, in <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> we find only one skeleton-forme
present: if we had found two skeletons in use here our conclusion
that only one compositor was setting type might well be suspect.
Generally speaking, if we find two skeletons in use, we may find
two compositors at work.<ref target="f005.06.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> If we
find only one skeleton in use, we may have either one or two
compositors at work, but certainly, except in very special
circumstances, two skeletons more likely may be equated with the
work of two compositors than with one, especially in folio
printing. It would be impossible for one compositor to maintain a
speed in composing, rinsing, distributing, and attending to his
other duties that would allow him to keep abreast of the press in
a manner necessitating the use of two skeletons; and where we find
one skeleton in use we are not forced to believe that two
compositors were at work. Thus if we find evidence elsewhere of
only one compositor at work,
we need not consider that it would be impossible for one compositor
to set the whole play.</p>


<p>More important, however, than these technical points is the
evidence that can be drawn from within the play itself. The
detailed examination of the variant spellings within the play,
following the method evolved by Mr. Hinman, revealed certain words
where the compositor who set <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> had a very marked
preference for certain spellings. To confirm these preferences, a
similar spelling test was undertaken for <hi rend="italic">Antony and
Cleopatra,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Othello,</hi> plays definitely set by
compositor B. For comparison with these spellings, an examination
of compositor A's portions of <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>
disclosed truly preferential spellings of both compositors. This
comparison not only revealed that <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> was set by one
compositor but furnished

<p>The very close correspondence between compositor B's
preferential spellings and those found in <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> indicate
clearly that the tentative assumption made at the first in the
investigation was correct: all of <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> was set by compositor
B. Where the simpler test of Mr. Willoughby failed to reveal the
compositor of a third of the play, the more detailed examination of
all the significant variants established the compositor of all the
play.</p>

<pb n="005.079"/>

<p>But there remains one further point that may be suggested as
accounting for certain minor divergences in compositor B's
preferential spellings in <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>. In the first place, we must
not expect a compositor to spell certain words in an invariable
way. Mr. Willoughby has already pointed out the possibility of a
compositor's varying the spelling of words, and Mr. Hinman has
enlarged upon that possibility: occasional copy-spellings will come
through; justifying of lines will affect preferential spellings;
the diminishing of a certain sort usually employed in preferential
spellings may lead him to varying his spellings; and insistence,
either by editor or author, upon copy-spellings for rhyme words, or
even a compositor's own idiosyncrasies, may cause variants.
Finally, Mr. Hinman concludes,

<q>. . . there are doubtless hosts of little part-psychological,
part-muscular influences too subtle for analysis which may, on
occasion, cause variations: such, perhaps, as the atmosphere
created in the compositor's own mind by his text, so that he sets
<hi rend="italic">bin</hi> in a low-comedy speech by a yokel, but
<hi rend="italic">beene</hi> a
few pages later in a very pompous speech by the king&mdash;though the
copy has the modern <hi rend="italic">been</hi> in both places (pp. 79-80, note
1).</q>

Taking these "part-psychological, part-muscular influences" in
connection with Mr. Hinman's declaration that "a book is always
likely to contain an occasional copy-spelling," we may account for
the slight divergence from preferential spellings that we find in
<hi rend="italic">Lear</hi>.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the factors that cause variation from
preferential spellings should be emphasized here. In the plays
where Mr. Willoughby's test works best, the compositor is setting
from manuscript. Here in <hi rend="italic">Lear,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">Midsummer
Night's
Dream, Merchant of Venice,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi>
where
Mr. Willoughby conjectured unknown compositors, the play was being
set from printed copy. It is probable that the printed copy has
much more effect upon a compositor's spelling than has been
previously recognized. It may be that if a compositor meets a word
in manuscript he will set that word in his own spelling far more
often than if he meets that word in print. Although this is a
difficult point to prove,
we must remain aware that part-muscular influences, coupled with a
respect for the printed word, may be at work on the compositor when
he is setting type from a printed page which is acting as copy. We
may have, therefore, a situation where a compositor meeting "do" in
a manuscript will impose upon it his usual spelling; but if he
meets "do" in a printed text, he may accept readily the spelling
that is there, either <hi rend="italic">do or doe or doo.</hi> This influence of
the printed word can be demonstrated in other ways, such as the use
of italics, the following of unusual spellings, the printing of
erroneously abbreviated speech-headings and the like, which have
long been noticed by bibliographers. Thus where we have a play
being reprinted from a previously

<pb n="005.080"/>

printed copy, we need to apply more comprehensive tests than the
five-word test of Mr. Willoughby and to examine the play using
another criterion for compositor-determination.<ref target="f005.06.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref></p>


<p>The principle that one must follow here in determining the
compositor of a play set from printed copy is this: he must examine
the spellings of the copy as well as those of the reprint, noting
what <hi rend="italic">changes</hi> have been made in the spellings. If a
<hi rend="italic">doe</hi> spelling is retained, it does nothing towards indicating
the compositor; if, however, it is changed to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> without
some other factor such as line-justification intervening, we may
note that as a very definite indication of the compositor. This
principle proved successful in the compositor determination of
<hi rend="italic">Lear.</hi><ref target="f005.06.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></p>


<p>But whatever the value of this principle, it is apparent, I
believe, that <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> was set by one compositor, B, of the
Folio. And this information is no academic exercise in a
theoretical desert. With the identification of the compositor
secure, we can undertake an examination of compositor B's work
elsewhere in the Folio where he was setting type from printed copy;
then, and only then, can we produce demonstrable evidence about his
characteristic handling of copy. And that, a longer story, must be
reserved for the present; but in spite of its length, it is an
important one for those who wish a text of <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> that is as
close as possible to Shakespeare's "fair copy." For the compositor
of the Folio text of <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> did make certain characteristic
changes in his text; and whatever the authority of the "Pied Bull"
Quarto, it has more authority than the changes made by a Jacobean
workman, compositor B of the Folio.</p>

Milton's
Epitaph on Shakespeare</name>
<lb/><hi rend="italic">by</hi><lb/>
<name type="author">William B. Todd</name>
</head>

<div2 type="section" n="1"><head/>
<p>From the time it was recognized as a distinct variant, now
almost a century ago, the "Coppies" issue of Shakespeare's Second
Folio has been gradually received and accepted as the predecessor
of a certain sequence of titles in several states and settings, and
thus the first to represent, on the leaf conjugate to the title,
the earliest issue of Milton's first-printed English poem. Such, in
brief, is the account of an issue considered only as a freak in the
days of Lowndes and Bohn, then regarded as "one of the earliest
impressions" by Lenox, Winsor, Cole, and Pollard, and finally
accorded preeminence over all in the exhaustive study published by
Robert Metcalf Smith.<ref target="f005.07.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref></p>


<p>When confronted by this imposing array of "firsts," in point of
issue for book and poem, in two great names now conjoined in a
single text, and in the roster of scholars who have labored to
establish and justify the present hypothesis, it ill becomes an
upstart to trample upon the work of generations and subvert the
tradition that work has produced. And yet, if the facts of printing
invalidate critical theories, it is the bibliographer's unbecoming
duty to present them. Certainly the facts allow us to accept the
premise common to all discussions of the problem: We are indeed
concerned with several issues of the Second Folio, each conveying
a different setting of Milton's Epitaph on Shakespeare. Beyond
this, however, I must demur and eventually dismiss all contentions
as irrelevant.<ref target="f005.07.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>
</div2>

<pb n="005.082"/>

<div2 type="section" n="2"><head type="sub">I. The Order of Issues</head>

<p>The issues of this Folio are distinguished by three settings of
the letterpress for A2.5 of the initial quire, a sheet containing
on the recto (outer forme) of one leaf the title to the work, and
on the recto (inner forme) of the other several commemorative
verses on the author. Two of the three settings for the title also
exist in a number of states, usually identified by alterations in
the impressions for Robert Allot, one of the principal
shareholders, or by the special imprints provided for his
collaborators. Between the variants for both leaves there is an
obvious correlation best described, in Smith's terminology, as:
Allot 1 associated with Effigies A; Allot 2-3 with Effigies B; and
Allot 4-5, Aspley, Hawkins, Meighen, and Smethwick, all with
Effigies C.</p>

<p>To substantiate this sequence, insofar as it applies to the
Allot variants, Professor Smith believed that we may "assume, with
a high degree of probability, that the order of the title-pages
follows the order of improvement, since it is readily demonstrable
that the compositor or compositors tried to correct in every
succeeding title-page mistakes made in the preceding one."<ref target="f005.07.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> The probability, it seems to me,
is at
times very remote. Where the corrections occur within the setting,
as in Allot 2-3 and Allot 4-5, the intent and direction of
improvement is apparent. But where the corrections require a
completely new setting, as in the transition from Allot 1 to 2 and
from 3 to 4, the necessity of such extraordinary measures for such
trifling results remains obscure&mdash;at least under the present
assumption.</p>


<p>Even more remarkable is the fact that whenever the compositor of
the title discards his forme the compositor of the Effigies page
also discards his at <hi rend="italic">precisely</hi> the same time. This means
that the two men, working together and in the same incomprehensible
fashion, twice distribute the entire letterpress for the sheet,
twice prepare others, and in the process aimlessly fritter away the
hours (days, I should say) shuffling and reshuffling countless
reglets, wedges, quoins, quads and spaces, as well as some 4960
sorts<ref target="f005.07.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref>&mdash;all this, we note, to
arrange a few "improvements"

<pb n="005.083"/>

which any dolt could have managed in five to ten minutes with
several pieces of type. In view of this circumstance, one
unparalleled in the annals of bibliography, the inclination is to
cast about for another hypothesis wherein these seeming absurdities
are reasonably explained.</p>


<p>For the moment, though, let us consider what else may be said
for our diligent compositors and their heroic struggle to improve
the text. In the sentence following the one cited, Smith assured us
that "this assumption acquires a certainty with the demonstration
of typographical links between successive title-pages."<ref target="f005.07.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> Between the first two settings there
is
assuredly, not only a typographical connection in the employment of
the same fonts of type, but also, as Smith elsewhere observes, a
further correlation in the use of the same variety of paper.
Obviously, then, these two were prepared within a relatively short
period. Between the second and the third, on the other hand, no
similarity exists. In Smith's words, the type is "not identical,"
"in a different font," and the paper for the later setting is drawn
"from another stock."<ref target="f005.07.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> Thus by his
own admission the "links" disappear,
the demonstration fails, and the expected certainty resolves into
an increasing distrust of the entire argument. If the premise is
unsustained all that is based upon it is in imminent danger of
collapse.</p>



<p>At this impasse let us now turn to another theory immediately
verified by evidence within the book and thereafter supported by
every indication of relevance to this inquiry. Contrary to the
received opinion, this would suppose that the Title-Effigies sheet
was, for various reasons, deliberately underprinted and then, as
the occasion required, twice reset at some later time to dispose of
remainders. The sheet identifying each of the subsequent issues
might therefore, in this view, be properly regarded as a "reprint,"
and like all reprints would presumably convey readings inferior to
those in its copytext. Possibly, then, the order is the reverse of
that alleged, and the sequence one of degradation rather than
improvement.</p>

<p>Some credence is given this presumption by the questions the
publishers themselves might have raised. Why run a complete issue
of the most expensive sheet<ref target="f005.07.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> in a
very costly book? Since this was not an original edition, why
imprint their names to something which might still be on the
shelves some twenty years after they were gone and forgotten? Why
not print just enough for their immediate needs and let events
determine

<pb n="005.084"/>

whether they, or their successors, should print again?<ref target="f005.07.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> Should these or other
considerations
have convinced them&mdash;and now convince us&mdash;of the
advisability of
limiting the original issue, the publishers of the Second Folio may
be credited with greater foresight than those of the Third and
Fourth; for while they eventually chose not to alter the original
make-up in successive printings, their precaution obviated any
necessity for cancellation, a necessity later enforced upon their
less perceptive successors.<ref target="f005.07.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></p>




<p>For the thesis, as now proposed, several pieces of evidence may
be advanced, all tending to the same conclusion. In his examination
of the correlations among the three settings Professor Smith
neglected to observe that the two which are actually connected have
no relation to the rest of the book, whereas the third, though
independent of the others, is very closely affiliated both in the
ornamental letters and in the paper used for this setting. The
ornaments in all issues, consisting of the letters "S" and "W" on
the Effigies page,<ref target="f005.07.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> are of three
kinds, each cut in a manner that suggests their origin in three
separate foundries.

</table>

Among these only group 1 is represented in the Folio.<ref target="f005.07.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref></p>



<p>As with the ornaments, so with the paper: that used for the
settings commonly described as the first and second (Heawood 594)
does not appear elsewhere in this book or in any other book of this
date, but that used for the setting usually considered to be the
third (H 1420 or 1731) repeatedly occurs in the last nineteen
quires of the Folio.<ref target="f005.07.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> Now since the

<pb n="005.085"/>

preliminary sheet would normally be printed in conjunction with
other work toward the end of the book, the identity in paper
confirms the identity in ornaments and establishes a strong
presumption for an order in which the "third" setting is
distinguished as the first. Thus, in the absence of the slightest
evidence to the contrary, the Allot 4-5&mdash;Effigies C sheet must be
regarded as the original issue, carefully prepared from manuscript,
and the others as mere reprints, hastily composed, badly centered
and spaced, and obviously degraded in text.</p>


<p>The exact order of the reprints may now be determined by the
textual relationship among the title-pages.

From Table I<ref target="f005.07.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> it will be observed
that, on this score alone, Allot 1 cannot be designated as the
first in a sequence of issues gradually "improving" in the
direction of Allot 5, for it is intermediate between 5 and 2,
having seven variants in common with the one and three in common
with the other. Hence for this reason, others previously adduced,
and others yet to be divulged, I suggest that we reject the
outmoded "Allot 1&mdash;5" classification and adopt one corresponding
to the evident order of issues. Including only

<pb n="005.086"/>

what I believe to be the first of the states in the initial setting
(all of which will be dealt with in the next section) the three
issues, with their variants, are identified as follows:

The inspection of a photostat from copy tentatively identified as
a variant of the state now described as IIIb<ref target="f005.07.16" n="16"><hi rend="super">16</hi></ref> leads me to believe that this is the
artful work of a restorer.</p>





<p>With the three issues properly identified, and properly arranged
in sequence, we should now endeavor to fix the approximate time and
circumstance of publication. For the later settings, as for certain
Jaggard-Pavier quartos, there is some indication that the imprint
is misleading in all of its particulars. Unquestionably, as the
paper attests, issue I was printed and sold in the manner announced
on the title page. But II and III, though distributed with a
similar announcement, were produced on such unusual paper that an
intensive search through the crown folios in several libraries<ref target="f005.07.17" n="17"><hi rend="super">17</hi></ref> has disclosed its presence not
before
1637 and then only in three books: certain leaves of the
preliminary quire of Camden's <hi rend="italic">Britain</hi> (1637), printed by
Felix Kyngston and others; throughout in Paris's <hi rend="italic">Historia
maior</hi> (1640), by Richard Hodgkinson;
and occasionally as a single sheet in Parkinson's <hi rend="italic">Theatrum
Botanicum</hi> (1640),<ref target="f005.07.18" n="18"><hi rend="super">18</hi></ref>
ostensibly
by Thomas Cotes, the printer

<pb n="005.087"/>

of the Second Folio. Moreover, as the investigation has also
revealed, the distinctive mark for this paper seems to exist only
in the two states required for a single pair of moulds;<ref target="f005.07.19" n="19"><hi rend="super">19</hi></ref> and as neither of these states
shows
any sign of deterioration the inference follows that the period of
manufacture approximates the dates of the books in which the paper
was found. It is quite probable, therefore, that the later issues
of the Shakespeare Folio were sold, not by Robert Allot in 1632,
but by his successors sometime between 1636 and 1641.</p>





<p>Within that period occur four significant events, any one of
which might have provided a suitable occasion for reissue: (1) an
inventory of Allot's effects subsequent to his death in 1635; (2)
a transfer of the stock by his widow Mary to Legatt and Crooke on
the first of July, 1637; (3) the gradual accumulation of unsold
copies returned to the new proprietors upon the demise of Allot's
original collaborators, all of whom had died between 1636 and
1641;<ref target="f005.07.20" n="20"><hi rend="super">20</hi></ref> and (4) still another
inventory, in 1641, upon the death of Thomas Cotes, the printer of
the original issue and part owner of the stock. Of these the most
plausible circumstance is the last. Under any other condition we
would expect to find issues with Legatt's imprint and Crooke's name
as publisher. But since these do not appear, and since, in any
event, neither Legatt nor Crooke was in possession of the paper,
engraving,
or ornaments used for these issues,<ref target="f005.07.21" n="21"><hi rend="super">21</hi></ref> their origin may be traced

<pb n="005.088"/>

to certain untitled lots originally reserved for Cotes and now
brought forth upon their discovery in 1641. At this time, as
stipulated by the will, Thomas's younger brother Richard assumed
possession of the stock, the printing shop, and all implements
therein.<ref target="f005.07.22" n="22"><hi rend="super">22</hi></ref></p>




<p>That Richard should have failed to enter his name on the titles
is not surprising, for of all the established printers of the day
his record is distinguished by a penchant for anonymity. So far as
I can discover, within the STC period, his name appears alone as
printer on only two books, both undated.<ref target="f005.07.23" n="23"><hi rend="super">23</hi></ref> Only once is he associated with a
printer other than Thomas, and on the occasions when he is entered
with his brother he usually withdraws his name from subsequent
editions.<ref target="f005.07.24" n="24"><hi rend="super">24</hi></ref> Books in which he had a
considerable interest, such as the nine owned jointly with his
brother<ref target="f005.07.25" n="25"><hi rend="super">25</hi></ref> or the nine owned
exclusively by himself,<ref target="f005.07.26" n="26"><hi rend="super">26</hi></ref> appear
invariably with the name of Thomas alone, never his own. Even for
the Second Folio, an enterprise in which his investment was twice
that of his brother's,<ref target="f005.07.27" n="27"><hi rend="super">27</hi></ref> comparable
to Allot's,
and equivalent to the total advanced by the minor shareholders, the
colophon and imprints register the names of all but the
self-effacing Richard Cotes. Apparently, if this practice has any
significance, the greater his responsibility and&mdash;we may
presume&mdash;the greater his share of the presswork, the less his
inclination to acknowledge it. Much of what is nominally under the
imprint of Thomas may, then, be justly attributed to his silent
partner.</p>
<p>Of all the books to which I have alluded, only one bears any
particular relationship to the later issues of the Folio, and in
every respect the correlation is complete, exact, and irrefutable.
This, we should now recall, is the <hi rend="italic">Theatrum Botanicum</hi>
(19302), a volume which contains in some copies the rare and
elusive watermark also found in these issues. Here then is the
crucial exhibit: a book published within a year of the inventory of
Thomas's effects, with paper and ornaments like those in the sheet
applied

 <pb entity="sb05883" n="Illustration 3"/>

<pb n="005.089"/>

to the remainders presumably discovered in that appraisal, and with
an imprint assigning the presswork to one man when it was actually
the property and almost certainly the work of another. Faced with
this series of coincidences, I find it impossible to avoid the
conclusion that the title-pages for these issues, now reading
"Printed by <hi rend="italic">Tho. Cotes,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Robert Allot</hi> . . .
1632",<ref target="f005.07.28" n="28"><hi rend="super">28</hi></ref> should be understood as
"Printed by and for <hi rend="italic">Richard Cotes</hi> . . . 1641 <hi rend="italic">or
later."</hi></p>
<p>Thus, at last, the esteemed "first" and "second" issues&mdash;the
erstwhile "Allots 1&mdash;3," so enshrined by the earlier
bibliographers and so avidly pursued by collectors everywhere&mdash;are
now revealed to be, in all the light that can be shed upon them,
nothing more than sweepings from the warehouse floor. Whether these
scraps are entitled to remain within the pale of the <hi rend="italic">Short-Title
Catalogue</hi> is not for me to decide. I am content to present here
the circumstantial evidence and, later, a proper motive for
Richard's action in reissuing the book in the manner
described.<ref target="f005.07.29" n="29"><hi rend="super">29</hi></ref></p>

just presented, the reader will readily agree that for the issue
now identified as the first the present alphabetical arrangement of
the imprints may not necessarily correspond to their chronological
order through the press. That is determined, we suspect, by the
convenience of the compositor. Normally, as his interest, like that
of us all, is in doing as much as possible with the least amount of
effort, he may be expected to plan his work so that it requires a
minimum of labor to effect the alterations he must perform. Both
within and between the several states of the title-page we should
therefore look, not for drastic changes back and forth in aimless
manner, but for the slight and deliberate adjustments which link
all variants in a certain progression.</p>

<p>As illustrated in the accompanying plate, the letterpress for
the title is disposed in three groups: (1) the <hi rend="italic">heading,</hi>
consisting of the seven lines of type above the area later to be
filled by the portrait; and, below this area,

<pb n="005.090"/>

(2) the <hi rend="italic">place,</hi> comprising the single word
<hi rend="italic">LONDON,</hi> and
(3) the <hi rend="italic">imprint</hi> consisting of the two lines which relate to
printer, publisher, address, and date. Group (1), of the same type
throughout the impression, is, with one exception, fixed in its
position; (2) is also, generally, of the same type, but
occasionally moved as a consequence of the adjustments immediately
below it; (3) is of two distinct settings of type, the position of
which differs from state to state and, in one instance, within a
state. Much of the variation in (3) is, of course, explained by the
constant revision required to supply each of the collaborators in
this edition with a distinctive imprint. Of the two settings
employed for this purpose one comprises the imprint states Allot
<hi rend="italic">a,</hi> Allot <hi rend="italic">b</hi> (formerly designated as Allot 5 and
4,
respectively), Aspley <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and Meighen <hi rend="italic">g;</hi> the
other,
Smethwick <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> Hawkins <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and Hawkins
<hi rend="italic">f</hi>.<ref target="f005.07.30" n="30"><hi rend="super">30</hi></ref></p>


<p>It will now be perceived that in any determination of the order
we must contend with two kinds of alterations, hereafter
arbitrarily distinguished as <hi rend="italic">states</hi> and <hi rend="italic">variants</hi>.
The
term <hi rend="italic">state</hi> is used to denote a deliberate alteration in
type, whether performed, supposedly, on press (<hi rend="italic">b, f</hi>) or off
press (<hi rend="italic">c&mdash;e, g</hi>); the term <hi rend="italic">variant</hi> to
denote shifts
within states in the position of the type, whether these appear as
intentional adjustments on press (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>2-3) or as accidental
results off press (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>2). The minimum deviation, laterally or
vertically, which distinguishes a press <hi rend="italic">variant</hi> has been
fixed at two millimeters. Any discrepancy less than this is
dismissed as a distortion caused by shrinkage in the paper.<ref target="f005.07.31" n="31"><hi rend="super">31</hi></ref></p>


<p>Since two settings of the imprint are employed within the same
impression it is obvious that the relation between them can be
decided only by reference to type elsewhere in the forme which both
have in common. This other type is unchanged except for a few
copies of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and all copies of <hi rend="italic">g</hi>. In the
exemplars of
what I believe to be the first variant, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> state, the
interval between the heading and the place<ref target="f005.07.32" n="32"><hi rend="super">32</hi></ref> measures 206 mm., an interval

<pb n="005.091"/>

soon reduced and thereafter maintained at 204 mm. in all succeeding
variants and states. Quite possibly this was a deliberate
adjustment to bring the several groups of type in closer proximity
to the portrait. In <hi rend="italic">g</hi> we observe several alterations&mdash;or,

possibly, substitutions&mdash;in the two <hi rend="italic">N</hi>s of the word
<hi rend="italic">LONDON</hi>. For the earlier states the lower right kern of the
first <hi rend="italic">N</hi> is bent slightly upward and the upper left kern of
the second curled sharply downward. For this, however, the one kern
is straight and the other only slightly curled. Another difference
is evident immediately behind the descending stem of the second
<hi rend="italic">N</hi> where, in all but the <hi rend="italic">g</hi> state, there appears
a
small speck. From these trivial discrepancies we may tentatively
conclude that <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the first state, <hi rend="italic">g</hi> the last, and
that all other states <hi rend="italic">including</hi> those represented by the
other setting are interposed between them.
Before considering the exact position of this other setting within
the sequence, it will be necessary to prove the order within each
setting.</p>


<p>Further scrutiny of copies in the earliest state of the first
setting&mdash;and of the entire sequence&mdash;discloses certain other
refinements, all intended, I believe, to improve the appearance of
the page. Shortly after the imprint was adjusted to 204 mm. it was
noticed that SHAKESPEARES, the longest and most prominent word in
the heading, though extending beyond the portrait (191x160 mm.),
was several millimeters short of the margin established by the
plate mark (200x169 mm.).<ref target="f005.07.33" n="33"><hi rend="super">33</hi></ref> To
remedy this the forme was again unlocked and the word spaced out
from 166 to 169 millimeters. The combination of adjustments thus
produces three distinct variants within the state:<ref target="f005.07.34" n="34"><hi rend="super">34</hi></ref>

<table>
<head type="sub">Heading Interval</head>

<row>
<cell>1. 166 mm.</cell>
<cell>206 mm.</cell>
</row>

<row>
<cell>2. 166 mm.</cell>
<cell>204 mm.</cell>
</row>

<row>
<cell>3. 169 mm.</cell>
<cell>204 mm.</cell>
</row>
</table>

Like the earlier gradation, the later one, once arranged, persists
in all remaining states.</p>



<p>Preceding these slight and delicate adjustments is another which
is grossly botched. Instead of replacing the foul case "f" in
"&longs;old" either at the striking of proofs, or when the imprint was
moved, or later, in state <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> the pressman attempted to gouge
out the offending projection, but succeeded

<pb n="005.092"/>

only in bending it up and into the shoulder of the piece, where it
gradually collected a "pick" and continued to clog the face of the
type<ref target="f005.07.35" n="35"><hi rend="super">35</hi></ref> until it was eventually
removed at the end of work on the second state.</p>


<p>While the later state <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is strangely defective in this
one respect, it does represent a further effort to enhance the
appearance of the impression, notably in the substitution of
ordinary type for the heavy-faced word "Printed". This too, we
observe, is a correction retained in the later states of the
imprint. Another alteration, the deletion of "at his &longs;hop", was
arranged for a reason which will become evident at a later point in
our discussion. Suffice it to say now that the order devised by
Smith as <hi rend="italic">b-a</hi> (Allot 4-5) disrupts the progression of his own
sequence (where Allot 4, with the phrase omitted, intervenes
between 3 and 5), disregards the actual relation between <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
and the states which succeed it (<hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> both
without the phrase), and ignores the indifferent practice observed
in other books printed for Allot at this time.
In these the imprint may be without address,<ref target="f005.07.36" n="36"><hi rend="super">36</hi></ref> with the simple reference "at the
Blacke Beare,"<ref target="f005.07.37" n="37"><hi rend="super">37</hi></ref> with the
preliminary notation (as in <hi rend="italic">b</hi>) "at the &longs;igne of the Blacke
Beare,"<ref target="f005.07.38" n="38"><hi rend="super">38</hi></ref> or with the full address
(as in <hi rend="italic">a</hi>) "at his &longs;hop at the &longs;igne of the Blacke
Beare."<ref target="f005.07.39" n="39"><hi rend="super">39</hi></ref> If the publisher's address
could be so variously rendered in these imprints, and his name so
variously spelled as Allott, Allot, or Allet, it would appear that
such decisions were not at his discretion but entirely at the
convenience of the printer. And this convenience, as we shall have
occasion to remark, was very directly involved in the alteration.
Hence, I repeat, the order is probably in the direction of
<hi rend="italic">a-b,</hi> and the inclusion of the phrase in the later issues
II-III is to be simply explained by the use of a copytext in its
earlier state.</p>
<p>The third imprint in this setting is obviously <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> the
Aspley state. Though this retains most of the type used for
<hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> (including the terminal phrases "at the
&longs;igne" and "in Pauls Church-yard") the several revisions within
the lines doubtless necessitated its preparation off press. Again
as in <hi rend="italic">b</hi> (and occasionally in <hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the type is
clogged
in several places and the "n" of "in" is above the line. Among the
idiosyncrasies not evident in <hi rend="italic">b</hi> but later transmitted to
<hi rend="italic">g</hi> are the substitution of "&longs;" for the previously mangled
"f" in "&longs;old", a depression in the "e" and "t" of "be" and

<pb n="005.093"/>

"at", and a battered "e" in "the". Peculiar to <hi rend="italic">d</hi> alone,
apparently, is the fact that in later copies of the impression in
this state the title is a cancel.<ref target="f005.07.40" n="40"><hi rend="super">40</hi></ref>
What this signifies, I suspect, is an overrun on the lot of paper
which had been reserved for all states through <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and the
consequent necessity for the excision of the titles in excess of
order and the impression of certain Aspley imprints by half-sheet
imposition.</p>


<p>In Meighen <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> the final imprint in this
setting&mdash;and in
the sequence&mdash;the modifications are more extensive. Besides the
usual substitution in the name, these include the two <hi rend="italic">N</hi>s
previously mentioned, on the next line, the use of "middle" for
"&longs;igne", the word employed in all preceding variants, and in the
last line an entirely new reading. Other than these the Meighen
state has only one distinction, a broken comma after <hi rend="italic">Cotes,</hi>
doubtless caused by the constant shifting of the type below it in
the preparation of the earlier states.</p>

<p>For Smethwick and Hawkins, the several states comprising the
second setting of the imprint, the compositor (or the overseer)
again grouped together addresses which would necessitate only
slight revision between impressions. As the other imprints had,
generally, certain readings in common, so these share in the
reading "at his &longs;hop". At some time during the printing of the
earlier, Smethwick state the press was stopped, the type removed
from the forme, and then returned to a position in which both
<hi rend="italic">LONDON</hi> and the imprint were three millimeters to the left
(or <hi rend="italic">right</hi> on the printed page) of the space they had
formerly occupied. Very probably this interruption was of some
duration&mdash;overnight, at least&mdash;for while the first run was on
a
heap of paper turned in one direction, the second is on a heap
turned in the other. Both type and paper, then, confirm the
existence of two variants:

<table>
<row>
<cell></cell>
<cell>Position of <hi rend="italic">LONDON</hi> (as printed)</cell>
<cell>Watermark<ref target="f005.07.41" n="41"><hi rend="super">41</hi></ref></cell>
</row>

<row>
<cell><hi rend="italic">c</hi>1</cell>
<cell>63 mm. to right of margin</cell>

</row>

<row>
<cell>2</cell>
<cell>66 mm. to right of margin</cell>
<cell>In title leaf [A2]</cell>
</row>
</table>

<pb n="005.094"/>

The "margin" to which I refer is a hypothetical line abutting the
left edge of the word SHAKESPEARES and extending perpendicularly
from that word.</p>


<p>Next and last is the Hawkins imprint, with <hi rend="italic">LONDON</hi>
disposed as in <hi rend="italic">c</hi>2, but with the beginning of the final line
reading first (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) "Chancery Lane", and then, as usual in
Hawkins' address<ref target="f005.07.42" n="42"><hi rend="super">42</hi></ref> (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>),
"in
Chancery Lane". For the other instance of a correction at press
(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the deletion of three words required a readjustment of
the imprint. For this insignificant addition, however, the
compositor was content to leave the line slightly off-center.</p>


<p>At this juncture I must confess that while I have, to the best
of my ability, defined and ordered all the points that appear on
the title-page of the first issue, I have established a sequence
which pertains only to the order of composition within each
setting, and not to the order of variants through the press. Were
the imprint of a single setting the order for both would be, of
course, the same. But since there are two, a question arises
concerning the necessity for the second. If eleven words are, as we
see, applicable for all states, why does the compositor go to the
trouble of preparing another setting?</p>

<p>The only plausible explanation is that the provision of this
other setting enables two men to work efficiently and
simultaneously at their separate tasks. While the compositor is
revising and adjusting the imprint in one slug the pressman can
work off copies on the other. Thereafter, as each finishes his
assignment, the slugs may be transposed, and both can then continue
to revise and print as before. The obvious advantage of the system
must have immediately recommended it to the overseer, who doubtless
classified the imprints in the two groups just described, ordered
a separate setting for each, and arranged a schedule for their
regular alternation through the press.</p>

<p>To reconstruct this schedule we may now recall that if <hi rend="italic">a</hi>

and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> have certain distinctions not common to the other
states, then these two are at the extremes and the others
alternately disposed between them.

 <!-- <figure entity="sb05941"></figure> -->

As ordered, this sequence is justified not only by the
peculiarities in the terminal states, or by the progression within
each setting, but also by certain links between the settings. In
some copies of <hi rend="italic">b</hi><ref target="f005.07.43" n="43"><hi rend="super">43</hi></ref> and
all
copies of <hi rend="italic">c</hi>1, for example, <hi rend="italic">LONDON</hi> is
displaced three
millimeters to the right (or <hi rend="italic">left</hi>

<pb n="005.095"/>

on the printed sheet) of the position retained in the other states.
Again, in some copies of <hi rend="italic">c</hi>2 and all copies of <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
the
exemplars share an odd lot of paper (H1420)<ref target="f005.07.44" n="44"><hi rend="super">44</hi></ref> not evident elsewhere. With
<hi rend="italic">c</hi>
thus established as intermediate between <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">d</hi> the
inference follows that <hi rend="italic">e-f</hi> is similarly intermediate between
<hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> and that all states were therefore
imposed
in the order now assigned.<ref target="f005.07.00" n="44a"><hi rend="super">44a</hi></ref></p>

<p>Through various discoveries and acquisitions in the years since
Smith's census the record of extant Second Folios in perfect or

extended to include some 196 copies, or approximately one-fifth of
the number estimated in the original edition. The existing copies
constitute a rather large percentage, large enough, I believe, to
provide a reliable index of the proportions among the states at the
time of publication. I therefore offer, in Table II, several

<p>The remarkable correlation between these two sets of figures,
each derived from a different premise, undoubtedly brings us very
close to what must have been the actual distribution. Only in
Hawkins is there an appreciable discrepancy, and this, I believe,
can be compromised by reference to the property held by the minor
shareholders. Any evaluation, whether of plays or of real estate,
involves a consideration not directly related to the size of the
piece. Hawkins had only one play, true, but this was
<hi rend="italic">Othello,</hi> a possession certainly equivalent in value to both
of the plays owned by Aspley (<hi rend="italic">Much Ado</hi> and <hi rend="italic">1 Henry

IV</hi>) and twice the value of the single play owned by Meighen
(<hi rend="italic">Merry Wives</hi>). Between these two figures, then, the one
which measures only the size of the property should very probably
be ignored in deference to the one which evidently signifies its
importance.</p>


<p>With this much rationalized (at least to my own satisfaction) we
may confidently reconcile the slight disparity in the estimates for
all states by adjusting the figures to the practical limits
determined by the quires of paper, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to the nearest
multiple of 24.

This tabulation serves to enforce earlier considerations and leads
to others still unresolved. For one, it will be observed that the
order of imposition in the original issue, as previously
determined, corresponds both to the extent of the copyright and
hence to the size of the allotment for each of the proprietors.
First off the press were the 27 quires of title-sheets for Allot
and Cotes, then 4 for Smethwick, 2 each for Aspley and Hawkins, and
finally a single quire for Meighen. For another, it should be noted
that the total for all issues is within one quire of what the
stationer calls a "perfect bundle,"<ref target="f005.07.46" n="46"><hi rend="super">46</hi></ref> the most convenient set-out for an
edition of this size. Both in whole and in part the figures
therefore conform to the general estimate of the extent of the
edition and of its various states.</p>


<p>The matters unresolved and deliberately evaded until now relate
to the occasion for the alteration in the Cotes-Allot imprint
<hi rend="italic">a-b</hi> and the reason

<pb n="005.097"/>

for the excessive delay in the production of the later issues
II-III. Since neither of the imprints in the first issue can be
regarded as a correction of the other, we may surmise that the two
were used so that the warehouseman could readily distinguish the
lots to be sent forward to Allot from those to be retained by
Cotes. In the preparation of the edition both of these partners,
like Jaggard and Blount before them, were acting in behalf of
certain unnamed associates as well as for themselves. The 28
"copies" assigned to both by imprint or, rather, the stock
represented by these copies, was therefore not entirely theirs by
right but by purchase from owners who had relinquished any interest
in the sale of their property. Table III identifies the owners of
these copies, the proportionate share of their investment, and, for
comparative purposes, certain other figures from our earlier
estimate.

Since Allot was entitled only to 192 copies, the equivalent of
those estimated in state <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> it would seem that this imprint,
describing the place of sale as "at his &longs;hop", is the one that
identifies his consignment. Apparently, then, the lots with the
abbreviated imprint <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> those not sold 'at Allot's shop',
were reserved for the Cotes brothers and their unnamed associates.
Included in these, we note, are the 336 copies belonging to them by
right or purchase and, as our speculations lead us to suppose, 120
others over

<pb n="005.098"/>

and above their pro-rata share. Possibly, if there was any such
surplus, some or all of it may have been baled up at the Cotes
warehouse and dispatched to booksellers outside London for sale in
the provinces.<ref target="f005.07.48" n="48"><hi rend="super">48</hi></ref></p>


<p>Besides these, however, there was still another lot which they
could neither publicly claim nor privately appropriate for
themselves&mdash;the 144 copies subject to seizure by the unknown
owners of the six derelict plays. This group was discreetly laid
aside, without titles, until such time as the claimants might
identify themselves and secure their proper share with the imprint
they might desire. For nine years or more the brothers Cotes
awaited the heirs of the registered owners. Finally, after the
inventory of 1641, Richard Cotes assumed the rights which others
had allowed to lapse, and provided the remainders with new imprints
copied from a sheet of the original issue.<ref target="f005.07.49" n="49"><hi rend="super">49</hi></ref> These then appeared at the
bookstalls
with the titles identified as II and III.</p>


<p>Richard's motive in disguising these two issues was, we may
believe, very prudent, if not entirely commendable. Quite apart
from his customary habit of operating under his brother's name,
there was now another and more compelling reason, that of avoiding
a confiscation of all remainders under the Ordinance of 1641. This
specifically prohibited the printing, and hence the sale, of any
book without the express consent of the owners.<ref target="f005.07.50" n="50"><hi rend="super">50</hi></ref> But who were the owners of these
six
plays? Whoever they were, Cotes must have reasoned, their failure
to contest the issue of 1632 amounted to an abandonment of the
property to which they were then entitled. What was apparent to
Cotes, however, as he doubtless realised, might not be apparent in
the eyes of the law. Hence, rather than invite litigation, he
passed these remnants off as the original issue and stood ready to
defend them as part of an edition published long before the
Ordinance was in effect.
Even in his most sanguine moments, though, he could hardly have
anticipated the ruling of Shakespeare's bibliographers that the
special sheets were to be regarded, not only as coeval with the
original issue, but as a series of states preceding it.</p>

<div2 type="section" n="5"><head type="sub">IV. The Effigies Leaf</head>

<p>In this and the following section I approach two considerations,
one of such importance that a single commentary on the subject
attained a circulation, if we may believe the author, of some
20,000,000 copies,<ref target="f005.07.51" n="51"><hi rend="super">51</hi></ref> the other of
equal importance but generally disregarded, both intimately related
to all that has gone before, and both easily dispatched (the reader
will be glad to know) on the warrant of evidence already
adduced.</p>


<p>The first of these pertains to leaf A5, the recto of which bears
two commendatory verses on Shakespeare, one by an unknown author
"Vpon the Effigies of my worthy Friend," the other Milton's
earliest printed English poem, titled as "An Epitaph on the
admirable Dramaticke Poet". Since this page is conjugate to the
title and, like its mate, appears in three different settings, the
established order for the one leaf enforces a similar order for the
other. Without further ado I therefore present, in Table IV, an
account of the textual and typographical variation among the
issues.</p>

<p>From this it will be immediately observed that, while Smith's
representation of "each succeeding version [in the order A-B-C as]
being printed from its immediate predecessor" is manifestly untrue,
the statement is just as inapplicable for the order I-II-III.<ref target="f005.07.52" n="52"><hi rend="super">52</hi></ref> But where Smith was forced to this

contention by his arbitrary arrangement of the title-pages, no such
obligation rests upon us. Though the order for title and Effigies
page is, we reaffirm, identical, the copytext furnished the two
compositors need not always be the same. For II both followed I,
the only available text. For III, on the other hand, two different
copies were passed to the compositors, a sheet of II to the man
setting the title, a sheet of I again to the man setting the
Effigies page. Thus the text descends directly for one page and
collaterally for the other.<ref target="f005.07.53" n="53"><hi rend="super">53</hi></ref></p>



<p>To clarify the relationship I offer four stemma, the first
illustrating my own explanation, the second conforming to Smith's,
the third and fourth exemplifying others which might be advanced.

 <!-- <figure entity="sb051001"></figure> -->

The difficulty with (2), we note, is the absence of any textual
link between Title III and I or between Effigies II and III; with
(3) and (4) the presence of an eclectic text in Effigies I; with
all three the assertion of priority to issues containing paper and
ornaments not found before 1637. Aside from all other
considerations, these impediments alone are insurmountable.</p>

<p>A comparison of Effigies I<hi rend="italic">b</hi><ref target="f005.07.54" n="54"><hi rend="super">54</hi></ref> with the page I have reproduced
now

<pb n="005.101"/>

leads to another discovery,<ref target="f005.07.55" n="55"><hi rend="super">55</hi></ref>
another predicament, and another solution. The facsimile provided
here is of an earlier state <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in which the readings for the
Effigies poem differ slightly from the usual version.

<table>
<row>
<cell>Poem line: 3</cell>

<cell>I<hi rend="italic">b Comicke</hi></cell>
<cell><hi rend="italic">Laugh</hi>,</cell>
<cell><hi rend="italic">ri&longs;e,</hi></cell>
</row>
</table>

In the correction of this page the compositor dutifully moved the
single word after <hi rend="italic">Comicke</hi> to close the gap created by the
excised <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> but neglected to justify the deletion in
<hi rend="italic">Laugh,</hi> perhaps because there were seven words in this line.
Thus between the comma and the following word an en space appears
as witness to his indolence. In <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the peculiar readings are
such that they cannot intervene between others (<hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
between III and I<hi rend="italic">b</hi> in Smith's sequence) but must precede
those in all three issues.<ref target="f005.07.56" n="56"><hi rend="super">56</hi></ref></p>




<p>The predicament arises when we attempt to correlate state
<hi rend="italic">a</hi> of the Effigies page with state <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of the title
for
this issue. The order in one, presumably, should correspond to the
order of the other. Except for a chance conjunction in a made-up
copy,<ref target="f005.07.57" n="57"><hi rend="super">57</hi></ref> however, this page occurs
only with titles in state <hi rend="italic">b</hi>.<ref target="f005.07.58" n="58"><hi rend="super">58</hi></ref> If a single pressman handled both
of
these formes in succession then, despite all the evidence to the
contrary, it would be necessary to reverse the order in one or the
other sequence. But since the Cotes establishment is known to have
had at least two presses,<ref target="f005.07.59" n="59"><hi rend="super">59</hi></ref> we may
adhere to the evidence for both states and argue that the formes
were machined

<pb n="005.102"/>

simultaneously. In this manner each man would receive half of the
sheets for the issue, and as these were worked off the two heaps
would then be turned over and exchanged for the reiteration. The
man printing the titles would therefore begin to perfect his
companion's heap (topped, presumably, by the several sheets with
Effigies in state <hi rend="italic">a</hi>) at a point midway through his own
operation. And that point, as a reference to our schedule will
show,<ref target="f005.07.60" n="60"><hi rend="super">60</hi></ref> occurs just after he has
printed 240 copies of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and while he has 216 yet to go.
Again, it would seem, apparently irreconcilable facts combine to
provide an almost certain conclusion. Indeed, the case is so neat
in this instance that I venture to predict that state <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of
the Effigies leaf will be found conjugate only with state <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
of the title.</p>

<div2 type="section" n="6"><head type="sub">V. Historical Associations: The Charles I Copy</head>

<p>In his account of certain notable copies of the Second Folio
Professor Smith hurries over what was, for him, a relatively
unimportant exemplar of "Allot 5" to humble himself before two
others which he had exalted in the rank of "Allot 1". One of these
was a copy first owned by King George III, then given to Dr. Burney
when the latter withdrew his bid for the Allot 5 in question,
eventually acquired by James Lenox, the American collector, and
finally deposited at the New York Public Library. The other, once
in the library of Thomas Howard, second Earl of Arundel, was
donated to the Royal Society and thence passed through Sotheby's
into oblivion. Both of these "treasures," as Smith calls them, were
at various times offered to the British Museum, and both were as
many times refused. Such persistent evidence of disrespect, though
excused by Smith as occurring before the enlightenment of his
"scientific bibliography,"
was nevertheless deplored on the grounds that the Museum had
thereby denied itself the opportunity of acquiring copies
immeasurably superior to those already in its collection.</p>

<p>A reversal in the order of variants puts an end to this
solicitude as quite ill-advised and allows an entirely different
interpretation. Where the Museum authorities had once been
admonished they are now to be congratulated, for with a sagacity
not given to Shakespeare's professed bibliographers they have been
careful to accept only the states proved to be the first&mdash;an
<hi rend="italic">a,</hi> two <hi rend="italic">b</hi>s, and a <hi rend="italic">c</hi>&mdash;and
to reject on every
occasion the unsightly specimens now demonstrated to be of
subsequent issue. The same discrimination appears in the selections
made for the other principal British libraries: all possess one or
more copies of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> or <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> only a few the

<pb n="005.103"/>

copies identified as of issue II (and these, no doubt, only at the
insistence of misguided benefactors), and none the copies described
as of issue III. Most of II and all of III were cast aside as the
scraps to be gobbled up in the American market.</p>

<p>Another consequence of this reversal is that the "Allot 5" Smith
had slighted many years ago finally assumes its rightful position,
not only as <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the first in the series of states in the
initial issue, but as the only known exemplar with a provenance
extending from the very date of publication to the present time.
This is the book formerly in the possession of King Charles I and
now, after many vicissitudes, in repose with other remarkable
volumes in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle. For the
privilege of offering a summary account of this historic copy and
a record of the inscriptions which it bears I am deeply indebted to
Sir Owen Morshead, Librarian to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth
II.</p>

<p>As a representative of the <hi rend="italic">a</hi> state this book, along with
others similarly distinguished, was separated from the <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
group retained by the printers and dispatched first to Robert
Allot, the chief proprietor. Some time before the day of
publication Allot honored the custom<ref target="f005.07.61" n="61"><hi rend="super">61</hi></ref> of forwarding the selected copy to
the
King's bindery, where it was suitably covered in morocco and gilt
and then presented with a ceremony befitting the occasion. As even
Milton was to admit, the King soon became a confirmed admirer of
Shakespeare, no doubt as the direct result of this presentation,
and in the enforced seclusion of his latter days often resorted to
the book as "the closest companion of these his solitudes."<ref target="f005.07.62" n="62"><hi rend="super">62</hi></ref></p>



<p>Toward the end of his stay at St. James's Palace Charles
entrusted to Sir Thomas Herbert, his retainer, all the possessions
which were then his to bestow&mdash;his books, his cabinet, his cloak,
and his large silver watch<ref target="f005.07.63" n="63"><hi rend="super">63</hi></ref>&mdash;
and
all of these Herbert faithfully preserved until his own death in
1682, when they were dispersed and, with the exception of the
Folio, subsequently lost from view.</p>


<p>An inscription in the copy testifies that it next appeared at
the auction of Dr. Richard Mead's library in 1754, where it was
purchased by Mead's friend and disciple Dr. Anthony Askew. Upon the
death of Askew it was again placed on sale and bought by George
Steevens at what he justly considered to be an "enormous price,"
unequalled at this time,<ref target="f005.07.64" n="64"><hi rend="super">64</hi></ref> but soon
to

<pb n="005.104"/>

reach over thrice that amount when it was eventually purchased in
1800, at the Steevens sale, by a representative of George III. Not
until the bidding had gone to &pound;18-18-0 was it made known that
the King desired the book, at which disclosure the participants,
Charles Burney among them, immediately withdrew their offers. And
so, after its strange and varied adventures, this precious volume
was returned to the Royal Library, there to remain until today.</p>

The death of Professor Smith on January 15 of this year brings to
an end in time, but certainly not in memory, an association
extending from my early days as an undergraduate. As it was he who
first introduced me to the ways of scholarship and thereafter
encouraged my interest in bibliography, I am confident that the
present expression of this interest would have received his hearty
approval.</p></note>

<note id="f005.07.02" place="foot" n="2"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">2</hi></seg><p>With this disavowal I now assume
responsibility for all errors and omissions in the presentation of
my case. In the gathering of the necessary evidence, though, I
gratefully acknowledge the interest of the Modern Language
Association Committee on Research Activities for a grant in aid of
my investigation, the helpful advice of Dr. Allan H. Stevenson on
the variant paper in the Folio&mdash;a matter of crucial importance to
my argument&mdash;and the generous assistance of curators throughout
the country in reporting the peculiarities of the copies in their
custody. To Dr. Giles E. Dawson and Dr. James G. McManaway of the
Folger Library, Mr. H. Richard Archer of the Clark Library, and Mr.
Herman R. Mead of the Huntington Library I am under especial
obligation for the time and energy they have devoted in my

Heawood 1420
is a small fleur-de-lis, always in paper with chainlines
approximately 23 mm. apart, and evidently existing in at least
three different states. According to Dr. Stevenson's method (see

the title-effigies sheet only for some copies of the

those for H594 (fn. 19), or for still another variant of H576
recently described by Allan H. Stevenson (<hi rend="italic">Studies in

and Crooke may have acquired stock in the other ways described and
remaindered this in the condition in which it was found. How else
may we account for the extraordinary number of copies in defective
condition? Altogether these comprise about sixteen per cent of all
copies now extant, and practically every one lacks only the
interior leaves A2 or A2.5. Surely the restorer is not to be held
responsible for such an extensive and such a specific loss as this.
More likely is the supposition that some copies, representing lots
returned by Allot's associates (condition 3), were issued with the
inapplicable titles deleted, and some others, representing lots
discovered in the warehouse (1 and 2) were distributed in their
originally imperfect condition, with both leaves absent. All we
need do now is to differentiate the copies in these several
categories from those whose deficiencies are of later date!</p></note>

I should defend the validity of this precise distinction by noting,
first, that the A2.5 sheet is fine quality crown paper, of uniform

among a few copies in two of the seven states in this issue, third,
that when they do appear they concern only a portion of the
letterpress on the page, and fourth, that the deviation is
generally corroborated by other evidence. For these several reasons

<div2 type="section"><head/>
<p>Of the many collections of eighteenth-century periodical essays
none has been more frequently reprinted than the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>
of Addison and Steele. By 1729, the year of Steele's death, at
least twelve "editions" had been published by Tonson, and
throughout the eighteenth century a steady stream of reprints and
so-called new editions emanated from the presses of London,
Edinburgh, and Dublin. From 1789 to the present six notable
full-dress versions have appeared, with notes and some effort at
editorial supervision. Yet, like the majority of eighteenth-century
classics, there is no text of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> in existence
which enables us to read with even approximate accuracy the essays
in a form approaching the intentions of their authors.</p>

<p>The first text with any editorial supervision is the so-called
Percy edition of 1789. Thomas Percy began to collect materials for
this edition in 1764. On 24 April of that year he wrote to Farmer:

<q>M<hi rend="super">r</hi> Tonson is going to publish a new Edition of the
Spectators, which he proposes to accompany with a few marginal
notes. Can you furnish him with any illustrations, anecdotes, or
names of concealed authors: or can you procure them from any of
your friends? I am now ransacking the Biographia Britannica and
other books of that kind for him. &mdash; Some personal and temporary
allusions require clearing up, and these only it is proposed to
annotate upon in as few words as may be. It is not perhaps too late
to recover the key to these: but if delayed much longer it will
become difficult, if not impossible: and then one of the most
valuable works in our language will be handed down to posterity
full of obscurities, which a few timely illustrations might have
prevented.<ref target="f005.08.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref></q>

It is clear from this letter and Percy's other correspondence that
the chief concern in the new edition was that of providing
explanatory notes and not that of a correct text. Percy eventually
gave up the work when he became chaplain to the Duke of
Northumberland, and his materials were turned over to John Calder,
who with John Nichols ultimately brought

<pb n="005.110"/>

out the edition in 1789. The value of this edition lies in its
biographical and historical notes, not in its text, and the same is
true of the two editions which followed at a short interval of
time, the first by Robert Bisset in 1793, "with notes and lives of
authors," and the other by Alexander Chalmers in 1806.</p>


<p>It was not until 1868, with the appearance of the edition by
Henry Morley, that any attempt was made to clear the text of the
inevitable corruptions and "improvements" which had crept in with
the numerous reprintings of the essays. At that time Morley
estimated, on the basis of a sampling of forty numbers, that there
were some three thousand textual corruptions in the
<hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>. Many of these he deserves credit for having
removed, though they have been reintroduced by subsequent editors.
Though he is often vague in his account of the texts, Morley seems
to have looked at the three original versions, and he sometimes,
though not consistently, indicates variant readings in his
footnotes. His edition remains to-day the most informative on
textual matters.</p>

<p>The only other editions with any pretensions to scholarly
exactness are the two which appeared almost simultaneously in 1897
and 1898&mdash;those prepared by G. A. Aitken and G. Gregory Smith.
Of
these Aitken's is modernized in spelling, punctuation, and
capitalization, whereas Gregory Smith's professes to reproduce
exactly such matters of eighteenth-century "style," even to the
insertion of new catchwords at the bottom of the pages. Both
announce themselves as based on the first 8vo edition, with
occasional footnotes recording variant folio readings, and both
ignore the first 12mo edition. Of the two, Aitken's is the less
inaccurate, in spite of its modernization of style. The edition of
Gregory Smith, the last volumes of which were brought out under
pressure of time, reproduces in a strange manner errors to be found
only in mid-eighteenth century reprints of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator,</hi>
and it introduces many other misreadings of its own.<ref target="f005.08.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> This edition was
reprinted in "Everyman's Library" in 1907, and in 1945 "reset with
minor revisions," only a very small percentage of the errors being
set right. Aitken's edition follows consistently, indeed slavishly,
the first 8vo text, even when this is patently in error. Neither
Aitken nor Gregory Smith appears to have made a thorough collation
of texts.</p>


<p>The three earliest and most important texts are the original
folio sheets, the first 8vo edition, and the first 12mo edition.
The original 555 numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> printed on both
sides of a folio half-sheet and published daily, except Sunday,
from 1 March, 1711, to 6 December, 1712, came from

<pb n="005.111"/>

the shops of Samuel Buckley and Jacob Tonson, Junior, which seem to
have worked in pretty regular alternation, in order to get out the
three thousand or more daily numbers which were called for.<ref target="f005.08.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> A continuation, in which Steele
had no
share (numbers 556-635), was published by Buckley and Tonson thrice
a week from 18 June to 20 December, 1714. The present study is
concerned only with the original series. Before the
<hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> had gone very far, the popularity of the essays
invited a reprint in book form, and a subscription edition was
undertaken by Tonson. The first two volumes of this edition in
octavo (comprising the first 169 <hi rend="italic">Spectators</hi>) was announced
in No. 269 (8 January, 1712) as ready for delivery. Ten days later,
on 18 January, Volumes I and II were advertised in No. 278 as
published in duodecimo, "a neat pocket edition" evidently designed
for popular consumption, although the price of the volumes does not
appear. Volumes III
and IV, again in both 8vo and 12mo (comprising numbers 170-321),
were published towards the end of 1712, about a month before the
original series ceased daily publication. The 12mo edition is
advertised in No. 533 (11 November, 1712) as "this day" published,
and the 8vo edition seems to have come out about the same time,
although there is no advertisement for this in the original
sheets.<ref target="f005.08.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> If the pattern of
publication followed that of the first two volumes we may infer
that Volumes III and IV appeared in 8vo about the first of November
and in 12mo, as we have seen, on the eleventh. Volumes V, VI, and
VII, completing the original series, appeared in both 8vo and 12mo
on 11 April, 1713; and the continuation of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>
(comprising numbers 556-635) was published as Volume VIII, again in
both 8vo and 12mo, on 1 September, 1715.<ref target="f005.08.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref></p>




<p>These three earliest editions&mdash;the Folio, 8vo, and 12mo
versions&mdash;offer themselves as candidates for a basic copy-text. In
addition, the reprint of Addison's eighteen Milton papers,
published by Tonson in 1719, the year of Addison's death, under the
title, <hi rend="italic">Notes upon the Twelve Books of Paradise

<pb n="005.112"/>

Lost, collected from the Spectator,</hi> contains numerous stylistic
revisions and clearly possesses authority. The edition of Addison's
<hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> prepared by Thomas Tickell and published by Tonson
in
1721, is not of great importance. Although Tickell had been
designated by Addison as editor and the selection of material seems
to have been made by Addison, the text of the <hi rend="italic">Spectators</hi>
reprinted there is demonstrably inaccurate and can in no sense be
taken as the final version intended by the author. The editions,
then, which have to be considered as possibly authoritative are the
Folio sheets, the first 8vo edition, and the first 12mo edition,
together with, for Addison's Milton essays, the 1719 collection of
the papers on <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>.</p>

<p>One has only to place the three texts of any number of the
<hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> side by side to see that they differ widely, not
only in punctuation, spelling, and capitalization, but in phrasing,
in grammatical construction, and in literary style. For how many of
these changes&mdash;in spelling, for example&mdash;were Steele and
Addison
responsible? How many were due to the style of the printing-house,
or to the care&mdash;or negligence&mdash;of the compositor? Inadvertent
errors disfigure all three texts, and many of those in the first
8vo reprint have been carried into modern editions. In No. 407, for
example, the word "Pack-thread" is misprinted in 8vo as
"Pack-threak," an error retained by Gregory Smith in his edition of
1897-98; in No. 376 the "Scream" of the criers in the streets is
altered in 8vo to the meaningless "Stream," a substitution copied
by both Gregory Smith and Aitken, and still uncorrected in the 1945
Everyman's Library reprint of Gregory Smith's edition. Some
typographical
errors, such as "impertiently" in No. 91 of the Folio text, remain
in both 8vo and 12mo; others, such as "Inablity" (No. 151, Folio),
are followed in 8vo but corrected in 12mo; still others, such as
"preceds" (No. 285, Folio), are corrected in 8vo but allowed to
stand in 12mo. Obvious errors of this sort can easily be noted of
course and corrected, but other examples are less clear, In No.
290, for instance, the Folio reads "in Greatness of Sentiment,"
which the 8vo alters to "in greatness of Sentiments," a change from
singular to plural followed by Morley, Aitken, and Gregory Smith.
Again, in No. 310 the Folio reads "in like Manner," the 8vo "in a
like Manner": Morley adopts the first reading, Gregory Smith and
Aitken the second. Are the 8vo alterations in both cases instances
of revision or of inadvertent error? Neither of the readings can be
said to commend itself instantly on purely literary grounds. It
soon becomes clear, in fact, that no one of the three earliest
editions
can be followed uncritically, because all contain errors in varying
degree.</p>

<p>The relationship of the three texts cannot be represented as the
simple one of Folio copied by 8vo and 8vo copied by 12mo, but
rather is one of

<pb n="005.113"/>

considerable complexity. Collation of all the variants in the 555
numbers reveals that in certain portions of the text the 8vo and
12mo versions are indeed so identical as to imply complete
dependence of 12mo upon 8vo; in other areas, however, the 8vo
follows the Folio with little or no change, and the 12mo exhibits
considerable variation; and in still other sections the 8vo
deviates greatly from the Folio, with the 12mo agreeing with the
Folio very closely. Since Tonson and Buckley not only worked
alternately in the printing of the original Folio sheets but also,
as we shall see, divided between them the work of bringing out
separate volumes of both the 8vo and 12mo editions, a study of
printing variants in the three texts of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> offers
an unusual opportunity of discovering to what extent printing
practice determined changes in spelling, punctuation and the like,
and how far these seem to have been due to the author. It will be
of interest to apply here the theory,
so persuasively stated by Greg, that the first printing of a
text&mdash;which is alone set up from an author's
manuscript&mdash;represents most faithfully the writer's intentions and
that the farther away we get from the first printing the greater
will be the opportunity for inadvertent changes and compositors'
normalizations to occur.<ref target="f005.08.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> Greg's
conclusion is that for the "accidentals" of a text&mdash;spelling,
punctuation, and capitalization&mdash;the earliest edition set from an
authoritative manuscript should be chosen as copy-text, with the
insertion of such "substantive" or other alterations from the
revised editions which in the judgment of the editor are
authoritative. This procedure, which is coming to be pretty
generally recognized in studies of sixteenth- and
seventeenth-century texts, seems particularly relevant to an
inquiry into the text of such a work as the <hi rend="italic">Spectator,</hi>
printed first in Folio sheets and later revised for publication in
book form.</p>


<p>Through the greater part of Volume I (Nos. 1-80) the 8vo and
12mo texts of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> are quite similar. In numbers
12, 13, and 19 the two texts are identical so far as accidentals
are concerned, and this is generally true through No. 73, with the
12mo copying typographical errors of 8vo in numbers 15 and 28.
There seems little question but that for most of the volume the
copy-text used by 12mo is the printed 8vo sheets. For the last
seven numbers, however, there is considerable divergence, with 12mo
following in about equal proportions Folio and 8vo readings, and in
No. 80 copying an error in Folio. For Nos. 74-80, therefore, we may
conclude that the 12mo text is less insignificant than it appears
to be in the earlier and greater part of the volume.</p>

<p>In Volume II (Nos. 81-169) the pattern is much the same as in
the

<pb n="005.114"/>

first part of Volume I, with the 12mo text closely following the
8vo. A substantive revision, however, appears as early as No. 91,
and others follow in Nos. 101, 104, 110, 119, 125, 131 (as many as
seven in this number), and so on, in increasing numbers in the
latter half of the volume. The 12mo text shows little similarity to
the Folio throughout Volume II, and there is no instance of its
copying errors in the Folio text. It does reproduce errors,
however, from the 8vo, so that one must conclude that its copy was
the 8vo sheets. The increasing number of revisions, on the other
hand, suggests that the authors may have taken the opportunity to
make further corrections after the 8vo sheets had been printed.</p>

<p>The 8vo and 12mo texts diverge radically in Volume III (Nos.
170-251), with the 8vo retaining many of the Folio characteristics
and the 12mo showing for the most part independent readings, so far
as accidentals are concerned. In No. 221 the 8vo text follows the
Folio in every detail, whereas there are 38 changes in 12mo. In
only four (Nos. 170, 178, 184, and 251) of the eighty-two papers in
this volume is the agreement between 8vo and 12mo greater than that
between Folio and 8vo. The 8vo copies errors of the Folio in Nos.
202, 212, 223, 228, 234, 241, and 249; in only one instance (No.
242) is an error in Folio copied by 12mo. The 12mo text shows a
similar independence as regards substantive readings and in as many
as twenty-seven essays contains authorial revisions not to be found
in 8vo. Significantly it is only in this volume that we find an
instance of an erratum marked in the Folio and corrected in only
one of the reprints. In No. 235 the substitution of "Fence" for
"Force" is noted only in the 12mo. It can hardly be argued, on the
other hand, that the 8vo is following an uncorrected copy of Folio,
for a considerable share of substantive revisions are to be found
in both 8vo and 12mo. These often occur in slightly different form,
so that one infers that both reprints are using independently a
corrected Folio sheet. One example may be given (from No. 249):

</q>

<p>In Volume IV (Nos. 252-321) the normal pattern of concurrence
between 8vo and 12mo is resumed, but only as far as No. 270.
Beginning with No. 271 the 12mo text suddenly begins to show a
preponderance of identical readings, both accidentals and
substantives, with Folio. More precisely, the shift occurs not at
the end of No. 270, but about midway in the fourth paragraph of No.
271, at the conclusion of gathering H of the 8vo edition. From the
beginning of gathering I of the 8vo to the end of the volume the
12mo text, especially as far as accidentals are concerned, is much
closer to the Folio than to the 8vo. In No. 305, a fair example,
the 12mo agrees with the 8vo in five cases, with the Folio in
sixty-one. It seems likely that the printing of 12mo was proceeding
at a faster pace than that of 8vo and that the supply of 8vo
printed sheets, which the 12mo compositor had been using for copy,
were no longer available, so that from No. 271 the Folio sheets
became the copy for 12mo. As we
should expect, 12mo copies errors from 8vo in the early part of the
volume (in Nos. 265, 266, and 270), and after No. 270 copies errors
from Folio (in Nos. 272, 278, and 285). Near the end of the volume,
however (in No. 319), it repeats an error from 8vo, in the spelling
"disigenuous," which, unless due to coincidence, suggests the
following of 8vo.<ref target="f005.08.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> The dependence
of 12mo on Folio need not in itself, however, imply an inferior
state of text for 12mo; in several of the papers in the latter
portion of the volume (notably in Nos. 272, 275, 279, 285, 298,
309, and 317) it preserves correct substantive readings which had
been lost in the 8vo. On the other hand, the correction of errata
in two numbers falling in the latter half of Volume IV seems to
point to further revision induced by "second thoughts" in the
preparation of 8vo. The erratum for No. 283 has "<hi rend="italic">for</hi>
Catlaine's <hi rend="italic">read</hi> Cataline's." The 12mo text duly prints
"Cataline's," but the 8vo  has the correct spelling "Catiline's." In No. 293 we have the case
of two errata originally marked in the Folio sheet but apparently
superseded by further revision before the number came to be
reprinted.</p>

<q>Alas! What an inconsiderable Creature am I in this prodigious
Ocean of Waters; my Existence is of no Concern to the Universe. .
.</q>

<p>If we were confronted with only the second of these cases we might
infer that 12mo was using an uncorrected Folio sheet and had only
the original errata notice to follow. In the first example,
however, both 12mo and 8vo adopt the same revision, and
consequently it would appear either that the 12mo compositor was
careless or that he had access to only a partially revised sheet.
The entire 12mo text of this number is very close to the Folio in
accidentals, and, in contrast to 8vo, fails to correct the spelling
"Richlieu" earlier in the paper as well as the incorrect marking of
the Greek motto at the head of the essay. Clearly, the 12mo
readings in the latter half of Volume IV, standing so close as they
do, both in accidentals and substantives, to the Folio, afford a
valuable check on the 8vo text, but they offer no easy solution and
do not allow an editor to shirk the responsibility of deciding each
reading on its own merits.</p>

<p>For the first part of Volume V (Nos. 322-394) the 12mo text
continues to show considerable dependence on the Folio sheets, and
copies errors from the Folio in No. 326; but after No. 351 the
similarity between the two decreases, with the exception of one
number (No. 386), and from No.

<pb n="005.117"/>

352 to the end of the volume the 8vo and 12mo texts are in general
agreement. Errors in 8vo are copied by 12mo in Nos. 354, 359, 361,
and 369. Both 8vo and 12mo of this volume were published
simultaneously, and it seems likely that at the beginning each
volume was set up from corrected Folio sheets, but that after some
thirty numbers had been printed the supply of 8vo sheets began to
be available as copy for 12mo. There is a notable absence of
independent substantive readings in 12mo. Volume V was produced,
both in 8vo and 12mo, by Buckley, and the proportion of variants is
high, particularly in the papers originally printed in Folio by
Tonson. It is perhaps worth noting that in the Milton papers, most
of which occur before No. 352, the instances in which 12mo follows
Folio rather than 8vo are to be found mainly in the quoted
passages. Was the 8vo compositor using a separately marked copy of
<hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> and the 12mo compositor simply transcribing
the Folio sheets?</p>

<p>Volume VI (Nos. 395-473) is notable for the low number of
accidental variants, and there is a greater uniformity among the
three texts than in any of the other volumes. In No. 413 there are
only seven variants, a proportion of only 4% to the length of the
paper. This is an extreme case, but in only eleven numbers of this
volume does the proportion rise above 20%, in remarkable contrast
to Volume V, in which all but two of the papers show a figure
higher than 20%. Generally the 8vo and 12mo texts agree; only in
three numbers (Nos. 411, 439, and 468) is there a greater
correspondence between 12mo and Folio. Judging from the
reproduction of errors, the 12mo text seems to follow now the 8vo
(in Nos. 400, 403, 422, 425, 427, 450, 465, and 470), now the Folio
(in Nos. 407, 413, 436, and 458) as copy. Independent substantive
readings are rare in the 12mo, but as usual it frequently preserves
correct readings from the Folio.</p>

<p>The proportion of variants in Volume VII (Nos. 474-555) is
higher, particularly in the first half of the volume. It is
apparent from typographical evidence that this volume, both in 8vo
and 12mo, was divided between the two printing houses, Buckley
producing the first half of the volume (Nos. 474-517)&mdash;through
gathering Q in the 8vo and gathering H in the 12mo&mdash;and Tonson
doing the remainder.<ref target="f005.08.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> In the
portion printed by Buckley there is considerable variation between
8vo and 12mo; in the remainder of the volume the 12mo text follows
8vo fairly consistently. The most striking feature is the fact that
in the first half of Volume VII the proportion of variants is much
higher (an average of 36% per number) in the papers which Tonson
had originally printed in Folio than in the papers originally
produced by Buckley himself (an average of 21%).

<pb n="005.118"/>

Conversely, in the latter half of the volume the average of
variants for the papers originally printed by Tonson is only 12%,
whereas the average for those originally brought out by Buckley is
17%. These figures, which can be supplemented by comparisons from
other volumes, afford good evidence that changes in accidentals are
likely to be due not to the authors of the essays but to the
practice of printers.</p>


<p>This survey of the textual variants in the seven volumes enables
us to see more clearly the relationship of the three texts. It is
apparent that for a large portion of the essays the 12mo text is
following the reprinted 8vo sheets. This is true in the main for
Volumes I, V, and VI, where 12mo generally reproduces the text of
8vo quite closely. These portions of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> are less
likely to offer, in the 12mo volumes, independent and revised
readings. The remaining four volumes, particularly Volume III,
display radical divergences in the 12mo text, and are entitled to
more scrutiny than they have hitherto been accorded. The
differences may be summarized by showing for each volume the number
of essays in which independent 12mo readings are more numerous than
agreement of 12mo with either 8vo or Folio.

Since the 12mo text has been almost completely ignored in the past,
it is obvious that for certain volumes it may offer the opportunity
for new and good readings.</p>

<p>The point raised by the study of variants in Volume VII offers
the possibility of exploring the real cause for accidental
variants. From the evidence supplied there, it would seem likely
that we should find fewer variants of this sort in a number of the
<hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> produced by the same printing-house in Folio, 8vo,
and 12mo, than in a number brought out in Folio by Printer A and
reproduced in 8vo and 12mo by Printer B. Three other volumes of the
<hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> enable us to test this hypothesis&mdash;I and VI,
printed both in 8vo and 12mo by Tonson, and V, printed in both 8vo
and 12mo by Buckley. A count of the accidental variants&mdash;excluding
the substantive changes, for which the author, not the compositor,
would be responsible&mdash;shows conclusively that an essay originally
produced by one printer and reprinted by another contains a greater
number of variants. In Volume I (published in 8vo and 12mo by
Tonson) the number of accidental variants in the 40 essays which
Tonson had originally printed in Folio is 1,123; for the same
number of essays first printed by Buckley the

<pb n="005.119"/>

total is 1,287, an increase of 12&frac12;%. In Volume V (by Buckley)
the variants in the 36 essays originally printed by Buckley total
1,551; the variants in the same number of essays first printed by
Tonson total 2,410, an increase of over 35%. The Tonson papers in
this volume are considerably longer, with a total "lineage" almost
25% greater than that of the Buckley papers. Even with this
modification, however, the increase is sufficiently impressive. In
Volume VI (by Tonson) the 39 papers originally done by Tonson show
a total of 501 variants; in the same number of original Buckley
papers the total reaches 996, an increase of almost 50%. The total
length of the Buckley papers in this volume is only 9% greater than
that of the Tonson papers. The variants when classified according
to the authors of the essays do not show the same consistent
proportions. It is the printer who is responsible. Variants in
spelling, punctuation, and capitalization exist not because the
author of
the essay demanded these changes but because the preferences of the
compositor or the practice of the printing-house dictated a
different spelling, a heavier or lighter punctuation, or a more
consistent system of capitalization.</p>

<p>The evidence from spelling is conclusive. In the dedication of
Volume II to Lord Halifax the first edition of the 12mo
(Sig.A2<hi rend="super">v</hi>) reads: "While I busie my self as a Stranger
upon
Earth, and can pretend to no other than being a Looker-on, You are
conspicuous in the Busie and Polite World. . . ." In the second
edition the spellings "busy" and "Busy" are substituted&mdash;not
because Steele rewrote the dedication, but because the first
edition was produced by Tonson, the second by Buckley. A more
arresting example occurs in two of the Folio <hi rend="italic">Spectators</hi>
(Nos. 170 and 171), both written by the same author (Addison) on
the theme of jealousy but printed by Buckley and Tonson
respectively. In the first essay "jealousy" is spelled without
exception (twelve times) with the "y" ending, and in the following
paper as regularly and uniformly (six times) with the "ie"
termination.
It is unthinkable that Addison wilfully altered the spelling of the
key word in the two essays, spelling it "jealousy" throughout the
one and "jealousie" throughout the other. When Tonson reprinted
these essays in the 8vo edition, the spelling throughout both
numbers is "jealousie," whereas the 12mo edition of Buckley with
almost equal uniformity (there are two exceptions) spells the word
"jealousy." The responsibility for the changes is unmistakable. The
letters of Addison and Steele exhibit the greatest irregularity in
spelling,<ref target="f005.08.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> and one conjectures

<pb n="005.120"/>

that the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> manuscripts confronting the compositor
showed a similar lack of consistency. Since the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>
was produced by two printing-houses, both in the original printing
and in the 8vo and 12mo volumes, it offers a particularly good
source for evidence of spelling differences. The two spellings of
"busy" have been cited. In the Folio sheets printed by Tonson the
word is generally spelled "busie," but it is never spelled thus in
the Folio numbers printed by Buckley. In the Folio, again, the word
"battle" appears uniformly thus in numbers by Buckley, and without
exception as "battel" in numbers by Tonson. The table below brings
together the most clearly marked differences in spelling, in the
Folio sheets, the 8vo, and the 12mo edition. The first column lists
all the occurrences of each spelling in the 555 Folio numbers,
first in the papers printed by Tonson and secondly in those printed
by Buckley. In the seven columns following will be found the
corresponding spellings of each word in the seven volumes of the
reprint, first in 8vo and then in 12mo. Volume VII is divided, to
show (a) the portion (Nos. 474-517) printed by Buckley and (b) the
portion (Nos. 518-555) printed by Tonson. At the foot, for each of
the 8vo and 12mo volumes, will be found the total of characteristic
"Buckley" and "Tonson" spellings.</p>

<p>The distribution of spellings is curious, and cannot be due to
coincidence. The word "money," for example, which is never spelled
as "mony" in the Folio sheets printed by Buckley, has this spelling
in both formats of Volume I and Volume VI and is never spelled thus
in Volume V, 8vo. Some of the spellings&mdash;particularly the "ie" and
"our" endings&mdash;may of course in some cases be due to the need for
justifying the line of type, and due allowance must be made for
accident or error on the part of the compositor. Most of the
differences, however, occur in sufficient numbers and with enough
consistency to rule out the element of chance. A comparison of the
spellings in the Folio sheets with those in the following columns
points very strongly to the printers responsible for the 8vo and
12mo volumes: the 8vo volumes I, III, and VI, and the 12mo volumes
I, II, IV, and VI by Tonson; the 8vo volumes II and IV, and the
12mo volumes III and V by Buckley; with Volume VII, both in 8vo and
12mo,
clearly divided between the two. Only for Volume V, 8vo, is the
evidence inconclusive, and on the basis of typography it may be
assigned to Buckley. For all the other volumes the typographical
evidence confirms the data from spelling differences, and the
several volumes may provisionally be assigned as follows:

Our concern here, however, is not so much to prove the identity of
the printers responsible as to note the remarkable consistency of
spelling differences and the very strong support which this gives
to the hypothesis that these differences are attributable not to
the authors of the essays but to the compositor or the
printing-house. And what is true of spelling is,

<pb n="005.122"/>

I feel sure, also true of other accidentals such as capitalization,
punctuation, italicizing, abbreviating, and so on. The
<hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> was published at a time when these matters were
in
process of becoming standardized, but there was still considerable
latitude. McKerrow has pointed out how different, in the matter of
capitalization, is Rowe's text of Shakespeare, printed in 1709,
from that of Pope, published just sixteen years later:

<q>In one respect Rowe's text appears to-day more old-fashioned
than the Fourth Folio, for he, or his printer, introduced the
practice common in his time of capitalizing almost all nouns.
Pope's text, on the other hand, though printed from Rowe's, has
hardly more capitals than a modern edition.<ref target="f005.08.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref></q>

If sufficient manuscript material by Addison and the other authors
of the essays existed it might be possible to attempt to determine
the general practice of these authors and proceed to standardize
spelling and other accidentals accordingly. Such material is not
available, and any attempt to regularize the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>
essays to fit such a program is open to the two-fold objection that
it would necessarily be incomplete and that it would impose a far
greater uniformity in such matters than Steele or Addison or any of
the other contributors ever cared about or practised. A choice
among copy-texts, however, must be made, even though such a text
will certainly exhibit a number of non-authorial characteristics.
The evidence assembled here gives very strong support to Greg's
view that the first printing&mdash;in the case of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>

the Folio sheets&mdash;will be freest from contamination and the
closest in the presentation of accidentals which we can hope to
reach to
the original intentions of the authors. The later corrections and
changes which were made by the authors&mdash;substantive
revisions&mdash;will then be incorporated into this basic text.</p>


<p>In the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> these revisions may be said to begin
with the lists of errata in the Folio sheets. As early as the sixth
paper an errata list is provided for No. 5, and these occur at
intervals throughout the run of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>&mdash;a total
of
57 errata lists in the 555 numbers, distributed among 38 numbers by
Addison, 17 by Steele, one (No. 283) by Budgell, and one (No. 237)
of uncertain authorship. Some of these errata have to do with
improvements in style, some are corrections of fact, and some are
simply rectifications of spelling. Many factual errors and
misspellings remain unnoticed, however, so that it is clear that
the insertion of errata lists was not done in any very systematic
manner. The greater part of them have to do with the Milton papers,
and in the later numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> the occurrence of
errata lists diminishes perceptibly.</p>

<pb n="005.123"/>

<p>The errata are, with some exceptions, taken into account with
the reprinting of the essays in 8vo and 12mo. In addition, many
stylistic changes are made&mdash;a total of over 1,500. They are
unmistakably author revisions. Addison, for instance, makes a
number of stylistic alterations to avoid inadvertent repetition of
a word, and with fairly regular consistency he drops the relative
pronoun "that" and replaces it by "which" or "who." Addison, in
fact, pays much more attention to such matters than does Steele and
is responsible for more than two-thirds of the total number of
revisions. Of the 555 papers only 51, less than one-tenth, are
without any stylistic changes; of these 33 are papers by Steele, 14
by Addison, two by Budgell, and two by uncertain authors. Moreover,
the number of such revisions in single papers is much higher in
Addison's than in Steele's; Addison's papers will contain as many
as twelve or fifteen stylistic revisions within an essay.
Steele's revisions run to a lower figure: there are a few papers
with as many as seven, but the number is generally lower. Only 41
of Steele's papers contain more than three such revisions. Steele's
inattention may be illustrated by the manner in which he allows
reproduction of his own earlier writings to stand in the
<hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>. On two occasions he quotes long extracts from
<hi rend="italic">The Christian Hero</hi>, in texts which are palpably careless and
inexact. The phrase "the Machiavilian Scheme" appears in No. 516,
Folio, as "the Machiavilian Scene," an error which is allowed to
stand in the 8vo and 12mo texts. Again, the phrase "Their proud and
disdainful Hearts, which were putrified with the Love and Pride of
this World" appears in No. 356 (all three texts) with the reading
"petrifyed." One might argue that this change was Steele's own
revision but for the fact that he continues to use "putrified" in
editions of <hi rend="italic">The Christian Hero</hi> after 1712.</p>

<p>When Steele and Addison make stylistic revisions for the 8vo and
12mo editions, and when we can be sure that the changes are in fact
revisions, we are entitled to consider them as representing what
the authors of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> intended us to read. Too often
in the past, however, editors have been ready to take all such
readings in the 8vo text as authoritative revisions. Actually many
are printers' errors. For example, in No. 267, the first of the
<hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> papers, an essay which Addison carefully
revised, the 8vo and 12mo texts read:

<q>As on the contrary, no single Step should be omitted in that
just and regular Process which it must be supposed to take from its
Original to its Consummation.</q>

If we turn to the Folio text we see that what Addison wrote was
"that just and regular Progress," and this is confirmed by the
reading in the 1719 volume of the <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> essays. The
Tickell edition of the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>

<pb n="005.124"/>

repeats the erroneous "Process," as do most modern editions,
including those of Aitken and Gregory Smith. Morley alone looked at
the Folio and has the correct reading. A few additional examples
may be cited in which the Folio text is to be preferred.</p>

</p>
<p>Another interesting&mdash;and much larger&mdash;body of
examples occurs
in which the correct reading of the Folio text has been lost in the
8vo reprint but retained in the 12mo version. This edition,
inferior in appearance to the handsome subscription 8vo, has been
almost entirely ignored in the past. The fact is, however, that
while it introduces errors of its own, it frequently provides, as
we have seen, evidence of being independently set up from the
corrected Folio sheets, and it avoids many of the errors of the 8vo
edition. In No. 290, by Steele, the 8vo text reads:

<q>We have seldom had any Female Distress on the Stage, which did
not, upon cool Imagination, appear to flow from the Weakness rather
than the Misfortune of the Person represented.</q>

It would not be difficult to conjecture that for "Imagination" we
should read "Examination," and this is, in fact, the reading of
both the Folio and

<pb n="005.125"/>

12mo texts. Both Aitken and Gregory Smith retain the 8vo reading.
In No. 533, again by Steele, which contains a letter protesting
against immoral company in stage-coaches, the 8vo text reads:

<q>One of them was called a Captain, and entertained us with
nothing but silly stupid Questions, or lewd Songs, all the Way.</q>

Turning to the Folio text, we find that the reading is not "silly"
but "filthy stupid Questions." The 8vo compositor misread the word,
but the 12mo compositor got it right and printed it as it stood in
the Folio. All succeeding editors have followed the erroneous 8vo
text. I cite a few more examples in which the 8vo text is clearly
wrong.</p>

</p>
<p>A study of these examples suggests that the Folio text not only
in accidentals but in substantive readings possesses more authority
than has generally been recognized, and that, although it was
revised when the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> was reprinted in book form, the
compositors of the 8vo and 12mo versions&mdash;particularly of the
8vo&mdash;altered the text in many cases for the worse. Interestingly
enough, in view of the fact that earlier editorial collation seems
to have centered largely on the early papers, the errors increase
in number in the later volumes: in the first two volumes I find
only 17 instances of erroneous substitution in the 8vo, but there
are 57 in Volumes III and IV, and 107 in Volumes V, VI, and VII.
With the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> in book form these
errors became firmly incorporated in the text, and no one, with the
partial exception of Morley, seems to have looked at
the Folio readings from this point of view or attempted a serious
collation of the three texts.</p>

<p>If the Folio text thus merits attention, an examination of the
12mo edition shows that it also needs to be taken into account as
a source of substantive readings. While it introduces many obvious
errors, it provides some examples of independent stylistic
revisions, with readings, consequently, which are not to be found
in the Folio or 8vo edition. In Volumes I and II there is not much
difference textually between the 8vo and 12mo editions, although in
Volume II the 12mo begins to diverge noticeably. In Volume III
there are radical differences (a preponderance of differences in 79
out of the 82 numbers in the volume). In Volume IV the differences
are much less striking, and in Volumes V-VII they become almost
negligible. To put it another way, in the first two volumes there
are eight readings which appear to be authorial revisions distinct
from the Folio and 8vo versions; in Volumes III and IV there are
47; whereas in Volumes V-VII there are no more than 16.
Three examples may be cited. In No. 131 the Folio text, followed by
the 8vo, reads: "Some look upon me as very proud, and some as very
melancholy." The 12mo version looks like an author's revision:
"Some look upon me as very proud, some as very modest, and some as
very melancholy." In No. 195, in a paragraph on the long-lived
Lewis Cornaro, the Folio text reads:

<q>insomuch that at fourscore he Published his Book, which has been
translated into <hi rend="italic">English</hi> under the Title of <hi rend="italic">The sure way

of attaining a long and healthful Life</hi>.</q>

<pb n="005.127"/>

The 8vo text follows this reading, and Gregory Smith has the
following note upon the passage: "The English version incorrectly
referred to by Addison is <hi rend="italic">Sure and certain Methods of attaining
a long and healthful Life</hi>. . ." The 12mo edition, however,
contains the correct reading:

<q>insomuch that at fourscore he published his Book, which has been
translated into <hi rend="italic">English</hi> under the Title of <hi rend="italic">sure and
certain Methods of attaining a long and healthful Life</hi>.</q>

The third example to be offered involves a drastic change in
meaning. In No. 279, one of the <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> essays, in a
passage in which Addison is discussing the sublimity of Milton's
thoughts, the Folio text reads:

<q>It is impossible for the Imagination of Man to distend it self
with greater Ideas, than those which he has laid together in his
first and sixth Book.</q>

Addison revised this sentence, striking out, I assume, in the Folio
sheet the last three words and inserting in the margin, "second and
sixth Books." The 8vo compositor noted the correction but
apparently misread the word "sixth," so that in the 8vo edition the
sentence ends with the words "in his first, second, and tenth
Books." Only the 12mo text has the correct reading, "in his first,
second and sixth Books." The 12mo reading not only accords better
with the facts of Milton's poem but is confirmed by the 1719
reprint of the <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> papers.</p>

<p>Such are some of the substantive differences in the three early
texts. They emphasize unmistakably the dangers inherent in too
implicit a reliance upon the 8vo text, the edition which has
hitherto served almost exclusively as the source for modern
reprints of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>. Studied in connection with the
accidental variants they enable us to assess with greater
confidence the relative authority of the various portions of the
text and to see at first hand some of the processes of change,
degeneration, and recovery which operate in the reprintings of a
long prose work. The study of variant spellings and conflicting
readings not only allows us to restore much that has been lost but
also brings some evidence to bear on the responsibility which the
printing-house may claim in the texts which we now read. Judged
from this point of view the study of variants may escape the
censure which the writer of <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> 470 bestowed upon the
textual critics of his own day:

<q>Indeed, when a different Reading gives us a different Sense, or
a new Elegance in an Author, the Editor does very well in taking
Notice of it; but when he only entertains us with the several ways
of Spelling the same Word, and gathers together the various

<pb n="005.128"/>

Blunders and Mistakes of twenty or thirty different Transcribers,
they only take up the Time of the learned Reader, and puzzle the
Minds of the Ignorant.</q>

His own prose, which has enjoyed the praise of Dr. Johnson and
survived the censure of Bishop Hurd, deserves to be read in as
accurate a version as modern scholarship can attain. Such a text,
if not imparting "a new Elegance," will at least in many cases
allow "a different Sense,"&mdash;a sense, one hopes, which its author
originally intended and would now approve.</p>

<div2 type="section" n="1"><head/>
<p>Several studies of Johnson's revisions of his publications have
disposed of the old belief that his care for his writings ceased
when they originally left his pen. The interest of these studies
has been chiefly in enabling us to see the process by which the
final form of each text&mdash;the form in which we are familiar with
it&mdash;was attained; only rarely has a knowledge of Johnson's
revisions enabled editors to arrive at readings superior to those
in the traditional texts.<ref target="f005.09.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
Johnson's revisions of his Preface to the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of the
English Language</hi> present a more complex and instructive case.
While noteworthy, like his other revisions, in displaying a great
stylist at work, these revisions have an additional significance
for the establishment of the true text of the Preface. For Johnson
revised the Preface twice, making an independent set of alterations
each time. And only one of these
sets of revisions has been incorporated in the versions of the
Preface printed since the eighteenth century.</p>


<p>Four folio editions of the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> appeared during
Johnson's lifetime. The first edition was published in 1775; the
second closely followed, the first volume late in 1775 and the
second early in 1756; the third edition was published in 1765; and
the fourth in 1773. All the subsequent texts of the Preface contain
variations from the first edition both in such "accidentals" as
spelling and punctuation, and in "substantive" readings directly
affecting the sense. It is the purpose of this study to record
these

<pb n="005.130"/>

variations; to indicate, on the basis of them, the relations among
the several editions; to distinguish, so far as possible, between
those variant readings which should be attributed to Johnson and
those which should be attributed to the compositor or
proof-corrector; and to suggest the editorial principles on which
future editions of the Preface should be based.</p>

<head type="sub">I. The Second Folio Edition, 1755-56</head>

<p>The second edition departs from the first in 31 readings, of
which 15 are in the accidentals of the text and 16 affect its
substance. The accidental variants may be considered first, for
they are not of great importance, and there is no clear sign that
Johnson is responsible for any of them.</p>

</list>

<p>Four of these changes &mdash;those in (81), (55), (94), and
(40)&mdash;are simple corrections of errors in the first edition. All
the errors are obvious, and the corrections merely bring the
readings into conformity with the style of the remainder of the
text. All could have been easily made by a careful compositor or an
alert press-corrector, and the general excellence of the work on
this edition suggests that the compositors were careful and the
proof-correctors alert, for although these four errors were
corrected, no new errors were introduced. I do not think,
therefore, that these four changes need be attributed to
Johnson.</p>

<p>Most of the remaining 11 changes are normalizations or easier
readings. None seems clearly to be by Johnson, and in view of the
relatively small number of substantive changes he made in the text
for this edition, it is perhaps doubtful that his care extended to
details of spelling and punctuation. I should be inclined to
attribute these 11 changes in accidentals, therefore, to the
compositor.</p>

<p>There are 16 substantive changes in the second-edition text.</p>

<p>(11) The first edition reads:

<q>Such defects are not errours in orthography, but spots of
barbarity impressed so deep in the <hi rend="italic">English</hi> language, that
criticism can never wash them away; these, therefore,

<pb n="005.132"/>

must be permitted to remain untouched: but many words have likewise
been altered by accident, or depraved by ignorance, as the
pronunciation of the vulgar has been weakly followed; . . . .</q>

In the second edition the latter portion reads:

<q>. . . but many words have been altered by accident, or depraved
by ignorance, . . . .</q>

The omission of <hi rend="italic">likewise</hi> may be a compositor's error, for it
is easier to omit a word than to insert one. But I think this is
Johnson's change, made because he saw that <hi rend="italic">likewise</hi> was not

quite accurate: alterations of the language from accident and
depravations from ignorance are <hi rend="italic">errors</hi>, and hence are
<hi rend="italic">not</hi> produced in a manner like that which accounts for the
spots of barbarity referred to first. <hi rend="italic">likewise</hi>, furthermore,
dulls the antithesis, and weakens Johnson's charge that preventable
damage is done by accidental or ignorant alteration.</p>

<p>(15) The first edition reads:

<q>I have left, in the examples, to every authour his own practice
unmolested, that the reader may balance suffrages, and judge
between us: . . . .</q>

In the second edition the next word to the last is altered to
<hi rend="italic">betwixt</hi>. In view of the care with which the compositor
followed his copy in setting this edition, I doubt that he would
have made so unnecessary a change, although it is not beyond
belief. On the other hand, I do not see why Johnson should have
made it. But on balance it should probably be attributed to
him.</p>

<p>(38) The first edition reads:

<q>As composition is one of the chief characteristicks of a
language, I have endeavoured to make some reparation for the
universal negligence of my predecessors, by inserting great numbers
of compounded words, as may be found under <hi rend="italic">after, fore, new,
night, fair</hi>, and many more.</q>

The second edition text omits <hi rend="italic">fair</hi> from this list. This is
surely Johnson's change. In defining <hi rend="italic">after, fore, new</hi>, and
<hi rend="italic">night</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi>, he calls attention to the

use of each in composition and gives numerous examples&mdash; 38
passages exemplifying compounds with <hi rend="italic">new</hi>, some 30
compounds
of <hi rend="italic">night</hi>, 27 with <hi rend="italic">after</hi>, and 73 with
<hi rend="italic">fore</hi>. But
in defining <hi rend="italic">fair</hi> he says nothing of its use as a compounding
element, and he gives no compound words formed from it. We may
speculate on the sequence of events underlying the inclusion of
<hi rend="italic">fair</hi> in the first edition. Johnson may have included it by
mistake, although this is unlikely on the face of it, and the more
so because the first four words in the list are in alphabetical
order. It is most improbable that the compositor intruded a word.
The likeliest explanation is that Johnson's manuscript contained a
fifth example which the

<pb n="005.133"/>

compositor misread as <hi rend="italic">fair</hi>; in his revisal Johnson
recognized <hi rend="italic">fair</hi> as incorrect, without being able to recall
the word he had originally written or troubling to add another. We
can only guess at what the original reading may have been. Perhaps
it was <hi rend="italic">semi</hi>, which would fall correctly in the alphabetical
series, which is treated in the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> as a prolific
source of compounds, and which could have been misread as
<hi rend="italic">fair</hi> in Johnson's hand.<ref target="f005.09.03" n="3" ><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref></p>


<p>(38) The first edition reads:

<q>These [compound words], numerous as they are, might be
multiplied, but that use and curiosity are here satisfied, and the
frame of our language and modes of our combination amply
discovered.</q>

In the second edition the last words read, with a sensible
improvement of the rhythm, "modes of our combination are amply
discovered."</p>

<p>(39) The first edition reads:

<q>Of some forms of composition, such as that by which
<hi rend="italic">re</hi> is
prefixed to note <hi rend="italic">repetition</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">un</hi> to signify
<hi rend="italic">contrariety</hi> or <hi rend="italic">privation</hi>, all the examples cannot
be
accumulated, because the use of these particles, if not wholly
arbitrary, is so little limited, that they are hourly affixed to
new words as occasion requires, or is imagined to require them.</q>

But <hi rend="italic">affixed</hi> is wrong, for it means "to unite to the end, or
<hi rend="italic">&agrave; posteriori</hi>; to subjoin." Johnson therefore corrected
the second edition text to <hi rend="italic">united</hi> (having used
<hi rend="italic">prefixed</hi> earlier in the sentence, he did not want to repeat
it).</p>

<p>(40) The first edition reads:

<q>These [verbal phrases] I have noted with great care; and though
I cannot flatter myself that the collection is complete, I believe
I have so far assisted the students of our language, that this kind
of phraseology will be no longer insuperable; . . . .</q>

In the second edition Johnson changed <hi rend="italic">I believe I have</hi> to
<hi rend="italic">I have perhaps</hi>, possibly with a view to continuing more
consistently the modest tone of the preceding clause.</p>

<p>(41) The first edition reads:

<q>Many words yet stand supported only by the name of <hi rend="italic">Bailey,
Ainsworth, Philips</hi>, or the contracted <hi rend="italic">Dict</hi>. for
<hi rend="italic">Dictionaries</hi> subjoined: of these I am not always certain
that they are read in any book but the works of lexicographers. Of
such I have omitted many, because I had never read them; . . .
.</q>

The second edition reads: "of these I am not always certain that
they are seen in any book but the works of lexicographers." I see
no reason to attribute

<pb n="005.134"/>

this change to the compositor. Johnson's alteration not only
eliminates the rather awkward repetition of <hi rend="italic">read</hi>, but
distinguishes nicely between <hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> a word in a dictionary
and <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> it in a book.</p>

<p>(43) First edition:

<q>And such is the fate of hapless lexicography, that not only
darkness, but light, impedes and distresses it; things may be not
only too little, but too much known, to be happily illustrated. To
explain, requires the use of terms less abstruse than that which is
to be explained, and such terms cannot always be found; for as
nothing can be proved but by supposing something intuitively known,
and evident without proof, so nothing can be defined but by the use
of words too plain to admit a definition.</q>

In the second edition the final part of this passage reads:

<q>so nothing can be defined but by supposing some words too plain
to admit a definition.</q>

I am not sure I can assay this change correctly; but I do not
believe it is Johnson's. Johnson's point is not that definition
forces us to suppose (what we might not otherwise know) that some
words are too plain to be defined. This we already know ("such
terms cannot always be found"). Instead, his point is that
definition is impossible without the use of these words, which
cannot themselves be defined. In the first edition the phrase
<hi rend="italic">the use of words</hi> stands directly below <hi rend="italic">by supposing
something</hi>, and I suspect that the second-edition compositor
read the wrong line&mdash;the surrounding words are very
similar&mdash;and
carried <hi rend="italic">by supposing some</hi> down into the next line as he set
it.</p>

<p>(45) The first edition reads:

<q>If of these [words of loose and general signification] the whole
power is not accurately delivered, it must be remembered, that
while our language is yet living, and variable by the caprice of
every one that speaks it, these words are hourly shifting their
relations, . . . .</q>

The second edition's "caprice of every tongue that speaks it" is an
obvious improvement by Johnson.</p>

<p>(78) The first edition reads:

<q>That many terms of art and manufacture are omitted, must be
frankly acknowledged; but for this defect I may boldly allege that
it was unavoidable: I could not visit caverns to learn the miner's
language, nor take a voyage to perfect my skill in the dialect of
navigation, nor visit the warehouses of merchants, and shops of
artificers, to gain the names of wares, tools and operations, of
which no mention is found in books; . . . .</q>

On re-reading this passage Johnson was perhaps struck by the
repetition in <hi rend="italic">warehouses: wares</hi>, or perhaps by the imperfect
balance which results

<pb n="005.135"/>

from illustrating the contents of <hi rend="italic">warehouses</hi> with one word
and of <hi rend="italic">shops</hi> with two. Whatever the reason, he made the
phraseology at once more elegant and more particular by
substituting for <hi rend="italic">wares</hi> the words <hi rend="italic">commodities,
utensils:</hi> "the warehouses of merchants, and shops of
artificers, to gain the names of commodities, utensils, tools and
operations, of which no mention is found in books."</p>

<p>(85) The first edition reads:

<q>. . . the stile of <hi rend="italic">Amelot's</hi> translation of father
<hi rend="italic">Paul</hi> is observed by <hi rend="italic">Le Courayer</hi> to be
<hi rend="italic">un peu
pass&egrave;;</hi> . . .</q>

The error in accent may not have been Johnson's, but it was
probably he who corrected the second-edition text to <hi rend="italic">un peu
pass&egrave;</hi>.</p>

<p>(89) The first edition reads:

<q>He that has long cultivated another language, will find its
words and combinations croud upon his memory; and haste and
negligence, refinement and affectation, will obtrude borrowed terms
and exotick expressions.</q>

Johnson, perhaps to avoid repeating <hi rend="italic">and</hi> four times in quick
succession, altered this in the second edition to read:

<q>and haste or negligence, refinement or affectation, . .
.</q></p>

<p>(92) The first edition reads:

<q>In hope of giving longevity to that which its own nature forbids
to be immortal, I have devoted this book, the labour of years, to
the honour of my country, that we may no longer yield the palm of
philology to the nations of the continent.</q>

Perhaps this seemed too categorical, especially for the peroration.
Johnson revised it to read:

<q>that we may no longer yield the palm of philology without a
contest to the nations of the continent.</q>

As will be seen, Johnson again made this change when he revised the
Preface for the 1773 edition.</p>

<p>(93) The first edition reads:

<q>. . . some who distinguish desert . . . will consider . . . that
sudden fits of inadvertency will surprize vigilance, slight
avocations will seduce attention, and casual eclipses of the mind
will darken learning; . . .</q>

In the second edition the words <hi rend="italic">of the mind</hi> are omitted. I
do not think Johnson made this change: it weakens the rhythm and
obscures the meaning. The compositor accidentally dropped the
phrase.</p>

<pb n="005.136"/>

<p>(94) The first edition reads:

<q>If the lexicons of ancient tongues, now immutably fixed, and
comprised in a few volumes, be yet, after the toil of successive
ages, inadequate and delusive; if the aggregated knowledge, and
co-operating diligence of the <hi rend="italic">Italian</hi> academicians, did not
secure them from the censure of <hi rend="italic">Beni</hi> . . . I may surely be
contented without the praise of perfection. . . .</q>

Johnson altered <hi rend="italic">be yet to are yet</hi> in the second edition. It
is true that Johnson notes in the <hi rend="italic">Grammar of the English
tongue</hi> that "the indicative and conjunctive moods are by modern
writers frequently confounded," and that after <hi rend="italic">if</hi> the
conjunctive is used "among the purer writers." But he may have
decided that the conjunctive did not suit well the mood of the
verbs in the two succeeding <hi rend="italic">if</hi>-clauses in this passage, and
he may have chosen to sacrifice purity to a stronger suggestion
that the lexicons of ancient tongues are inadequate.</p>

<p>Of these 16 changes introduced in the second edition,
two&mdash;those in (43) and (93)&mdash;are probably compositor's
errors.
The rest are probably by Johnson.</p>

<head type="sub">II. The Third Folio Edition, 1765</head>

<p>This text of the Preface has no independent textual authority.
It is a page-for-page reprint of the second edition, and follows
that edition in all the readings in which it departs from the first
edition. The third edition introduces no new substantive readings.
It departs from the second edition text in only 12 places: five of
these are sporadic normalizations of spelling, three are slight
changes in punctuation, of which one is indifferent and two obscure
Johnson's syntax, and four are clear compositor's errors.<ref target="f005.09.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> The third edition may therefore be
disregarded.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="4">
<head type="sub">III. The Fourth Folio Edition, 1773</head>

<p>The fourth edition of the Preface is a page-for-page reprint of
the first-edition text, varying from it in 38 readings, of which 21
are accidental

<pb n="005.137"/>

and 17 substantive. Except for five of these readings, the text of
the fourth edition does not repeat any of the variants introduced
in the second-edition text nor any of the variants from the second
edition introduced in the third. The five readings in which the
second, third, and fourth editions agree against the first must
therefore be examined in order to determine whether they imply
dependence of the fourth-edition text on the second or third rather
than, as the preponderance of the evidence would suggest, on the
first. Four of the readings in which 1773 agrees with 1755-56 and
1765 are in accidentals: in (81) the correction of
<hi rend="italic">unreguarded</hi> to <hi rend="italic">unregarded;</hi> in (55) the insertion
of
a necessary comma between <hi rend="italic">to CHEER</hi> and its definition; in
(94) substitution of a semicolon for a comma after <hi rend="italic">Beni</hi> to
separate the second and third of three long parallel clauses; and
in (40) a correction in typographical style,
changing an italic <hi rend="italic">to</hi> to roman in the phrase "to <hi rend="italic">break
off</hi>" in conformity with the style in a list of examples. The
fifth variant from the first-edition text in which the three later
editions agree is a substantive change. In (92), as we have seen,
Johnson originally said:

<q>In hope of giving longevity to hat which its own nature forbids
to be immortal, I have devoted this book, the labour of years, to
the honour of my country, that we may no longer yield the palm of
philology to the nations of the continent.</q>

In the second edition he had changed this to "that we may no longer
yield the palm of philology without a contest to the nations of the
continent"; this reading was repeated in 1765. The fourth edition
reading is identical with the second, except that the phrase
"without a contest" is set off with commas.</p>

<p>Do these five readings establish a textual connection between
the second edition and the fourth, or between the third and the
fourth? I do not think they do. The four changes in accidentals are
all simple corrections of manifest errors, of the kind that could
easily have been made by any careful workman, guided by the
consistent practice in the rest of the text, whether or not he had
a corrected copy before him. As to the alteration in (94), I think
we must suppose either that Johnson in 1773 remembered having made
this change in 1755 (and he may have done so because this is the
beginning of the noble close of the Preface), or that he invented
it anew (which he might easily have done, for once the need for
some softening of the sentence is felt, the phrase inserted has a
degree of inevitability). If we suppose instead that Johnson
derived this reading from the second or third-edition text, we must
suppose what is almost
inconceivable&mdash;that in all the other instances listed above in
which these texts vary from the first edition Johnson rejected the
reading of the intermediary text and returned by pure chance to the
readings of the first edition. The agreement

<pb n="005.138"/>

among the three later editions in these five places is to be
attributed, therefore, not to a direct line of descent from one to
another, but to the coincidence of simple and obvious corrections
by compositors or proof-correctors (or, less likely, by Johnson)
and to Johnson's chance recollection or repetition of one of his
earlier revisions. The fourth-edition text is independently derived
from the first edition.</p>

<p>The remaining 33 variations between the texts of the first and
fourth editions may now be examined.<ref target="f005.09.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> 17 affect the accidentals of the
text.</p>

the colon, not only to introduce a series or an expansion, but to
separate long complex clauses in which semicolons are used, or to
separate clauses between which the connection is slight, where
there is no conjunction and where we would normally use a period.
Cf. for the first type, (4), (15), (17), (42), (51), (72), (86);
for the second, (6), (17), (46), (48), (54), (65), (67), (92),

in the normal subordination; the fourth ed. reverses it.</item>

their own, by vanity or wantonness, by compliance with fashion, or
lust of innovation." If the comma is removed after <hi rend="italic">fashion</hi>,
that after <hi rend="italic">languages</hi> should also be deleted. (Johnson uses

</list>

<p>As in the second edition, the changes in accidentals seem to be
the occasional intrusion of the compositor or proof-reader.
Johnson's revision was casual and did not extend to the minutiae of
the text.</p>

<p>The text of the fourth edition contains 16 changes in the
substantive readings of the first edition. Readers familiar with
the Preface will recognize these, because they have been
incorporated in the standard text; one or two of them, I think,
should not be attributed to Johnson.</p>

<p>(2) The first edition reads:

<q>Among these unhappy mortals is the writer of dictionaries; whom
mankind have considered, not as the pupil, but the slave of
science, the pionier of literature, doomed only to remove rubbish
and clear obstructions from the paths of Learning and Genius, who
press forward to conquest and glory, without bestowing a smile on
the humble drudge that facilitates their progress.</q>

<q><hi rend="italic">1773:</hi> . . . doomed only to remove rubbish and clear
obstructions from the paths through which Learning and Genius press
forward to conquest and glory, . . . .</q></p>

<p>(8) In 1755 Johnson writes that uncertain pronunciation is the
source of

<q>that diversity of spelling observable in the <hi rend="italic">Saxon</hi>
remains, and I suppose in the first books of every nation, which
perplexes or destroys analogy, and produces anomalous formations,
which, being once incorporated, can never be afterward dismissed or
reformed.</q>

In 1773 the final relative pronoun is changed: "anomalous
formations, that, being once incorporated. . . ." Johnson's use of
<hi rend="italic">that</hi> and <hi rend="italic">which</hi> in the Preface follows no
principle
consistently, and it is accordingly difficult to fix the
responsibility for this change. But the printers seem in general to
have followed their copy closely, and I suspect that Johnson
changed the

<pb n="005.140"/>

relative to eliminate the repetition of <hi rend="italic">which</hi>, from which a
false parallelism might be inferred.</p>

<p>(15) Discussing the dependence of spelling on a writer's
knowledge of the language from which English words are derived,
Johnson concludes, in the first edition:

<q>. . . some words, such as <hi rend="italic">dependant, dependent; dependance,
dependence,</hi> vary their final syllable, as one or other language
is present to the writer.</q>

The 1773 text reads: "as one or another language is present to the
writer." I do not see the motive for this change, unless "one or
other" seemed archaic in 1773; but again, in view of the
infrequency of compositorial intervention, I think the change
should be attributed to Johnson unless there is a clear reason for
assigning it to the printer.</p>

<p>(25) Defending himself against the charge of injustice to Junius
as an etymologist, Johnson writes, in 1755:

<q>. . . it can be no criminal degree of censoriousness to charge
that etymologist with want of judgment, who can seriously derive
<hi rend="italic">dream</hi> from <hi rend="italic">drama,</hi> because <hi rend="italic">life is a
drama, and a
drama is a dream;</hi> and who declares with a tone of defiance,
that no man can fail to derive <hi rend="italic">moan</hi> from
&mgr;&oacugr;&ngr;&ogr;&zgr;, <hi rend="italic">monos,</hi> who considers that grief
naturally loves to be <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>.</q>

By 1773 Johnson had perhaps become convinced that he could not
expect from his readers enough Greek to follow him and Junius; at
any rate he added a gloss after <hi rend="italic">monos: "single or solitary,</hi>
. . ."</p>

<p>(34) 1755:

<q>Words arbitrarily formed by a constant and settled analogy, like
diminutive adjectives in <hi rend="italic">ish,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">greenish,
bluish,</hi>
adverbs in <hi rend="italic">ly,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">dully, openly,</hi> substantives in
<hi rend="italic">ness,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">vileness, faultiness,</hi> were less diligently

sought, and many sometimes have been omitted, when I had no
authority that invited me to insert them; . . . .</q>

The reading <hi rend="italic">many sometimes</hi> is clearly faulty, although
Johnson had let it slip past him when he revised the Preface for
the second edition: <hi rend="italic">many</hi> words cannot with propriety be
<hi rend="italic">sometimes</hi> omitted. In 1773 Johnson solved the difficulty by
deleting <hi rend="italic">many</hi>. But the error in the first edition must be
accounted for. I suspect that Johnson originally wrote <hi rend="italic">and may
sometimes have been omitted,</hi> and that the first-edition
compositor misread <hi rend="italic">may</hi> as <hi rend="italic">many</hi>. If this was
the
original reading, it gives a sense preferable to that which results
from Johnson's deletion of <hi rend="italic">many</hi>, for the fourth edition text
makes it seem that Johnson knows which of these words have been
omitted, whereas the point is clearly that he does not know. A bold
editor might introduce <hi rend="italic">may</hi> into the text.</p>

<pb n="005.141"/>

<p>(36) 1755:

<q>The participles are likewise omitted, unless, by signifying
rather qualities than action, they take the nature of adjectives;
as a <hi rend="italic">thinking</hi> man, a man of prudence; a <hi rend="italic">pacing</hi>
horse,
a horse that can pace: these I have ventured to call <hi rend="italic">participial
adjectives</hi>.</q>

1773 reads: "unless, by signifying rather habit or quality than
action, . . . ." The <hi rend="italic">qualities</hi> of the first edition conceals
a distinction conveyed in Johnson's two examples, of which, in the
1773 text, <hi rend="italic">habit</hi> (defined in the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> as
"a
power or ability in man of doing any thing, when it has been
acquired by frequent doing the same thing" [Locke]) is illustrated
by <hi rend="italic">thinking,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quality</hi> ("accomplishment;
qualification") by <hi rend="italic">pacing</hi>.</p>

<p>(40) 1755:

<q>There is another kind of composition more frequent in our
language than perhaps in any other, from which arises to foreigners
the greatest difficulty. We modify the signification of many verbs
by a particle subjoined; as to <hi rend="italic">come off,</hi> to escape by a
fetch; to <hi rend="italic">fall on,</hi> to attack; . . . .</q>

In 1773 "the signification of many verbs" is altered to "the
signification of many words." This seems to be a compositor's
error. This type of composition is confined to verbs, as is shown
by the list of examples, all of which are verbs, and by Johnson's
reference at the end of the paragraph to "combinations of verbs and
particles."</p>

<p>(47) Johnson confesses that he has been unable to explain some
words because he does not understand them. In the first edition he
says:

<q>. . . when <hi rend="italic">Tully</hi> owns himself ignorant whether
<hi rend="italic">lessus,</hi> in the twelve tables, means a <hi rend="italic">funeral
song,</hi>
or <hi rend="italic">mourning garment;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi> doubts
whether
&ogr;&urouagr;&rgr;&egr;&ugr;&sfgr;, in the Iliad, signifies a
<hi rend="italic">mule,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">muleteer,</hi> I may freely, without
shame, leave
some obscurities to happier industry, or future information.</q>

For <hi rend="italic">I may freely</hi> the 1773 text has <hi rend="italic">I may
surely</hi>.
Johnson perhaps sought a more modest tone.</p>

<p>(69) 1755:

<q>Thus have I laboured to settle the orthography, display the
analogy, regulate the structures, and ascertain the signification
of <hi rend="italic">English</hi> words, to perform all the parts of a faithful
lexicographer: but I have not always executed my own scheme, or
satisfied my own expectations.</q>

Johnson changed this in 1773 to read:

<q>Thus have I laboured by settling the orthography, displaying the
analogy, regulating the structures, and ascertaining the
signification of <hi rend="italic">English</hi> words, to perform all the parts of
a faithful lexicographer: . . . .</q>

This change eliminates an awkward shift in construction in the
original

<pb n="005.142"/>

text, where <hi rend="italic">to perform</hi> . . . must be taken not as the final
member of a series, which it appears at first to be, but as a
summary phrase. In improving the syntax Johnson did not notice, or
chose to disregard, the new implication of the sentence&mdash;that he
had in fact settled the orthography, displayed the analogy,
etc.&mdash;an implication denied in the second clause, in the rest of
the paragraph, and in the two paragraphs that follow.</p>

<p>(72) 1755:

<q>When first I engaged in this work, I resolved to leave neither
words nor things unexamined, and pleased myself with a prospect of
the hours which I should revel away in feasts of literature, the
obscure recesses of northern learning, which I should enter and
ransack, the treasures with which I expected every search into
those neglected mines to reward my labour, and the triumph with
which I should display my acquisitions to mankind.</q>

In 1773 the passage reads instead:

<q>. . . and pleased myself with a prospect of the hours which I
should revel away in feasts of literature, with the obscure
recesses of northern learning, which I should enter and ransack;
the treasures. . . .</q>

The original reading is clear, and the change in 1773 produces some
difficulty. In the first edition, <hi rend="italic">prospect</hi> controls a series
of four parallel elements&mdash;<hi rend="italic">hours, recesses, treasures,</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">triumph</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">with</hi> added before <hi rend="italic">the
obscure
recesses</hi> in 1773 destroys this parallelism and appears to
initiate a new one, less precise than the old, between
<hi rend="italic">prospect</hi> and <hi rend="italic">recesses;</hi> and the added
<hi rend="italic">with</hi> must
also be understood as preceding <hi rend="italic">the treasures</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the
triumph,</hi> for Johnson, if he made this change, could not prefix
a <hi rend="italic">with</hi> to each of these because each is followed by a
<hi rend="italic">with</hi>-construction. This is all very awkward; it is also
imprecise, for although Johnson could please himself in advance
with the <hi rend="italic">prospect</hi> of recesses of learning he intended to
enter, he could not please himself with the recesses themselves, as
the altered reading would have it, until he had entered them. If
this is Johnson's change,
he was careless, as he appears to have been nowhere else in the
course of this revision. Despite the general accuracy of the
compositor, therefore, I attribute this change to him rather than
to Johnson.</p>

<p>(73) 1755:

<q>I then contracted my design, determining to confide in myself,
and no longer to solicit auxiliaries, which produced more
incumbrance than assistance: by this I obtained at least one
advantage, that I set limits to my work, which would in time be
finished, though not completed.</q>

In 1773 Johnson altered the ending to read "which would in time be
ended, though not completed." This is an elegant change, and shows
Johnson at his most fastidious. In the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary to end</hi> is
defined as "to terminate; to

<pb n="005.143"/>

conclude; to cease; to fail," and <hi rend="italic">to finish</hi> as "1. to bring
to the end purposed; to complete. 2. to perfect; to polish to the
excellency intended. 3. to end; to put an end to." The same nicety
appears in the Advertisement Johnson composed for the 1773 edition:
"Many are the works of human industry, which to begin and finish
are hardly granted to the same man."</p>

<p>(74) 1755:

<q>Many of the distinctions which to common readers appear useless
and idle, will be found real and important by men versed in the
school philosophy, without which no dictionary ever shall be
accurately compiled, or skilfully examined.</q>

In 1773 <hi rend="italic">ever shall</hi> is transposed, by Johnson, I presume, to
<hi rend="italic">shall ever</hi>.</p>

<p>(84) 1755:

<q>Those who have been persuaded to think well of my design,
require that it should fix our language, and put a stop to those
alterations which time and chance have hitherto been suffered to
make in it without opposition.</q>

In 1773:

<q>Those who have been persuaded to think well of my design, will
require. . . .</q>

I am not sure what to make of this. It does not look like the
compositor trying to repair a sentence he found difficult to
understand. Perhaps Johnson in 1755 had in mind the hopes actually
expressed by friends, and in 1773, these circumstances being long
past, recast the sentence to give not only a better rhythm but a
firmer contrast to his own shifting opinions as expressed in the
next sentence.</p>

<p>(84) 1755:

<q>When we see men grow old and die at a certain time one after
another, from century to century, we laugh at the elixir that
promises to prolong life to a thousand years; and with equal
justice may the lexicographer be derided, who being able to produce
no example of a nation that has preserved their words and phrases
from mutability, shall imagine that his dictionary can embalm his
language, and secure it from corruption and decay, that it is in
his power to change sublunary nature, or clear the world at once
from folly, vanity, and affectation.</q>

In 1773 the lexicographer is made to imagine that he can "change
sublunary nature, and clear the world at once from folly" etc. The
change, which I take to be Johnson's, heightens the vanity of the
lexicographer and perfects the parallelism of the last two
clauses.</p>

<p>(88) In 1755, Johnson, commenting on Swift's proposal that words
should not be allowed to become obsolete, says:

<q>But what makes a word obsolete, more than general agreement to
forbear it? and how shall it be continued, when it conveys an
offensive idea, or recalled again into

<pb n="005.144"/>

the mouths of mankind, when it has once by disuse become
unfamiliar, and by unfamiliarity unpleasing.</q>

The inversions at the end of this passage are changed in 1773 to
the straightforward "when it has once become unfamiliar by disuse,
and unpleasing by unfamiliarity." Since Johnson's style in his
later prose tends to be less artfully contrived than in his earlier
writing, I take this change to be his.</p>

<p>(92) As already noted, Johnson in 1773, as in the second
edition, softened

<q>. . . that we may no longer yield the palm of philology to the
nations of the continent to</q>

<q>. . . that we may no longer yield the palm of philology, without
a contest, to the nations of the continent.</q></p>

<p>(94) 1755:

<q>. . . it may gratify curiosity to inform it, that the <hi rend="italic">English
Dictionary</hi> was written with little assistance of the learned,
and without any patronage of the great; not in the soft obscurities
of retirement, or under the shelter of academick bowers, but amidst
inconvenience and distraction, in sickness and in sorrow: and it
may repress the triumph of malignant criticism to observe, that if
our language is not here fully displayed, I have only failed in an
attempt which no human powers have hitherto completed.</q>

The rhythm and power of this noble passage are enhanced by
Johnson's revision in 1773: he ends the first sentence with
<hi rend="italic">sorrow,</hi> deletes the <hi rend="italic">and,</hi> and begins a new
sentence
with <hi rend="italic">It</hi>.</p>

<p>On the basis of this comparison of the texts of the four
editions of the Preface printed in Johnson's lifetime, the
relationships among them may be summarized as follows:

<list>
<item>(1) the second edition, 1755-56, was printed from the first;
there is no sign that Johnson or the compositor returned to the
manuscript (and a strong sign that they did not; cf. the deletion
in (38)).</item>

<item>(2) the third edition, 1765, was printed from the second:
wherever the second edition varies from the first, the third
edition follows the second; when the third varies from the second,
it never returns to a reading of the first; the third edition
introduces no readings which can be attributed to Johnson.</item>

<item>(3) the fourth edition, 1773, was printed from the first,
with revisions by Johnson independent of those he introduced into
the second-edition text: the fourth edition does not follow the
third in any of its variations from the second, nor, with the
exceptions already accounted for, does it follow the second in any
of its variations from the first.</item>
</list>
</p>

<pb n="005.145"/>

<p>We have, then, three texts of the Preface&mdash;since the text of
the third edition may be disregarded&mdash;which possess textual
authority. The second and fourth editions present texts
independently revised, and contain substantive changes of
importance. It does not appear from the number of these substantive
changes that Johnson's revision of the Preface for either edition
was systematic; this fact, together with the nature of the changes
in the accidentals of the texts, suggests that he did not extend
his attention to the details of spelling and punctuation, and that
the changes in the accidentals are probably not by Johnson. Nor can
all the substantive revisions in the two editions be automatically
ascribed to Johnson; most of them are surely his, but some, as I
have tried to show, may be suspected.</p>

<p>We need not be surprised at Johnson's failure to recall, in
1773, the revisions he had made in the Preface late in 1755. During
the intervening eighteen years he had, as he wrote to Boswell,
"looked very little into" the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary,</hi><ref target="f005.09.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> and he had been heavily occupied
with
other writing. And the revisions made in 1755 were not on the whole
so striking&mdash;with a single exception, perhaps&mdash;as to stick for
years in the mind of a man who wrote and revised much. Nor need we,
on the other hand, be surprised that Johnson, even if he had
forgotten the changes made in 1755, did not once more notice at
least the errors he had then corrected, if not the elegancies he
had added, and correct them again in 1773. Both revisions were
rather casual performances, not at all like his thorough-going work
on the <hi rend="italic">Rambler</hi>. He evidently read rapidly through the text,
mending or improving where something happened to catch his eye.</p>


<p>The two sets of revisions therefore complement each other. Each
represents, for certain passages in the Preface, Johnson's "final
intention." And the editorial procedure to be adopted in the light
of these circumstances is clear. There is no ground for adopting,
as the copy-text for an edition of the Preface, the text of the
fourth edition. This has been the procedure followed in all
editions since 1773, on the familiar theory that the last edition
published in the author's lifetime is the one most likely to
contain his final intentions with respect to the work.<ref target="f005.09.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> Greg and Bowers have recently

<pb n="005.146"/>

demonstrated that even for works whose textual history is more
normal than that of the Preface to the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> this is an
editorial theory certain to produce corrupt texts.<ref target="f005.09.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> For the Preface this theory has led,
in
all modern texts, to the exclusion of half of all the revisions
made by Johnson, to the perpetuation of errors and stylistic
defects which he had carefully expunged, and to the omission of
several stylistic elegancies which he had added. Future editors
must therefore adopt the text of the first edition as their
copy-text and introduce into it the two sets of Johnsonian
revisions from the second and fourth editions, together with such
changes in the accidentals from these texts as seem necessary for
correctness or consistency. The editor will have to determine for
himself which of the changes made in substantive readings in the
second and fourth editions are authoritative; I have tried to
indicate which are Johnson's,
but I do not suppose that I have chosen correctly in every case.
But the editor cannot avoid the responsibility of making a choice.
The resulting text will be a composite, but only a composite text
can reflect accurately the composite of intentions which influenced
Johnson in 1755 and 1773.</p>

<div2 type="section" n="1"><head/>
<p>A 'point' system is used by English-speaking type-founders and
printers of the present day to measure the 'body-size' of a fount
of type, in which the point is a unit measuring approximately one
seventy-second of an inch. Points are not used to measure that part
of a 'sort' of type, raised in relief upon the rectangular body
which actually makes an impression on the paper, called the
'face';<ref target="f005.10.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> and for this purpose it is
perhaps most convenient to use millimetres.</p>


<p>The face can be placed upon a particular size of body in two
different ways. One way, which is used to produce what may be
called 'text types', is to cast a fount which includes both upper
and lower-case sorts; this means that, in designing the face of
such a fount for a particular body-size, allowance must be made for
lower-case ascenders<ref target="f005.10.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> and
descenders, which will project beyond the vertical dimensions of
the capital letters. The other sort of fount, usually called
'titling types', has no lower case, so that there need be no
provision for lower-case ascenders and descenders; which means that
the face of a capital letter can be almost as tall as the body on
which it is cast.<ref target="f005.10.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> To take an
example of how this works out in practice, the face of the 72 point
capital 'A' of 'Gill Sans' text type in the current Monotype
specimen book (Monotype series 262) is 18 mm. high;
the 72 point capital 'A' of 'Gill Sans Titling' (Monotype series
231) has a face that is 24&frac14; mm. high; and the body-size in both
cases is 72 points, which is about 25&frac14; mm., or &middot;9962 in.</p>



<pb n="005.148"/>

<p>Before the point system was adopted in the English-speaking
countries during the last quarter of the nineteenth century, a
series of names was used to distinguish the various body-sizes most
commonly employed. A list of these names, together with the
body-size and face-size of the founts to which they refer, will be
found at the end of this note. Although this list, and what
follows, are based on an examination of eighteenth-century
typefounders' specimens, they will be found to apply, with only
occasional alteration, to typographical usage in Britain during the
sixteenth, seventeenth, and nineteenth centuries.</p>

<p>The practice of the eighteenth-century founders with regard to
the casting of text and titling faces on to the same size of body
was, with one serious exception, exactly similar to the modern
practice described above; it need only be remembered that they did
not usually differentiate between the two varieties in their
specimens. To take an example, Alexander Wilson and Sons' specimen
book of 1772<ref target="f005.10.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> begins with a 'Five
Lines Pica' which turns out to be a titling type; in other words,
the face-size of these capital letters takes up nearly the whole of
the five lines of Pica named as the body-size. This fount is
followed by other titling sizes from Four Line Pica to Two Line
Small Pica, and they in turn by text sizes from Canon (which has a
Four Line Pica body) to Pearl. But now comes the exception.
Wilson's next specimen, the broadside of 1783,<ref target="f005.10.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> appears to make nonsense of the
nomenclature hitherto employed by him. The Six Line Pica of this
sheet has capitals of titling size, the face being nearly six picas
high; <hi rend="italic">but it also has a lower case</hi>. In the same specimen,
Five and Four Line Pica are displayed only by their lower case; but
measurement discloses that the distance from ascender line to base
line virtually fills the body named, leaving no room for
descenders.</p>



<p>I have taken Wilson as an example, but the same apparently
inconsistent nomenclature is to be found in the specimens of a
number of other eighteenth-century founders. Caslon's specimen book
of 1764<ref target="f005.10.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> shows capitals of Five and
Four Line Pica which have capitals of titling size together with a
lower case; and Fry's book of 1788<ref target="f005.10.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref>does exactly the same. Nor was this

practice confined to the eighteenth century; the latest examples I
have come across are in <hi rend="italic">Specimens of Wood Letter</hi> (H. W.
Caslon and

<pb n="005.149"/>

Co., <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1899). Page 8 shows Six, Eight, and Twelve Line
Pica
Old Face founts which are titling types with lower case; and the
same system is used through the book for sizes up to Twenty Line
Pica.</p>



<p>There are two possible explanations of this anomaly. Since the
occurence of titling types with lower case was confined to the
larger sizes, it may be that they were not intended to be set
solid. If so, then the lower case could have been cast on the
body-size named, with projecting 'kerns' to accommodate the
descenders of g, j, p, q, and y. Against this it may be said that
kerns are a nuisance, both because they are easily broken and
because descender kerns necessitate leading;<ref target="f005.10.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> and that they are difficult to
cast.<ref target="f005.10.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> On the other hand, if kerns
are rejected, then we must suppose that the real body-size of a
titling fount with lower case called Six Line Pica was in fact
about eight picas, not six; that the body-size of such a Five Line
Pica was really six and three-quarter picas, and so on. Against
this may be set the facts that
the capitals of these queer founts can sometimes be found set solid
(when there are no lower-case sorts about), showing a true titling
body-size; and that this method would be more extravagant of type
metal than would casting with kerns. It is hard to decide which
method is the more likely.</p>



<p>Some confusion would be avoided if bibliographers, when they
speak of type-sizes by name, would agree to state plainly and
repeatedly whether they are referring to text or titling types. It
is, at any rate, quite essential to do so when there is any chance
of confusion arising from the occurence of the ambiguously named
types we have been discussing.</p>

<div2 type="section" n="2">
<head type="sub">Notes on the Table</head>

<p>This table is based on measurements taken from ten
eighteenth-century specimens by Caslon, Wilson and Fry. The average
of these measurements is given, so that the table is unlikely to be
completely accurate with regard to the products of any one
foundry.<ref target="f005.10.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> It will be noticed that
a few of the body-sizes are not quite the same as those given by Mr
J. C. Tarr in a letter to <hi rend="italic">The Library;</hi><ref target="f005.10.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> however, I am convinced that the
sizes
I give are more accurate than his as far as eighteenth century

<pb n="005.150"/>

founts are concerned, which, with few exceptions differed
remarkably little from each other in size. I imagine that Mr Tarr's
measurements were taken from type of other periods, which would
explain the slight discrepancy.</p>



<p>It will be seen that one or two text types have the same sized
capitals as some of the titling types (e.g., Two Line Great Primer
text and Two Line Pica titling), and these correspondences are
found even more frequently in the work of each individual founder.
Probably both sets of capitals were cast in matrices made from the
same punches. A similar technique seems to have been used to supply
founts with Small Capitals; the small caps of a given fount often
appear to originate from the punches of the capitals of the fount
two or three sizes smaller.</p>

<name type="title">The Pre-Publication Printings of Tarkington's
<hi rend="italic">Penrod</hi></name>
<lb/><hi rend="italic">by</hi><lb/>
<name type="author">Campbell R. Coxe</name>
</head>

<div2 type="section"><head/>
<p>Booth Tarkington's <hi rend="italic">Penrod</hi> (Doubleday, Page &amp;
Co., New
York, 1914) has sold close to a million copies and has been rated
as one of the outstanding American books of the first half of this
century. Moreover, it has proved an interesting 'guinea-pig' for
twentieth-century bibliographers.</p>

<p>The first to approach the problem was Barton Currie, who in a
1932 <hi rend="italic">Colophon</hi> article (vol. III, pt. 9) entitled "Hints to
Tarkingtonians" discussed the then known points in an attempt to
establish priority for interested collectors: namely, that the
first "issue" was bound in light blue mesh cloth and measured
one-eighth of an inch more across the top of the leaves than later
"issues," which were bound in greenish-blue grained cloth and
printed in blacker ink. Later in the same year appeared Currie's
<hi rend="italic">Booth Tarkington, A Bibliography,</hi> which included the
<hi rend="italic">Colophon</hi> article as an introduction and added the further
important information that 20,000 copies were printed before its
publication on March 26, 1914. In 1938 Jacob Blanck published some
new points<ref target="f005.11.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>: the earliest copies
had the numeral 'viii' at the foot of that page, which was
"partially or wholly removed" in later copies,
and the first 'state' could be distinguished by the spelling
'sence' instead of the later state's 'sense' in line 23 on page
19.</p>


<p>After considerable scholarly research D. R. Russo and T. L.
Sullivan produced in 1949 their comprehensive <hi rend="italic">Bibliography of
Booth Tarkington 1869-1946,</hi> which considers the above points
and two others which were inadvertently attributed to Currie
through an error in the revision of the final manuscript.<ref target="f005.11.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> The second of these latter two
points
was: "p. 344, line 6, 'l' present in 'perfectly', later dropped
out." The difficulties of this account, together with a
dissatisfaction with the bibliography's use of 'state'

<pb n="005.154"/>

to avoid the much abused 'issue' where sufficient information was
not at hand to indicate an impression, provided the incentive for
the research which has led to this present paper.<ref target="f005.11.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref></p>



<p>In the first place, it did not seem possible for the missing 'l'
on page 344 to have dropped out after printing started, for the
sheets seemed to have been printed from plates and thus the 'l'
ought to have been lost before the plates were made. If so, a type
could not have dropped unless the setting had been made by
monotype. Mr. Powers, an employee at Doubleday Press, who had been
with the Country Life Press in 1914, confirmed these assumptions by
stating that at the time <hi rend="italic">Penrod</hi> was printed plates were used
and monotype machines set the type. Further evidence that the 'l'
was added to the plate came to hand when it was seen that the
letter in question is shaky and malformed and that the preceding
't' and the following 'y' are not properly formed. This line of
investigation established that the sheet for gathering [22], a
normal quire of eight leaves in which page 344 is sig.
[22]<hi rend="sub">7</hi><hi rend="super">v</hi>, was first printed with the 'l' missing.
Comparison then demonstrated that both states of gathering [22]
were indiscriminately distributed among the fourteen copies
examined for evidence.</p>

<p>The following table lists the variant copies in three groups for
convenience of future reference:

<list>
<item>I   (a) Page viii numbered; p. 19 'sence'; 'l' missing p.
344.</item>

sky-blue ribbed cloth.<ref target="f005.11.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref></item>

</list></p>

<pb n="005.155"/>

<p>With the exception of the state of 'presently' on page 344 and
the elimination of the page number viii, the nine copies of Group
I are sufficiently uniform to indicate that they came from the same
impression. The "Ross" copy, classed as I(b), which is in the Smith
Library of the Indiana Historical Society, contains a presentation
inscription from the author dated March 29, 1914, to Morris Ross,
then managing editor of <hi rend="italic">The Indianapolis News</hi>. The presence

of the second state of gathering [22] in this copy, which was
inscribed only three days after publication, is of interest as
evidence that the dropped 'l' was inserted in the plate of page 344
before any copies were bound. It is also worth notice that the
correction must have been made late in the first press run or
between the first and second printings noted below, owing to the
number of sheets printed without the 'l', as evidenced by the first
state of the sheet in the "Wing" copy at Yale, III(a).</p>

<p>A comparison of the three copies in Group II with the nine in
Group I produced conclusive evidence that the plates had been
handled and a new imposition made before they were printed. The
correction of 'sence' to 'sense' on page 19 is so perfect that it
almost certainly indicates a resetting and a new plate. Even if we
disregard many damaged page numbers and much damage to the type,
which could conceivably have been caused by linting or press
batter, the damage to three particular plates is worthy of
consideration as evidence of handling. The right margin of page
153, lines 5 to 15, was quite obviously damaged by the ratchet key
slipping when the plate was being locked to the bed for a new
impression. Considerable damage to the type on page 167, running
diagonally down the page from the heading to the lower left,
appears to have been caused by handling the plate;
the same is true of the damage to lines 2 and 3 from the bottom of
page 182, which is the conjugate of page 167. Definite proof of a
new imposition, however, is provided by the fact that the plates of
the two half-titles, pages [i] and [1] (sigs. [1]<hi rend="sub">1</hi><hi rend="super">r</hi> and
[1]<hi rend="sub">6</hi><hi rend="super">r</hi>), are reversed. In the first half-title in Group I,
which is printed as the second half-title in Group II, there is a
diagonal white line running across the shadow on the girl's
forehead which does not appear in the second; and the short curved
line at the lower left of the boy's coat shows as an elongated "S"
in the second half-title.</p>

<p>Whereas the evidence in support of a separate impression for
Group III is not so conclusive as that for Group II, it appears
likely that there was indeed a third impression. There is new, if
slight, margin batter which points to ratchet damage having
occurred during a new imposition: see especially page 161, second
line from the bottom, right margin; page 165, line 14, left margin;
and page 232, right margin of lines 2 and 3 from the bottom. The
damage to pages 167 and 182 in Group II has been

<pb n="005.156"/>

partially repaired by reshaping some of the type faces and by
morticing in new type. The latter process was undoubtedly used on
the second line from the bottom of page 182, where through an error
an inverted comma was inserted in place of a semi-colon which had
been battered above the line. (This damage could have been repaired
in press, but as corroborative evidence and as an interesting
example of repair work it is included here.) The sheet bulk in
Group III averages 3/32 of an inch less than that in Group II; and
the binding is ribbed cloth instead of the mesh of the earlier
copies.</p>

<p>The last two points may assume new significance when considered
in connection with the following supposition: That the publisher's
estimate had to be expanded by two additional printings owing to
the popular interest created by the magazine serialization which
overlapped the publication date for the book. This was not a novel,
but a collection of stories about a boy and his dog and his
friends. Therefore, it seems reasonable that a printing of 10,000
copies was first planned, with two additional printings of possibly
5,000 each called for prior to publication. Unfortunately, no
information was obtainable from the printer or publisher regarding
the printings of this book.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that Group III also represents a
pre-publication printing on the evidence of the presence of the
first state of gathering [22] in the "Wing" copy at Yale, III(a).
It is unreasonable to suppose that any of those sheets remained
unused or undestroyed during the interval of more than two months
between the March publication and the next 3,750 copies which were
brought out in June (Currie, <hi rend="italic">Bibliography,</hi> p. 63). I regret
that I have been unable to find any copies of this later printing
for comparison with those already examined; no doubt some
interesting and instructive variations would be found.</p>

<p>It may be of more general interest to conclude by listing a few
points which developed from the study of <hi rend="italic">Penrod</hi> and which
represent printing evidence too often overlooked or misinterpreted
by bibliographers of twentieth-century books. I hope to develop
these on a future occasion.</p>

<list>
<item>1. It is almost safe to assume that plates were made before
the first printing, but it is possible that some books were first
printed from standing type in small impressions until such time as
a demand for copies warranted the expense of plating.</item>

<item>2. It is well to determine if the type was set by monotype or
by linotype, and whether it was plated before printing
started.</item>

<item>3. If the type was plated, a dropped letter would indicate
(a) that it was dropped prior to plating, and (b) that the type was
probably set by monotype. A type set by linotype can appear to be
dropped only if the compositor has inadvertently hit the spacer, an
unusual accident.</item>

<pb n="005.157"/>

<item>4. Broken type does not, per se, denote a later state or
printing.<ref target="f005.11.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref></item>


<item>5. Broken type can be repaired and plates corrected to some
extent in press by morticing; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> by cutting out faulty
letters and soldering in new type. (Mr. Richmond of Doubleday Press
is of the opinion that in adding the 'l' on p. 344 the 'y' was also
morticed out to provide more working space, which would account for
the malformation of both letters in the later state.)</item>

<item>6. Damage to upper and lower page numbers and the headlines
tends to indicate handling of the plates between impositions, but
is not conclusive evidence.</item>

<item>7. However, ratchet batter to the margins of the plates, as
evidenced by distortion or bending of the type face, is fairly
definite proof of a new imposition. Such damage is the result of
carelessness in permitting the ratchet key to slip while locking
the plate to the bed.</item>

<item>8. In the case of bad damage, the press run on the sheet is
stopped until a new plate can be made, which may take anywhere from
a few hours to a few days before printing of that sheet can be
resumed.</item>

<item>9. Sheet bulk does not vary to any great extent within an
impression; however, any variation should be substantial before
considering it as an indication of a separate printing.</item>

<item>10. Variations in the blackness of the inking can occur
within the impression; one of the most difficult problems in book
printing is holding even color from forme to forme.</item>

<item>11. Variant sheets can become mixed during the folding before
any copies are bound, as the skids on which they are stacked are
not necessarily delivered to the folding machine in any
pre-arranged sequence. (During the war shortage when different
papers had to be used, serious problems developed in binding
together only gatherings of the same paper stock.)</item>

<name type="title">The Morgan Copy of Machlinia's
<hi rend="italic">Speculum
Christiani</hi></name>
<lb/><name type="author">Curt F. B&uuml;hler</name>
</head>

<p>As the result of a slight mishap in the printing house of
William de Machlinia in London, the copy of the <hi rend="italic">Speculum
Christiani</hi> [c. 1486; Duff 415, STC 26012] in the Pierpont
Morgan Library differs from the dozen other copies with whose
readings I am acquainted either by personal inspection or through
correspondence. These examples are the following: Cambridge,
University Library and Trinity College; Chatsworth, Duke of
Devonshire; London, British Museum (two copies) and Lambeth Palace;
Manchester, John Rylands; New York, Public Library and Mr. Carl H.
Pforzheimer; Oxford, Bodleian; San Marino, Henry E. Huntington; and
Washington, Folger. The Morgan example is distinguished from its
fellows by an interruption in the text which no method of folding
can obviate.
In short, on the verso of the third folio of this copy is found the
text which should appear on folio 5 verso and on the fourth folio
that which belongs to the sixth leaf; conversely, the verso of
folio 5 has the text properly found on the verso of the third leaf,
while on the sixth that portion occurs which is appropriate to leaf
4. This error in the printing, the incorrect "perfection" of a
sheet (if so contradictory a term be allowed), is reasonably
familiar to students of early printing; its most conspicuous
example among the earliest English books is that found in the
Devonshire-Huntington copy of the first printed book in English,
<hi rend="italic">The Recuyell of the Hystoryes of Troye</hi> by Raoul Le Fevre
[Bruges: Caxton, c. 1475; Blades, <hi rend="italic">Life and Typography of William
Caxton,</hi> II, 6].</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Speculum Christiani</hi> was printed as a quarto with
the
first (unsigned) quire consisting of eight leaves; it follows from
this that the opening quire consisted of two sheets of paper either
folded together or folded separately, with the folded second sheet
laid into the folded first. If the first procedure had been
followed, the "affected" pages of the Morgan copy would be spread
over two different formes, with [1]<hi rend="sub">3</hi><hi rend="super">v</hi> and [1]<hi rend="sub">6</hi>
being found
in the outer forme of the second sheet, and [1]<hi rend="sub">4</hi> and
[1]<hi rend="sub">5</hi><hi rend="super">v</hi>
in the inner forme of the first. However, in the second method of
folding all four pages would have been found in the same forme
(inner of the second sheet) and this is doubtless the method of
printing employed by Machlinia.</p>

<p>In that invaluable <hi rend="italic">Vade mecum</hi> which the editor of
<hi rend="italic">Studies in Bibliography</hi> has thoughtfully provided for his
grateful fellow-bibliographers (Bowers, <hi rend="italic">Principles of
Bibliographical Description,</hi> pp. 73-74), one finds this problem
discussed with the

<pb n="005.160"/>

writer's customary incisiveness; we learn that such an error arose
either as a mistake in machining or through faulty imposition.
Thus, the interruption in the text of the Morgan copy of the
<hi rend="italic">Speculum Christiani</hi> was due to the pressman who either
perfected the sheet by "turning it the wrong way" or who had
incorrectly imposed the type-pages, so that the already printed
pages would inevitably be "backed up" but not "perfectly
perfected."</p>

<p>Quite recently Mr. Paul S. Dunkin (<hi rend="italic">BSA</hi> XLV, 246-50)
has
reviewed this problem and has concluded that it was "unlikely that
a turned sheet or heap often, if indeed ever, caused wrong
perfecting in books printed on hand presses." His belief is founded
on the use made of the "points" or pins attached to the tympan,
whose function it was to achieve correct "register." For a short
explanation of this process, the reader is referred to Mr. Dunkin's
account.</p>

<p>Now it is obviously not impossible that the alternative
explanation for such misprinting, suggested by McKerrow and quoted
by Mr. Dunkin ("the second forme printed having been placed the
wrong way round on the bed of the press"), may well have prevailed
in the case of the Morgan sheet. Nevertheless, the fact that but a
single copy with this particular error has survived as against a
dozen correctly printed examples weighs rather heavily against this
theory, at least in the opinion of the present writer. If the
printer discovered the faulty imposition early in the course of
machining, he could obviously cancel or destroy all leaves already
perfected and thus completely eliminate the error from the entire
edition. If he did not observe the fault until a goodly number had
been printed and he needed the leaves to complete his edition, one
would expect to find a percentage of copies with this misprint
certainly far greater
than the one in thirteen which is our highest possible
estimate.</p>

<p>Though my knowledge of the eighteenth-century printing
techniques is not such as to permit me to disagree with Mr.
Dunkin's conclusion so far as it affects that period, I must
nevertheless affirm that the recommendations set forth in Moxon's
<hi rend="italic">Mechanick Exercises</hi> (1683) were apparently not at all
familiar to the earlier printers. According to one authority (BMC
I:xiv), as many as ten pinholes to each leaf have been found in the
42-line (Gutenberg) Bible; again, Konrad Haebler (<hi rend="italic">Handbuch der
Inkunabelkunde,</hi> p. 67) records the occurrence of from six to
eight such marks per sheet. At a very early date, the
fifteenth-century printers reduced this number to four, and not
much later to two, pinpoints. When four pinholes are present, these
are normally not found in the middle fold of the early folios but
in the four corners of the sheet, equidistant from the first (and
the last) character of the first and last lines.
In Ulrich Zell's early quartos, the pinholes are often found at the
upper edge of the leaves, exactly parallel to the indentation of
the text-page from the outer edge of the paper. In such positions,
the points would not prevent the printer from turning the sheet the
wrong way and still getting perfect register. This is certainly
what <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have happened in the present instance, assuming
that the points were in such a position as not to prevent correct
register when the sheet was turned the wrong way round. Just such
cases as this doubtless brought about the practice recommended by
Joseph Moxon, which would effectively eliminate misprintings of
this sort, or at least have caused such misprinting that the sheet
would have been quite useless for insertion in the book. If this be
the true answer (as I believe it to be) for the origin of the
faulty printing in the single case of the Morgan <hi rend="italic">Speculum
Christiani,</hi> I would further agree with Professor Bowers
that this condition represents a variant copy, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a variant
state, since it may well never have existed in more than this one
example.</p>

Plagiarism</name>

<div2 type="section"><head/>
<p>Some interesting problems arise for literary critic as well as
bibliographer when an early work appears so applicable to later
times that it is stolen, reprinted, and the real authorship of this
later edition is concealed for three hundred years. That this can
happen in the case of a very rare book is demonstrated by the
discovery that <hi rend="italic">The Melancholy Knight</hi> (1615) by Samuel
Rowlands, of which the only known copy is in the Bodleian
Library,<ref target="f005.13.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> was reprinted in 1654
under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Melancholy Cavalier</hi> by an author
using the initials "J. C." as one of the attacks on the royalist
party. Only two copies of this 1654 edition, printed for C. R., are
known: the Thomason copy in the British Museum, and the
Christie-Miller copy in the Arents Tobacco Collection of the New
York Public Library.<ref target="f005.13.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> The
appropriation in 1654 of Rowlands' work indicates that poetic
effusions of the
Jacobean period were unfamiliar to the readers of the ephemeral
productions of the Commonwealth versifiers. The appropriation was
pertinent since the subject of the poem was not dated in 1654. A
burlesque survey of a corrupt age was as timely in 1654 as in
1615.</p>



<p>Except for an eight-line introductory poem describing the new
woodcut of the cavalier smoking his pipe on the 1654 title-page, a
dedication to William Middleton, and the statement of authorship as
"by J. C.," the differences between Rowlands' <hi rend="italic">Melancholy
Knight</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Melancholy Cavalier</hi> are small. The
most
significant occur in the introductory lines <hi rend="italic">To the Reader</hi>
and in <hi rend="italic">The Argument</hi> where there have been nine revisions.
A
few of these are trifling literary tinkerings, a few designed to
insert contemporary allusions,<ref target="f005.13.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> and
some to adjust the description to the homely attire of the cavalier
from the foppish dress of Rowlands' knight.<ref target="f005.13.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> The poem proper was made to
order for
the pirate's purpose, and hence it is in the main an exact reprint
of Rowlands' verses, with only a few tidyings to alter <hi rend="italic">knight to
cavalier,</hi> as in 1654, "But what an Age is this brave Cavaliers
/ (I mean all you,
that Melancholy fears)" (p. 2), which in 1615 had read, "But what
an age is this my fellow Knights / I meane all you whom
<hi rend="italic">melancholy</hi> bites)". In addition there is the addition of a
contemporary touch or two, as changing 1615's battles of Newport
and Ostend to Edgehill and Colchester.</p>



<pb n="005.162"/>

<p>The identity of <hi rend="italic">J. C.</hi> who thus stole Rowlands' poem
in
1654 is the fascinating problem in <hi rend="italic">The Melancholy Cavalier</hi>.
There is the possibility, of course, that a stray copy of the
Rowlands pamphlet fell into the hands of a publisher, who employed
J. C. to touch up the poem for contemporary consumption. But it may
also seem possible that in the interval between 1615 and 1654 some
sheets of the 1615 edition had been in the hands of a printer,
deriving from John Beale, who had printed the <hi rend="italic">Knight,</hi><ref target="f005.13.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> and that this individual after
Beale's
death decided to turn a dishonest penny. I am inclined to
conjecture that the unknown J. C. could have been the printer John
Crouch, who wrote and published prolifically, mainly newssheets or
"mercuries," first on the side of the royalists and then for the
Commonwealth party. J. B. Williams refers to him as the author of
a large number of counterfeits.<ref target="f005.13.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref>
In 1650 his unlicensed press was finally swept away by the
government and he was imprisoned. The experience must have been
instructive, for after his release early in 1652 he changed sides
and began producing periodicals which attacked the royalist party
and were licensed by the government, chiefly "mercuries" written in
prose with some interspersed verse. Williams (p. 146, n. 1) felt
that "as a ballad writer Crouch possessed great skill and some of
his verse is charming." It was in 1654, according to my conjecture,
that in the midst of his journalistic activity he chose to issue
<hi rend="italic">The Melancholy Cavalier</hi> as an additional satire on the
adherents of the royalist cause, printed "for C. R."<ref target="f005.13.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref></p>




<p>No matter who J. C. may have been, his dedication is a
masterpiece of cool impudence since it was written with the
knowledge that he was offering what was in fact the work of
another.</p>

<p>The Epistle Dedicatorie, to all Cordiall Lovers of Art and
Ingenuity, more especially his much Honored Friend, Mr. William
Middleton.<ref target="f005.13.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref></p>

he might have been receptive to the dedication of a poem satirizing
the royal cause. Later, in spite of his views on politics and

<hi rend="italic">State of

<div2 type="section"><head/>
<p>Nine quarto editions of Dryden's <hi rend="italic">State of Innocence</hi>
were
printed before publication of the 1701 Folio of the <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi>
shortly after Dryden's death, brought to a close the early history
of the text with a tenth edition. Although the chronological order
of five of these editions is established by the title-page dates,
which there is no reason to suspect, the same is not true for the
remaining five, three of which bear the date 1684 and two the date
of 1695.</p>

<p>In Hugh Macdonald's <hi rend="italic">Bibliography</hi> of John Dryden the
order
of listing of these editions is presumably intended to be
chronological, although no statement is made concerning the
evidence on which the order is based. The Woodward and McManaway
<hi rend="italic">Check List of English Plays 1641-1700</hi> follows the
Macdonald
listing. However, textual collation of the nine quartos and of the
Folio makes evident that this commonly accepted sequence is not
correct, nor is the derivation of the various editions a simple
matter of successive reprints as has been generally, though
implicitly, believed. The following table summarizes what
investigation establishes as the true order of the printed quarto

<p>Obviously Dryden was concerned with the printing of the first
edition of the play: the prefatory essay "The Author's Apology for
Heroique Poetry and Poetique Licence" was written, he states,
partly to explain why he chose to publish an opera that was never
acted. Since textual collation shows no indication of fresh
authority having been added to any of the later editions, and
instead discloses only the usual steady deterioration of the text,
it is clear that Q1 is the only substantive printed text of the
play.</p>

<pb n="005.164"/>

<p>In brief, the derivation of the texts is as follows: Q2 was
printed from Q1, Q3 from Q2, and Q4 from Q3. Q4 is a terminal
edition from which no other derived. Although Q3 and Q4 were both
printed in 1684, the quartos are readily differentiated. Q3
collates A-G<hi rend="super">4</hi>, with advertisements on sig.
G4<hi rend="super">r-v</hi>. Q4 collates
A-E<hi rend="super">4</hi> F<hi rend="super">2</hi> G<hi rend="super">4</hi> (G1
missigned F1). [See below for the
differentiating points between Q4 and its piracy, Q9.] Q5 derives
from Q3, Q6 from Q5, and Q7 from Q6. The 1701 Folio was printed
from Q7. Q8 was printed from Q7. Since both Q7 and Q8 are dated
1695 and have the collation A-F<hi rend="super">4</hi> G<hi rend="super">2</hi> they
could be confused
unless one notices that in Q7 there is a semi-colon after
<hi rend="italic">Innocence</hi> in the running-title on
&dollar;2<hi rend="super">v</hi>4<hi rend="super">v</hi>(&mdash;G2<hi rend="super">v</hi>) and

a semi-colon after <hi rend="italic">and</hi> in the running-title on
C3<hi rend="super">v</hi>;
whereas in Q8 the semi-colon after <hi rend="italic">Innocence</hi> is found only
on C2<hi rend="super">v</hi>4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, and a comma appears after
<hi rend="italic">and</hi> on C3<hi rend="super">v</hi>.</p>

<p>The piracy Q9 imitates the title-page and the collation
A-E<hi rend="super">4</hi>
F<hi rend="super">2</hi> G<hi rend="super">4</hi> of Q4, but its text derives
immediately from Q8.
However, there is no difficulty in distinguishing it from Q4 since
Q9 uses running-titles in the headlines but Q4, instead, has only
page numbers within parentheses.</p>

<p>The total evidence on which this statement of derivation is
based is too extensive for presentation here but may be briefly
summarized.</p>

<p>The lack of significant variation in the text of Q2, and the
fact that its preface and the text for Act I is a page-for-page
reprint of Q1, establishes that Q2 derives from Q1 and not from an
independent manuscript. There are 22 substantive variants in Q2,
eight of which are corrections of obvious errors in its copy. Of
the remaining 14, 2 are simple misprints corrected in Q3, 3 are
obvious errors but were retained until Q5, and the rest appear,
with occasional modification, in all subsequent editions. Of these
the most serious was the omission of the second half of the line in
Act V (Q1, sig. G2<hi rend="super">r</hi>)

<q>Death you have seen: Now see your race revive, [.]<ref target="f005.14.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></q></p>


<p>In substantives, Q3 has 18 variants from Q2 in addition to the
Q2 variants from Q1 which it follows. In turn, all but three
obvious errors in the Q3 total of variants appear in Q4,
which&mdash;being carelessly printed&mdash;adds 49 unique substantive
variants of its own. With only one exception, which may just
possibly be coincidental, none of these unique variants appears in
any later edition, this fact establishing Q4 as a terminal
text.</p>

<p>Q5, accepting all but the most flagrant of the Q3 variants, adds
19 to the list, all of which appear in Q6 together with 27 new
readings. In turn, Q7, repeating all but four of the most obvious
Q6 errors, adds 18 new substantive readings, of which 16 appear in
Q8 together with 19 new variants.</p>

<p>Q9, the last of the early quartos, presents a most peculiar
case. Dated 1684 and having in its register of signatures and
title-page typography a definite relationship with Q4, also dated
1684, it nevertheless shows (except for four pages) a page-for-page
correspondence with Q8 printed in 1695. Superficially, the simplest
view would be that this edition (Macdonald 81c) was a corrupt
version of Q4 and that, eleven years later, it served as copy for
Q8. Such an assumption is impossible, however. In the first place,
Q4 (M 81d) could not have served as copy for any other edition
because

<pb n="005.165"/>

of its extraordinary number of unique and non-reversible readings
which prove it to be a terminal text. Secondly, Q8 (M 81h) could
not have derived from Q9 (M 81c) since Q9 with 38 unique readings,
over half of which are non-reversible, is also shown to be a
terminal text. Moreover, there is definite evidence that Q9
textually derives from Q8, a fact which re-enforces the otherwise
ambiguous evidence of its general page-for-page correspondence with
Q8. Of the 20 substantive variants which first appeared in Q8, 11
are simple errors which Q9 corrects; but Q9 follows the other 9
cases of Q8's hitherto unique variants and adds no less than 39 of
its own. Thus Q8 could not have derived from Q9; and instead Q8
must have served as copy for Q9. This can be demonstrated, also,
for sheet C and half-sheet F.</p>

<p>We have, then, the peculiar situation that Q9, printed in
imitation of Q4, and falsely dated, nevertheless did not choose Q4
as copy but instead was set up from the text of Q8. Whatever the
reasons for this oddity,<ref target="f005.14.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> the facts
rule out inadvertence, the more especially since Knight and
Saunders&mdash;listed in the Q9 imprint as sellers, in imitation of
Q4&mdash;were no longer in business together by 1695. Piracy is the
only answer, but the exact date cannot be determined except that it
was in 1695 or after.</p>


<p>There is one further peculiarity associated with Q9. Although
there can be no question that Q8 served as printer's copy, Q9
corrects six Q8 readings by reversion to the forms found in some
earlier edition. Since various of these in the Q8 forms were
plausible enough to have escaped suspicion, simple compositorial
ingenuity is insufficient to explain their revision, the more
especially since they appear in clusters.</p>

</p>
<p>If for the moment we disregard the variant on sig.
G1<hi rend="super">r</hi>, the
evidence points only to some edition between Q1 and Q4 being
collated to produce these revised readings. Since it is clear that
the printer had had access to Q4, it would seem a natural
assumption that Q8 for these pages had been collated against Q4.
This is probably the answer, although there are difficulties.
First, the return to a unique Q1 reading on line 5 of the adjacent
page would need to be fortuitous. It is true that in context the
change of <hi rend="italic">was</hi> to <hi rend="italic">is</hi> makes better sense;
nevertheless,
the <hi rend="italic">was</hi> reading had passed muster with the compositors of
Q2-8. Hence it might be possible to conjecture that Q1 was the
collating copy and that this collation extended over to the top of
sig. G1<hi rend="super">r</hi>. Second, it may seem suspicious that in no case
does Q9
follow a unique Q4 variant,<ref target="f005.14.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref>
although two such unique readings would have been present for Q9
sig. F1,
one for F1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, one for F2, and three for
F2<hi rend="super">v</hi>. The text for Q9's
sig. C1<hi rend="super">v</hi> could have contained no unique Q4 reading,
however.</p>


<pb n="005.166"/>

<p>Yet we may be the more prepared to accept as chance the
collator's invariable rejection of Q4's unique variants (which have
nothing much to recommend them at best), since the alternative is
the hypothesis that a copy of Q1 was used as the collating edition.
In fact, the collation of Q1 (making three editions in the
possession of the Q9 printer) could be advanced only if we assumed
that Q4, although available for consultation, was not available to
be kept on the premises.<ref target="f005.14.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> This
seems to invoke such special and peculiar circumstances that we are
better off with the simpler hypothesis that Q4, which served as the
specific model for the piracy, was also used for the small amount
of collation actually engaged in.</p>


<p>That any textual collation whatever with an earlier edition was
contemplated, and in fact performed even to a minor degree, is a
fact sufficiently astonishing in a late reprint and a piracy
without our conjecturing such extraordinary textual conscience in
the pirate as to secure a copy of Q1 for collation, when he was
also in the possession of Q4. In truth, the only plausible
explanation why this collation was ever engaged in was the
availability of Q4 in the shop as a model for the piracy.</p>

<div2 type="section"><head/>
<p>In "The Early Editions of Dryden's <hi rend="italic">State of Innocence"</hi>

appearing in the present volume, Dr. Marion H. Hamilton establishes
the very curious fact that Q9 (Macdonald 81c) was printed not in
1684 as stated on its title-page but instead in 1695 or later.
Moreover, although this misdated edition made an obvious effort to
imitate a printing peculiarity of Q4, dated 1684 (M 81d), as well
as its title-page, in fact it used Q8 of 1695 (M 81h) as its copy
although Q4 seems to have been collated for certain readings on
sigs. C1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, F1, and F1<hi rend="super">v</hi>. However odd
these facts are, as Dr.
Hamilton argues they point unmistakably to an act of piracy.</p>

<p>My purpose in this note is to examine the reasons why Q9 may
have drawn its text from Q8, though imitating the appearance of Q4;
but more especially to endeavor to explain the curious clustering
of variants, presumably drawn from Q4, only in two widely separated
sheets of Q9.</p>

<p>The story must begin with the peculiar collation of Q4 as
A-E<hi rend="super">4</hi> F<hi rend="super">2</hi> G<hi rend="super">4</hi>, with G1
missigned F1 although G2 is correctly
signed. Two possible explanations suggest themselves. When the
typesetting of an edition is divided between two or more
compositors and presses, the estimated division may prove to be
inaccurate. If there is too little material assigned him, the
compositor of the first section may be unable to space his setting
to join exactly with the already-printed first sheet of the second
section. In such a case, the first press will print its final
gathering in less than a full sheet. As opposed to this, if the
first press has been assigned more than its proper share of
material, it will need to print an extra leaf or leaves. Since Q4
is not a paginal reprint of its copy, Q3, some such confusion might
have developed. If so, the signing of G1 as F1 would point rather
to extra than to insufficient material

<pb n="005.167"/>

given to the first compositor (if the outer forme were first on the
press), since it would seem that half-sheet F was an
afterthought.</p>

<p>This explanation, though possible, is not very satisfactory. If
the point of division was originally assigned as between gatherings
E and F, the play would have been so nearly typeset as to preclude
any such plan ordered from the beginning. Normally a play to be
printed simultaneously in two sections is divided close to the
halfway mark.<ref target="f005.15.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> Hence it would be
necessary to conjecture that with Q4 a second press was ordered
into action to print only the final sheet and thus to speed
publication. If so, however, one might expect some evidence of a
different compositor and press. Although the lack of running-titles
prevents definite determination, there is nothing either in the
length of the printer's measure or in the general typographical
layout to lead one to suspect the presence of a second compositor
and press. Moreover, if the missigning of G1 as F1 indicates an
original plan to compress the Q3 makeup, the correct signing on
G2 shows that the proper position of the sheet was known by the
time the inner forme was sent to press. In other words, by the time
the second, or inner, forme of G was machined, the compositor of
the first section would have found that he could not include all of
his material in sheet E.</p>


<p>This reconstruction is not impossible, but it does not carry
conviction, largely because such a major error in casting off
printed copy so near the end of the book would be highly unusual.
The second explanation, for which I am indebted to a suggestion
made by Dr. Giles E. Dawson, is therefore to be preferred.
According to this hypothesis, only one compositor and press were
concerned with the entire printing of this edition, but when the
time came to make up the formes for sheet F, four pages of text
were inadvertently passed over. Accordingly, the final eight pages
of type were imposed, outer forme first, and this outer forme was
sent to the press, signed F. Sometime during the printing of this
forme the error was discovered, and thereupon the forme was
perfected, correctly signed G2 on the second leaf. To repair the
mistake, half-sheet F was imposed and printed with the omitted four
pages. Although I have not seen a close analogy for such an error
in imposition,
this explanation conforms most closely to the evidence of the
quarto and is very likely correct.</p>

<p>When we examine Q9, we see that the printer chose to disguise a
piracy by imitating the makeup of Q4, an out-of-date edition and
one containing a particularly noticeable aberrancy in its
half-sheet F. The choice of Q4 to pirate, rather than Q8, was
doubtless dictated in part because copies would not be common to
provoke comparison, in part because the stationers named in its
imprint were by 1695 with one exception inactive, and in part
because reproduction of the Q4 abnormal makeup would be supposed
sufficient to allay suspicions. These considerations would not
operate if an attempt were made to pirate the most recent edition,
available in quantity, and readily to be compared against an
imitation.</p>

<p>This may be sufficient to explain why the form of Q4, and not
that of Q8, was pirated, but it fails to account for the odd fact
that Q8 was used as printer's copy instead of the natural candidate
Q4. One possible answer could appeal to the common custom of
utilizing the last printed edition as copy for the next, a custom
which seems to have had as a basis not only its obvious convenience
but also, perhaps, some feeling that a late edition was textually
superior to its predecessors. With our knowledge of the
degeneration of texts in the course of reprinting, this
attitude&mdash;if indeed

<pb n="005.168"/>

it were held&mdash;would seem to have been singularly naive. Yet from
one point of view, at least, and this could have operated very
powerfully on a printer's thinking, a late edition was indeed
superior in that it offered for copy a modernized form of the
texture to an age critical of old-fashioned ways. Moreover, a very
practical reason could be present. If a printer is to make a
line-for-line and page-for-page reprint, clearly it is more
convenient in setting lines which will require a minimum of
justification to choose as copy a text which in its accidentals
will be nearest in modernity to those of the compositor setting the
new edition.</p>

<p>If this explanation is valid, we should have the reason why the
pirating printer of Q9 chose to set up what is substantially a
page-for-page reprint of Q8, disguising it by imitating the
title-page of Q4, and the Q4 aberrant half-sheet F, instead of
utilizing Q4 as his copy.<ref target="f005.15.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>


<p>The chief problem in Q9 is the necessity to explain the
particular pages on which variants appear, indicating collation
with some earlier edition, very probably Q4. Here the
bibliographical evidence of the running-titles is important. In the
first place, only one skeleton-forme was used to print the entire
edition, this skeleton imposing the type-pages for both the inner
and outer formes of every sheet. This evidence shows that the Q9
edition-sheet was a small one, in which presswork would normally be
faster than compositorial speed.<ref target="f005.15.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref>
Secondly, the printer made sure of following his Q4 model by
completing first a paginal typesetting of sigs. F1-2<hi rend="super">v</hi> from
Q8
and then sending these four pages to the press as F<hi rend="super">2</hi>
printed by
half-sheet imposition. Then he started the normal text by imposing
and machining the inner forme of sheet C.
This order can be demonstrated by the lucky chance that a variant
typesetting of one running-title appears only on C3<hi rend="super">v</hi> and
F1<hi rend="super">r</hi>,
thus establishing that the same state of the skeleton-forme printed
inner C and half-sheet F, one following the other. However, when
this same skeleton imposed the outer forme of C and all subsequent
formes, the running-title on C3<hi rend="super">v</hi> had presumably pied and
was
reset. This evidence shows, moreover, that half-sheet F was printed
before inner C, since otherwise we should need to assume that inner
C was run off but before perfecting it the printer set and machined
half-sheet F.</p>


<p>The importance of this reconstruction lies in the fact that,
with two possible exceptions, the Q9 divergences from Q8 copy to
restore earlier readings are confined exclusively to half-sheet F
and to the inner forme of sheet C, which can be shown to have been
printed one following the other. Such a remarkable coincidence of
bibliographical and textual evidence cannot be fortuitous.<ref target="f005.15.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref></p>


<pb n="005.169"/>

<p>Two alternative explanations may be advanced for this
peculiarity. The first and the simplest is that proof was read
against Q4, Q8 being in the compositor's hands, and that these
variants are therefore proof-reader's markings. The second is that
the compositor hastily and incompletely collated the Q8 text
against some early edition, probably Q4, before typesetting, and
made notes in his Q8 copy of the variants he happened to observe or
thought to be sufficiently significant to warrant alteration. A
choice between these can only be speculative. Against the
hypothesis for a proofreader is the fact that in general proof does
not seem to have been read on reprints, and certainly not against
copy. This last is unusual enough even for first editions. Against
the compositor is the unusual care and initiative the process would
evince. But since these variants manifestly were made by collation
in some fashion against an early edition, more than usual care is
shown,
at least at the start of the printing.</p>

<p>This last fact is of interest, for the demonstrable variants
cease after the printing of half-sheet F and inner forme C
(specifically, C1<hi rend="super">v</hi>). The evidence may suggest, therefore,
that
the compositor was the collator, that he was setting by
formes,<ref target="f005.15.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> and that he stopped
probably after collating C1<hi rend="super">v</hi>. The reason is not far to seek,
I
think. Since the edition was small, as evidenced by the use of only
one skeleton-forme, typesetting was almost certainly slower than
presswork once distribution had to be started, and hence it soon
became clear that the luxury of collation could not be managed
without delaying the press inordinately. It was, therefore,
discontinued, and the remainder of the play was set directly from
uncollated Q8 copy in the most expeditious manner.</p>

managed, albeit with delay, before printing the formes. If there is

isolation on C1<hi rend="super">v</hi> of these revisions, the compositor was
probably
casting off copy and setting by formes, which in this case would
mean no more for him than making a paginal reprint of the inner

<div2 type="section"><head/>
<p>The first edition of Thomas D'Urfey's comedy, <hi rend="italic">The Richmond

Heiress: Or, A Woman Once in the Right,</hi> presents a number of
interesting bibliographical problems. It was first published in
1693, evidently from a manuscript which had served as a prompt copy
or, rather more likely, which had been marked to serve as the basis
for a transcribed prompt book. An actor's name appears sporadically
in place of the character he portrayed; more important, warnings to
the actors about to enter the scene have crept into the text in two
places.<ref target="f005.16.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> The quarto collates
A-I<hi rend="super">4</hi>, pp. [<hi rend="italic">8</hi>] 1-32

<pb n="005.170"/>

29-36 41-64 (all pp. in parentheses except for 57-64 in square
brackets). The book appears to be very carelessly printed, very
likely in considerable haste.</p>


<p>This edition exists in two distinct issues, the second of which,
as we shall see later, is a reimpression except for two sheets.</p>

<p>The first issue, distinguished as (i), exists with the outer
forme of sheet A, including the title-page, in two variant states.
In the earliest pulls of this forme (i&tgr;) the title-page reads as
follows:

<q>THE | Richmond Heire&longs;s: | OR, A | <hi rend="italic">Woman Once in the

(123057).</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Copy reported:</hi> British Museum
(644.h.23).</l></q></p>

<p>Comparatively early in the printing (on the evidence of the few
copies preserved of this early state) the press was stopped. On the
title-page the misprint 'ROAYL' was corrected to 'ROYAL', and the
line attributing the authorship to D'Urfey was revised to read

<q><l>| Written by Mr. <hi rend="italic">D'URFEY</hi>. |</l></q>

This produces state (i*), performed by press-correction with the
remainder of the type of the title left undisturbed.</p>

<p>The alteration of the line containing the author's name has an
interesting background. In 1691 D'Urfey had been scathingly
attacked in the epistle dedicatory of the anonymous pamphlet <hi rend="italic">Wit
for Money,</hi> in which he was referred to as, <hi rend="italic">"a certain Poet,
who before the Poll Acts, used to write himself</hi> T. D.
<hi rend="italic">Gentleman. . . ."</hi> The original form of the
<hi rend="italic">Heiress</hi>
title-page seems to have been the work of the printer, therefore,
and the change made by the author himself. This view is
substantiated by important textual changes made elsewhere in the
outer forme of this sheet at the same time as the revision of the
title-page. On sig. A2<hi rend="super">v</hi> <hi rend="italic">'The Scene</hi>
Richmond-<hi rend="italic">Hill.'</hi>
was added beneath the dramatis personae. On A4<hi rend="super">v</hi> a
necessary
correction was made in the text in stanza 3 of 'SHINKEN's <hi rend="italic">Song
to the Harp'</hi> by the alteration of 'Highfoot' to 'light-foot'.
On the same page in <hi rend="italic">'SONG</hi>. In the Last ACT'
the word 'Philosophers' was altered to 'Philosophey' in the last
line of stanza 3; in the third line of stanza 6 'A Health' became
'Success'; and simultaneously an entire new stanza, a seventh, was
added to this song. These are clearly authorial revisions.</p>

<q>Issue (i*)</q>

<q><hi rend="italic">Copies examined:</hi> Folger (10.21.43), Folger (8.30.46),
Chicago, Columbia, Library of Congress, Illinois (822.08 / P699),
Newberry, Pennsylvania.</q>

<q><hi rend="italic">Copies reported:</hi> Bodleian (Mal. 47[6]), Worcester

<p>During the course of impression in this first issue, one small
press-correction was made in sheet E, when on sig. E2 in the last
line 'I must needs, nay,' was altered to 'I must needs say,'.
However, both formes of sheet H were heavily press-corrected on
every page. A total of ten variants appear in the inner forme, the
most convenient identification being in line 12 of H1<hi rend="super">v</hi>
where the
stage-direction '[<hi rend="italic">to</hi> Doggett.' of the early pulls was
altered in the corrected state of the forme to '[to
<hi rend="italic">Quickwit.'</hi>. Most of

<pb n="005.171"/>

these variants represent correction of egregious compositorial
misreadings and lapses, but several represent literary revision. In
the outer forme of H appear twelve similar corrections. In addition
to these the warning to the actors, '[<hi rend="italic">Sir</hi> Charles.T.Romance,
Shink.Guiac.<hi rend="italic">Constable.'</hi> at line 5 of H1 in the uncorrected
state is eliminated in the corrected. The two stage directions on
H1 (lines 24-25 and 29-31) are reset, the first being made less
crowded, and the second indented from the left margin, this last
producing consequential changes in the lineation. In all the copies
observed, both formes of sheet H were either in their uncorrected
or else in their corrected states; in no case was an uncorrected
forme backed by a corrected, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>.</p>

<p>It is an equally curious fact that owing to the distribution of
the sheets in the binding process, every observed copy of issue
(i&tgr;) with uncorrected sheet A (containing the 'ROAYL' title) is
bound with uncorrected sheets E and H. Moreover, every observed
copy of issue (i*) with corrected sheet A ('ROYAL' title) was bound
either with uncorrected sheet E but corrected sheet H,<ref target="f005.16.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> or else with corrected sheet E and
uncorrected sheet H.<ref target="f005.16.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> No observed
copy of (i*) contained both E and H uncorrected or both
corrected.</p>

<p>Before passing on to the second issue (reimpression) and its
variants, I should say something of the printing of issue (i),
since certain facts in relation to this have a bearing on the
interpretation of the peculiarities of issue (ii). The evidence is,
unfortunately, somewhat contradictory and at first sight not
susceptible to an exact bibliographical solution.</p>

<p>For example, if we took only the evidence of spelling tests to
determine compositors, we should divide the book into sheets B-E
set by compositor X, and sheets F-H set by compositor Y. What
evidence there is would assign sheet A to workman X. As for sheet
I, it is quite anomalous since it contains some characteristics of
both X and Y. A marked compositorial break seems to occur beginning
with sheet F.

<pb n="005.172"/>

This table seems to point to only one compositor of sheets B-E, a
workman of regular characteristics. Correspondingly, at least for
sheets F-H, another compositor seems to be present, one of mixed
characteristics but nevertheless in the majority of cases
differentiating himself from the first workman.</p>

<p>On the basis of four appearances of the spelling 'intrigue' (and
forms) in the dramatis personae, there are grounds for assigning
sheet A to compositor X. Sheet I is troublesome. The compositor
shares with X the invariable spelling 'I'll', the invariable
spelling 'intrigue' (once on I2<hi rend="super">v</hi> 'intriegue'), and the
spelling
of 'Quickwit' and 'Marmalet' with single final consonant. On the
other hand, he doubles the last consonant in 'Hotspurr' like Y;
also like Y he does not place an apostrophe before 'Gad' and he
employs the invariable spelling 'Shinkin'. A breakdown of the
occurrences of these variants by pages does not encourage a
hypothesis that X and Y alternated. Although X could have set
I1<hi rend="super">r</hi>, and Y could have set
I1<hi rend="super">v</hi>-2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, on I3-4<hi rend="super">r</hi> there
is the
clash between Y's 'Gad' without apostrophe, one to each page, and
X's spellings of 'Quickwit', 'Marmalet', and 'intrigue'. Possibly
another compositor, Z, is present, a workman of mixed
characteristics in following copy.</p>

<p>It should also be noticed that the compositor of sheet F, though
in most respects associated with the characteristics of compositor
Y, especially in such important invariables as 'Shinkin',
'intreague', and 'Gad' without apostrophe, yet is heavy on the
'Hotspur' spelling, once uses (on sig. F1<hi rend="super">r</hi>) a roman scene
number, once the 'Marmalet' spelling, and is unique in setting
parentheses about stage directions instead of the square brackets
invariably used elsewhere in both sections. The odds are that he is
Y, but some doubt may exist.</p>

<p>The evidence for a sharp break in compositorial characteristics
occurring between sheets E and F strongly suggests the hypothesis
that this book, like so many Restoration play quartos, was divided
approximately in half between two compositors and presses and the
two sections simultaneously typeset and printed. Moreover, this
evidence is buttressed by the significant fact, commented on below,
that in the reimpression which constitutes issue (ii) both sheets
B and F (the start of the two sections of text) show no signs of
reimpression and are definitely sheets from the same run as issue
(i). This further serves to differentiate the two sections of the
book, and may be taken as confirming the general hypothesis for
simultaneous printing in two major sections. Yet it is by no means
certain that only two compositors and presses were involved. Sheet
I, for example, with its unique headline square brackets and its
mixed spelling characteristics seems to be associated with
a different compositor and press, brought in to help finish the
book as quickly as possible. In the second section the two
preceding sheets G and H definitely are the product of only one
workman, on the evidence of the spelling but more important on the
evidence of their similar type-page measurement of 48 ll. 194-5
(205-6) x 122 mm. But sheet F, already mentioned as slightly
irregular in spelling, not only has smaller page numbers in the
headlines than those in sheets G and H but also was set to fit a
quite different skeleton-forme, its average type-page measurement
being 46 ll. 188(198) x 126. Moreover, 20 lines of its type
measures about 82 mm., whereas the type measurement for sheets G
and H is about 81 mm. Thus sheets G-H would seem to have been set
by a different compositor from that of F (which on the whole is
difficult to believe), or else there was a delay in the printing
after the composition and machining of sheet F.</p>

<p>In the first section there seems to be a similar break. Sheets
B and C have the same small numbers in the headline, approximately
the same type-page measurements, and seem to have been set with the
same printer's measure of 119-120 mm. and in the

<pb n="005.173"/>

same font of type. Yet sheets D and E change to larger figures in
the headlines, and are set to fill a different skeleton-forme,
since their measure changes to 126 mm.; moreover, though sheet E
has apparently the same font of type as B-C, about 81 mm., that in
sheet D is an 82 mm. type. Since the spelling tests make it almost
impossible to conjecture more than one compositor, clearly this is
an anomaly. Possibly a delay between C and D can be posited here,
as could be conjectured between F and G; but if so, it is a little
more difficult to explain why all the observed copies of issue (ii)
contain sheet C re-impressed.</p>

<p>Issue (ii), with the exception of sheets B and F, was printed
from the standing type of issue (i) re-imposed and in parts
revised. The title-page now reads:

<q>THE | Richmond Heire&longs;s: | OR, A | <hi rend="italic">Woman Once in the
Right</hi>. | A COMEDY, | ACTED | At the THEATRE ROYAL, |
By Their
Majesties Servants. | [rule] | Written by Mr. <hi rend="italic">D'URFEY</hi>. |
[rule] | <hi rend="italic">LONDON</hi>, | Printed for Samuel
<hi rend="italic">Bri&longs;coe</hi>,
over-again&longs;t <hi rend="italic">Will</hi>'s Coffee-Hou&longs;e | in
<hi rend="italic">Covent-Garden</hi>. 1693. <hi rend="italic">stet Will</hi>'s</q>

This is the same form as in issue (i&tgr;), and represents the
standing type of this issue, although there have been a few
typographical alterations. The letter 'R' in 'Richmond' has been
changed from one with a straight tail to a sort with a curved tail.
The lower rule, broken in (i), has been replaced and the two rules
moved nearer each other. In (i) the rules are 25 mm. apart, but in
(ii) only 18 mm. The roman 'l' in <hi rend="italic">'Wi</hi>l<hi rend="italic">l</hi>'s' of
issue
(i) has been replaced with an italic type. On A4<hi rend="super">v</hi> the
spelling
<hi rend="italic">Philosophey</hi> in the third stanza of the song in the last act
has been altered to <hi rend="italic">Philosophy</hi>. In the other sheets changes
in the alignment of the page numbers in the headline in relation to
the text, or alterations in the font used to set the paginal
headlines, demonstrates that the type-pages have been stored and
reimposed for a second impression. There is no question, however,
that sheets B and F in both issues come from a single impression,
since there is no alteration in the headlines or in the text.
Moreover, the outline of a hair on the face of the type across
lines 16-18 of sig. B1<hi rend="super">v</hi> is present in both issues,
presumably an
impossibility if the type-page had been rinsed and stored between
impressions.</p>

<p>Before the impression a few, mostly minor, corrections were made
in the standing type. For instance, on C2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, line 25, 'hear
you
are' in (i) was altered properly to 'here you are' in (ii). That
these were the sole responsibility of the printing house is shown
by the miscorrection that followed on C3<hi rend="super">r</hi>, line 7, of 'She
hear!' to 'She here!' through a misunderstanding of the context.
Some few of the differences result from type dropping out, as the
disappearance of the <hi rend="italic">u</hi> between impressions in the
speech-heading on G2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, line 20, from
<hi rend="italic">'Quick.'</hi> in (i) to
<hi rend="italic">'Qick.'</hi> in (ii). Viewed as a whole, the alterations made in
standing type do not suggest authorial intervention. Of the text,
such variants appear only on C2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, C3,
G2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, G3, H2, H3<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
I4<hi rend="super">v</hi>. Grouped thus as formes, it is likely that the slight
changes were made just before printing the second impression.</p>

<p>More important changes appear, however, in the second
impression, since a certain amount of resetting is found. Thus the
whole of sigs. D1<hi rend="super">v</hi> and D2 appear in a new typesetting,
as well
as the whole of G4<hi rend="super">v</hi> and the last 15 lines of G1. The
variant
settings may be identified as follows: D1<hi rend="super">v</hi>, line 8, 'four'
with
a comma in (i) but no comma in (ii); D2, line 26, 'surprized' in
(i) but 'surpriz'd' in (ii); G1, line 34, 'disturb' in (i) but
'desturb' in (ii); G4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, line 1, ends with 'Heiress' in (i) but

'Heiress agen' in all but one copy of (ii). The text in these reset
portions shows normal compositorial corruption and there is no
evidence that any variant has authority.</p>

<pb n="005.174"/>

<p>Within sheets D and G these reset portions are confined to a
forme from each sheet. Although it may be that they resulted from
accidental pieing in handling the type, another suggestion is
possible and will be offered later.</p>

<q>Issue (ii), normal form</q>

<q><hi rend="italic">Copies examined:</hi> William A. Clark, Folger (9.3.46),
Folger (cs 368), Illinois (uncatalogued, 24 Je 47 Spencer),
Princeton, Texas (Aitken).</q>

Victoria and Albert Museum.</q>

<p>The second issue exists in several variant states. Among the
copies examined, Huntington (123058) is unique in possessing an
added leaf (bound between A3 and A4) which is paged 61 and 62 and
contains a song "The Country Gentlemen" on recto and verso.<ref target="f005.16.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> The pagination is enclosed in
square
brackets, similar to the practise in sheet I of the text. This
addition is accompanied in the Huntington copy by two cancellations
made to include revisions to the text. <hi rend="italic">The Gentleman's
Journal</hi> for November, 1693, noticed: "Mr. <hi rend="italic">Durfey's
Richmond</hi> Heiress has been Revis'd, and Acted several times,
with Alterations and Amendments." The revisions on cancel leaves G3
and I1 would appear to reflect these later changes, at least in
part.</p>


<p>In IV.iii on G3<hi rend="super">r</hi> the changes take away comment on
Tom
Romance's intrigue with Mrs. Stockjobb in order to emphasize the
romance with Sophronia which figures so prominently at the end of
the play. Various additional disparaging remarks about Tom's father
seem to heighten Tom's role as a profligate and so justify the more
his final undoing later. In order to insert this new material,
G3<hi rend="super">r</hi> was reset in smaller type, with 55 lines to the page
as
against 48 in the cancellandum, and some of the revision was
carried over onto the verso, which is set in type similar to that
of the original leaf. Parentheses are used about the headline page
numbers in the cancellans.</p>

<p>On sig. I1 the action of V.iv had originally continued with a
farcical episode involving Numps. In cancellans I1 this action is
excised completely and, instead, Scene Ultima begins at the head of
the cancellans leaf recto with an interview between Sophronia and
Tom Romance (lacking in the original version) before the entrance
of Sir Charles, Guiacum, and Hotspur. Originally, their entrance,
with that of Romance, had begun the first version of the final
scene on cancellandum I1<hi rend="super">v</hi>. Parentheses are used about the
headline pagination of the cancellans.</p>

<p>From the similarity of paper and the fact that the chain-lines
match up, it seems reasonably certain that the added song bound in
the Huntington copy's preliminaries and cancellans leaf I1 were
printed together by half-sheet imposition and then cut apart for
insertion. On the other hand, the paper of cancellans leaf G3 seems
to differ slightly, and it may be that this represents a separate
printing.<ref target="f005.16.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref></p>


<p>The Wrenn copy at the University of Texas also contains variants
not found elsewhere. This copy is peculiar in that the
title-gathering, sheet A, in the second state of the first
impression (i *) is bound up with sheets B-I of issue (ii).
Presumably

<pb n="005.175"/>

there were a few extra copies of this sheet and it was economically
held over to assist in making up the second issue. Sheet G contains
on sig. G1 a pagination variant, the leaf being numbered 37 and 38
instead of the 41-42 found in all other copies of both impressions.
Apparently when the formes were being readied for the second
impression the printer noticed the gap between page 36 on sig.
F4<hi rend="super">v</hi> and 41 on G1<hi rend="super">r</hi> and essayed to bridge
it to indicate to the
purchaser that no material was missing. Since there are no other
variants on this leaf it is impossible to demonstrate whether this
change was in fact made late in the run of the first forme through
the press, or early as I have assumed. Whichever it was, there is
some interest in the consequential change made in the opposite
forme to coincide (on this slight evidence) only with the same
sheets of the first forme printed with the variant pagination.</p>

<p>Finally, there is still another variant state in the copy of
issue (ii) preserved in the Ohio State University library. This is
found in a rearrangement of the type in the first three lines of
sig. G4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, one of the reset pages in issue (ii). In the
impression represented by issue (i) these lines had read "time to
tell ye, that if you follow me quickly, you may recover the Heiress
/ agen. [<hi rend="italic">Speaks as out of breath</hi>. / Sir <hi rend="italic">Char</hi>.
Hah,
&mdash; what say'st thou?" In all of the regular copies of issue (ii)
in the resetting these three lines were condensed to two, reading,
"time to tell ye, that if you follow me quickly, you may recover
the Heiress agen. / Sir <hi rend="italic">Char</hi>. Hah, &mdash; what say'st
thou?
[<hi rend="italic">Speak</hi> [sic] <hi rend="italic">as out of Breath."</hi> In the Ohio
State
copy, however, although the type is that of issue (ii) the lines
are arranged as three and the stage-direction reads <hi rend="italic">"Speaks"</hi>
as in issue (i). The position of the direction in issue (ii) is
clearly wrong,
since the first speaker (Cunnington) has just said "I have only now
Breath and / time to tell ye . . ." and therefore the
stage-direction must apply to him and not to Sir Charles. It is
obvious, therefore, that the Ohio State copy represents the first
state of the type on G4<hi rend="super">v</hi> in the second impression, which
reprinted that of the first impression, and that the type for these
lines was not rearranged for revision (in the state represented by
other copies of the second issue) but instead for some purely
mechanical reason. It is most plausible to guess that the lines
were reduced from three to two the better to accommodate the
type-page in the opening of the skeletonforme, and in the process
it was necessary to place the direction after a different line even
though in error.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Variants in Issue (ii)</hi> [all copies examined]:

<list>
<item>1) CSmH (123058): added leaf with new song; G3 and I1
cancellans leaves.</item>

<item>2) TxU (Wrenn): G1 paged 37-38 (earliest state?). Sheet A(i
*) bound with sheets B-I of issue (ii).</item>

<item>3) OU: G4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, earliest and most correct state of
first three
lines on G4<hi rend="super">v</hi>.</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>Any use of standing-type, especially in connection with partial
resetting, calls for explanation; and for <hi rend="italic">The Richmond
Heiress</hi> this is the more necessary bibliographically because of
the peculiarities which are apparent in the printing of the first
impression and which have a connection with peculiarities, such as
the first-impression sheets B and F, in the second impression. The
following hypothesis is offered in full consciousness that there
still remain a few details of the printing process which seem
difficult to pinpoint exactly.</p>

<p>The date of the first performance for the <hi rend="italic">Heiress</hi> is not
quite certain. Nicoll assigns it to <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> February, 1693;
Summers and Harbage to <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> March; and Day to
<hi rend="italic">c.</hi> April.
The later date seems much to be preferred, on two counts. First,
the play was advertised in <hi rend="italic">The Gentleman's Journal</hi> for
April, 1693 (p. 130). Second, in a letter from Dryden to Walsh
dated May 9, 1693, Dryden wrote:

<pb n="005.176"/>

<q>Durfey has brought another farce upon the Stage: but his luck
has left him: it was sufferd but foure dayes; and then kickd off
for ever. Yet his second Act, was wonderfully diverting; where the
scene was in Bedlam. . . . The rest was woefull stuff, &amp;
concluded with Catcalls. . . .</q>

Since D'Urfey's dedication in the quarto (in which he speaks of the
play's failure) is dated May 6, it is very likely that the play was
first produced in late April or the first few days of May. In spite
of Dryden's prognostication that the farce was "kickd off for
ever," the <hi rend="italic">Heiress</hi> was revived the following November and
apparently then with some success. As previously noticed, <hi rend="italic">The
Gentleman's Journal</hi> for November, 1693 (p. 374), writes that
the play "has been Revis'd, and Acted several times, with
Alterations and Amendments."<ref target="f005.16.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref></p>


<p>It seems clear from the way in which many Restoration play
quartos were hurriedly printed in two or more sections
simultaneously that the first appearance in print ordinarily
coincided closely with the date of initial performance, and there
is some reason to suspect that authors liked to have copies
available for the third, or author's, night of the play. Thus
Briscoe, it is almost certain, would have started to print the play
shortly before its first night. On the evidence detailed above that
sheets B and F were simultaneously printed on two presses, we may
suppose that they represent sheets run off in anticipation of an
edition of normal size for a successful play. Only on this
assumption can we explain the fact that enough copies of these
sheets were machined to serve for the second impression without
reprinting. It seems legitimate to assume, further, on the basis of
the evidence that when the catcalls of the first-night
reception<ref target="f005.16.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> demonstrated
that the play was doomed to failure, Briscoe reduced the size of
his edition-sheet beginning with sheets C and G and put out his
first issue in a relatively limited quantity.</p>


<p>However, failure on the stage, it would be possible to argue,
need not necessarily mean failure with the reading public.
Moreover, D'Urfey was a successful dramatist and may have laid
almost immediate plans for revisions in the hope of a revival after
the turmoil had subsided. Thus it seems that Briscoe decided, or
was persuaded, to keep the type standing in anticipation of a
possible further demand in the future which would justify the
inconvenience in view of the money to be saved if a second edition
were called for. Here the resetting of two pages in sheet D and of
one page and a portion of another in sheet G assumes a new
significance, for the position of this resetting argues for
deliberate and mechanical distribution of the original type after
the first impression rather than an accident to type-pages in
storage. If this is so, sheet D (the third of the first section)
and sheet G (the second of the second section) were probably run
off very close to each other in point of
time and had begun to be distributed before Briscoe decided to keep
any of his type standing for a possible later impression.</p>

<p>The date of the second re-impressed issue is uncertain but may
be placed either before the November revival as a consequence of a
reading demand for the play or else, more probably, in close
connection with the revival itself, probably coincidental with it.
That Briscoe was not aware of the changed text which marked the
revival is shown by the fact that no authorial changes were made in
his standing type. Presumably after the later relative success of
the play, a few remaining copies were

<pb n="005.177"/>

brought up to date by the cancellation of leaves G3 and I1 to
provide some portion of D'Urfey's revisions, as well as the
addition of a new song, as represented, among the copies examined
or reported for this study only in the unique Huntington exemplum.
If this hypothesis is reasonably accurate, it would seem, then,
that Briscoe kept his type standing from early May to November.</p>

<p>The main outlines of this reconstruction do not seem to be
controversial and they may roughly represent the facts in all
probability. The problems raised by the anomalous evidence for the
printing of the first impression may now be surveyed with somewhat
more speculation. It will be recalled that a spelling test shows
little doubt that sheets B-E (and probably A) were set by one
compositor, this comprising the first section of the book. In the
second section sheet G and H were clearly set by the same workman;
but sheet F, although in general showing his characteristics, is
not quite so uniform, and sheet I is rather mixed. Within each
section bibliographical evidence suggests some lack of continuity
in typesetting and also in printing. Thus whereas sheets B and C
employ the same font of type and the same printer's measure, and
utilize the same font for the pagination in the headline, sheets D
and E coincide in a different font for the pagination, and in a
different printer's
measure (126-127 mm. as against 119-120 mm. for B-C), and differ
only in the font for the text, which is slightly larger in sheet D
than that employed in sheets B, C, and E. Correspondingly, sheet F
in the second section is unique in its treatment of setting off
stage-directions by parentheses instead of square brackets, in the
small size of its headline pagination, in the longer printer's
measure (125-126 mm. versus 122-123 for G-H, and 121-122 for I) and
in the slightly larger size of the font used for the text. Sheet I
differs in its use of square brackets instead of parentheses about
the headline pagination; and though its font seems to be the same
as that in sheets G and H, its measure is slightly narrower.</p>

<p>When we put all these facts together we may conjecture that in
the original impression sheet F was started somewhat later than
sheet B. The break that exists between sheets C and D, and between
F and G, suggests that when Briscoe was apprised of the play's
failure sheet F was on the press at the same time as either the
last of sheet B or the early pulls of the first forme of sheet C.
At any rate, the compositor of the first section was far enough in
advance of the second-section workman to have completed his setting
of sheet C, but the second compositor had not, for some reason,
begun to set G. Thus the simultaneous break in the typesetting
after C and F may further suggest that for a short time Briscoe
suspended work on the play, possibly with a view to cutting his
losses at that point by giving up publication. He then, seemingly,
changed his mind, and began again by machining sheet C in a reduced
edition-sheet (from the type already set) and starting fresh
composition
with sheets D and G.<ref target="f005.16.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> If this is
so, the irregular sheet I is explicable as the work of a third
compositor and press, since the first press would be working on
sheet A when the second was engaged with sheet H, and to complete
the play most expeditiously some extra assistance was required in
the second section.</p>


<p>The only irregularity remaining is the shift in sheet E back to
the font of type used in sheets B and C instead of the slightly
larger font employed for sheet D when setting was resumed. This is
mere guesswork, but it may not be unreasonable to

<pb n="005.178"/>

conjecture that since sheet E had to join with the text for sheet
F, long since printed, the inadvertent choice of type for sheet D
was corrected in order to set more text, as was necessary, in sheet
E.<ref target="f005.16.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref></p>

<div2 type="section"><head/>
<p>An attempt to trace the publication history of Henry Fielding's
early play, <hi rend="italic">The Coffee-House Politician,</hi> raises a number of
interesting questions, some of which may be answered with a degree
of assurance although some remain puzzling. W. L. Cross lists in
his bibliography<ref target="f005.17.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> two editions of
the play, one on June 23, 1730, under the title <hi rend="italic">Rape Upon
Rape,</hi> and a second, as <hi rend="italic">The Coffee-House Politician,</hi>
with
variant Epilogue, on December 17, 1730. Allardyce Nicoll also
mentions two versions and tells us that the play was performed in
the fall "with an entire new act."<ref target="f005.17.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>
<hi rend="italic">The Monthly Chronicle</hi> for 1730 supports Cross in listing
<hi rend="italic">Rape Upon Rape</hi> in June and <hi rend="italic">The Coffee-House
Politician</hi> for December;<ref target="f005.17.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> but

Winston, in the Folger Shakespeare Library copy of the Winston
MSS.,<ref target="f005.17.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> has a note beside the June
23 performance of
<hi rend="italic">Rape Upon Rape</hi> to the effect that it has been "previously
published," although for this I find no support. Finally Herman R.
Mead notes the existence of three variant forms to be found in the
Huntington Library.<ref target="f005.17.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref></p>






<p>Comparison of a number of copies of the play, all London 1730,
has led me to the conclusion that it exists actually in only one
edition, that the edition has three issues, and that the third
issue exists in two states. The forms may be distinguished as
follows:

<p>Apparently in all these states,<ref target="f005.17.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref>

the collation is identical for B-F<hi rend="super">8</hi>. The only exceptions I
have
found are a different ornament at the top of B1 in the DLC copy of
(iii<hi rend="super">a</hi>), quite possibly a press variant, and the lack of F8 in
this copy and perhaps in others. I have, in fact, found no evidence
to contradict the conclusion that the gatherings B-F are all the
product of a single typesetting. All agree in the running-title,
Rape upon Rape; <hi rend="italic">Or,</hi> | <hi rend="italic">The</hi> Justice
<hi rend="italic">caught in his
own</hi> Trap., and the pagination and type alignment are the same
in each. There are a number of uncorrected errors in the texts:
"Goal" for "Gaol", p. 71; "Teasure" for "Treasure", p. 75, etc.;
and all share many notable peculiarities in type: "Scene V1II", p.
36, etc. Even the running-titles, signatures, and catchwords agree
in relative positions and other peculiarities. ("Bamb." for
"Ramb.", p. 19, c.w.; "Ra" of running-title markedly slanted, p.
66, etc.)
We may conclude, then, that we have to deal actually with only one
edition of the play. If there really was "an entire new act," it
seems never to have gotten into the printed text; and the truth may
be either that the revived play was misrepresented in its
advertisements, (Winston's note says "rev. by Author.") or that
Nicoll was misled by the rewritten epilogue, which is included in
the new performances and the later issues.</p>


<p>Since the typesetting is the same for gatherings B-F in the
spring and fall issues of the play, we must conclude either that
the type itself was kept standing all summer for a reimpression, or
that a number of sheets printed in the spring were kept over the
summer as remainders. The latter is obviously the simpler and more
probable hypothesis, and there is some evidence to support it. For
one thing, the play almost certainly had a disappointing sale. The
printer had every reason to believe that the edition would be a
success&mdash;it had a provocative title, and it was Fielding's fourth
dramatic production of the season. The other three had all done
well: <hi rend="italic">The Temple Beau</hi> had run a respectable thirteen nights,
and <hi rend="italic">The Author's Farce</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tom Thumb</hi> had
been
tremendously popular, the one going through two and the other
through three editions in the course of the year. But <hi rend="italic">Rape Upon
Rape</hi> opened very late, played only seven nights in the season,
and according to Winston's notes had only fair box-office receipts.
Therefore, Watts probably was left with unsold sheets on his hands
and almost certainly would not have kept his type tied up for the
summer in a not-too-promising play. This hypothesis is further
substantiated by the fact that there are no signs of a
re-impression: even the running-titles, signatures, and catchwords
are not reset in the fall issues, though they would almost surely
have been removed if the type had been kept standing, and indeed
were removed in the first gathering where

<pb n="005.181"/>

there are signs of standing type. We may, then, advance the theory
that gatherings B-F represent a single impression of a single
type-setting.</p>

<p>In the first gathering, however, the problem is more complex.
Notwithstanding the various changes noted above, the same basic
typesetting is present in each version. Thus the prologue, A2 and
A2<hi rend="super">v</hi>, is the same typesetting throughout although
(iii<hi rend="super">a</hi>) and
(iii<hi rend="super">b</hi>) have corrections in ll. 15 and 16, and the head and
tail
ornaments, initial, signature, and the word "Prologue" have clearly
been reset. Even in the rewritten epilogue, A3 and A3<hi rend="super">v</hi>,
the
passages which have been retained in (iii<hi rend="super">a</hi>) and
(iii<hi rend="super">b</hi>) are in
the same setting as the corresponding passages in (i) and (ii),
though again the ornaments and the word "Epilogue" are reset. A4 in
(i) and (ii) is the same setting of the advertisement; and
(iii<hi rend="super">a</hi>) and (iii<hi rend="super">b</hi>) similarly agree. On
A4<hi rend="super">v</hi>, (iii<hi rend="super">a</hi>) and
(iii<hi rend="super">b</hi>) have the same setting of the dramatis personae, with
the
noted changes; but the whole page is a different setting from that
shared by (i) and (ii).</p>

<p>The determination of the order and the exact relationship of
these forms depends to some extent on establishing the stage
history of the play. Winston, Nicoll, and Cross agree that the play
opened as <hi rend="italic">Rape Upon Rape</hi> at the Little Theatre in the
Haymarket on June 23. After the summer vacation, it played one more
night in the Haymarket, on November 27, as <hi rend="italic">The Coffee-House
Politician</hi>. Then, for some reason, the play was moved to
Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, where it was given on December 4, 5, 7, and
17. Genest<ref target="f005.17.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> and Cross<ref target="f005.17.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> state that Mrs. Younger took the
role
of Hilaret on December 4, and Winston specifies that Mrs. Boheme
was Isabella. Cross even adds that the epilogue was probably
revised at the request of Mrs. Younger although he offers no proof
and we may note that the old epilogue, beginning,

<q>
<l>RAPE upon Rape! <hi rend="italic">what Author ever chose</hi></l>
<l><hi rend="italic">A name so sure to make the Fair his Foes!</hi></l>
</q>

loses its point once the title has been changed. In any case, the
new epilogue was clearly intended to be spoken by some character in
the play, probably Hilaret, for it begins,

<q>
<l><hi rend="italic">At length the dreadful Hurricane is ended,</hi></l>
<l><hi rend="italic">And I and Spouse are safe together landed</hi>.</l>
</q>

Genest lists Mr. Milward as Constant, and the prologue would
fittingly have been spoken by him. None of the authorities
mentioned discusses any change in the original Lincoln's-Inn-Fields
cast, but the variant A4<hi rend="super">v</hi> of (iii<hi rend="super">b</hi>) suggests
that changes
were made at some point in the progress of the production.</p>



<p>In view of the stage history, the evidence of the advertisements
in A4, and those in the periodicals referred to by Cross,<ref target="f005.17.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> there is no reason to doubt that
<hi rend="italic">Rape Upon Rape</hi> (i) was actually the first issue of the play
and that it appeared on June 23. Since all the other forms have the
new title, and Lincoln's-Inn-Fields on the title-page, we may add
that (i) was the issue brought out in the spring of 1730. We may
then suppose that Watts kept a fairly large number of already
printed copies of gatherings B-F, and some printed copies of the
first gathering. We are forced to the conclusion

<pb n="005.182"/>

that he kept as well the type for the first gathering since this
theory explains most satisfactorily the recurrence of the same
typesetting with new headings and signature and internal revisions
in (iii<hi rend="super">a</hi>) and (iii<hi rend="super">b</hi>). The position of (ii) is
somewhat
doubtful since the unique copy of this state, in the
Kemble-Devonshire collection, has inlaid leaves so that it is now
impossible to draw any conclusion about the conjugacy of the
leaves. This could be a "made-up" copy, but since it has a
genuinely variant title-page, I have accepted it as the second
issue. If this is correct, (ii) was probably brought out very soon
after the fall opening&mdash;possibly as a stop-gap to meet a demand
created by the one Haymarket performance. The title-page was most
likely a cancel prefixed to old sheets of the first gathering and
bound without regard for the fact that it joined a
Lincoln's-Inn-Fields title-page with a Haymarket cast and an
epilogue related to the old title.</p>


<p>Only a few copies of the second issue were apparently sold, and
it is reasonable to suppose that the third issue, with reset
title-page, corrected prologue, revised epilogue, and
Lincoln's-Inn-Fields cast, was in preparation at the time of the
Lincoln's-Inn-Fields rehearsals. According to the usual practice,
it would have appeared on or about December 4, the day of the new
opening. That this was what actually did happen is indicated by
advertisements, not listed by Cross, in the <hi rend="italic">London
Evening-Post</hi>. Its issue for December 1-3 announces "Tomorrow
will be published" <hi rend="italic">The Coffee-House Politician</hi>, and the one
for December 3-5 follows up with the information that it is
"Published Today." We may, therefore, conclude with reasonable
assurance that the new issue did appear early in December.</p>

<p>The issue exists, however, in two states. Both have the same
basic typesetting as (i) and (ii), and yet contain changes on every
leaf of the initial sheet; hence, we must suppose that the whole
first gathering was reprinted from the modified standing type. The
only remaining problem is the determination of which is the earlier
of the two states. The solution hinges on the cast of characters on
A4<hi rend="super">v</hi> as this is the only place in which the two states do not

agree.</p>

<p>If we accept the statements that Mrs. Younger was Hilaret when
the play opened on December 4, we are tempted to theorize that
(iii<hi rend="super">b</hi>), the state which contains her name in the cast and as
speaker of the epilogue, is the earlier form. We might complete
this theory by suggesting that some time after December 4, perhaps
in the interim between the seventh and the seventeenth, the cast
was changed. Watts might then have corrected the cast, neglecting
to replace Mrs. Younger's name on A3, and have brought out the
second state about December 17, the date suggested by Cross for the
"second edition." But this hypothesis has certain difficulties. The
simplest method of making the change in cast would have been by the
canceling of A4. But none of the copies of (iii<hi rend="super">a</hi>) which I
have
seen or had described shows any clear signs of cancellation.<ref target="f005.17.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> If Watts did not cancel, he must
have
reprinted the whole gathering, and if so, being a careful printer,
why did he not replace Mrs. Younger's name on A3? He might have
canceled by removing the conjugate leaves A1 and A4 after the edges
had been trimmed and replacing them with corrected leaves; but, if
this were the case, one would expect to find some evidence in the
failure of the chain lines of the new leaves to coincide exactly
with those of the old. Also, in order to imagine a reprinting of
the A1 and A4 leaves, or even of just A4 as it occurs in
(iii<hi rend="super">a</hi>),
we

<pb n="005.183"/>

must concede that Watts kept the type of the gathering standing for
some two weeks and kept it, not as he had kept it before, with
headlines, etc. removed, but just as it had been used for
(iii<hi rend="super">b</hi>). Finally, and most improbably, this theory allows the

supposition that the greatest number of copies were printed and
sold, not when the play opened, but on December 17, when after a
single performance, the demand ceased altogether.<ref target="f005.17.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref></p>



<p>On the whole, an alternative hypothesis seems more satisfactory.
Let us suppose that there was no change in the cast after the
actual opening of the play. The listing in (iii<hi rend="super">a</hi>) may be
taken
to represent rather a provisional casting given to Watts when the
Lincoln's-Inn-Fields rehearsals began. He may then have proceeded
to change his standing type where necessary and prepare for
printing everything except the revised epilogue which he had to get
from Fielding himself. It is possible that by the time the epilogue
was completed there had been changes made in the cast: in
particular, that Mrs. Younger had been substituted for Mrs. Boheme
in the role of Hilaret. Fielding accordingly would have supplied
her name as the speaker of the epilogue. A3 and A3<hi rend="super">v</hi>
would then
have been set in their final form; and the printing would have
begun. At some time&mdash;either during this printing process, or
between December 4 and 17, someone familiar with the cast noted
that the listing on A4<hi rend="super">v</hi>
had not been changed, and hence the necessary corrections were
made.</p>

<p>Yet the same objections as before may be made against
conjecturing a second printing later in December. In addition,
there would not now be even the occasion of a modified production;
and it seems unlikely that Watts would have bothered to correct
such a relatively minor error after a large number of copies had
already been issued and after it must have become fairly obvious
that the play was not destined for a long run.</p>

<p>The simplest conclusion, therefore, and the one I wish to
present, is that A4<hi rend="super">v</hi> was corrected during the course of the

printing of the December 4 issue. It is true that this printing
would not have occupied more than four or five hours; but if
Fielding was on hand to proof-read his revised epilogue, he himself
could easily have called for the alteration of A4<hi rend="super">v</hi> to agree
with
the scheduled opening-night cast. The error would probably not have
been considered sufficiently grave to deter the use of the already
printed copies (iii<hi rend="super">a</hi>), probably most of the issue. Whatever
the
actual situation was, the weight of the argument seems to favor the
classification of (iii<hi rend="super">a</hi>) as the first state and
(iii<hi rend="super">b</hi>) as the
second.</p>

<p>The analysis of the variant forms of the play indicates, then,
three issues: (i) represents the first, on June 23; (ii) is the
second, probably very late in November; (iii<hi rend="super">a</hi>) and
(iii<hi rend="super">b</hi>) are
respectively the first and second states of the third issue, on
December 4. Judging from the number of extant copies, the final
issue sold considerably better than the first two; but the play was
doomed. Lincoln's-Inn-Fields closed for the Christmas vacation, and
<hi rend="italic">The Coffee-House Politician</hi> did not survive the year.</p>

1733: An Extraordinary Use of Standing Type</name>
<lb/><name type="author">Oliver L. Steele, Jr.</name>
</head>

<div2 type="section"><head/>
<p>In the McGregor Collection of the University of Virginia Library
are two tracts concerning colonial tobacco trade. A study of the
relationship existing between the tracts illustrates a printing
practice which, so far as I have been able to learn, has not been
previously recorded.<ref target="f005.18.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> One of the
tracts was printed as a folio sheet, with the following undated
title-page:<ref target="f005.18.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref>

<q>The CASE of the Planters of | Tobacco in <hi rend="italic">Virginia</hi>, as
re-|pre&longs;ented by them&longs;elves, &longs;ign-|ed by the Pre&longs;ident of the
| Council and the Speaker of the | Hou&longs;e of Burge&longs;&longs;es.</q>

The other tract was printed as an octavo in fours; its dated
title-page reads as follows:<ref target="f005.18.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref>

<q>THE | CASE | OF THE | Planters of TOBACCO | in
<hi rend="italic">Virginia</hi>,
| As repre&longs;ented by Themselves; | &longs;igned by the Pre&longs;ident of
the | Council, and Speaker of the Hou&longs;e of Burge&longs;&longs;es. | To
which is added, | A VINDICATION | of the &longs;aid Repre&longs;entation. |
[double rule] | <hi rend="italic">LONDON</hi>: | Printed for <hi rend="italic">J.
Roberts</hi> in
<hi rend="italic">Warwick-Lane</hi> | 1733. Price 1 s.</q></p>




<p>As the titles suggest, the texts of the two tracts are, in part,
the same. In fact, a collation of the two copies reveals that, save
for titles, catchwords, and the <hi rend="italic">Vindication</hi> which appears
only in the 8<hi rend="super"></hi>, the text of one of the copies is a letter for
letter, point for point reprint of that of the other. There are no
variants in either the substantives or the accidentals of the text
of the two formats. This complete absence of variation suggests
that one of the formats was printed from the standing type of the
other, even though their line-length is completely dissimilar; and
an examination and collation of defective type and misprints
occurring in the two copies proves that such was indeed the
case.</p>

<p>Of course, there are apparent defects in the sorts of one copy
which do not appear in the sorts in the corresponding positions of
the other copy. However the many examples of defective type common
to the tract in both formats make it most likely that variation is
only apparent and was the result, on the one hand, of light inking
and, on the other, of heavy inking. Of the ninety or so obvious
type defects common to the tract in both formats, the following is
a list of those defects which seem most

significant. The first reference is to the folio; the reference
within parentheses is to the octavo.

</list>

These examples present convincing proof that standing type of one
format was rearranged and used exclusively in printing the text of
the other format.</p>

<p>Which of the formats was first through the press is a matter of
some interest. The <hi rend="italic">Vindication</hi> mentions a text of the
<hi rend="italic">Case</hi> which ". . . has been long talked of about the Royal
Exchange . . ." (sig. C2), and it is natural to assume that the
reference is to the folio sheet. However, <hi rend="italic">Arents Catalogue</hi>
lists the 8&deg; as a first edition, and, as the folio sheet is
undated, there is no proof, only a general probability, that this
listing is wrong. That the listing is in fact incorrect, and that
the <hi rend="italic">Case</hi> as printed in the 8&deg; is a second issue
(re-imposed and re-impressed) of the text printed in the folio
sheet, can be established. In the lack of any variant readings, the
clearest and the only unambiguous evidence<ref target="f005.18.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> as to the order of the issues is
what
may be called the awkward spacing occasionally found in the 8&deg;
as compared with the consistently regular spacing of the
folio.<ref target="f005.18.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> Roberts or his
compositor seems regularly to have attempted to split the folio
lines, the measure for which was 148 mm., in half in rearranging
them for the 8&deg;, which was set in a measure of 75 mm.<ref target="f005.18.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> Very often he

<pb n="005.186"/>

was unable to do this and, in order to justify lines, was forced to
remove or to add spaces. In the majority of cases he changed the
original spacing without any very unsightly result, but in a few
instances the result is manifestly unsightly. Following are three
of the most obvious examples of awkward spacing in the 8&deg;:

</p>

<p>
The awkward spacing found in the 8&deg; establishes the order of the
two issues. The text of the <hi rend="italic">Case</hi> printed in 8&deg; is not the
first edition but a separate, second issue of the folio text.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know how long the type used in
printing the folio sheet was kept standing before the printing of
the 8&deg;, but that I have not been able to discover. However, from
extant sources I have inferred a history which is admittedly
conjectural, though not, I think, illogical. On June 28, 1732, John
Randolph was appointed by the House to present before parliament a
petition pleading the case of the Virginia planters.<ref target="f005.18.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> He left Virginia soon after August
8,
1732,<ref target="f005.18.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> and reached England in late
November or early December. Soon after he was settled in London he
gave the MS of the <hi rend="italic">Case</hi> to Roberts, and the folio sheet was
printed by late December or early January. Randolph, expecting,
perhaps, that the <hi rend="italic">Case</hi> would be attacked, ordered Roberts to
keep the type standing. The folio <hi rend="italic">Case</hi> was ". . . long
talked of about the Royal Exchange . . .", and attacks against it
did appear in
print.<ref target="f005.18.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> Sometime after March 2,
1733, Randolph finished his <hi rend="italic">Vindication</hi><ref target="f005.18.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> of the <hi rend="italic">Case</hi> and gave
it to
Roberts. Roberts decided upon the format to be used in printing the
<hi rend="italic">Vindication</hi> and began reimposing the standing type from the
folio <hi rend="italic">Case</hi> while setting the <hi rend="italic">Vindication</hi>. Thus
the
type of the folio sheet was kept standing over two months before
the second issue was printed. The chief interest in this octavo,
however, lies not merely in the fact that it employed standing type
in another format but that this standing type was broken up and
completely rearranged to adjust it to a smaller type-page.</p>

<name type="title">Baskerville and James Whatman</name>
<lb/><name type="author">A. T. Hazen</name>
</head>

<div2 type="section"><head/>
<p>In discussions of Baskerville's innovations, the use of wove
paper is often cited, along with his blacker ink, hot-pressed
sheets, and new types; and he is therefore often credited with the
manufacture of the first wove paper. The difficulty began in his
own time, for Dr. John Bedford of Durham wrote, 29 October 1758:
"By Baskerville's Specimen of his types, you will perceive how much
the elegance of them is owing to his paper, which he makes himself"
(Nichols, <hi rend="italic">Illustrations</hi>, I, 813). Similarly, Samuel Derrick
wrote in 1760 that Baskerville manufactured his own paper. So it is
not astonishing, perhaps, that the Vergil of 1757 has ever since
been called, in numerous handbooks, the first book on wove paper,
and Baskerville is credited either categorically or doubtfully with
the invention: he is so acclaimed in a standard encyclopedia
revised in 1950.</p>

<p>To some extent Baskerville himself is to blame for the error.
The Vergil was advertised as to be "on a very fine writing Royal
paper," and in his Preface to the Milton of 1758 Baskerville spoke
of "the improvement in the manufacture of the paper" used for the
Vergil. Even more dangerous, perhaps, was his letter to Dodsley in
1756 concerning "the paper scheme," in which he proposed to send
samples to the Prince of Wales "as a sample of English
manufactory"; and in advertisements as well as in his Proposals for
Milton he offered writing paper "of his own manufacture." But in
these latter references, as the punctuation indeed suggests,
Baskerville was certainly speaking of his novelty, ornamented
writing papers, and perhaps also of his new process of glazing and
hot-pressing. The two references to the paper of his Vergil are to
be understood as expressing his satisfaction in the new paper he
was using, not a claim for its manufacture.</p>

<p>Baskerville said nothing of the paper when he wrote to Dodsley
in 1752 concerning his care about punches, printing press, ink, and
printing; and in his appeal to Horace Walpole in November 1762 he
added a postscript: "The ink, presses, chases, moulds for casting,
and all the apparatus for printing were made in my own shops."
Clearly, Baskerville never said he manufactured the new wove paper
or any other paper, whatever practical interest he may have had in
the improvement of paper manufacture.</p>

<p>If Baskerville did not manufacture, or invent, the first wove
paper, however, it is of some interest to know who did. Baskerville
was conscious of the effect of the paper in setting off his new
types&mdash;hence his calendering of the fresh-printed sheets&mdash;and
we
may fairly assume he used the new wove paper purposefully but
experimentally. No paper-maker is known who would seem more likely
to have invented wove paper than James Whatman, the man who lifted
English paper-making from obscurity to pre-eminence. His
association with Baskerville and with early wove paper seems
sufficient to suggest that he (and his son) did in fact develop the
first wove paper.</p>

<p>The art of making woven wire does not seem in itself to be the
important technical accomplishment, although it is the
prerequisite. But its application to the art of paper-making, as a
way to eradicate the irregularity caused by chain-lines, must have
proved difficult: not only do the first specimens in England show
an imperfect fusion with the established method of parallel laid
wires, but twenty years later (after Franklin in 1777 exhibited
specimens of English wove in Paris) Johannot and Montgolfier did
not succeed in producing a satisfactory wove or <hi rend="italic">papier
v&eacute;lin</hi> for two or three years.</p>

<pb n="005.188"/>

<p>The association between Whatman and Baskerville has to be traced
through William Shenstone and Dodsley, but it is nevertheless
exactly demonstrable; and because of the proposed new bibliography
of Baskerville, this association may well be stressed now.
Shenstone wrote, 7 March 1757: "My neighbor Baskerville, at the
close of this month, publishes his fine edition of Vergil. It will,
for <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> and <hi rend="italic">type</hi>, be a perfect curiosity."
Then
Shenstone wrote to Percy, 11 August 1760: "Have you ever yet seen
the <hi rend="italic">Prolusions?</hi> [completed by Dryden Leach in October
1759,
but delayed in publication] . . .'Tis indeed a specimen of
<hi rend="italic">type</hi> and <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> that is meant to alarm my
neighbor
Baskerville. . . . However, Tonson [publisher of Milton as well as
of Capell's <hi rend="italic">Prolusions</hi>] having sent it to Baskerville, is to
find it surpassed in Dodsley's <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi>."</p>

<p>The Vergil of 1757 is partly on a new paper perhaps made by
placing woven wire or a stiff cloth screen on a conventional mould,
since it is in effect an unwatermarked wove paper but shows
translucent chain-lines. The second part and the cancels are on an
excellent, unwatermarked laid paper with closely spaced
chain-lines. But Capell's <hi rend="italic">Prolusions</hi> is printed on a
completely satisfying wove paper, watermarked some half-inch from
the edge with a small block W, a paper fully as good as that in the
Vergil but not hot-pressed.<ref target="f005.19.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> And we

know from a letter of James Whatman the Younger, in 1768, that he
made the paper for the <hi rend="italic">Prolusions:</hi> he says that Crown No.
2
is the common size, "and is made upon wove moulds and is the same
sort of paper I made for Mr. Caples Prolusions." (Quoted by James
Wardrop in <hi rend="italic">Signature</hi> No. 9, 1938, from a transcript in the
BM.) <hi rend="italic">Prolusions</hi> is therefore on wove paper manufactured by
Whatman, and we know that
Shenstone was very favorably impressed by the new papers used in
the Vergil and in <hi rend="italic">Prolusions</hi>.</p>


<p>In the autumn of 1759 Dodsley planned the printing of his
<hi rend="italic">Selected Fables of Aesop</hi>, during discussions with Shenstone
and Baskerville. Then in June 1760 Dodsley wrote about the
<hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> to Shenstone: "I hope that Mr. Baskerville will be
quite ready for me; I shall send him the paper in a fortnight." And
when the book was completed, Baskerville advertised it as on
superfine paper; it was published in February 1761, "price bound
five shillings"&mdash;on the same wove paper, watermarked W near the
edge, that Whatman had made for Capell's <hi rend="italic">Prolusions</hi>. (Mr.
Wardrop noted the paper of the Aesop in his article in
<hi rend="italic">Signature</hi>.)</p>

<p>Now it is true that Dodsley's selection of a wove paper made by
Whatman, in 1760, on which Baskerville was to print his Aesop's
<hi rend="italic">Fables</hi>, does not exactly prove Whatman to be the originator.
But it does link Whatman very firmly to Baskerville in connection
with one book, and no other source of Baskerville's supply has ever
been established. Furthermore, since Whatman had the same paper
available for Capell's <hi rend="italic">Prolusions</hi> in 1759, Whatman is
clearly proved to be the first maker of wove paper save for the
unidentified maker of the experimental wove used for the first part
of the Vergil. Perhaps there is some pattern to the other papers
used by Baskerville in books of about the same period.</p>

<p>Most of the books printed in the early years are on good laid
paper, sometimes without watermarks, sometimes with marks that can
not be assigned to one mill. The Juvenal of 1761, in quarto, is on
laid paper much like that used in the second part of the Vergil, a
good laid with chain-lines rather closely spaced, without
watermark; it is presumably paper from the same mill. The octavo
Milton of 1758, printed by Baskerville for Tonson who published
Capell's <hi rend="italic">Prolusions</hi>, and the earlier Proposals

<pb n="005.189"/>

for Milton are on very similar paper: it has the same closely
spaced chain-lines (about &frac34;"); but it was not glazed and
calendered like the Vergil, so that it seems a little heavier and
less translucent; again, it seems likely to have come from the same
mill. The octavo Milton of 1760 is less interesting, chiefly
because the chain-lines are more normally spaced. The Horace of
1762, in duodecimo, is on a fine unwatermarked paper with
chain-lines still more closely spaced (the cancels, however, are on
rather ordinary paper of the period); and if this paper came from
Whatman or another English maker, that used in Aesop's
<hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> of 1764 becomes an apparent attempt in Holland to
imitate it. This second Baskerville edition of Aesop's
<hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> has chain-lines very closely spaced (about &frac12;"),
and the watermark is a post-horn, Superfine, and countermark
Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Other books are on the whole rather less interesting. Two
quartos, Gardiner and Dalby, printed in 1762, are on trade demy
paper: lily watermark, with IV countermark. The 1758 <hi rend="italic">Avon</hi>,

in quarto, is similar. The Book of Psalms, 1762, in duodecimo, has
a normal lily in shield, LVG, with IV countermark. These could be
imported Dutch paper, or English paper using the standard marks.
Much the same is true of the Addison and Congreve, 1761.</p>

<p>But <hi rend="italic">Edwin and Emma</hi>, 1760, in quarto, has (one sheet
in
one copy, both sheets in another) the watermark lily, Strasburg
bend, LVG, with countermark (I think) JW. The initials are in the
binding, but this is almost certainly the same Whatman laid paper
that appears in other royal quartos of that date&mdash;the best laid
paper on the market.</p>

<p>The reprint of the Vergil, customarily dated <hi rend="italic">ca.</hi> 1771,
is
on an apparent wove paper that is not especially good; the
wire-lines and chain-lines are rather dim, so that it passes for
wove paper. This can hardly be ascribed to Whatman: it is not at
all as satisfactory as the Aesop's <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> of 1761, or even
the Vergil of 1757. One other book is of interest, though, the
quarto <hi rend="italic">Paradise Regained</hi> of 1759: this is an excellent and
undoubted wove, very much like that in Capell's <hi rend="italic">Prolusions</hi>
save that I find no watermark in <hi rend="italic">Paradise Regained</hi>.</p>

<p>The pattern of these few books is perhaps this: various books
printed on good paper as it became available, with a sharp eye out
for the typographical effectiveness of an experimental new paper.
The Vergil begun on the experimental paper in which the chain-lines
were nearly obliterated by the use of woven wire; <hi rend="italic">Paradise
Regained</hi> of 1759 on a much more satisfactory wove; the latter
half of Vergil and most of Tonson's Miltons on a fine laid with
experimentally narrow chain-lines; and Aesop's <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> on a
fine Whatman wove supplied by Dodsley.</p>

<p>Only the paper used in Aesop's <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> and in Capell's
<hi rend="italic">Prolusions</hi> is demonstrably Whatman's wove; and yet there
is
a demonstrable association between Whatman and Baskerville by way
of Tonson, Dodsley, and Shenstone. If I were seeking for the
originator of wove paper for Western Europe, a quarter of a century
before Johannot and Montgolfier learned to make wove at Annonay, I
would begin by studying the products of the Whatman mill.</p>

<name type="title">The First Edition of <hi rend="italic">Essays by Mr.
Goldsmith,</hi>
1765</name>
<lb/><name type="author">Arthur Friedman</name>
</head>

<div2 type="section"><head/>
<p>It is well known that there are two editions of Oliver
Goldsmith's <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> dated 1765, both said in the imprint to
be "for W. Griffin": one with an engraved titlepage (1765A);<ref target="f005.20.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> the other a cheaper edition with a
title-page printed from type (1765B).<ref target="f005.20.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> No careful attempt has been made
to
determine which of these editions is the first. In his bibliography
of first editions of Goldsmith's writings Iolo A. Williams
describes 1765A and does not mention the other edition.<ref target="f005.20.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> Temple Scott, on the other hand,
describes both editions and argues for the priority of 1765B:

<q>I lean to the conclusion that the issue [i.e., edition] of this
book without the engraved title-page is the first issue, because
most of the editions which followed it have the engraved title. It
is more likely that the publisher, had he used an engraved title
originally, would have continued to use it rather than abandon it
and reset the volume in a poorer form. The demand for the book
encouraged Griffin to make a more pleasing volume, hence the
improved type-setting and engraved title-page of the later
issue.<ref target="f005.20.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref></q>

This argument is by no means conclusive. Although it is remarkable
that 1765B, if it is the later edition, has a printed title-page,
various reasons might be suggested why the title-page plate
engraved for 1765A could have been inaccessible when another
edition was printed. More important, Scott's last sentence states
the reverse of what I take to be the normal procedure; Griffin
might rather be expected to make the first edition attractive in
appearance in order to create a demand and then possibly to take
advantage of the demand with a cheaper edition.</p>
<p>A direct comparison of the texts of 1765A and 1765B leads to no
demonstrable conclusion for one or the other as the first edition.
Fortunately, however, the problem of priority is readily solvable
by comparing the two editions with an earlier state of the text. As
is suggested by the motto "Collecta revirescunt" on the title-page
of the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>, Goldsmith was republishing essays and poems
which he had previously contributed to newspapers and periodicals,
and the original texts are available for all but the last of the
twenty-seven pieces. For the collected <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> Goldsmith
made
very extensive revisions, which appear in both 1765A and 1765B; the
two editions are clearly not independent reprintings of the
periodical texts. One of the editions, consequently, was printed
from the revised periodical texts, whereas the other was derived
from this first edition;<ref target="f005.20.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> and the
order of the editions can be determined by

<pb n="005.191"/>

discovering which one is closer to the periodical texts. I attempt
to list below all the variants in substantives where one of the
1765 texts agrees with the periodical version and the other differs
from it.</p>

<pb n="005.192"/>

<p>From this collation 1765A is seen to be very much closer to the
periodical texts than is 1765B. 1765B agrees with the earlier texts
against 1765A in only two cases: in one instance (227.23) the
reading of 1765A is a simple misprint, and in the other (187.17) it
appears on critical grounds to be inferior to the reading of the
<hi rend="italic">British Magazine</hi> and 1765B. 1765A, on the other hand,
agrees
with the periodical texts twenty-six times when 1765B differs from
them. Of these distinctive readings in 1765B three (121.16, 131.14,
and 135.6) are obvious errors, and three others (112.6, 131.7, and
137.3) seem on critical grounds to be inferior readings. The other
twenty instances, however, are all indifferent readings not clearly
inferior to 1765A; indeed a number of them&mdash;the correction of
grammar at 167.24, for example&mdash;appear to be attempts at obvious
improvement. In these twenty cases it is highly improbable that
either Goldsmith or a printer would have returned in 1765A from the
readings of 1765B to those of the periodical texts; it is very much
more probable that 1765A is the first ediiton and that 1765B
represents a stage of the text still further removed from the
periodical version.<ref target="f005.20.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref></p>


<p>When 1765A is recognized as the first edition, 1765B is seen to
contain a number of features that call for explanation. (1) It is
not described as the second edition; rather the edition of 1766 is
called on the title-page "The SECOND EDITION, corrected." (2) No
new edition, as far as I have been able to discover, was advertised
in the newspapers during 1765.<ref target="f005.20.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> (3)
The printer of 1765B did not employ the

<pb n="005.193"/>

title-page plate engraved for 1765A or even the picture cut from
that plate and used as a vignette in 1766. (4) 1766 bears a close
physical resemblance to 1765A; it is, indeed, as far as corrections
and additions permitted, a page-for-page reprint of the first
edition. 1765B, on the other hand, is not a paginal reprint; it is,
rather, a cheap reprint which does not attempt to imitate the
physical make-up of 1765A. (5) 1765A has at the end a leaf
advertising nine books printed and sold by W. Griffin; 1766
advertises these same books and fourteen others. 1765B carries no
advertisements.</p>


<p>It is apparent that 1765A and 1766 display a sequence in the
practices of Griffin and that the supposedly intermediate 1765B
departs from this sequence. The only thing associating Griffin with
1765B is his name on the title-page, and the five features listed
above taken in combination strongly suggest that he was not
responsible for its publication. If 1765B is in fact a piracy, then
(1) there would have been no reason for calling it the second
edition, whereas Griffin would naturally have given that
designation to 1766; (2) the only result of advertising 1765B as a
new edition would have been to call the piracy to Griffin's
attention; (3) the engraved title-page plate for 1765A or the
picture cut from that plate and used as a vignette for 1766 would
not have been available to the printer of 1765B; (4) 1765B does not
resemble 1765A in physical make-up because the printer wished, not
to deceive people who had seen the first edition, but to produce
the volume as cheaply as possible;
(5) the printer would have had no interest in advertising Griffin's
stock.</p>

<p>Since 1765B can with some confidence be labelled a piracy, none
of its distinctive readings&mdash;even those which are corrections or
have the superficial air of improvements&mdash;can be authoritative,
and therefore an editor should give no weight to its variants. Even
if a less extreme view is taken, and the case for piracy is
considered speculative only, an editor will find that there is no
distinctive reading in 1765B which could not be a printing variant.
In light of this fact, it would appear to be of considerable
significance that when the authorized 1766 edition was ordered, the
printer was furnished a copy of 1765A, an unlikely occurrence if
the readings in 1765B resulted from the author's further revisions.
Of even greater importance, Goldsmith, if he were responsible for
the distinctive readings of 1765B, might be expected to repeat some
of them in his fairly extensive revision of 1765A for this edition
of 1766; but for the twenty-eight instances listed above where
1765A and
1765B differ, 1766 invariably agrees with 1765A. Even if the very
strong evidence that 1765B is a piracy is ignored, the edition can
still be granted no textual authority.<ref target="f005.20.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref></p>

Biographically Considered</hi> (1928), p. 157. Scott's statement
that "most of the editions which followed it [1765B] have the
engraved title" is inaccurate. For the edition of 1766 the complete
title-page plate engraved for 1765A was discarded, probably because
to have used it as a whole would have necessitated not only the
addition of "The SECOND EDITION, corrected" and of a Roman numeral
to the date but also a change of the address of Griffin's shop from
Fetter Lane to Catharine Street. The engraved picture above the
imprint in the plate, however, was cut out and used alone as a
vignette for the title-page of 1766; the rest of the 1766
title-page was printed from type. This correction of Scott is not
intended to weaken his argument; 1765B, if it is the later edition,
might be expected to have the engraved title, since the wording of
the two 1765 title-pages is identical.</p></note>

example from an earlier period of the treacherous nature of
accidentals in determining priority see A. H. Carter, <hi rend="italic">Studies in

variants in accidentals for four essays (Nos. III, XVI, XXI, XXVI)
from four different periodicals, from which 1765A is again seen to
be much closer to the periodical texts than is 1765B. In the
presence or absence of a comma there is no significant difference
between the two editions; 1765A agrees with the periodical texts
seventeen times against 1765B, and 1765B agrees thirteen times
against 1765A. In more important variations in punctuation&mdash;an
exclamation mark for a period or semicolon, a question mark for a
comma, and so on&mdash;1765A agrees with the earlier texts against
1765B in thirteen cases; 1765B agrees against 1765A in only two
cases. In capitalization
alone 1765B is closer to the periodical texts than is 1765A; it
agrees with them in four cases against 1765A, whereas 1765A agrees
in only two cases against 1765B. In all other differences &mdash;five
in the use or absence of a hyphen and two in spelling&mdash;the
agreement is uniformly on the side of 1765A. For all variants in
accidentals in the four essays, then, 1765A agrees with the
periodical texts thirty-nine times against 1765B; 1765B agrees with
them nineteen times against 1765A.</p></note>

published before the first of December 1765, for sometime between
the middle of October and the end of November Griffin moved his

edition subsequent to 1765A; but nothing would really be gained by
such a hypothesis. This lost edition, if it were authoritative,
would have to be prior to the edition of 1766, since as copy for
1765B it could not contain the revisions and additions of 1766; its
distinctive readings, consequently, would seem not to be revisions
by Goldsmith for the same reasons that those of 1765B appear to
lack authority; and&mdash;unless its title-page were printed from the
1756A engraved plate or had the 1766 vignette&mdash;it would be
suspected of being a piracy because it was not advertised in the
newspapers or called the second edition. The hypothetical edition
would thus have the same status as 1765B.

<hi rend="italic">M&eacute;moire
Justificatif</hi></name>
<lb/><name type="author">Robert R. Rea</name>
</head>

<div2 type="section" n="1"><head/>
<p>To few literary figures has been given the enjoyment of such
thorough bibliographical coverage as Miss J. E. Norton provided in
her <hi rend="italic">Bibliography of the Works of Edward Gibbon</hi> (1940).
Among
the most significant contributions of this volume is the
clarification of much of the detail surrounding the publication of
Gibbon's chief digression into political propaganda, a
semi-official "white-book" entitled <hi rend="italic">M&eacute;moire Justificatif pour
servir de r&eacute;ponse a l'expos&eacute;, &amp;c. de la cour de
France</hi>
(1779). The excellence of Miss Norton's work and the prominent
character of her subject combine to make further additions to the
textual and bibliographical analysis of this pamphlet
desirable.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="2"><head/>
<p>Three forms of the <hi rend="italic">M&eacute;moire Justificatif</hi> have
previously been noted. The first edition was published under
governmental supervision sometime between August 10, 1779, when
Gibbon submitted to Lord Weymouth his "first, imperfect Essay, in
this kind of Composition,"<ref target="f005.21.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> and
October 7, when the <hi rend="italic">General Evening Post</hi> noticed its
appearance in print.<ref target="f005.21.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref> The
title-page of this edition gives no information concerning printer,
publisher, or distributor. A second issue of the first edition was
produced for the bookseller Peter Elmsley by the printers T.
Harrison and S. Brooke. Norton (p. 30) found this issue first
mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> of December 24, but
earlier publication seems quite certain. Gibbon wrote on October 27
that Elmsley had already "desired to print a new Edition which he
has swelled by the addition of the French Manifesto."<ref target="f005.21.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> This supplement entitled
<hi rend="italic">Expos&eacute; des Motifs de la Conduite du Roi de France,
relativement &agrave; l'Angleterre</hi> was separately paginated and
bound so as to precede Gibbon's pamphlet. A reputed second edition
incorporating English translations of the documents was printed by
Harrison and Brooke and advertised in 1780 by the houses of Davies,
Longman, and Dodsley (Norton, pp. 30-31).</p>




<p>The true second edition appears, however, to be one which, by
virtue of its extreme rarity, has escaped Gibbon's bibliographers
altogether.<ref target="f005.21.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref> This new edition may
be described as follows:

That the new edition was printed subsequent to the second issue of
the first edition is patent from half a dozen instances in which
the typographical and textual corrections of the Elmsley issue are
incorporated in the Hallhead pamphlet. Although the pagination is
the same in both cases, the typesetting and spacing differ on four
pages. In the Elmsley <hi rend="italic">M&eacute;moire</hi> the short notice
explaining
publication is headed "Avis du Libraire." The publisher of the new
edition chose to omit that phrase and re-worded the paragraphs
which followed. The elimination of "Avis du Libraire" and the
capitalization of the word "De" in the title strongly suggest that
the new edition was set directly from a copy partially described by
Norton (p. 35) as a variant of the second issue located in the
private collection of Lord Rothschild.</p>

<p>In addition to its appearance in pamphlet form, Gibbon's
<hi rend="italic">M&eacute;moire</hi> was reprinted in contemporary newspapers,
periodicals, and in the author's <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Works</hi> edited
by Lord Sheffield (Norton, pp. 33, 35). As the Norton
<hi rend="italic">Bibliography</hi> mentions only the <hi rend="italic">Annual Register</hi>
as an
English periodical source, two additions to this category may be
cited. The <hi rend="italic">M&eacute;moire Justificatif</hi> is to be found in the
<hi rend="italic">London Magazine,</hi> XLVIII (1779), 582ff., and in John
Almon's
<hi rend="italic">Remembrancer; or, impartial repository of public events,</hi>
VIII (1779), 374ff. These are among the most accessible
contemporary sources of the work in this country but they should be
used with care. In both the <hi rend="italic">Annual Register</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Remembrancer</hi> versions the last four pages of the original
pamphlet are transposed into the middle of the text and a half page
is omitted. This error, obviously the result of a compositor's
carelessness, leaves the text in the
<hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi> the only reliable source of its type.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="4"><head/>
<p>The most interesting of the textual variations to be found in
the several editions of the pamphlet is that concerning the affair
of <hi rend="italic">La Belle Poule</hi>. This French vessel was engaged in the
first naval action of the war when, in company with two smaller
ships, <hi rend="italic">Licorne</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pallas,</hi> she ran afoul
Admiral
Keppel's British squadron off Brest, June 18, 1778. The Frenchman
was ordered to stand to by one of Keppel's frigates, but replied to
the warning bow shot with a broadside. In the ensuing encounter
<hi rend="italic">La Belle Poule</hi> was able to withdraw into the safety of Brest
harbor, but her escorts were taken.<ref target="f005.21.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref> Gibbon dealt with this affair in the

<hi rend="italic">M&eacute;moire Justificatif,</hi> but erroneously described "les
circonstances de la prise de la <hi rend="italic">Belle Poule</hi> et de deux
autres fr&eacute;gates."<ref target="f005.21.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> This
factual
mistake was corrected in the second issue and carried into the
second edition as a more modest statement
concerning "les circonstances du combat avec la <hi rend="italic">Belle Poule</hi>
et de la prise des deux fr&eacute;gates."<ref target="f005.21.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref> Though not an especially
significant
error, this slip of Gibbon's pen and its correction is peculiarly
interesting, as almost the same sort of error was made by his
French protagonist Caron de Beaumarchais whose airy treatment of
cold naval facts led to considerable embarrassment at the hands of
outraged politicians.<ref target="f005.21.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref></p>




</div2>

<pb n="005.196"/>

<div2 type="section" n="5"><head/>
<p>The author of the <hi rend="italic">M&eacute;moire Justificatif</hi> was quite

pleased with his handiwork. He remarked that "it has . . . been
communicated as a State paper . . . to all the Ministers and Courts
of Europe, and as far as I can understand it has been received with
some degree of approbation" (Prothero, I, 372). He even mentioned
a Turkish translation to Lord Sheffield who declared that, "At
Petersburgh and Vienna it was currently observed by the Corps
Diplomatique, that the English Ministry had published a Memorial
written not only with great and more than usual ability, but also
in French, so correct, that they must have employed a Frenchman"
(Sheffield, I, xix-xx). Gibbon's high opinion of his own prowess (a
characteristic not limited to the present problem) has been widely
upheld despite an embarrassing lack of substantiation from the
Continent. Norton's efforts uncovered only a translation of an
English newspaper version at the Quai D'Orsay, and no other
official foreign notice of
the <hi rend="italic">M&eacute;moire</hi> has come to light. Certainly Gibbon's
pamphlet circulated abroad, but as Madame du Deffand, who refused
to read it, informed Horace Walpole, "Il n'a pas un grand
succ&egrave;s."<ref target="f005.21.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> A portion of the
honors claimed by Gibbon must be attributed to the simultaneous
publication under remarkably similar circumstances of another
anonymous pamphlet bearing the same short title. This was Sir James
Marriott's <hi rend="italic">M&eacute;moire Justificatif de la conduite de la Grande
Bretagne, en arr&ecirc;tant les navires &eacute;trangers et les munitions
de guerre, destin&eacute;es aux insurgens de l'Amerique</hi> (Londres:
Imprim&eacute; par T. Harrison et S. Brooke, MDCCLXXIX). The
Marriott
pamphlet, which Norton found attributed to Gibbon in the French
archives, was an able statement of maritime law written by a judge
of the Admiralty court. Printed at the expense of the English
government and circulated by Sir Joseph Yorke, ambassador at the
Hague, it was directed to "all
the Maritime Neutral Courts, with great success."<ref target="f005.21.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref> A comparison of the subject matter
in
the two <hi rend="italic">M&eacute;moires</hi> strongly suggests that Marriott's
would
have been of far more interest to Russian or Turk than Gibbon's
pamphlet, and should receive long overdue recognition.</p>


</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="6"><head/>
<p>A concluding word may be devoted to the question of Gibbon's
motives for writing the <hi rend="italic">M&eacute;moire Justificatif</hi>. Early
and
late commentators have carelessly implied or stated that the
historian received his place at the Board of Trade for penning this
pamphlet.<ref target="f005.21.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref> The origin of this idea
is laid at the feet of John Wilkes by Gibbon's bibliographer (p.
26) with little consideration for either eighteenth-century
politics or the clear implications of Wilkes's statements. It is
evident from simple chronological study that Gibbon did not receive
his post as a reward for having written the <hi rend="italic">M&eacute;moire
Justificatif</hi>.<ref target="f005.21.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> Gibbon would
scarcely have written in anticipation of payment. "I will never
make myself the Champion of a party," he declared. Such
prostitution

<pb n="005.197"/>

of pen was beneath him. But having accepted office, and in large
part for financial reasons, he could no less afford to refuse the
"very polite request" to become "the Advocate of my Country against
a foreign enemy" (Prothero, I, 371-372). The political morality of
the eighteenth century allowed a man of letters who accepted
pension or place to become the anonymous mistress of a mercenary
government, but did not demand a public display of the
relationship. John Wilkes was not in error when he noted the
plethora of literary state papers <hi rend="italic">"since</hi> the ministerial
purchase" of Gibbon's pen. He rightly viewed the <hi rend="italic">M&eacute;moire
Justificatif</hi> as no more than the product of the ardent zeal of
"a very late ministerial convert," a task "commanded by a
task-master more cruel than those of Egypt." He did not baldly
assert that "Gibbon was made a Lord Commissioner of Trade as a
reward for writing it," as Norton implies (p. 26), but to the
contrary deplored that "a lord of trade [had] been
employed to traffic in the grossest abuse" of political
polemic.<ref target="f005.21.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref> True, Wilkes blamed
Gibbon for accepting a position at the hands of a government of
which the historian disapproved, but his attack upon the author of
the <hi rend="italic">M&eacute;moire Justificatif</hi> was a reaction to the
undignified prostration of Clio before Mammon after the goddess's
prayers had been answered. For that Wilkes need not be so heartily
condemned&mdash;nor Gibbon so glibly exonerated.</p>

<div1 id="vol005.22" type="bibliography"><head type="main">
<name type="title">Two New Works of Robert
Southey</name>
<lb/><name type="author">Kenneth Curry</name>
</head>

<div2 type="section"><head/>
<p>A professional author such as Robert Southey, who made his living
by his pen, was frequently tempted to write for the sole purpose of
financial gain, and more than once he did a pamphlet or book with
only the briefest mention in his correspondence. It is, therefore,
likely that some of his works may have escaped notice when there
has been no reference to the work in his published correspondence,
and when, in addition, he did not put his name upon the
title-page.</p>

<p>In preparing an edition of Southey's unpublished correspondence,
I have found allusions to two works of his not mentioned elsewhere:
an edition of Don J. Ignatius Molina's <hi rend="italic">The Geographical,
Natural, and Civil History of Chili,</hi> London, 1809; and <hi rend="italic">An
Exposure of the Misrepresentations and Calumnies in Mr Marsh's
Review of Sir George Barlow,</hi> London, 1813. To neither work can
any claim for literary greatness be made, but as each represents an
addition to the corpus of Southey's works a brief description of
them is in order.</p>

<p>The Molina was a sheer bit of editorial routine undertaken at
the request of Longman. On 10 August 1809 Southey wrote his uncle,
the Reverend Herbert Hill:

<q>Molina is translated by an American and printed in America.
Longman sent it to me to know if it should be reprinted here, and
I added the two Appendices and a few notes.</q>

Again on 31 August 1809 he wrote to his uncle:

<q>What I have done to Molina has been very little. I have only the
first volume in the original and have seen none of the
translations, which however the American translator, whoever he be,
seems diligently to have examined. It seemed a proper place for
abstracts from Agueros and Falkner, and accordingly there I placed
them, with a few stray notes thro the volumes.</q></p>

<pb n="005.198"/>

<p>An investigation of the Molina volumes bears out the implication
in Southey's remarks that his work was perfunctory, but as he was
always conscientious in whatever he undertook, he drew upon his
extensive knowledge of South American history and provided an
annotation from those authorities likely to prove illuminating. The
English edition is a reprint of the translation printed at
Middletown, Connecticut, for I. Ripley, in 1808, and attributed to
"An American Gentleman," who actually was Richard Alsop
(1761-1815), a resident of Middletown and one of the Hartford
Wits.<ref target="f005.22.01" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref> To the English edition
Southey contributed the following note (p. viii):

<q>In addition to what is said above, the English Editor has to
state, that he has, from documents in his possession, added a few
occasional Notes, which are distinguished by the letters
<hi rend="italic">E.E</hi>. He has also subjoined, from Falkner's Description of
Patagonia, a further elucidation of the language of the Auracanos;
and two Appendixes, the first containing an Account of the
Archipelago of Chiloe, from the Descripcion Historial of that
Province, by P. F. Pedro Gonzales de Agueros, printed at Madrid, in
1791; and the second, an Account of the Native Tribes who inhabit
the Southern Extremity of South America, extracted chiefly from
Falkner's Work.</q>

Notes so signed will be found on the following pages: Volume I, 31,
34, 37, 38, 66, 69, 99, 103, 116, 150, 151, 156, 158, 160, 191,
201, 226, 268, 273, 311, 313; Volume II, 26, 84, 85, 177, 217, 260,
275. The two appendices will be found in Volume II, 367-374,
375-385.</p>


<p>The bibliographical description of these volumes is as follows
(copies at Yale, the Library of Congress, the London Library, and
the British Museum; the copy with the half-title is in my own

<p>The Barlow pamphlet is a more important piece of work. Southey's
uncle, the Reverend Herbert Hill, the rector of Streatham, was a
neighbor of the Barlow family, whom Southey had met upon his visits
to the Hills. Sir George Hilaro Barlow, Bart. (1762-1847), soon
after his appointment as governor-general of India in 1807 had been
forced to put down a mutiny. Many of the cashiered officers on
their return to England wrote pamphlets against the Barlow
administration; he was recalled in 1812, Lord Minto was sent in his
place, and the peerage which the King had been willing to grant
Barlow was withheld. Charles Marsh's pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">Review of Some
Important Passages in the late Administration of Sir G. H. Barlow,
Bart. at Madras</hi> (London, 1813), had particularly disturbed the
Barlows, and it was against what they felt were Marsh's calumnies
that they wished to vindicate Sir George's name. Through the
mediation of Southey's uncle, it may be understood, his aid was
sought. A long letter
of Southey's to Mr Hill (21 May 1813) discusses the whole matter.

<q>You know what I have written upon the Madras disturbances. The
Carnatic Debts are not touched upon in that chapter. I had however
gone thro all the papers concerning them which were laid before
Parliament. My opinion was as much in favour of Sir G[eorge].
B[arlow]. in them as to the beginning of the business, as it was in
the rebellion at the end. But in the progress I thought he acted in
more than one instance, oppressively. You will believe me when I
say that I should have been heartily glad to have thought him right
throughout.</q>

<q>If however Marsh's book applies chiefly to the Carnatic Debts,
there is no reason why I should decline to answer him upon that
point: and upon the general question the necessity of suppressing
the rebellious spirit of the army, and the vigour with which it was
done, too much cannot be said in praise of the Government of
Madras. I have therefore no other feeling of repugnance at
undertaking this task than that it makes me feel, for the first
time in my life, like one whose talents are for sale, and who write
not because he has information to communicate, amusement to offer
or opinions to enforce, but wholly and solely because he is paid
for writing. In this there is something humiliating. But a feeling
of pride ought not to stand in the way, if there be no stronger
reason.</q>

<q>I know Marsh, and if we were Bedouin Arabs he would have a right
to expect my protection, for he once ate bread and cheese and drank
porter at some lodgings which I was occupying for a week in London.
He came uninvited and unwelcome as well, and Wm Taylor in whose
company he introduced himself would fain have been excused from
bringing him, for Marsh is a worthless fellow. He was then going to
India, and was not without fear of being shipt in a different
direction, for among many dishonesties he had committed one which
brought him within reach of the law, and I believe he had recourse
to some shifts and stratagems to get safely on board.</q>

<q>Let me see the plan which is sketched out, that I may chew the
cud upon it. The business of course must be kept secret, and if it
will not occupy much time, it had better be done at Streatham,
where any alterations may be made as soon as they are suggested,
and no time lost in a distant correspondence.</q>

On July 18th Southey added a few details in writing to his uncle:

<q>The nature of the reply seems to be clearly chalked out, and my
thorough knowledge of the character of the man who is to be
answered gives me no little advantage. If you think my personal
appearance at Streatham is not necessary, send me Marsh's book and
the other documents. . . . Believe me I should be heartily glad to
find reason for believing that Sir G. B. was as right in every part
of his conduct as he was in the great points of dispute. Be this as
it may, I shall know how to take the strong ground and to read
Marsh a lecture upon subordination.</q></p>

<p>A few notes on the foregoing passages are necessary. Southey's
phrase "what I have written upon the Madras disturbances" refers to
his discussion of the very

<pb n="005.200"/>

problem in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Annual Register,</hi> III, part I,
260-281 (Chapter 8), and his treatment of the matter there was so
much in accord with what he was to say in the pamphlet that he
needed to feel no qualms of conscience concerning the partisan
stand he must take. A full, modern account of the troubles at
Madras&mdash;and a defence of Barlow's action&mdash;will be found in
Sir
Alexander Cardew's <hi rend="italic">The White Mutiny</hi> (London,
1929).</p>

<p>Southey's pamphlet quotes at great length from Marsh's work and
answers his charges one by one. The composition is plainly
Southey's&mdash;written in the straightforward, unaffected prose of his
biographies, letters, and <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> articles. Marsh's
pamphlet had been published after the matter was thought to be
concluded, and Southey accuses Marsh of trying to reopen an old
issue. Marsh's career is cited to his disadvantage, and the
testimony of Lord Minto (Barlow's successor) is quoted in Barlow's
favor.</p>

<p>Very occasionally the reader will find an idea that is
especially characteristic of Southey but that has no particular
connection with the controversy. Southey's opinion of the price
paid by the Anglo-Indian for his fortune may serve as an
illustration:

<q>The British adventurer in India pays a dear price for the
fortune of which he goes in search; he leaves his parents and his
friends, and the companions of his youth; time passes on; they for
whose sake he has eagerly looked on to the hour of his return, drop
off; and in that state of mind which arises from remembrance, and
sorrow, and hope delayed, he repines at his lot, and perhaps
silently acknowledges that no accumulation of wealth can be an
adequate recompence for the sacrifice of the best years of his
life, and the best affections of the heart. (p. 15)</q></p>

of a &dollar;400 loan from the Marquis de La Fayette he began his
publishing career in Philadelphia. Among his earlier publications
were the <hi rend="italic">Pennsylvania Herald,</hi> first issued on January 25,
1785; the <hi rend="italic">Columbia Magazine,</hi> in October, 1786, with five
partners; and in 1792, the first book printed with Greek type in
America.<ref target="f005.23.02" n="2"><hi rend="super">2</hi></ref></p>



<p>Although he had been a printer in Ireland before fleeing to
avoid persecution for political pamphleteering, Carey did not do
all of his own printing. When, in 1793, he decided to publish a
second American edition of Jefferson's <hi rend="italic">Notes on
Virginia</hi><ref target="f005.23.03" n="3"><hi rend="super">3</hi></ref> in 1,000 copies,
he
engaged Parry Hall at "149 Chestnut near Fourth" to be the
printer.</p>


<p>Hall composed the work in Edmund Fry's <hi rend="italic">Pica Roman No.
1</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">Pica Italic No. 2</hi>.<ref target="f005.23.04" n="4"><hi rend="super">4</hi></ref>
As
soon as he had pulled a proof sheet, he sent it to Jefferson on
July 25, 1793, with a note:

<q>Parry Hall incloses a Proof Sheet of the Notes on Virginia;
which with the greatest respect and a high sense of obligation, he
lays before the Hon<hi rend="super">ble</hi> M<hi rend="super">r.</hi> Jefferson.<ref target="f005.23.05" n="5"><hi rend="super">5</hi></ref></q></p>



<p>So far as can be determined, Jefferson made no textual changes;
however, a curious alteration occurred which cannot be attributed
specifically to either the author or printer. In all prior editions
of the <hi rend="italic">Notes,</hi> numbers (in parentheses) had been used to
refer to the appended material containing Charles Thomson's
comments on various passages in the text. Hall's sheets, however,
used upper-case letters<ref target="f005.23.06" n="6"><hi rend="super">6</hi></ref> in lieu of
numbers. This change persists in most of the subsequent editions of
the <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> and is an indication of the copy utilized in their
composition.<ref target="f005.23.07" n="7"><hi rend="super">7</hi></ref></p>



<p>Hall and his daughter are listed among those who died between
the first of August and the middle of December in the Philadelphia
plague of 1793.<ref target="f005.23.08" n="8"><hi rend="super">8</hi></ref> Thereafter,

<pb n="005.202"/>

the firm of Wrigley and Berriman moved into his shop and completed
the printing of Carey's edition of the <hi rend="italic">Notes,</hi> continuing
with signature E. By the time they got to working sheet O, Carey
increased his edition to 1500 copies,<ref target="f005.23.09" n="9"><hi rend="super">9</hi></ref> and Wrigley and Berriman were
forced to
reset and run 500 additional sheets of the first three gatherings,
B, C, and D. This explains the differences in the settings of these
first three sheets. The two different states are easily
distinguished. Hall ran his sheets on thin or ordinary paper, while
Wrigley and Berriman used a thick paper water-marked A L MASSO that
is clearly superior to the ordinary paper.<ref target="f005.23.10" n="10"><hi rend="super">10</hi></ref></p>




<p>The presswork was probably done on a full sheet imposed eight
pages up, in a "work and turn" operation; thus, 750 sheets were
printed on one side, and the sheets were then turned and worked on
the other side with the same eight pages. Each sheet thus produced
two copies of the same signature.<ref target="f005.23.11" n="11"><hi rend="super">11</hi></ref>
Printing was completed by November 10, 1794, and the bill for the
job was submitted to Carey.<ref target="f005.23.12" n="12"><hi rend="super">12</hi></ref> From
this bill we can learn the full details of the cost and production
of the book. The bill lists the following items:

<list>
<item><hi rend="italic">To printing 1500 copies Jeffersons Notes on Virginia
containing 42 forms and 4 pages 8<hi rend="super">vo</hi></hi>.
This means, of course, 336 pages + 4, i.e., 42&frac12; formes or
really 43 formes to be charged at press.</item>

<item>COMPOSITION
<hi rend="italic">To 40 forms 6888 m a form &amp;c.mmat; 2/9 a thousand is 19/3 a form
 38.10.0</hi>
Composition is still computed by the thousand ems. An em is the
square of the body of a type. Each text-page of this book required
861 ems, or 6888 ems for the eight-page forme.</item>

<item><hi rend="italic">To 2 pages pica
           4.9</hi>
These are the title, advertisement, and contents pages. Probably
the three pages were lumped together and charged as two normal pica
pages.</item>

<item><hi rend="italic">To 2 forms long primer 11026 ms a form &amp;c.mmat; 2/9 a
thousand
is 30/3 a form 3.0.6</hi>

<pb n="005.203"/>

These two formes, or 16 pages, are the tables in the text. They
average about 1378 ems per page.</item>

<item><hi rend="italic">To 2 pages brevier 4752 ms &amp;c.mmat; 2/9
          13.9</hi>
These are the small footnotes and such matter. They have 2376 ems
per page.
The composition to this point makes 42 formes plus 4 pages, as
totaled above.</item>

<item><hi rend="italic">To a table equal to 3 pages long primer 3675 &amp;c.mmat; 2/9
          11.0</hi>
This was undoubtedly the folding table of Indian Tribes, and
represents the cost of composition only.</item>

<item>PRESSWORK
<hi rend="italic">To 43 forms at press each form 6 Tok &amp;c.mmat; 2/9 is 16/6 a form
  35.9.6</hi>
Since a token is 250 impressions, and the edition was 1500, 6
tokens were required. Paper was no doubt furnished by Carey.<ref target="f005.23.13" n="13"><hi rend="super">13</hi></ref></item>


<item><hi rend="italic">To presswork of the table 6 Tok
         16.6</hi>
Although this was a smaller forme than the regular eight pages, it
took the pressman just as long to run it; hence there was the same
charge as for a regular forme, or 16/6.
The total bill was &pound;79.6.0; but since Parry Hall had already
worked 1,000 copies of the first three formes, this was deducted
from the bill:</item>

<item><hi rend="italic">Deduct 4 Tok from each of the 3 first forms is 12 Tok &amp;c.mmat;

2/9   1.13.0</hi>
The final bill, then, was &pound;77.13.0. The printing was completed
on November 10, 1794, and the imprint dated November 12th. Carey
advertised the book as available ". . . in about three or four
weeks . . ." in the <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia Gazette</hi> of Monday,
November
17th. On November 26th he listed the <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> as ". . . neatly
bound&mdash;1 dollar and a half."</item>

<p>This letter was apparently addressed to James Russell Lowell,
then the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi>. "Bardic Symbols"
was published in the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic</hi> for April, 1860 (V, 445-447)
without the questioned lines. Later, when Whitman included the poem
in <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> as "As I ebb'd with the ocean of life"
(one of the "Sea-Drift" poems), the lines were restored. It is
enlightening that only a few years before this, Lowell had deleted
a line from Thoreau's "Chesuncook," without permission when he
published it in the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic</hi>. Thoreau took him strongly to
task for the liberty and refused thereafter to submit any of his
works to Lowell's editing. Apparently Lowell learned his lesson and
thereafter consulted his authors before censoring their works.</p>

<q>Walt Whitman</q>

<p>Dr. Knortz was a German-American scholar who translated many
American writers for German-speaking audiences. A large part of
Whitman's correspondence with him is printed in Horst Frenz's "Walt
Whitman's Letters to Karl eaking audiences. A large part of
Whitman's correspondence with him is printed in Horst Frenz's "Walt
Whitman's Letters to Karl Knortz" in the May, 1948, <hi rend="italic">American
Literature</hi> (XX, 155-163). Mr Frenz derived his texts from the
appendix of Knortz's monograph on Whitman. The original manuscripts
for the following letters printed by Frenz are in the Barrett
collection: November 14, 1882; November 15, 1882; June 19, 1883;
January 10, 1884; April 27, 1885; June 14, 1886 (for which there
are important additions, see below); March 24, 1887; May 3, 1887;
September 10, 1888; January 8, 1889; and February 14, 1889. They
differ in no important details from Mr. Frenz's transcription
except that he occasionally spells out some of Whitman's elisions
in full and in the letter of November 14, 1882, transposes a
postscript into the main body of the letter. There are also
included in the Barrett
collection this letter of September 11, 1883 and one for June 14,
1887, for which see below.</p>

<p>Knortz was for several years pastor of the German Independent
Protestant Congregation in Johnstown, Pa. In 1882 he moved to New
York to do free lance editorial work. Although by this time there
were several people translating Whitman into German, it seems
likely that Whitman was referring here to Ferdinand Freiligrath who
made the first translations in an essay in <hi rend="italic">Augsburger Allgemeine
Zeitung</hi> for April 24, 1868. Dr. R. M. Bucke's book was his

<p>Although an international controversy had raged in 1876 over
Whitman's need of financial assistance, when Robert Buchanan
published an appeal for aid for him in an English journal, his
English admirers continued to help him. Traubel includes several
letters (II, 330; III, 65) from William Michael Rossetti in the
fall of 1885 sending contributions. Herbert Gilchrist was the son
of Whitman's ardent admirer Anne Gilchrist.</p>

Knortz had not returned it, complaining to Horace Traubel to that

taken by George C. Cox, but only one, which Whitman called "the
laughing philosopher," was satisfactory to him. Cox sold these
photographs to the general public, and, according to Whitman, was
the only photographer who had the courtesy to pay him royalties.
Whitman apparently never had the opportunity of meeting Knortz, for
more than a year later, on September 3, 1888, he told Traubel that
his curiosity to meet him was still great.</p></div3>

<name type="author">Ernst Kyriss</name>
</head>

<p>Remarks on E. Wead, "Early Binding Stamps of Religious
Significance in Certain American Libraries: A Supplemental Report,"
<hi rend="italic">Studies in Bibliography,</hi> II (1949).</p>

<p>In connection with Miss Wead's contribution (the first part of
which, published in 1935, is not accessible to me), it may be of
interest to many experts to learn some further particulars
concerning the origin of the binding stamps illustrated therein.
Inasmuch as a rather large number of bindings for the workshops
named below are assembled in my book, <hi rend="italic">Der verzierte gotische
Einband im alten deutschen Sprachgebiet</hi> (Stuttgart, 1951),
reference will be made to it for the sake of simplicity.</p>

<p>The outer border of Fig. 4 is not made by a roll but by a
rectangular die with two lilies placed one above the other. The
stamp of the fall of man reproduced in Fig. 7 belongs to No. 100 of
the Cologne workshop in my book. Of this workshop I was able to
identify 72 bindings in 42 different ornamental forms of the last
quarter of the 15th century. The binding of which Fig. 8
illustrates a stamp was probably made in Danzig. The rectangular
forms of the Annunciation (Fig. 9) together with the two fighting
cocks are found in the workshop of the Benedictine monastery
Wiblingen (No. 36) as well as in that of the Ulm bookbinder (No.
126). Of the latter I have authenticated 252 bindings with 152
different stamps; of the former, 340 bindings with the same number
of stamps. The Adoration of the Magi (Fig. 11) is to be allotted to
the 38 different stamps of the monastery of Brothers of the Cross
in Cologne (No. 17). Not from Kempten but from the Vienna Dominican
monastery mentioned by Wead
on page 72 come the stamps of Ill. 16 and 17. This monastery had at
its disposal a large number of especially well cut forms.</p>
