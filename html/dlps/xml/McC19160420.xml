            <p>
            We arrived at 
            Luxeuil last evening after a
            strange and varied trip, during
            which we went to Rosnay, where
            we found orders were wrong, and
            we should have gone to Luxeuil; then
            in a special machine we were taken
            to Rheims and then Epernay.  At
            Lure our Captain, who is a fine
            chap, met us in one of our
            touring cars and motored us to
            aviation camp here.  “Sixty two
            pilots were killed last month” was
            his cheerful greeting.  Then we were 
            taken to meet Captaine Att.  This 
            jovial soul was rubbing his hands
            and arranging eight little boxes
            containing Croix de Guerre (sl. [sic] “For
            the families of those killed on
            our last trip” said he smiling.
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0299" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            “You see there’s lots of work.”
            </p><p>
            Well our machines won’t be
            here for a week and so we’ve
            got a few days left us to
            enjoy life.  And so we are doing.
            We have splendid quarters; eat
            with the Capt. and Lieutenant at 
            the best hotel and have an
            orderly to shine shoes take
            care of rooms and arrange for
            our baths which we take at 
            the famous springs next door
            to us.  C’est dure cette sale
            Guerre!”  The main trouble is
            that we’re 65 kilometers from
            the lines and that’s too far
            for an escadrille de chasse.
            We expect that we will form
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0298" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            here, get in some work
            and then move on.  Our
            escadrille has a beautiful
            equipment.  // new Fiat <unclear>Canions [sp?]</unclear>,
            two staff card, 4 trucks and
            all sorts of tents, etc.  There
            are over 70 men in the
            escadrille and, as at present,
            we are but ten pilots, including
            the Captain and Lieutenant, you
            see being a pilot is quite 
            a comfortable feeling.  In the
            ambulance I was a driver and
            did repairs and ran around on
            orders.  Here we have the
            driver come for us; an adjutant
            sees that our orderly does what
            we want and for the first
            few days its hard to get used
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0300" n="[p.4]"/>
            
            to, especially after being a 2nd
            class soldier at Pau.  The whole
            thing reminds me somewhat of
            the custom in ancient days of
            treating a man like a king before
            the sacrifice of his blood to the 
            Gods.  But I don’t care what
            the motive is so long as the
            treatment lasts.  What I want is to
            get a chance at some Boches and
            I’d trade em [sic] all the comfort for
            that.
