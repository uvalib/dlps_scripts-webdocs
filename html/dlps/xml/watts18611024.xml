                    poor Thom Brown<add place="top" hand="author">"Watts half brother"</add> is dead, shot<lb/>
                    by a bullet just above the eye<lb/>
                    as he was going out to picket<lb/>
                    duty, and I feel so sad that<lb/>
                    I must <unclear>[-]</unclear> you a few lines<lb/>
                    I went to see the boys last week<lb/>
                    and failed to see them in <reg orig="cones-|quence">conesquence</reg><lb/>
                    of a general move among<lb/>
                    the troops, so that it was almost<lb/>
                    impossible to find where they were<lb/>
                    I feel so sorry that I did not<lb/>
                    See Thom!  Poor fellow!  In the <lb/>
                    Twinkling of an eye he is suddenly<lb/>
                    cut down and hurried into <reg orig="eter-|nity">eternity.</reg><lb/>
                    Oh! My children do you not<lb/>
                    see the importance of trying to be<lb/>
                    ready?  At any moment we may<lb/>
                    be called away, and how awful<lb/>

                    to enter the presence of God<lb/>
                    unprepared!  Try my children to<lb/>
                    give y'r hearts unreservedly to the<lb/>
                    Lord now while you are young,<lb/>
                    and you will never have cause to<lb/>
                    regret it thr'o life.  Last Monday<lb/>
                    we had a very severe battle near<lb/>
                    Lees burg, which began in Mr <reg orig="Trun-|dle's">Trundle's</reg><lb/>
                    field.  Early in the morning<lb/>
                    some forty Mississippians went out<lb/>
                    as a scouting party and came in<lb/>
                    sight of five or six companies of <lb/>
                    Yankees who were marching up to <lb/>
                    town.  Ours charged upon them and<lb/>
                    routed them.  Later in the day many <lb/>
                    more came up and for three or<lb/>
                    four hours there was very severe<lb/>
                    fighting between some 2500 of our <lb/>
                    forces and 3 to 5000 of the enemy<lb/>
                    We whipped them, taking upwards<lb/>
                    of 700 prisoners, killing some 200<lb/>

                    and causing it is thought more<lb/>
                    than 300. to be drowned.  As our<lb/>
                    troops ran them to the river so<lb/>
                    many jumped on one <add place="top" hand="author">canal</add> boat that<lb/>
                    it sunk and nearly every one was <lb/>
                    drowned.  They say the screams were<lb/>
                    awful.  One general was killed<lb/>
                    a colonel taken prisoner and many<lb/>
                    other officers of lower grade.<lb/>
                    Well I have such a head ache<lb/>
                    to night.  I cant write more<lb/>
                    with any comfort.  I expect to <lb/>
                    start for Amherst about the 6<hi rend="super">th</hi><lb/>
                    of Nov: if nothing prevent and<lb/>
                    will probably see you the last<lb/>
