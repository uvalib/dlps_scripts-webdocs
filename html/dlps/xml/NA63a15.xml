                    <salute>My own precious darling,</salute>
                </opener>

                <p> I have just returned from "Ball Call" and seated myself in the comfortable room
                    with pen in hand to pour out on paper thoughts for your eyes alone, which shall
                    again remind you of my strong devotion for <hi rend="underline"> my own loved
                        one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p> I recieved the <unclear/> letter from <unclear>Welfare Goon</unclear> and
                    Barnum, last evening. Nothing could have give one greater pain that to know that
                    you dearest; had suffered a relapse. Your last letter was so hopeful and
                    charming that I was much encouraged, but as you my dearest; "There is many a
                        <unclear>livest?</unclear> the <unclear/> and the life." May God in his
                    great mercy give you strength so that you may not again be brought to your bed.
                    I think there was nothing which kept me from utter dispair, except the knowledge
                        <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0260"/> that you had recieved a furlough
                    and that God <unclear/> illing, you will soon be home. But love, will not the
                    exertion be too great? Will not the journey be too long for you to undertake in
                    your <unclear/> weak state? </p>
                <p> Oh Charlie, <hi rend="underline">darling</hi> one I tremble. Would that you were
                    but here, But I will be hopeful and trust in God's goodness. </p>
                <p> Seth informed me that the arrival of any letters gave you great pleasure, I was
                    gratified to know it; I feared they were written with so much <unclear/> that
                    they would but thend to make you worse, But darling, do not read my sad
                    thoughts, read only the happy ones, or at-least do not dwell upon the sad ones.
                    I will try and write cheerful loving letters, just such as you <hi
                        rend="underline"> dear <unclear/>
                    </hi> Charlie needs. </p>
                <p> How happy I should be love, could I but watch over you as you return to health,
                    I do not believe any one can do <unclear/> as well I as I should. How devoted I
                    should be. When the pain tortured you, I would try <del hand="h1">and so</del>
                    drive it away and soothe you with <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0261"/>
                    gentle words, such as none but <hi rend="underline"> your Addie</hi> has a right
                    to utter. Then when you were able and could endure it, I would read some
                    splendid work, from which we could obtain instruction, and for one <unclear/> .
                    Would be not be happy dearest? In my dreams I was with you last night. I went to
                    sleep wishing that I could fly to you. I had no sooner fallen into a gentle
                    slumber than I was lifted from my bed and <unclear/> far far away, over
                    mountains, hills, rivers, citites and towns, on on till at last I found myself
                    in a dark comfortable foom surrounded by <unclear/> . Some were lying on rough
                    beds, others walking around as if tired of life and wished to walk into
                    eternity, <unclear/> I was told that I was in a hospital and that those
                    frightful objects were dear brave soldiers. </p>
                <p> Mentally, I asked if Charlie was there and began searching. Earnestly I gazed in
                    each face hoping to see one familiar glance one <hi rend="underline"> loving
                    </hi> one, I looked in one corner and noticed a rude couch of straw <pb n="4"
                        entity="DSSR_000000766_0262"/> accompanied by <hi rend="underline"> my
                        Charlie </hi>/ I needed no second glance to convince me, besides over it
                    <unclear/> born, his face animated and his blue-eyes humming with joy as he
                    asked, "How you <unclear/> ." I flew to thee darling and awaken <unclear/>
                    Carrie. But darling <unclear/> Carrie wishes to <unclear/> a word of
                    enocouragement; and this with hers will be all that you must read at one time. I
                    will write a line to <unclear/> who so <unclear/> to me for you, and if you are
                    proper please give it them. Darling even to have you with me I remain as ever
                    thine own true, </p>
