                        <p>Pleasant all day. also very warm. We had some baked beans for Breakfast
                            which were <add hand="author" place="top">very</add> good. All we wanted
                            to make it a splendid Breakfast was <del hand="author">
                                <hi rend="line-through">hard</hi>
                            </del> brown bread, some thing that I have not seen for a good while.
                            Inspection was at seven O clock.</p>
                        <p>At Dinner time, Mitchell and myself bought a dozen eggs for twenty five
                            cents. (No dinner was given us, except hard bread) I got a piece of
                            pork, and a spider and fried six of them. Which made a very good dinner
                            for us. In the Afternoon I walked down to the Run and took a bath. I
                            crossed the run and went to a house about a mile from where I crossed;
                            up the creek was the Battle field. I went into the House and asked for a
                            drink of water, which was given me. I asked the man, that was <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000000961_0002" n="np"/> in the House, if he was there
                            when the Battle took place. He said his Family was there, but he himself
                            was at Manassas, The Rebels had ordered him there, to join the Secesh
                            Army, a few days before the Battle. He had got rid some way or reather,
                            of going into the ranks, and the Rebels had concluded to let him return
                            home. He was at Manassas waiting for an opportunity to return home when
                            the Battle took place. The woman that was in the house said that she was
                            frightened most to death, and never wanted to be so near two Army's
                            again. I have never been over all the Battle ground yet, but think I
                            shall some day. The man said that he had never been on to the field, and
                            never shall if he can help it. He went to the edge of it the day after
                                <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0003" n="np"/> the Battle He saw three
                            dead bodies laying on the ground, which sickened him of going any
                            farther. The Chaplain preached reather a curious Sermon to us to day,
                            but a very good one, Where do you think he took his text from. From Mark
                            Tapley, a Character in one of Dickens Novels.<ref n="1" target="n1">{1}</ref>
                            The text is always be jolly He went on to say that, <del

                            than Soldiers. He said if a Soldier started on a March with a Knapsack
                            weighing from twenty to thirty pounds, should grumble, complain and
                            weep, the Knapsack would weigh <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0004" n="np"/>

                            when he reaches the end of ten miles his Knap would weigh thirty pounds
                            still, it might in some cases weigh sixty but never over. He did not
                            mean by being jolly to laugh at all the bad jokes that some got off, or
                            to made bad jokes, but good innocent jokes, something that our Concience
                            approved off. Mark Tapley was a man, that in what ever circumstances he
                            was placed in to be always jolly. I think <add hand="author" place="top"

                        <p>To day is the last day of June. At ten O clock we were mustered in for
                            our pay, by the Magor In the afternoon, there was a Brigade drill under
                            Gen Hartsuff, as there was only twelve files to go out when it is a
                            Brigade drill I was was one that was excused. Mitchell and myself bought
                            a paper of Corn Starch of the Sutler for twenty five cts, also some
                            sugar, and for supper we had some tasty pudding, the first that I have
                            yet had. It was first rate. No dress Parade, pleasant all day.</p>

                        <p>Pleasant and warm all day. We drilled this morning in the Skirmishing.
                            After drill I stole out of Camp and went about <pb

                            before I came to a House, in which I found nothing but colored people
                            who informed me that their Master and Mistress had gone South when the
                            Rebels left here. The man has two sons in the Rebel Army. I tried to get
                            some milk but could not, going back I found some black berries, which
                            are just beginning to get ripe. I got back about three O clock, and
                            found Mitchell had got some Corn Starch pudding made for me. We had no

                            eight Oclock. It was a great disappointment to a New York Regt, in
                            Rickets Brigade. They had got their Camp fixed up splendidly, and had
                            commenced to put up fire<ref n="3" target="n3">{3}</ref> which were sent

                        <p> I was supernumery of the Guard this morning. After Guard mounting I went
                            to the brook and had a bath. I then went and got all the Cherries that I
                            wanted to eat. I took a walk around the Country. On my travels I came to
                            a mill, the owner of which was close by sitting, on a stone wall talking
                            with a couple of Soldiers. He seemed anxious to have our forces whip the
                            Rebels at Richmond, and that the War would end as soon as possible. The
                            opinion I formed of him was, that he sympathized with the South, but
                            that he thought it was useless for them to hold out any longer and was
                            in hope our forces would conquor as soon <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000000961_0014" n="12"/> as possible. He denounced the
                            Rebel Leaders. The next house I came to I stoped and took dinner, as it
                            was after two Oclock. I had been away from Camp ever since eight Oclock.
                            I found the people here very pleasant and kind. There was two persons in
                            the House, one a Lady of about the age of Fifty, and her daughter, who
                            was about twenty five or six years of age. Here I met two Soldiers, one
                            from this Regt, and one from the New York Ninth. The Youngest Lady
                            entertained us for nearly three hours. She said that she had three
                            brothers in the Rebel Army, whose time of enlistment had expired some
                            time ago, but the Conscript Law that was passed, held them in Service
                            over their time. She thought that Law very unjust, and denounced the <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000000961_0015" n="13"/> the Rebel Leaders more
                            severly, then the Miller did. She tried to prevent her Brothers from
                            joining the Army in the first place. When the Rebel forces were at

                            took dinner yesterday I found that some of the troops belonging to
                            Duryeas Brigade, had been acting very rudely. They came to the house and
                            killed some of their Chickens Geese and Sheep, broke into their Spring
                            House and took all their Butter and Milk. All this was done right before
                            the face and eyes of the women of the House. When I was there they would
                            sit on the front door step and shout at the Geese and Turkeys in the
                            yard. I tried to persuade them not to act so, but it did not do any
                            good. The man of the Farm went off to the Generals to try and get a
                            guard. The folks were glad to see me and they persuaded me to stop to
                            Dinner, and what Soldiers, that were in the yard that had acted right,

                        <p>After dinner, I walked along the road leading to Town. I passed a House
                            belonging to a free Negro, and saw two Soldiers trying to catch his
                            Chickens. The next house I came to belonged to a poor Widow Woman. Her
                            Husband died in March last, and her daughter in May leaving her all
                            alone with an old Negro Servant. The Soldiers had been there took all
                            the bees she had except one hive, all the vegetables she had in her
                            small garden, broke into her spring house, stole two jars of pickled
                            Cherries, and every thing they could lay their hands on. All these
                            depradations seem to be committed by one Regt the 104 New York,
                            belonging to Duryeas Brigade. Never since I have been in the Army have I
                            seen such actions before <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0018" n="16"/> I

                            going further without a pass, So I turned about and came back to Camp.

                            the troops. A double guard had been order to be put on, and no one to
                            leave Camp without a pass. I thought I would get out of Camp before

                            started I went to the brook and had a bath after which, I went off for
                                <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0019" n="17"/> a walk, taking a different
                            direction from what I went yesterday. After walking about a mile I found
                            a splendid Cherry tree. The fruit looked to tempting to pass, so up the
                            tree I went, and eat my fill. I walked about a mile farther and came to
                            a road that branched off to the right. I followed this rode till I came
                            to a house, which belonged to a Widow Women by the name of Edmunds.
                            There was a number of Women in the House, and several young Ladies. I
                            went to the door and asked for a drink of Water, which was given me.
                            They were siting at the door, and they handed me a chair, and asked me
                            to sit down. I asked them if they had been troubled any by the Soldiers,
                            and I found that they had been served about as hard as their Neighbors.
                            In our <reg orig="conversa-|tion">conversation</reg>, the Old Lady
                            mentioned a Clock <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0020" n="18"/> that She had
                            that wanted repairing. I told her that I used to repair Clocks once, and
                            would look at it if she wanted me to. The Clock was brought into the
                            Entry and lay upon a table. It was an old Wooden Clock. I took it to
                            pieces and found the trouble was with the rope attached to the weight.
                            It had got off of the wheel and got twisted up. I fixed it and oiled it
                            a little, and set it to running which pleased the old Lady very much.
                            She wanted to pay me, but I told her I wanted nothing that she was
                            welcome to services that I had done her. She persuaded me to stop to
                            dinner. One of the Young Ladies name was Parrott, and lives in
                            Alexandrier. She came here to visit, about a year ago, and had not had

                            the most Gentlemanly Soldier they had yet seen. They sympathized with
                            the South, but did not know what Secession meant any more then, the Old

                            about the age of fifty that had been a cripple for seven years. He was a
                            Cobbler, but could work but very little. His wife had to do most of the
                            work. They said that they made between them, fifty to seventy five cents
                            a day which supported them. He had not walked for seven years and his

                            would make me. I reached camp about five Oclock. After Dress Parade I
                            bought some Coffee of the Sutler, and went to the House where I dined

                            Guard, Sergeant Shepard. Sergeant of the guard. At six O clock the <pb

                            go down to the Depot to unload Cars. We got back to Camp at eight O

                            hours. When we were at the Depot a heavy shower came up. At half past
                            eight Major General Banks came into Camp. We were prepared for him, and
                            when he entered, the Band played hail to the Chief amid the Cheers of
                            the Regt He made a short speech, and, said he I am happy to say that I

                            when you left me, or I might say when we were separated, for we never
                            would have separated our selves, I would not leave you, and I know you
                            would not separate from me, (cries of no no) therefore some one did that
                            little job for us. Since you left me, we had a quick race before us. We
                            were one to five, if we had been one to four, we would have held our
                            ground from that day till this. If you had been with me, we should not
                            have run the race at all. I have been invited to Boston, to speak in Old
                            Fanuel Hall. It would give me great pleasure to do so and if I can spare
                            the time I will go You fellow soldiers can do a great deal in the cause.
                            Every mail that go from this Camp there should be earnest appeals to
                            your Friends to come into the field and help you fight for the best

                            the legs, and put on a strap, for which I paid a Quarter. She was a
                            Rebel When I went to the house I told her, I supposed She Sympathysied
                            with the Rebels. She said she did. She though<ref n="4" target="n4"
                            >{4}</ref> the name of Rebel was reather harsh. I asked her, if a person
                            violated the laws of the United States if it was not Rebeling, therefore
                            she must be a Rebel. Said I during the old Revolution we were Rebels,
                            and gloried in that name for the Rebellion was just, therefore She had
                            not ought to think that the name of Rebel was any harsher than Southern

                            invited me to stop over night. I slept on a feather bed, the first one I
                            think that I have slept on since leaving Boston. I could not sleep two
                            hours together. I was so restless. If I had layed on the floor I should
                            have slept sound. This morning at Breakfast Mr Vowell told me that his
                            sons had left the Southern army, there time being up He said they were
                            some where near our lines, but did not dare to come home for fear they

                            O clock we strapped our Knapsacks to our backs and started for the Regt.
                            It was very warm; and we did not hurry. We would march about a mile, and
                            then hault for an hour. We reached the Regt distance of seven or eight
                            miles, about four O clock in the afternoon. We found the Regt camped on
                            the side of a hill, near, five or six buildings, which is called
                            Waterloo. There was some mills here, but were burnt The Camp is in a

                            After the great American Pope had gone, we went to our quarters. After

                            Battle field, on our way we met many Ambulances filled with the wounded,
                            and many on foot that had slight wounds, some limping on one foot and
                            some <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0052" n="50"/> with their hands in
                            slings, and many I am sorry to say that were not hurt at all, and were
                            nothing more than Cowards getting away from the field as soon as
                            possible. Most every one we met said that their Regt was all cut to
                            pieces. We knew their stories could not all be true, and were sorry to
                            see them coming back. The nearer we got to the battle field we could
                            hear the rifle shots quite plainly. It sounded like corn popping. Every
                            one we met said that the second Mass V were all cut to pieces. It was
                            dark before we reached the Battle field and the firing had stoped except
                            once in a while one occasional shot. We marched up near the front and
                            stacked arms in a field. We had our Canteens filled, and were laying
                            down on the grass to rest, (our Knapsack &amp; blanket were left in
                            a corn field two miles back) When Towers Brigade marched into the field,

                        <p>Page 51<lb/>Journal Continued<lb/> We immediately fell in and took our
                            arms from the stacks, and marched direct ahead. The Shells flew around
                            us in grand style, some plowed through the ground near us, but most of
                            them went to high. One, we thought came very near sweeping the heads of
                            most of our Company, it came so near. A number of the 11th PA were
                            wounded, and one killed and one wounded in the Ninth New York. We
                            advanced onto a piece of Woods, and had got within a hundred feet of it,
                            when we were fired upon. The Rebel pickets were in this woods. We were
                            marching, in column, and at trail arms. When we were fired upon, the Col
                            gave the order right blique<ref n="6" target="n6">{6}</ref>. We doubled
                            quick right bliquee, and the men squat so low to the ground that it was
                                <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0054" n="52"/> hard to see us. After
                            going this way about a hundred feet, we marched direct ahead and then
                            filed right. We did not return the shots. The 12th Mass V were behind us
                            and fired a few return shots. Capt Shirtleff of the 12 was shot through
                            the neck, and two more Officers and a private were wounded. Our Regt was
                            the only one of the Brigade that came off unharmed, and I think it was
                            the Cols order that saved us, for we were in the most dangerous place
                            being nearest to the woods. We went off to the right several hundred
                            yards, and behind a little hill, here we stacked arms. The role was
                            call, so as to see how many there was to go into battle, and to find out
                            who the cowards were, as a number had left the ranks on our way here. I
                            was sorry to see that two of this company had left. We then layed down
                            and <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0055" n="53"/> tried to get a little
                            sleep. We had to lay on the ground, we having left our Rubber blankets
                            this time. The Battery belonging to this Brigade was on our left. We had
                            layed on the ground but a short time, when the Rebels commenced throwing
                            shells at our Battery, which returned the fire. The Shells most of them
                            landed on a woods behind us about seventy or eighty yds. It looked
                            beautiful to see them go through the air. It looked like stars shooting.
                            They were beautiful but not very agreeable, if they came to near. After
                            remaining in this position about one hour. We received the order to fall
                            in and we went a little farther to the right, and again I layed down to
                            rest about one oclock the Artilery stoped firing and I fell asleep. We
                            were in the advance and layed very near the Rebels. We were as you might
                            say on picket. We had to lay with our <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0056"
                                n="54"/> Equipment on and within reach of our guns. There was a
                            spring within twenty feet of us and so near were we the Rebels that we
                            captured two or three that came to the Spring for Water, they not
                            knowing we were so near. Every order was given in a low tone. About
                            three oclock we were ordered to fallin and we marched to the rear
                            through a piece of woods, and into a corn field, where we again stacked
                            arms. We was close by a house where many of our wounded were. I layed
                            down again and went to sleep. <add hand="author" place="top">Sunday

                            to this Division for their cool behavior last night. I went over to the
                            house where the wounded are, and the scene was awful. All around the
                            yard they layed some with arms off some legs, another with gash in his

                        <p>This morning the Rebels proposed Armistice, till two oclock so that each
                            could bury their dead. I went down onto the Battle field. The sight was
                            horrible. I saw nearly two hundred dead bodies, the Sun made terrible
                            work with the dead. The Stench was very bad. The Rebels were the burying
                            their dead, and our men ours The rebels and Federal Soldiers were quite
                            sociable, drank from each others Canteens and talked of the War. They
                            are as sick of the work as we are. I saw two Soldiers one Federal and
                            one Rebel, recognize each other, as old acquaintances, both belonged in
                            the Same town somewhere in Western Virginia. The shook hands and had a
                            long talk together. Gen Hartsuff of this Brigade, and Gen Stuart of the
                            Rebel Cavalry (formerly of the same Class at West Point) spent two hours
                            together under a shady tree talking of old times. I was into the Rebel
                            lines some ways and nearly into their Camp. A Rebel Major rode up to me
                            and told me that I was farther then we were allowed to go. I told him,
                            that I guess I would turn about then. Some wounded were found on the
                            field this morning, having layed there since Saturday. The Battle field
                            was nearest to the Rebels lines, but neither side could go onto the
                            Battle field without danger of the other. We expected a fight after two
                            Oclock, but every thing remain quiet.</p>

                            on the road to Warrenton Junction. We did not know what to make of this,
                            backward movement, When about three miles this side of Culpepper. Our
                            Brigadier Gen Hartsuff told us that we were in the centre of a long
                            column, and we had to march as they marched, that before the march was
                            ended, it would be the hardest march we have yet born, So far we had
                            done it well and he hoped that we would continue on till the end, The
                            Brigade gave him three cheers, The roads were very dusty, about nine
                            Oclock in the evening <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0061" n="np"/> we
                            crossed the Rappahannock and bivouacked, The distance we had marched was
                            twenty miles. We did not think it was too hard a march as we have done
                            before The recruits got along very well, The Company teams it seems went
                            to Warrenton Junction and therefore I got not yet my Knappy. I had to
                            beg half of one of my Companions blankets.</p>

                        <p>The number of troops on the march yesterday was probably nearly a hundred
                            thousand. The Wagon train that went ahead of us was nearly twenty miles
                            long. The troops are all about us. The Brigade is camped in a space
                            about half as large as our Camp at Williams port used to be This morning
                            I went to the Rappa hannock river and had a swim. About noon we fell
                            into line (This Regt) and marched across the Bridge and took up our
                            quarters behind a little hill two pieces of Artillery came across. The
                            Rebels had made their appearance at the edge of the woods about a mile
                            distant, We have got a beautiful position and one Brigade could keep a
                            whole army back (nearly) as there a level plain of a
                            <unclear>[-]</unclear> long between us and the woods. If any attempt to
                            cross. we could mow them down by the hundreds, We have Artilery still
                            placed along the north back of the river. a little skirmish took place a
                            little before dark by the Artileryists. The rest of the Brigade came
                            across before dark. At night four Companies from each Regt went on
                            picket. </p>

                        <p>About the middle of the afternoon we marched. We went through Warrenton
                            and on the road to Ganesville, on the route for Manassas. We were till
                            three Oclock the next morning, in marching eight miles. We had to halt
                            for the wagon train that was ahead of us which made it a very tiresome
                            march for us. At three oclock Thursday morning we turned into a field
                            and went to sleep.</p>

                        <p>At day light we were called up, not having had but one hour and a half to
                            sleep. We marched to Hay Market. Before we got to Hay Market, the colum
                            moved so slow and I was so tired and sleepy that I layed down under a
                            shady tree and went to sleep. I must have slept a number of hours for
                            when I awoke the rear guard was just going by. They said the Rebels were
                            not a great ways behind. I marched on as rapidly as possible. After
                            going two miles which brought me to New Market, I found that our Brigade
                            had left their Knapsacks and had gone to the Gap distance four miles
                            (Thorougherfair) to keep in check some Rebels that were there. The other
                            Brigades were throwing off their Knapsacks and marching to the Gap. <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000000961_0068" n="62"/> I had got within two miles of
                            the Gap when I heard the report of Musketry. When I got to the Gap I did
                            not know where my Reg. was. Some one told me it was in the Gap and I
                            came very near running right into the hands of the Rebels. I went into
                            the woods, on the right and found two Regts of the Brigade having it hot
                            and heavy I went in with them but did not get a chance to fire but one
                            shot. I was so afraid of shooting some of our own men. The balls came
                            thick and fast, through some blunder. Some of a Virginia Regt (Federal)
                            and some of our Brigade got to firing upon each other, it being in the
                            woods, it was very easy to make such a mistake. I thought I would get
                            out of such a scrape and try and find my own Regt, which I found on the
                            left, laying behind a hill. Our Gen was very foolish to lead his men in
                            such a place without knowing the place, and what force he had to contend
                            with, a thousand men in that Gap could keep back nearly twenty thousand.
                            (Gen. Hardsuff is sick and Col Stiles had command of Brigade) Gen.
                            Ricketts is in command of the Division, which is composed of four
                            Brigades. While on the right with those in the woods I saw some terrible
                            wounds, one poor fellow had both under eye lids of his eyes torn down
                            nearly two inches. How a ball could make such a wound I do not see.
                            After laying behind the hill a short time we were ordered back to a
                            woods about two hundred yards to the rear. In going across the field
                            Sergeant Lemoyne of this Company was wounded in the hip. We had been in
                            the woods but a short time when we were marched back to Hay Market, got
                                <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0069" n="63"/> their Knapsack, and
                            marched three miles, and Bivouack near Ganesville. In the affair at the
                            Gap Private Clark of Co. E was killed, Corporal Jackson Co. E was
                            wounded and since died. Private Robins of Co D. wounded and has since
                            died and from five to eight wounded.</p>

                            hours when Jackson came there in hopes to capture us, which he would
                            have been likely to have done if we had been there. We haulted at
                            Bristel a number of hours and then marched to Manassas. We haulted here
                            till nearly night and then marched to the battle field of Bull run,
                            having marched nearly eighteen miles. Many have been left along the road
                            side a great many bare footed. Most of the straglers were probably taken
                            prisoners. They have been fighting nearly all day here. To night our
                            forces hold the battle field.</p>

                        <p>Our rations were out yesterday and for Breakfast I had to put up with a
                            mug of Coffee and two or three crumbs of hard cracker. About nine
                            Oclock, we were ordered to the front, being considered as fresh troops.
                            The Col is sick and has not been with us since leaving <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000000961_0070" n="64"/> the Gap. The Major is in
                            command of the Regt. He thought after our hardships of the past week
                            that we were very fresh troops, very few of us having had any breakfast.
                            The advance skirmisher were firing nearly all day, but no engagement
                            took place till about three oclock in the afternoon. This Brigade
                            changed their position several times during the day. About two Oclock we
                                <sic>we</sic> ordered towards the left, and haulted in a field near
                            the road. Shortly after this the Fight became general on the right and
                            Centre and was working round towards the left. McDowell came along, and
                            ordered us toward the Centre. We went double quick up a hill and on
                            right by file into line of Battle before we were aware that we were so
                            near them (the Rebels) The Rebels were in the hollow beyond the hill as
                            thick as they could be, it seemed impossible to fire without hitting
                            some of them they were so thick. Our position was as near as I can
                            judge, on the right of the left wing, If we had have stayed in our <add

                            should have been of some service then where we were placed for the
                            Rebels came round to the left and flanked us whereas if we had been on
                            the road they could not have done it so easily. We were exposed to a
                            severe <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0071" n="65"/> cross fire, which mowed

                            Artillery which of course had to stop firing. One Battery came up on the
                            hill and opened upon the Rebels with Canister and Grape. Our Regt had
                            the order to fix Bayonets. And we thought it was <unclear>[-]</unclear>
                            for a charge and we started and went several rods yelling as loud as we
                            could, when we were ordered to stop. A line of Rebels happen to be
                            coming up the hill at the same time. What little charge we did make was
                            enough to break there line and they run back to the main body as fas as
                            they could go. They was so much noise that it was impossible to hear any
                            orders. The left wing had orders to pull back. I did not hear it, and
                            seeing no one around me <unclear>[-]</unclear> turned round and saw them
                            some ways in the rear. I has turned to join them and keep in line as
                            much as possible. The Rebels made a charge up the hill and captured a
                            Piece of Artilery. I was within fifty feet of them. The Officers that
                            led them on the charge and the color bearer was shot dead the moment
                            they reached the Gun. The color bearer jumped upon the Gun and waved his
                            flag when he fell. By this time our Brigade, and got all mixed up. It
                            was impossible to find my place. The Regt I since learned was ordered to
                            the left into the woods, but I guess they were very <del hand="author">

                            began the Bushwhacking style, could not have gone any farther. I was so
                            tired, I sat down in the ravine <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0072" n="66"
                            /> and drank some water, and then commenced to load and fire. I took
                            good aim, and it seemed impossible for my ball to miss them they were so
                            thick. In the front rank I saw three fall that I fired at, either from
                            my ball or some one else that might have fired at the same man at the
                            same time. I fired till my Gun became foul and I could not fire it. I
                            was so buisy firing that I did not notice that the line of Battle had
                            fallen back and was much supprised to find that I was about half way
                            between the two armies and in danger of being shot by my own men. I
                            carried my Gun at right shoulder shift and Squat as low as possible and
                            made as straight a line to our line of Battle as possible. I was not
                            long going over the ground I can tell you. The balls and shells whistled
                            around me like bees One ball hit my Gun barrel, and, but for my Gun I
                            should have had a ball in my brain. I met the Major going off of the
                            field and he said he was going to try and form the Regt. in the rear. We
                            went back to a house some ways in the <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0073"
                                n="67"/> rear, where we found about twenty belonging to the 12 and
                            13 Mas. We stoped here till dark. When we were ordered to cross the the
                            run. All the forces are falling back. About two miles from the run we
                            haulted for the night Gen Duryea with part of his Brigade was with us,
                            he was slightly wounded in the hand.</p>

                        <p>Early this morning we started for Centreville. It rained hard. The
                            remains of our Regt haulted near Centreville. We soon learned that
                            another Squad of the Regt were the other side of Centreville. We went to
                            them and soon after another guard under a Lieut came up. A number of the
                            wounded of our Company were there and the Capt saw them safely aboard of
                            hacks that came from Washington. We marched about two miles from
                            Centrevill and Camped or rather Bivouaked in amongst some stumps of
                            trees, formerly a forest. A great many of the straglers came up to day.
                            Our loss is very heavy. Our Company had Sixteen wounded that we are sure
                            of, three killed and there is eight I think missing. We do not know
                            whether they are killed wounded or taken prisoners. The other Companies
                            have lost in like proportion. Among the killed and wounded in this
                            Company is Cop Blanchard killed, Private Dickinson killed Hastings
                            Bennett of Brighton who attended Mr Allens School the same time Sophia
                            and I did, killed. <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0074" n="68"/> John Arnott
                            wounded , J Halstrick, John Keith, Henry Loard, Frank Mann, Chas. Page,
                            Henry Richards, John Richardson, George Sawyer. All wounded. Other that
                            I forget the names of a number of recruits wounded and missing Joe
                            Keeting was wounded. John Mitchell is missing and I have heard since
                            that he was wounded and in Washington but cannot tell for certain. Among
                            the missing are Walter Colender Private Palfrey David Walke Albert
                            Lescolm and some of the Recruits. There is very few but what can show
                            some mark of a bullett about their clothing A great many had holes shot
                            through their canteens. The Regt threw off their Knapsacks before going
                            into Battle and the Rebel have got them. </p>

                        <p>We marched towards Fairfax. When within about two miles of there we
                            crossed over on the Leesburg road, and marched on this road about a
                            mile, where we found troops drawn up in line of Battle. We went into
                            line of Battle behind a fence used in the edge of a woods. There was
                            another line of Battle in the woods ahead of us and before night there
                            was quite a battle but we were not <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0075"

                            noon the next day. It rained hard the better part of the afternoon and

                            attack of Reumatism in my left shins and right shoulder so that I could
                            hardly walk. I told my Captain that I was unable to go farther with out
                            resting. He told me that I must get a pass from the Surgeon to fall to
                            the rear. I went to the Surgeon, and he told me to keep with the Regt,
                            that marching would do the Rhumatism good. I told him that I should have
                            to take of my things and rest, and I steped one side, took them off and
                            rested. We had a hundred rounds of Catridges given to us the day before
                            and I destroyed half of them. It was killing me to carry them. If the
                            Doctor had give me a pass I could have rode on an Ambulance. After
                            resting half an hour I started on again. The Regt went towards Hall
                            Church At night I stoped over night in a barn with two privates of the

                            eight miles. Toward night I went with the Company on picket.</p>

                            quiaduct bridge, passed through Georgetown and Washington. General
                            Ricketts must have been either mad or crazy for he marched us over six
                            miles without a hault <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0078" n="72"/> The Boys
                            were unable to march so, and the consequences were that the road was
                            lined with Straglers. I fell out of the ranks while passing through
                            Washington. I sat down on the steps of a beautiful Mansion. It was about
                            One Oclock Sunday morning. The owner of the House happened to be up
                            watching the Soldiers go by. He saw me and came out, had a talk with me
                            and gave me an Apple and a couple of peaches. After resting a little
                            while I marched on again, and took the road that went to Rockville.
                            About two miles from Washington I went to a house, spread my blanket on
                            the Piazza, and went to sleep. The people of the house were up talking
                            with some Soldiers </p>

                        <p>I awoke a little after Sun rise There was two Ladies siting on the Pzza
                            and they asked me if I Slept well. There was plenty of Soldiers about.
                            trying to buy a Breakfast The Ladies said that there had been so many
                            Soldiers about that they had eat them all out of every thing and they
                            thought it was doubtful if they could get anything for their own
                            breakfast, but we were welcome to go into the Kitchen, use the fire to
                            cook our Coffee, and anything that we could use to help get out
                            breakfast. I made my self at home, and soon had my Coffee cooked. After
                            eating my hard bread and drinking my Coffee I strapped on my Knapsack
                            and started. I had gone but a little ways <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000000961_0080" n="74"/> when I found Shuttle, Dyer and
                            Parker of my own Mess cooking their breakfast by the roadside. I stoped
                            and when they got through, we four started on to- gether. We reached the
                            Regt (which was in Camp about twelve miles from Washington) a little
                            before dark. When the Regt reached there they only had eight men, the
                            12th they say had only the Major come in. We four got in long before our
                            Captain did. I heard many Officers say that they thought Gen Ricketts
                            must be crazy to march the men the way he did. It is not always the
                            distance that tires the men the most. It is the manner in which we are
                            made to march it. If we don't march but six miles, if the Gen marches us
                            that distance without a hault he will have very few men come in with
                            him. We marched through the upper part of Washington and did not have a
                            chance to see the Capitol close to even by night. I was in hopes we
                            would pass through there in the day time. </p>

                            me to day, and after marching about eight miles I told the Lieut that I
                            should have to rest before going further. He told <pb

                            along when I felt able. After siting by the road side a little while
                            James Leeds of Co. A, (Son of Mr Leeds Police detector of Boston) came
                            along, and it being near supper time we concluded to go to some house
                            and get some supper.</p>
                        <p>We went to a House that was some way back from the road. The people had
                            seen but very few Soldiers, only two having been there before us. We
                            asked them if we could buy some supper. They said we could have some
                            supper, <add hand="author" place="top">but</add> would not take any pay
                            for it. When we had got nearly through a man came along who it appears
                            was a clock maker. We did not like his talk at all He seemed to be very
                            intimate with the people, by his talk I judged he was a Seceshionist <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000000961_0084" n="78"/> Just as we had finished eating
                            a Soldier came along and asked the Woman if she could give him a bite to
                            eat. She told him to sit down, and went to work preparing him a supper.
                            This citizen went to her and told her not to get any that she would have
                            to work all night if she was agoing to feed soldiers. He then came to us
                            and told us that there was a young fellow that was sick in another room
                            that wanted to see us. Said he, he is manager of things here and
                            probably want to collect pay for the suppers. We went to him and it was
                            even so. He told us to pay the Women folks for our supper. We did so but
                            they did not want to take it. We forced it upon them. This other Soldier
                            then told the Woman that he would not trouble her to get any thing for
                            him as he had no money. This Citizen told him that he could not expect
                            any supper then.</p>

                        <p>The Woman said she did not want his money, but to sit down and eat. She
                            then told the Citizen that she had no Sons in the Army to help fight for
                            the Country, and she thought it was no more then right for her to feed
                            one or two Soldiers. The Citizen told her she would ruin her self if she
                            was agoin to feed the Army. Said she I don't intend to feed an Army and
                            as to my coming to want, I have plenty to last me through this life, and
                            some to leave for my children. If it had not been for this Citizen I
                            feel confident that she would have asked us to stay all night. We put on
                            our Knapsack, and went out to the barn and slept on the Hay mough. It
                            rained <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0086" n="80"/>hard all night.</p>

                            made his appear- ance at the top of the Lader Said he you did not go far
                            last night. We told him we did not. About half an hour after this we had
                            got ready to trot along. A Boy came out of the house and said the sick
                            man wanted to see us before we went. We went in and he wanted to know if
                            we troubled any thing out at the Barn. We told him we guessed not. He
                            said if we wanted any Breakfast we could have some if we had got the
                            money to pay for it. The Breakfast table was all set for us. We told him
                            that we did not want any <pb entity="DSSR_000000961_0087" n="81"/>
                            Breakfast. We passed through the Breakfast room in going out. The Woman
                            asked us to sit down to Breakfast. We told her that we did not want any.
                            She said the Clockmaker told her that we ordered breakfast. We turned to
                            the Clock tinker and told him that he seemed to be making a great deal
                            of trouble. We gave him a good talking to and left. At the next house we
                            had some Breakfast. We did not hurry at all, and the Brigade marched
                            again before we got up to it. They Camped <add hand="author" place="top"

                            between the Towns of Cooksville and Lisbon. We caught up with the Regt
                            before they had marched far. The marched to day was only Six miles. We
                            camped at night close by the Town of Ridgeville. </p>
