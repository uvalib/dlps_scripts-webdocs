            <p>
            The chief trouble with
            this place is the fact that one
            never has any time to one’s self.
            To day is quartier libre and so
            I have some time to write.  Other
            days one hasn’t even the opportunity
            to shave.  That’s really the truth.
            Even now the room is filled
            with a lot of young fools
            throwing bread at one another<unclear>[.]</unclear>
            And its so cold the pen moves
            with difficulty.  As luck would
            have it I caught a cold and
            so appreciate your beautiful
            handkerchiefs more than ever.
            </p><p>
            I was fortunate in the 
            time I arrives here.  Only seven
            were ahead of me and so I
            started training in three days.
            Shortly afterwards forty five new
            men arrived.  They’ll be a long
            time.  One starts rolling in a 
            Pengouin &mdash; a machine that won’t
            leave the ground.  I’ve broken one
            already &mdash; tipped her over instead of

            shutting off.  <unclear>Rumsey [sp?]</unclear> an American
            here has had two wonderful
            falls without killing himself.
            </p><p>
            Marcelle I don’t know how
            to thank you for the pleasure 
            you gave me while I was in
            Paris.  I’ve never been happier and
            had it not been for the unfortunate
            incident it would have been
            perfect.  Please do forget it.  It 
            was nice of you to write as 
            you did.
            </p><p>
            They take me for a Canadian
            here - my coat I suppose.  I’ve
            made friends and get along
            very well.  Its about as good
            a place to learn French as a 
            jail in Ohio.  Everyone speaks 
            English.  In my pianle [sic] French is
            not used.  I’m sorry about that.
            My friend Haviland hasn’t shown
            up yet.  Can’t understand.
            </p>
