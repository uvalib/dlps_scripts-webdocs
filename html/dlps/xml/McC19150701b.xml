            Dear Paul:
            </salute></opener>
        		
        		<p>
            I guess you thought
            me an awful slob for not
            writing, but then it wasn’t my
            fault so much as the staff car’s.
            I kept waiting for it.  Never again!
            </p><p>
            I received your letter 
            with the clipping.  Holy Smoke,
            where did you dope out the 
            mixture?  Railroad tracks &amp; farm
            houses aren’t a very close resemblance
            but then what’s the “diff”.  It
            will be amusing to get comments
            from the States if any one I know
            runs across the stuff.  Be sure 
            and get me a copy of the 
            bunk with photo.  That ought to
            be great.  You know  - ^ Sunday edition a border
            with bursting shells and a 
            black sun setting over a 
            heap of dead at the four
            corners.  Its all very funny
                        
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            the way papers frame it
            up isn’t it?  By the way
            please be careful about 
            using names.  We are not
            supposed to give our location
            you know.  At the front in Lorraine would do.
            </p><p>
            The 1er E. certainly is 
            running in hard luck these
            days.  After its glorious work
            at Carency you’d thing they’ed [sic]
            let em [sic] live to enjoy the fruits
            of their work.  Doesn’t seem to be 
            run that way tho [sic].  As soon as 
            a regiment makes a name they
            keep using it until there’s
            nothing left.
            </p><p>
            Glad to hear Kiffin is 
            to be in Paris soon.  I am
            afraid there isn’t any chance
            of my getting down tho [sic].
                        
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            Six new cars, detached from
            the tent section are to be sent
            to take up our back work to morrow.
            They will not be allowed any further
            than our old base.  It means that
            we will have to work along the lines
            all the time with no chance for a 
            refreshing long evacuation trip thru [sic]
            the country now and then as before.
            I’m laying for the first trip down
            to fill them full of bull.
            </p><p>
            My article on this section made 
            a hit with the inspector and I may
            land something out of it.  Hope so
            anyway, for finally, after writing me a
            number of letters telling me to return 
            to America, my family had informed me
            that they will discontinue sending me
            even the small sums that I used
            to receive with much glee from time
            to time.  Fortunately the amounts were
            small so I shall not miss them 
            so much.  I’ll drop you another
            note soon old socks.
