                    VISITORS<lb/> October 18-19, 2001</head>
                <p>The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met, in Open Session, at
                    11:10 a.m., Thursday, <date value="2001-10-18">October 18, 2001</date>, in the
                    Board Room of the Rotunda; <name type="present">John P. Ackerly, III, Rector,
                        presided. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr., Charles M. Caravati, Jr., M.D., William G.
                        Crutchfield, Jr., Thomas F. Farrell, II, Charles L. Glazer, William H.
                        Goodwin, Jr., T. Keister Greer, Gordon F. Rainey, Jr., Timothy B. Robertson,
                        Terence P. Ross, Thomas A. Saunders, III, Ms. Elizabeth A. Twohy, and
                        Benjamin P.A. Warthen</name> were present. </p>

                <p>Also present were <name type="present">John T. Casteen, III, Leonard W.
                        Sandridge, Alexander G. Gilliam, Jr., Paul J. Forch, Gene D. Block, Ms.
                        Colette Sheehy, Robert D. Sweeney, Ms. Yoke San L. Reynolds, R. Ariel Gomez,
                        M.D., and Ms. Jeanne Flippo Bailes</name>. </p>

                <p>The Rector opened the meeting with a miscellany of announcements.</p>

                <p>On motion, the Minutes of the Board meetings of June 15- 16, and July 13-14,
                    2001, were approved.</p>

                <p>The Rector asked the Secretary to read the annual ACC Governing Board
                    Certification Form, which attests that responsibility for the administration of
                    the athletics program has been delegated to the President of the University. The
                    Atlantic Coast Conference requires that this Form be read to the Board once a
                    year.</p>

                <p>The President gave his customary report, announcing first that the Honorable
                        <name type="person">Emily Couric</name>, who represented Charlottesville and
                    Albemarle County in the Virginia Senate and who was a great friend of the
                    University, had died during the night.</p>

                <p>The President reviewed the Universityâ€™s response to the events of September 11<hi
                        rend="super">th</hi> in New York and Washington.</p>
                <pb n="6052"/>
                <p>The President announced three senior administrative appointments made since the
                    last Board meeting: <name type="person">Mr. Craig Littlepage</name> as Director
                    of Athletics, <name type="person">Mr. Robert Harris</name> as Dean of the Darden
                    School, and <name type="person">Dr. Ariel Gomez</name> as Interim Vice President
                    for Research and Public Service.</p>

                <p>The plans for the implementation of the Virginia 2020 priorities, authorized by
                    the Board at its Retreat in July, will be presented to the Board at the April
                    meeting.</p>
