                              meet with members of the Southwest Virginia General Assembly

                      <p>At the Rector’s request, the President introduced <name>Mr.

                              The University of Virginia’s College at Wise on September 1st. </p>

                              Neurophysiology from the University in 1972, has come to Wise from the
                              University of Wisconsin-Superior, where he was Provost and Vice
                              Chancellor for Academic Affairs. </p>

                            <p>The President introduced <name>Mr. William B.
                                    Harvey</name>, who has just been appointed Vice President and
                                    Chief Officer for Diversity and Equity. <name>Mr. Harvey</name>,
                                    who will assume his duties on November 1st, – the first person
                                    to have this title at the University – is at present the Vice
                                    President of the Center for Advancement of Racial and Ethnic
                                    Equity at the American Council on Education in Washington. </p>
                            <p><name>Mr. Harvey</name>, the President explained,
                                    would speak later in the day at the Diversity Committee report
                                    session. </p>
                            <p>The President summarized racial and other incidents
                                    that have taken place since the University opened this fall.
                                    What has taken place has been the work of what he called
                                    “creeps,” not persons exercising their rights of freedom of
                                    speech and discourse. He emphasized the importance of police
                                    involvement in dealing with these incidents and cited examples
                                    of police investigations being hampered because of lack of
                                    timely notification of the incidents – part of the University’s
                                    response to these things has been a program to educate students
                                    to the importance of notifying the police <pb n="6983"/>
                                    immediately. <name>Mr. Harvey</name> had suggested the value of
                                    a public, symbolic show of solidarity, and the black ribbons
                                    worn by members of the University community over the last
                                    several weeks have been in response to his suggestion. </p>
                            <p>There has been good support from alumni on the
                                    wearing of ribbons, and good faculty support on making
                                    statements in the classroom. The General Counsel is looking into
                                    formal involvement by the University Judiciary Committee in
                                    dealing with racial incidents, and the President noted that with
                                    the principles of student self-governance in mind, the student
                                    leadership – as well as the faculty – must be involved in these
                                    efforts.</p>
                            <p>The General Counsel and several of the lawyer Members
                                    discussed the difficulties of the legalities of dealing with
                                    some of these issues. There was discussion, too, about the
                                    possibility of the Board raising the reward offered by the
                                    Alumni Association for information regarding the perpetrators of
                                    these incidents. <name>Mr. Payne</name> said it is important
                                    that the University emphasize publicly the positive things it
                                    has done in recent years to encourage minority students. </p>
                            <p>The President said it has been “a rough fall” for
                                    student abuse of alcohol, with increased arrests by the police
                                    for underage possession, and a rise in the number of alcohol-
                                    related hospital emergency room visits. There seems to be a
                                    pattern of this across the country, and he cited a series of
                                    mass arrests at Duke University this fall. </p>
                            <p>The President next gave a report on AccessUVa: a
                                    total of 749 students in the first year class are participating;
                                    201 low-income students this year are eligible for a loan-free
                                    education; and 375 middle-income students will receive a
                                    combination of loans, grants, and work-study packages. He has
                                    found that donors are very interested in supporting the program. </p>
                            <p>The University this semester has admitted 116
                                    undergraduates and 21 graduate students, chiefly from Tulane
                                    University, who were displaced when the New Orleans universities
                                    were forced to close because of Hurricane Katrina. Of the 137
                                    students, 107 are Virginians. </p>
                            <p>The President reported that <name>Mr. Terry
                                    Belanger</name>, the Director of the Rare Book School – which is
                                    located in the Alderman Library – has been given a MacArthur
                                    Fellowship. He explained that the MacArthur Foundation awards
                                    so-called “Genius Grants” – a $500,000 stipend, with “no strings
                                    attached,” which is spread over five years. <name>Mr.
                                    Belanger</name> has said that he intends to use the money to
                                    support the Rare Book School.</p>

                            <p>The President said that opportunities are being
                                    explored to extend the University’s international reach, and he
                                    cited possibilities of areas in the world where the University
                                    might establish its presence.</p>

                      <p>The President gave the customary quarterly report on gifts
                              and grants – his report covered the period May 1-August 31, 2005, as
                              well as general figures for the past fiscal year. </p>
                      <p>The University and its related foundations finished Fiscal
                              Year 2005 with a total of $183.5million in gifts – this represents an
                              increase of $8.5million, or 4.9%, above the results of Fiscal Year
                              2004. For the current Fiscal Year (which began July 1) through August
                              31st, the total gifts received amounts to $23.7million, which is an

                              times.” The job of insuring diversity at the University is a job, he
                              said, “for all of us.” Among the strengths that can be built upon is
                              not only the University’s firm commitment to diversity, but the
                              affection and support of the University’s African-American alumni. </p>

                              The Plan has 1) described and documented through consistent 
                              narratives and graphics the general appearance, significant 
                              features, and histories of these buildings and landscapes, 2) 
                              evaluated their integrity and significance, their interior and 
                              exterior architectural elements, physical or historical context, and 
                              other contributing qualities and developed priorities for 
                              preservation and maintenance, 3) analyzed the potential for adaptive 
                              use of these buildings, and 4) prepared preservation guidelines 
                              defining preferred preservation treatment and maintenance practices. </p>
                      <p>
                              The Office of the Architect for the University developed four 
                              evaluation criteria: 1) association with people or events important 
                              to the University’s history, 2) quality of the original design, 3) 
                              integrity of the design, and 4) condition of the building and site. </p>
                      <p>
                              The Office of the Architect for the University developed six 
                              preservation priority categories: 1) fundamental to University 
                              history and present character, 2) essential to University history 
                              and present character, 3) important to University history and 
                              present character, 4) contributing to University history and present
