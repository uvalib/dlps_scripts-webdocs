      <title>Letter from Charles N. Tenney to Adelaide E. Case</title>
     </bibl>
    </head>
    <p> Charles receives a longed for letter from Adelaide and thanks her for it. He discusses how
     as a single man it is difficult to find people to vouch for his character, especially as he is
     in not on amiable terms with his father's family. He chastises Mollie for disapproving of
     Adelaide taking time to write, and then describes his religious sentiments professing his faith
     is not as it should be, but that the Bible is his most precious book. </p>

    <opener>
     <name type="place">Camp Tyler, Va.</name>
     <lb/>
     <dateline>Feby 28th 1862</dateline>
     <lb/>
     <salute>My own loved<name type="recipient">Addie</name>;</salute>
    </opener>

    <p> Your longed for letter came to<lb/> hand tonight, and now I can resort to my<lb/>
      favorite <orig reg="past time">pasttime</orig> - There! <orig reg="Don't">Dont</orig> that look
     fine with 2 ts?<lb/> this evening, that of writing, also my <hi rend="underline">duty</hi>
     in<lb/> answering your kind letter. Perhaps you<lb/> would like to know what part of your<lb/>
     letter interested me most. I will tell you.<lb/> I was gratified to know that my rehearsal<lb/>
     of my past life, strengthened you confidence in<lb/> me, which I <hi rend="underline"
      >never</hi> <hi rend="underline">doubted</hi>. <del hand="h1">before.</del><lb/></p>
    <p> I had feared that it might pain you<lb/> and situated as I am, not on <orig reg="amiable"
      >amieable</orig> terms<lb/> with my father's family, I could not refer you<lb/> to them to
     establish my character. I have always<lb/> tried to maintain <hi rend="underline">strict
      integrity</hi>, all my life,<lb/> yet being alone, it is natural for people to distrust<lb/>
     one, on that account. This company, I think<lb/> to <orig reg="a man">a/man</orig>, will testify
     to my good behaviour,<lb/> since I have been in the service.<lb/></p>

    <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0518"/>

    <p> But I will change the subject.<lb/> I was delighted with the description you gave<lb/> me of
      the<q>"Large Family."</q> but I am sure I could<lb/> not like<q>
      <name>"Mollie."</name>
     </q> She must be of a selfish nature<lb/> if she could not give you an hour or two to
     write<lb/> to those who are fighting in her behalf,<lb/> to secure the <orig reg="privileges"
      >priveleges</orig> she even <hi rend="underline">now</hi> enjoys<lb/> Not that <hi
      rend="underline">I</hi> am selfish, but I am one of six hun=<lb/> dred thousand, I have no
     doubt but she was<lb/> charmed with your society, for who would not be?<lb/> but passing the
     day with you, and having some<lb/> slight knowledge <del hand="h1">of</del> as to whom you were
     writing to.<lb/> she must be selfish indeed if she could not suffer<lb/> you to do even <hi
      rend="underline">that</hi>.<lb/></p>
    <p> You must admire my letters very much<lb/> to <orig reg="receive">recieve</orig> them with
     such demonstrations of lively<lb/> pleasure, now suppose you recieved such interesting<lb/> and
     charming letters as a certain correspondent<lb/> of mine-- <name type="recipient">Miss A.L.
     Case</name> - writes, how would you<lb/> deport yourself when they arrived? I love your<lb/>
     letters, for they tell me I am loved, <hi rend="underline">I love you</hi>, for<lb/> it is
     right, and - <hi rend="underline">you</hi> love <hi rend="underline">me</hi>.<lb/> <hi
      rend="underline">God bless you</hi>, and<lb/> preserve you my hearts idol, <hi rend="underline"
      >my Love!</hi><lb/></p>

    <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0519"/>

    <p> Did I ever tell you my religious sentiments?<lb/> I think not? That there is a good God,
     none can<lb/> deny. That some, yes <hi rend="underline">many</hi> of those who<lb/> profess to
     have a<q>"saving knowledge of Christ<lb/> Jesus"</q> are misguided, is a matter of as little doubt.<lb/>
     <q>"The Bible is true."</q> is one of my<q>"articles of faith."</q><lb/>
     <q>"Christ died for all,"</q> is another,<q>"God is just,"</q> is a third.<lb/> From these,
      you <orig reg="percieve">percieve</orig> I believe that the way<lb/> is open for all <hi
      rend="underline">who will</hi>, to enter Heaven.</p>
    <p> I do not profess to Love the Saviour, as I ought,<lb/> but <hi rend="underline">I might</hi>.
     I have my Bible, and I consider<lb/> it the most precious of all books. <name type="recipient"
      >Addie</name>, there<lb/> is not a ch<add place="inline" hand="h1">r</add>istian in this
     company! Are you<lb/> astonished? <hi rend="underline">Tis true</hi>. I shudder to think of<lb/>
     the end, yet <hi rend="underline">I</hi> am <hi rend="underline">one</hi> of them.<lb/></p>
    <p><name type="recipient">Addie</name> dearest, I would give much if I<lb/> could come and see
     you, but I cannot, yet<lb/> I know that is one who remembers me, and<lb/> I am happy. But I
     must bring this to a<lb/> close, Think of me often, and remember that<lb/> I am with you
     constantly in spirit, give my love<lb/> to <name type="person">Bro. Hallie</name>, <name
      type="person">Sister Laurie</name>, Auntie, and all, and write very<lb/> often to Your <name
      type="sender">Charlie</name>.<seg type="postscript">P.S. Do you ever sing.<q>"Dixie"</q><lb/>
      My favorite is<q>"Ever of thee"</q>. Our band plays it beautifully.<lb/></seg></p>
