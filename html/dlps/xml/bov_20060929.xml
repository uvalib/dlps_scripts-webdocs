    <head>DIVESTMENT OF FUNDS IN COMPANIES THAT DO BUSINESS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN </head>

     <p> WHEREAS, the Board has a fiduciary obligation to invest the University's
      endowment prudently and for the benefit of the University; and </p>
   
     <p> WHEREAS, the threshold for divestment based on factors other than business
      reasons must be very high and should not be taken lightly. The corporate action about which
      the complaint is made must be gravely offensive and cause much social injury, and the Board
      finds that the situation in Sudan exceeds this threshold; and</p>

     <p> WHEREAS, there is clear and mounting evidence that the government of Sudan
     is committing genocide against the people of its Darfur region; and </p><lb/>
     <p>WHEREAS, approximately
      400,000 people have been tortured and killed, and some 2.5 million displaced in and around
      Darfur; and </p>
   
     <p> WHEREAS, on <date value="2004-07-22">July 22, 2004</date>, the U.S. Senate
      and House of Representatives unanimously adopted a joint resolution declaring the atrocities
      in Darfur to be genocide; on <date value="2004-09-09">September 9, 2004</date>, Secretary of
      State Colin Powell declared that genocide had been committed, and quite possibly still was
      being committed, in Darfur; on <date value="2005-06-01">June 1, 2005</date>, President Bush
      reiterated that the U.S. government believes genocide is taking place in Darfur; and a January
      2005 report by the United Nations condemned the Sudanese government and the Janjaweed militias
      for committing "serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law", and
      Sudanese government officials may have committed genocidal acts; and </p>
    
    <pb n="7181"/>
 
     <p> WHEREAS, the Finance Committee has determined that divestment of
      investments in multinational companies that directly support the activities of the Sudanese
      government is an appropriate response to the situation in Darfur because a number of
      multinational companies, particularly in the energy and telecommunications fields, provide the
      government of Sudan with substantial financial resources and the infrastructure to continue
      the sponsorship of genocidal actions in Darfur; and </p>

     <p> WHEREAS, although the University does not currently have direct
      investments in such companies, the Board's action shall preclude future direct investment in
      these companies; and </p>
    
     <p> WHEREAS, this targeted divestment strategy is intended to indicate
      disapproval of the actions of the Sudanese government without causing harm to innocent
      Sudanese citizens. </p>
  
     <p> RESOLVED, that the Board requests that the University of Virginia
      Investment Management Company (UVIMCO) divest any and all direct investments managed by
      UVIMCO, in multinational companies identified as having direct business ties to the Sudanese
      government or companies whose business activities are in direct support of these companies and
      the activities of the government. The following are the specific criteria for companies
      targeted for divestment: </p>
      <list>
       <item rend="indent"> 1. Provide revenues to the Sudanese government through business with the
        government, government-owned companies or government-controlled consortiums; </item>
       <lb/>
       <item rend="indent"> 2. Offer little substantive benefit to those outside of the Sudanese
        government or its affiliated supporters in Khartoum, Northern Sudan and the Nile River
        Valley-this "outside" population specifically includes the country's disaffected Eastern,
        Southern, and Western regions; and </item>

    <p>The meeting resumed in the Cabell Hall Auditorium at 2:00 p.m.; all Members of

    <p>The purpose of the Cabell Hall meeting was the ceremonial launching of The

     Marshal of the University, bearing the Mace. Mr. Rainey, as National Chair of the Campaign

     <head>ENDORSEMENT OF CAPITAL CAMPAIGN AND SETTING OF THE CAMPAIGN GOAL</head>
  
      <p>WHEREAS, the University of Virginia has set goals of excellence and
       pre-eminence among institutions of higher learning in this country; and</p>
  
      <p>WHEREAS, substantial philanthropic support is necessary for the University
       to maintain its present high standing among peer universities and to attain the goals it has
       set; and </p>
  
      <p>WHEREAS, the University must rely on the generosity of its alumni and
       friends for this support; and</p>
 
      <p>WHEREAS, the University is embarking on a major capital campaign to meet
       these needs, a campaign with a recommended goal of $3 billion;</p>
  
      <p>RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors endorses The Campaign for the University
       of Virginia and establishes a goal of $3 billion, this goal to be subject to adjustment as
       the Board may from time to time find justified in light of the Campaign's successes; and </p>
  
      <p>RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board expresses its gratitude to those whose
       contributions have led to the early completion of the first third of this goal, and calls on
       all those who love the University to work toward the success of the Campaign.</p>

      <p> WHEREAS, <name>Mr. Sandridge</name> is known, too, for his modesty and
       his reluctance to claim credit for the things he does; and</p>
   
      <p> WHEREAS, admirers of <name>Mr. Sandridge</name> have banded together to
       make possible a naming in his honor, suggesting a portion of the John Paul Jones Arena;</p>
 
      <p>RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors names the entrance to the John Paul Jones
       Arena the Leonard W. Sandridge Portal; further, the Board names the access road from the
       By-Pass to Massie Road, Sandridge Road; and</p>
 
      <p>RESOLVED FURTHER, in so doing, the Board salutes the First Citizen of
       Crozet and joins the entire community in thanking him for all he has done, and continues to
       do, for the University of Virginia.</p>

     <p> The Rector then directed the Secretary to take a roll call vote. All Members
      voted "aye," and the motion was carried.</p>
     <p>The Rector remarked that as the John Paul Jones Arena has become known as "The
      Jack," he assumed the Leonard W. Sandridge Portal will become known as "The Leonard."</p>
     <p>The Rector adjourned the meeting at 10:55 p.m.</p>
