            <salute>Dear Marcelle:</salute>

            <p>
            Bill Thaw brought out the
            box of candy.  I thank you so much
            Marcelle for thinking of me in such a
            delightful way.  I enjoyed it immensely.
            </p><p>
            We have been so busy since
            the good weather came that there has
            been no time to write.  Day before yesterday
            we were six hours in the air and
            on alert rest of the twenty four.  I’m
            on guard this morning and since four
            have been going up on false alarms.
            </p><p>
            That fellow Chapman is a 
            wonder.  He’s so brave he’s unique &mdash;
            Kiffin says he’s too courageous and will 
            suffer for it.  Yesterday he attacked a Boche
            over the lines and was immediately surrounded
            by four others.  As he was trying to get 
            away a Fokker swooped down from above
            and filled him full of holes.  One of
            the aileron controls was cut off and he
            had to work it with one hand.
            Another bullet ripped his fusilage [sic] just
            back of him and another went thru [sic] his
            wind shield and grazed his head wounding
            him slightly.  There were other balls all
            thru [sic] his machine.  He finally escaped and
            then fired back to show he was not
            wounded badly nor brought down.  He landed
            at a nearby field, was repaired and flew
            home.
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0362" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            We are anxious about Balsley at this
            moment.  There was a big fight
            and Boches were in superior number.
            Rochwell reported having seen Prince fall
            but Prince came in a few minutes ago.
            Balsley is over half and hour late.  He
            was a little behind the others and may
            have fallen in with all the Boches.
            Cowden too is missing but they didn’t
            see him in fight.
            </p><p>
            Yesterday there was an alert but by
            the time we could get ready the
            Boches were over the field.  The bombs
            were dropping as we left.  One went off
            to my right as I was leaving the ground
            and I was glad to jump into the air.
            By the time we gained their altitude they
            were ficing [sic] over their lines.  There’s not
            much to do against an outfit like that
            unless one knows long before that they are
            coming.
            </p><p>
            A short time after we had come
            down and before we started on our
            second sortie over lines we saw a 
            distressing accident.  Two men went up in
            a large Brequet.  It rocks and floats
            as if it were not meant for the air.
            At fifty meters high the pilote tried
            a very steep turn.  The big thing
            flopped over, made a swerve and nose
            down hit the earth.  There was a
            
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0363" n="[p.3]"/>
            
            sickening thud.  Both men were killed
            instantly but before any one could reach
            them the machine took fire and for
            half an hour we had to look on being
            unable to do a thing.
            </p><p>
            Later:  Cowden showed up at
            a field nearby with engine trouble or
            something.  Balsley came down back of
            the lines (Chez nous) wounded in the 
            thigh.  I feel relieved for I was afraid
            he was dead.  Here comes Cowden now &mdash;
            I’ll see what news he has. &mdash; Nothing.  He
            had engine trouble.
            </p><p>
            I’ve seen Lovell several times.
            He’s looking fine and always the same
            charming fellow.  He’s leaving to morrow
            for aviation.  Wish he were with us
            now.  Guess you’ll see him when
            he’s in Pauam.
            </p><p>
            Have been hoping to hear from
            you but have had no letter in
            a long time.  Do write.
