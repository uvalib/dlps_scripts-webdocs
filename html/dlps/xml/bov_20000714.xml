                    14 and 15, 2000, a roll call vote was taken immediately following an executive

                    (1) only public business matters lawfully exempted were discussed in closed
                    session; and (2) only public business matters identified in the public motion by
                    which the executive or closed meeting were discussed. In accordance with the
                    law, any member of the public body who believes that there was a departure from
                    the foregoing shall so state prior to the vote indicating "the substance of the
                    departure". Any such statements are recorded below under "comments". </p>
