            Dear Paul:
            </salute></opener>
        		
        		<p>
            Again the
            pleasure of hearing
            from you, and as I’ve
            just returned from a
            place de secour and won’t
            have another call for a
            few minutes I’m taking
            the opportunity of getting
            a line off to you.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            I told you 
            didn’t I about the close
            call one of us had when
            a shell tore off the top
            of a car, missing the
            driver’s head by ten inches.
            We got another heavy
                        
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            bombardment yesterday
            but it didn’t stir up
            much dust.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            Its very eerie
            working out here at night.
            One carries no lights; even
            cigarettes are forbidden for
            they can be seen from the
            enemy trucks and might
            draw fire.  One creeps slowly
            past convoy, after convoy,
            past sentinels who cry “Halte
            la” and get cussed out
            by a reproachful “Ambulance
            Mon vieux!”, and it is only
            in the dazzling light of
            the illuminating shells
            that hurtle into the sky
            and sink slowly over the
            trenches that one can run
            with any speed.
                       
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            Its a safe bet that
            when the Boches are
            forced from their position
            near here that they will
            retaliate by blowing our
            advance point off the map.
            It doesn’t seem to bother 
            the cheerful, easy going
            denizens of the berg.  All
            the stores, save those
            that have been shattered,
            are running full blast,
            and one may purchase
            most anything;  the factories
            are running; the cafes
            are crowded, and right 
            now between the roar
            of heavy artillery I can
            hear the high pitched drone
                        
            <pb n="[p.4]"/>
            
            of children’s voices reciting
            the lesson for the day
            in the little school across
            the garden from us.
            </p>
            <p>
            The gardens here are
            beautiful.  I recommend 
            the place highly as a 
            honeymooning point and
            hope you’ll come up
            after the big event.
            Sorry you have to delay
            the big happening on 
            your account.
            </p>

            We’ve made good up
            here and as a result
            the French section has
            received orders to pull
            out Monday for another
                        
            <pb n="[p.5]"/>
            
            point, turning all
            the work over to
            us.  We are being 
            treated beautifully.  We
            have a Marechal des logis;
            and Salisbury our Chief
            has been made a sous
            lieutenant for the war.
            The grub is O.K. and our
            sleeping quarters, even at 
            our advance point, are
            comfortable.  We expect to
            leave our base and live
            at the advance point
            all the time.  It adds 
            considerably to the speed
                        
            <pb n="[p.6]"/>
            
            of our work.  Its naturally
            reducing the chances of
            getting out of the fight
            with a whole skin,
            but ‘what the hell Bill
            what the hell’ as our
            old friend Eugene Field
            so aptly remarked in
            that tender set of verses 
            anent the screw fest
            of the greaser and the 
            border bat.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            We have a new form
            of amusement now which
            consists of going to
            the end of a certain
            street where we are in
            full view of the German
            trenches fourteen hundred
                                    
            <pb n="[p.7]"/>
            
            yards away and testing
            out whether we can
            get them to take a 
            couple of pot shots.
            I’ll give a brown derby
            to any Boche that can 
            hit at that distance.
            Our uniform ought to
            make them mad enough.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            By the way I got
            a nice letter from
            Mlle. Guerin who spoke
            highly of you and 
            another letter from no
            less a cutie than
            our little friend
            Elizabeth Baldwin, to
                        
            <pb n="[p.8]"/>
            
            whom I sent a 
            postal.
        		</p>
        		<p>
            We’re just about
            due for another
            large fight in a 
            couple of days and I
            hope to God the
            Germans get all shot
            to hell.  We’ve got a 
            hundred and fifty
            of em [sic] at our base
            now working as a white
            wings gang.

            The spring has come
            to us now and its
            very beautiful out here.
