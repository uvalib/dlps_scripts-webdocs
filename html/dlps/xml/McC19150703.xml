            Dear Paul:
            </salute></opener>
        		
        		<p>
            Well, I sure wish
            you were to be here tomorrow.
            We’re going to have a real
            old American 4th of July
            celebration.  A bit different
            in that the others are
            making the noise for us,
            and that we can’t very 
            well fire off any illuminating
            rockets on our own hook,
            but we’ve got the flags 
            and the booze.  We’ve got
            a big spread arranged 
            and a stage put up in
                        
            <pb n="[p.2]"/>
            
            the caserne where some
            of us will do stunts
            including a boxing match
            between a Frenchmen and one
            of our fellows.  We scared 
            up a piano too.  The ten 
            cars that were detached from
            the tent section and that
            are stationed out of the
            Zone to do our evacuation
            will run up for the day.
            The ten drivers were invited
            to lunch when they first 
            came and they were very
            funny.  When they heard our
            artillery they thought a 
                        
            <pb n="[p.3]"/>
            
            bombardment was on.  Our old
            base is as far as they can
            come except on permission.
            </p><p>
            The damn Boches sent fifty
            three large shells into the
            little cluster of houses where
            some of our postes de secours
            are located yesterday afternoon
            and two of my friends among 
            the French officers got it.  Hell
            of a shame.  They do that just
            to get square with the French
            artillery.  We sleep in the phone
            bureau when on night duty
            there and they smeared that
            too.  None of us hurt.  Terrific
            bombardment of trenches now
            14,000 shells fired in in [sic] 24 hours.
            I’ll drink your health to morrow.
            Then back on the wagon.
