                </opener>

                <p>I cannot apologize for not writing<lb/> sooner for all I could plead would be
                    a<lb/> march and its attendant miseries.</p>

                <p>We left our camp near <name type="place">Edinburg</name> the<date
                        value="1862-04-17">17th</date><lb/> inst, and arrived here the same night,
                    but<lb/> our baggage,did not come up until yesterday,<lb/> and it has rained
                    quite heavily since until<lb/> this morning. If I did not know it is<lb/> my
                    duty and that it pleases her for whom I would<lb/>
                    <hi rend="underline">die</hi>, I would not write<orig reg="today">to-
                    day</orig>.</p>

                <p>I am not well dear <name type="person">Addie</name>, nor have<lb/> I been for a
                    week. I caught a severe cold,<lb/> and it has settled upon my lungs, and in
                    my<lb/> head, leaving me a troublesome cough and<lb/> a severe headache, which
                    last hangs on in<lb/> spite of every effort to remove it. &mdash;I can<lb/>
                    hardly see the lines on the paper, so you must excuse the poor writing.<lb/>
                    <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0546"/> But I am still trying to perform
                    my<lb/> duties in the company, and hope by the<lb/> time I write again I shall
                    be fully<lb/> well. I wrote a "kind" of letter to you on<lb/> the<date
                        value="1862-04-11">11th</date>
                    <orig reg="instant">inst</orig>, and sent it by a friend of mine<lb/> to <name
                        type="place">Woodstock</name> to be mailed, but it escaped his<lb/> memory,
                    and he just gave it to me yesterday<lb/> I enclose it in this.</p>

                <p>Our advance to <name type="place">New Market</name> was<lb/> marked by nothing
                    serious, but it was<lb/> a march of caution, also a series of brilliant<lb/>
                    dashes. It would be useless for me to <hi rend="underline">attempt</hi><lb/> to
                    particularize now, for I am not in a<lb/> proper state of mind. We saved the
                    large<lb/> covered bridge across the <name type="place">Shenandoah</name>,
                    but<lb/> they tried hard to burn it.</p>

                <p><name type="place"><orig reg="Mount">Mt.</orig> Jackson</name> is a small town
                    and<lb/> not a very neat one, certainly not one<lb/> half as pretty as <name
                        type="place">New Market</name>. Our camp is near<lb/> the latter place
                    distant only about half a mile</p>

                <p>I went across the river a day or two since,<lb/>
                    <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0547"/> and what do you think I found?<lb/>
                    Nothing more nor less than a genuine, and<lb/>
                    <hi rend="underline">pretty</hi> Secessionist in the form of a young lady<lb/>
                    of about fifteen by name <name type="person">Miss Mary Rice</name>.</p>

                <p>Of course I immediately "set my cap" for<lb/> her and when I thought <orig
                        reg="myself">my self</orig> on the<lb/> verge of success imagine my chagrin
                    as she<lb/> turned around and with all the sarcastic and<lb/> biting emphasis of
                    which she is capable, said,<lb/> "Do you know that I <hi rend="underline"
                    >hate</hi> Yankees?"</p>

                <p>I replied "Do you know I <hi rend="underline">do not</hi>, on the <orig
                        reg="contrary">con-<lb/> trary</orig>, there is one I regard in a much
                    more<lb/> amiable manner?" "Who is it, for the love<lb/> of mercy?" was the
                    answer. I immediately<lb/> showed her the portrait of a certain<orig
                        reg="handsome">hand-<lb/>some</orig> Ohioan, (<hi rend="underline">I</hi>
                    wouldn't tell <hi rend="underline">you</hi> who it was,)<lb/> and with a look of
                    scorn she said, "She isn't<lb/> pretty &mdash; she is a yankee." Said I
                    &mdash; "she <hi rend="underline">is</hi> pretty,<lb/> and a more handsome
                    young lady cannot be<lb/> found in <hi rend="underline">any</hi> or all of the
                    Southern states."</p>

                <p>"You look with partial eyes." said she.<lb/>
                    <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0548"/> "Do you see with <hi rend="underline"
                        >impartial</hi> ones?" was my response<lb/> Finally she admitted that it was
                    "pretty, but then<lb/> she is a yankee." By this time, <hi rend="underline"
                    >my</hi> "righteous<lb/> indignation" began to rise, and I said almost<lb/>
                    petulantly, "<hi rend="underline">Yes</hi>, she <hi rend="underline">is</hi> a
                    Yankee girl, and she is<lb/> proud of it, and so <hi rend="underline">am I</hi>.
                        &mdash; <hi rend="underline">More that that</hi> &mdash;<lb/> she
                    would die sooner than submit to have<lb/> the glorious Stars and stripes
                        trampled <orig reg="underfoot">under<lb/> foot</orig> by <hi rend="underline"
                        >traitors</hi> without giving them their<lb/> just reward <hi
                        rend="underline">a traitors doom</hi>." and I will<lb/> fight for her and
                    her country, and rest assured,<lb/>
                    <hi rend="underline">I'll</hi> not submit or return home, until <hi
                        rend="underline">your</hi><lb/> unholy flag be trailed in the dust. <hi
                        rend="underline">aye destroyed</hi>."</p>

                <p>We conversed some time longer, during which<lb/> I did not fail to <orig
                        reg="instill">instil</orig> into her mind, that<lb/> patriotism, to <orig
                        reg="one's">ones</orig> country, consists in "obeying<lb/> the constitution
                    and enforcing the laws." and I<lb/> flatter myself I left her a less violent
                    secessionist<lb/> than she was when I went there.&mdash; At any rate<lb/>
                    she condescended to give me my supper, while<lb/> she would not some others who
                    were there.</p>

                <p>I would answer your kind letters in a more<lb/> detailed and concise form, my
                    darling but my<lb/> head instead of ceasing to ache. "<hi rend="underline">puts
