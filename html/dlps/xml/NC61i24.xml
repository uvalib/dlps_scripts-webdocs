     <salute>Dear Addie:</salute>
    </opener>


    <p>Your short but interesting <lb/> note of the 10<hi rend="super">th</hi> Hal gave me this <lb/> morning. and I haste
     to reply. <lb/>
    </p>

    <p>I wrote you last week that I <lb/> I was on the Silver Lake as a guard <lb/> with Leiut.
     Wood. we are still on board <lb/> of her and bound to Gallipolis O. <lb/> where I will mail
     this. The boat <lb/> trembles so much from the working <lb/> of her engines that it is almost
     <lb/> impossible to write legably, however <lb/> as the landlord said, "its our best accom-
     <lb/> modations" and I will do as well as I can <lb/>
    </p>
    <pb n="2" entity="DSSR_000000766_0390"/>
    <p>This is a most beautiful day here, <lb/> the trees and shrubs along the shore <lb/> look as
     fresh and green as in June while <lb/> a gentle breeze murmurs by and ripples <lb/> the clear
     and beautiful waters of the <lb/> Kanawha. The Kanawha Valley! I wish <lb/> you could see it in
     its wild and <lb/> picturesque beauty. I think it the most <lb/> beautiful valley I ever saw,
     It seems <lb/> almost sacrilege that pitiless war <lb/> should seek to deform such beauty,
     <lb/> but with a ruthless hand she seeks <lb/> to destroy. We have just passed <lb/> the black
     scorched timbers which <lb/> alone remain of the once splendid <lb/> steamer "Julia Maffit".
     When Wise first <lb/> commenced his depredations in the <lb/> Ka Vally he impressed the Julia
     Moffit <lb/> into the Rebel service; and when Gen. <lb/> Cox was in pursuit of "Wise's flying
     <lb/> Brigade, Capt. Cotter who commanded <lb/> an artillery company saw a boat <lb/>
     <pb n="3" entity="DSSR_000000766_0391"/> bearing the Rebel flag coming up <lb/> and at once
     turned one of his rifle <lb/> cannon upon her and fired the first <lb/> shot went crashing
     through her <lb/> and all on board made for the shore <lb/> not however till one more daring
     <lb/> than the others, applied the incendiary <lb/> torch and soon she was a smoking <lb/>
     hulk. Oh! shall I be so gald when <lb/> this cruel unholy war is ended. it <lb/> seems so like
     killing friends. but <lb/> in the language of the hoary traitor Wise <lb/> himself, who said at
     the time of the John <lb/> Brown raid, "Treason must be put <lb/> down", and I could
     conscientiously <lb/> shoot him and his associates Floyd and <lb/> Lee like dogs. Don't think
     for a moment <lb/> dear Addie because I say I am tired <lb/> of war, that I am tired of
     supporting <lb/> the glorious old Stars and Stripes on <lb/> the contrary I would not accept a
     <lb/> discharge if one was offered me until <lb/> every ______ banner be trampled in <lb/>
     <pb n="4" entity="DSSR_000000766_0392"/> the dust, and every traitor hung. <lb/> Hal says when
     he comes home I must <lb/> come with him. I have not yet decided <lb/> whether to come or not.
     but I think now <lb/> if I can get leave to come I may. </p>

    <p>Can you explain what it is that <lb/> binds me so closely to Hal? I really <lb/> think more
     of him than my own <lb/> brother. Surely never boasted a sister of a better <lb/> brother. I
     feel far more interest in his <lb/> welfare than in my own. The boys often <lb/> ask me why it
     is that I think so much <lb/> of Lieut. Case, Almost invariably my answer <lb/> is, and it
     comes spontaneously -- "Why should <lb/> not I? He is a brother to me". Is it any <lb/> wonder
     that I like the sister while the <lb/> brother is so good? "Brave and efficient, a <lb/> very
     lion." Such are the _______ passed <lb/> on Hal by members of the ______ who know <lb/> him.
     Pardon me if I say I like you because <lb/> you possess the good qualities of your brother
     <lb/> for it is true -- and -- more. </p>

    <p>But my letter must be getting uninteresting <lb/> if, indeed, it has been other <lb/> wise so
     I will close. </p>

    <p>Please excuse this poor paper for it is <lb/> all I could get, and the writing for the <lb/>
     boat is in a continual tremor. </p>

    <p>Write soon and often, even if you <lb/> do not hear from me every week <lb/> but i will write
     as often as possible </p>
    <closer> Believe me Addie <lb/>
     <salute>I remain Yours ever</salute>
