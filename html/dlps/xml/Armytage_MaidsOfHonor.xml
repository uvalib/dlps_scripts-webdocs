<p><hi rend="small-caps">With</hi> grateful thanks I beg to acknowledge the <lb/>
kindness of Mrs J. Addington Symonds, Messrs <lb/>
Macmillan, and Messrs Sampson, Low, Marston, <lb/>
&amp; Co., in allowing me to make use of '<reg orig="Recol-|lections">Recollections</reg> <lb/>
of a Happy Life,' 'West African Studies,' <lb/>
'Poems of Christina Rossetti,' and 'Life of Louisa <lb/>
Alcott,' respectively,&mdash;also to the Chairman of the <lb/>
Bristol Museum Committee, Professor J. Estlin <lb/>
Carpenter, Sir William Herschel and Miss Herschel, <lb/>
Mr Kirby, Mr Charles Kingsley, Madame Belloc, <lb/>
Mrs W. W. Vaughan, Mr F. B. Sanborn, Mr W. M. <lb/>
Rossetti, Mr W. G. Strickland, and Mr C. Elkin <lb/>
Mathews, for their kindly readiness in lending <lb/>
me the originals from which the portraits in this <lb/>
volume are reproduced&mdash;most of them for the first <lb/>
time,&mdash;also to "Delicia" for her clever delineation <lb/>
of Hannah More's handwriting.</p>
<p>For a detailed list of the illustrations and an <lb/>
interesting "note" respecting Agnes Strickland, <lb/>
<pb n="viii" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0021"/>
together with her authentic pedigree, the Appendix <lb/>
may be consulted.</p>
<p>What shall I more say? Space would fail were <lb/>
I to tell of all the evidences of interest and <reg orig="en-|couragement">encouragement</reg> <lb/>
received,&mdash;always from the most <lb/>
unexpected quarters,&mdash;but I sincerely wish to <reg orig="ac-|knowledge">acknowledge</reg> <lb/>
my indebtedness. Nothing truer has <lb/>
been said as to the making of a book than that <lb/>
"there is scarcely any limit to the improvements <lb/>
which might be suggested, scarcely any point at <lb/>
which an author would acknowledge that he could <lb/>
effect no more." Of this I am most humbly <reg orig="con-|scious">conscious</reg>, <lb/>
and, in submitting these "Sketches" to the <lb/>
Public, I would fain claim sympathy rather than <lb/>
challenge criticism, knowing only too well wherein <lb/>
I have failed, but knowing also, even better than <lb/>
It, the difficulties of portraying, satisfyingly, the <lb/>
rare and beautiful lives of these honourable women.</p>

<ornament type="line"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">In</hi> matrimony "a woman ventures most." Yes, <lb/>
indeed, Jeremy Taylor was right, and that is <lb/>
probably the reason why many of the most <reg orig="ven-|turesome">venturesome</reg> <lb/>
women in all lines of life, and in various <lb/>
countries, have "refused the leap."</p>
<p>In these days, happily or unhappily, women are <lb/>
more a law to themselves than formerly&mdash;more <lb/>
self-sufficing, possibly at times more self-sufficient. <lb/>
But the slur upon "Old Maids," as a race, has been <lb/>
quite effaced by those womenly women who, in the <lb/>
splendid motherliness of a self-chosen celibacy, have <lb/>
not kept within the limits of four walls the charms <lb/>
which have characterised their sex from the first, <lb/>
nor narrowed within the barriers of a selfish <reg orig="domes-|ticity">domesticity</reg> <lb/>
the talents which were "meant for mankind."</p>
<p>It is of such women that we propose to write in <lb/>
these papers&mdash;a "chosen few," perhaps, but, none <lb/>
the less, fair samples of what women can be and do, <lb/>
under circumstances as varied as are their <reg orig="disposi-|tions">dispositions</reg>. <lb/>
If it be true that, to every woman, at some <lb/>
<pb n="xvi" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0029"/>
time or other, comes that offer of marriage which is <lb/>
the highest compliment, surely, that any man can <lb/>
make to any woman, then we cannot be too thankful <lb/>
that these "old maids" resisted all blandishments, <lb/>
and, planting themselves in the very front of the <lb/>
world's battle, bore the brunt of a war with prejudice <lb/>
and misunderstanding which, from Eden to <reg orig="Arma-|geddon">Armageddon</reg>, <lb/>
has been, and will be, waged against those <lb/>
whom it took the Devil himself to tempt successfully.</p>
<p>"The third sex," we are told, "is increasing, and <lb/>
the competitor who meets man at every turn is a <lb/>
creature like the working-bee, whose desire to be a <lb/>
wife or mother has been atrophied, and the driving <lb/>
force of that desire is converted into a feverish <lb/>
hunger for work."</p>
<p>Whether or not this be the case it is unnecessary <lb/>
for our present purpose seriously to consider; but <lb/>
surely there can be no question as to the superiority <lb/>
of even such mortals&mdash;so pathetically deprecated by <lb/>
Signor Ferrero&mdash;to the "sea-anemone women" with <lb/>
their proneness to hysterics and bursts of amorous <lb/>
sentimentalism, with descriptions of whom the novels <lb/>
of the early part of the nineteenth century abound. <lb/>
All honour be to those who have made the world <lb/>
realise that "woman is the lesser man"&mdash;his <reg orig="fellow-|worker">fellow-worker</reg>, <lb/>
though <hi rend="italic">not</hi> his rival, in all good things.</p>
<p>Where the physical conditions are so diverse, no <lb/>
equality or rivalry is possible, but let each "grow <lb/>
together" and "the time shall declare it"&mdash;whether <lb/>
<pb n="xvii" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0030"/>
or not the "new woman" &lpar;so called&rpar; is not to be <lb/>
preferred to the worsted - working, wing - clipped <lb/>
spinster of former days, of whom it might have <lb/>
been written, her "delight is to sit still." "Nous <lb/>
avons chang&eacute; tout cela!" Bicycling has been one <lb/>
of the epoch-making agencies, and the Miss Mores <lb/>
of the eighteenth century, whose Sundays were <lb/>
"as laborious as those of a colonial clergyman of <lb/>
to-day," would have revelled in the liberty of the <lb/>
twentieth.</p>
<p>The rapid development of women is one of those <lb/>
phenomena to which, in this era of surprises, we have <lb/>
been obliged quickly to accommodate ourselves.</p>
<p>From shadowy beings who lived lives of passive <lb/>
usefulness, or uselessness, they have materialised <lb/>
into a contingent of active workers, whose influence <lb/>
knows no circumscription.</p>
<p>Thousands have already benefited by the ardent <lb/>
yet tactful sympathy, the intuitive knowledge of <lb/>
the world's needs, and the patient fertility of <reg orig="re-|source">resource</reg>, <lb/>
which make the services of a devoted woman <lb/>
so valuable in all schemes either of philanthropy, <lb/>
discovery, or research.</p>
<p>To say that human beings leave "footprints on <lb/>
the sands of time" is altogether to underestimate <lb/>
our own importance. We do vastly more than that. <lb/>
Say rather&mdash;<hi rend="italic">fragments</hi>, imperishable bits of <reg orig="our-|selves">ourselves</reg>, <lb/>
which may be stepping-stones or <reg orig="stumbling-|blocks">stumbling-blocks</reg> <lb/>
to the generations that follow.</p>
<pb n="xviii" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0031"/>
<p>No word of ours can fruitless fall; but how many <lb/>
think of it? The world is but one huge phonograph, <lb/>
and, borne on waves of sound, far out beyond the <lb/>
reach of mortal hearing, our words go echoing on, <lb/>
either for the blessing or cursing of others.</p>
<p>It is a grim thought that we are responsible to <lb/>
our grandchildren, but the fact remains all the <lb/>
same; and perhaps that is why some of the finest <lb/>
specimens of womanhood have contented themselves <lb/>
with the handling of other people's posterity, and <lb/>
can therefore claim to be numbered among our <lb/>
"Maids of Honour."</p>
<p>In an old magazine, long since extinguished, <lb/>
dovetailed in among minute instructions for making <lb/>
bead mats and pomade, fashion-plates of garments <lb/>
as worn by our grandmothers, and quaint recipes <lb/>
for pickling and preserving, is the following short <lb/>
article by Charlotte Bront&euml;; full, so it seems to us, <lb/>
of the tense bitterness of an almost breaking heart <lb/>
&mdash;an exceeding bitter cry for the "more life and <lb/>
fuller" that is wanted by every mortal under the <lb/>
sun:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Where is my place in the world? That is the <lb/>
question which most old maids are puzzled to solve; <lb/>
other people solve it for them by saying, 'Your <lb/>
place is to do good to others, to be helpful whenever <lb/>
help is wanted.' That is right in some measure, <lb/>
and a very convenient doctrine for the people who <lb/>
<pb n="xix" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0032"/>
hold it; but I perceive that certain sets of human <lb/>
beings are very apt to maintain that other sets <lb/>
should give up their lives to them and their service, <lb/>
and then they requite them by praise: they call <lb/>
them devoted and virtuous. Is this enough? Is it <lb/>
to live? Is there not a terrible hollowness, mockery, <lb/>
want, craving, in that existence which is given away <lb/>
to others, for want of something of your own to <lb/>
bestow it on? I suspect there is. Does virtue lie <lb/>
in abnegation of self? I do not believe it. Undue <lb/>
humility makes tyranny; weak concession creates <lb/>
selfishness. Each human being has his share of <lb/>
rights. I suspect it would conduce to the happiness <lb/>
and welfare of all, if each knew his allotment, and <lb/>
held to it as tenaciously as the martyr to his creed. <lb/>
Queer thoughts these, that surge in my mind; are <lb/>
they right thoughts? I am not certain.</p>
<p>"Well, life is short at the best: seventy years, <lb/>
they say, pass like a vapour, like a dream when one <lb/>
awaketh; and every path trod by human feet <reg orig="ter-|minates">terminates</reg> <lb/>
in one bourne&mdash;the grave: the little chink in <lb/>
the surface of this great globe&mdash;the furrow were <lb/>
the mighty husbandman with the scythe deposits <lb/>
the seed he has shaken from the ripe stem; and <lb/>
there it falls, decays, and thence it springs again, <lb/>
when the world has rolled round a few times more."</p>
<p>Probably, in spite of its incorporation in 'Shirley,' <lb/>
this was originally one of the "bits of mosaic" <lb/>
described by Mrs Gaskell&mdash;pencilled on scraps of <lb/>
<pb n="xx" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0033"/>
paper and afterwards copied into the finished <reg orig="manu-|scripts&mdash;and">manuscripts&mdash;and</reg>, <lb/>
as probably, written before that <reg orig="mem-|orable">memorable</reg> <lb/>
Hegira, in 1848, which first opened up to <lb/>
Charlotte Bront&eacute; the delights of literary London, <lb/>
and revealed to the astonished published her identity <lb/>
with the mysterious Currer Bell.</p>
<p>Deliberately disintegrated from its place in the <lb/>
book, it was evidently intended by the proprietors <lb/>
of the magazine to voice the growing discontent of <lb/>
single women in those days&mdash;to plead, with all the <lb/>
effectiveness of a successful author, for a wider <reg orig="out-|look">outlook</reg> <lb/>
and a larger sphere of work than had hitherto <lb/>
been possible to them.</p>
<p>It is hard to realise in this unfettered age the real <lb/>
tragedy of "old maidism" in the days that are past, <lb/>
but if anything would make us do so, it is this <lb/>
bit of flotsam tossed up on an old bookstall; for <lb/>
Charlotte Bront&euml; was no weak neurotic, but a <lb/>
woman whose literary style man have tried in vain <lb/>
to imitate, and whose domestic virtues and <reg orig="accom-|plishments">accomplishments</reg> <lb/>
were as varied as those which amazed <lb/>
the world in 1847. Compare with this the cheery <lb/>
optimism of Frances Power Cobbe, whose life was <lb/>
a fine example of what spinsterhood can be:&mdash;</p>
<p>"There must needs be a purpose for the lives of <lb/>
single women in the social order of Providence&mdash;a <lb/>
definite share in the general system which they are <lb/>
intended to carry on; not selfishness&mdash;gross to a <lb/>
proverb&mdash;but self-sacrifice, more entire than belongs <lb/>
<pb n="xxi" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0034"/>
to the double life of marriage, is the true law of <lb/>
celibacy.</p>
<p>"Until lately the condition of an unmarried <lb/>
woman of the upper classes was so shackled by social <lb/>
prejudices that it was inevitably dreary and <reg orig="monot-|onous">monotonous</reg>; <lb/>
but now the old maid's life may be as rich, <lb/>
as blessed, as that of the proudest of mothers with <lb/>
her crown of clustering babes; nay, she feels that, <lb/>
in the power of devoting her whole time and energies <lb/>
to some benevolent task, she is enabled to effect <lb/>
perhaps some greater good than would otherwise <lb/>
have been possible.</p>
<q>"'On n'enfante les grandes &oelig;lig;uvres que dans la virginit&eacute;.'</q>
<p>"The hospital of Scutari was the cradle of a new <lb/>
life for the women of England, and &lpar;marvellous to <lb/>
relate&rpar; the hospital of Sebastopol served the same <lb/>
noble purpose for the women of Russia.</p>
<p>"Till the cry of agony from the Crimea came to call <lb/>
forth Miss Nightingale's band and their sister nurses <lb/>
in the hospital camp, 'the public function of woman' <lb/>
was still to be sought. A thousand prejudices did <lb/>
that gallant little army break down for ever.</p>
<p>"All faithful work&mdash;be it in the fields of art and <lb/>
science or disinterested labour of any kind&mdash;is as <lb/>
truly work for God as the toil of the most devoted <lb/>
of philanthropists."</p>
<p>Disinterested public work is not necessarily good <lb/>
work, but inasmuch as a woman has always to take <lb/>
<pb n="xxii" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0035"/>
the initiative, deliberately and from a sheer love <lb/>
of it, unbiassed by the hereditary brow-sweating <lb/>
instinct that distinguishes a man, she is at any rate <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">likely</hi> to succeed in what she undertakes, while the <lb/>
personal benefit to herself is indisputable.</p>
<p>We wonder what fate would have befallen those <lb/>
of whom these chapters narrate had they not yielded <lb/>
to the overmastering impulse to write and to act <lb/>
as they did.</p>
<p>We are not advocating "single blessedness." <lb/>
This thing be far from us! It is, at best, but as the <lb/>
made lightnings of Excalibur contrasted with the <lb/>
full radiance of the moon. Not to be compared in <lb/>
relative value of possibility with the "perfect <lb/>
round" of womanhood so nobly planned as to be a <lb/>
fit instrument for the manifestation to mankind of <lb/>
the mystery of the Incarnation. But we would <lb/>
fain demonstrate in these pages that spinsterhood <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">has</hi> a "place in the world," a place which is as <lb/>
"honourable" as, nay more honourable than, many <lb/>
a marriage; where life both within and without <lb/>
can be made beautiful with interests philanthropic, <lb/>
literary, and divine.</p>
<p>If by the reading of this volume any inspiration <lb/>
be afforded, or any aspiration encouraged, towards <lb/>
the betterment of this our world, then its purpose <lb/>
will be fulfilled, and the pleasure which the writing <lb/>
of it has given will be more than justified.</p>

<ornament type="line"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Mr Jacob More</hi>, the village schoolmaster of Lord <lb/>
Bottelourt's foundation-school at Stapleton, near <lb/>
Bristol, probably felt no little disappointment when <lb/>
his wife presented him with a fourth daughter on <lb/>
the 2nd of February 1745; but this same daughter <lb/>
was destined to become world-famous, and to <lb/>
bring countless visitors into the neighbourhood <lb/>
of Bristol, both during her life and after her <lb/>
death. At eight years old we see little Hannah <lb/>
the happy possessor of a long-coveted "whole quire <lb/>
of writing-paper," which it had not needed much <lb/>
coaxing for her to obtain from her observant <lb/>
mother. Mrs Jacob More was one of Nature's <lb/>
gentlewomen, and though only a farmer's daughter, <lb/>
she was a person of vigorous intellect, who fully <lb/>
appreciated the value of education, and had made <lb/>
the most of her own rather narrow possibilities. <lb/>
Bearing in mind the efforts of her later years, it <lb/>
is interesting to notice that Hannah More's first <lb/>
attempts in religious literature were letters to <lb/>
<pb n="4" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0039"/>
imaginary people of depraved character and their <lb/>
replies thereto, full of contrition and promises of <lb/>
amendment!</p>
<p>Probably none of these documents are now in <lb/>
existence, or the reproduction of the square <reg orig="writ-|ing">writing</reg>, <lb/>
with its quaint childish phraseology and <reg orig="spell-|ing">spelling</reg>, <lb/>
would make us realise, as nothing else could <lb/>
do, what were her early tastes and principles.</p>
<p>The evangelical piety of Hannah More is rather <lb/>
remarkable, when one considers that her father <lb/>
was a staunch Tory and High Churchman. <reg orig="Per-|haps">Perhaps</reg> <lb/>
it would be more correct to say that it <hi rend="italic">seems</hi> <lb/>
remarkable at first sight; for it has been noticed <lb/>
that a Nonconformist strain is frequently <reg orig="pro-|ductive">productive</reg> <lb/>
of conspicuous piety in the families of <lb/>
High Church religionists. Three generations had <lb/>
passed since the time when Jacob More's ancestors <lb/>
had fought bravely as captains in Cromwell's army, <lb/>
and it is probable that the precocious child heard <lb/>
many stirring stories of their doings in the time <lb/>
of the Commonwealth, which intensified the <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg> <lb/>
and fiery interest with which she afterwards <lb/>
watched the Revolution of 1793. "Coming events <lb/>
cast their shadows before," and the nursery floor was <lb/>
often the stage whereon, in carriages made of their <lb/>
high-backed chairs, the child played at excursions <lb/>
to London, and drove with her sisters "to see <lb/>
Bishops and Booksellers"&mdash;a curious combination, <lb/>
when one remembers the happy experiences which <lb/>
<pb n="5" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0040"/>
she subsequently enjoyed with Porteous and <lb/>
Cadell.</p>
<p>The following quaint advertisement occurs in <lb/>
the Bristol newspapers of March 11, 1758:&mdash; <lb/>
<q>"At No. 6 in Trinity St. near the College Green. <lb/>
On Monday after Easter will be opened a School for <lb/>
young Ladies, by Mary More and Sisters, where will <lb/>
be carefully taught French, Reading, Writing, <reg orig="Arith-|metic">Arithmetic</reg>, <lb/>
and Needlework. Young Ladies boarded on <lb/>
reasonable terms."</q>
A few weeks later an additional line appears&mdash; <lb/>
<q>"A dancing master will properly attend."</q></p>
<p>At this time Hannah More was only thirteen, so <lb/>
that the statements as to her having been a chief <lb/>
promoter of the school are altogether incorrect <lb/>
and absurd. Mary More, then barely twenty-one, <lb/>
seems to have been one of those thoroughly <reg orig="un-|selfish">unselfish</reg> <lb/>
women of whom there are but too few; and <lb/>
she delighted in developing the taste for languages <lb/>
and literature which her more gifted younger sister <lb/>
very early evinced. The school prospered from <lb/>
the first,&mdash;and no wonder, for the mistresses were <lb/>
no ordinary women; and from their wise teaching <lb/>
scores of girls went out, strengthened in principle <lb/>
as well as richer in knowledge, into a world <lb/>
where "it was the fashion to be irreligious."</p>
<p>Hannah took her share in the school duties <lb/>
when she was old enough to do so; but at <lb/>
<pb n="6" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0041"/>
twenty - two years of age a wealthy but elderly <lb/>
admirer appeared upon the scene, and her <reg orig="engage-|ment">engagement</reg>, <lb/>
to Mr Turner of Wraxall, was doubtless a <lb/>
source of much satisfaction to the little circle, <lb/>
who in 1762 had moved to a large house in Park <lb/>
Street.</p>
<p>It is difficult now to realise the original <reg orig="con-|dition">condition</reg> <lb/>
of Park Street&mdash;described in the 'Annals <lb/>
of Bristol' as "certain land 40 feet wide in <lb/>
Bullocks Park." This "Park" has long since <reg orig="dis-|appeared">disappeared</reg>; <lb/>
but the street still remains, and the <lb/>
house now known as "Hannah More Hall" is a <lb/>
standing memorial of those old-world days. That <lb/>
house was probably the scene of many lovers' <lb/>
meetings, and for six years the curious courtship <lb/>
continued; but at the last moment the gentleman <lb/>
decided that he did not feel equal to the <reg orig="responsi-|bilities">responsibilities</reg> <lb/>
of matrimony, and, after compensating his <lb/>
Amaryllis for her "blighted hopes" with an annuity <lb/>
variously computed at &pound;200 and &pound;400 per annum, <lb/>
he died a bachelor. To the last this quaint pair <lb/>
entertained a "cordial respect" for each other, <lb/>
and by his will she found herself the possessor <lb/>
of a legacy of &pound;1000. The annuity enabled her <lb/>
to feel independent and to devote herself to the <lb/>
study of literature, for which she was really far <lb/>
more suited than to the consideration of the <lb/>
"varying moods" of a middle - aged landowner. <lb/>
The literary world is distinctly the richer, so <lb/>
<pb n="7" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0042"/>
that we are able honestly to rejoice at the <reg orig="cap-|ricious">capricious</reg> <lb/>
conduct of the vacillating lover.</p>
<p>Her first work, 'The Search after Happiness,' <lb/>
published in 1773, was an immediate success, and <lb/>
at once secured her a footing among the <reg orig="distin-|guished">distinguished</reg> <lb/>
writers of that day. At twenty-eight the <lb/>
obscure schoolmaster's daughter awoke to find <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
famous. It was a far cry from Bristol to <lb/>
London in those days. George Stephenson was <lb/>
still unborn, and the natural terrors of the journey <lb/>
were increased by the hordes of highwaymen with <lb/>
which the roads were infested.</p>
<p>In 1763 the "Flying Machine" promised to do <lb/>
the distance from Bristol to London in the <reg orig="amaz-|ingly">amazingly</reg> <lb/>
short space of twenty-four hours; but the <lb/>
addition of the words "if God permit" in the <lb/>
advertisements leads us to believe that this <reg orig="un-|usual">unusual</reg> <lb/>
speed was considered a plain tempting of <lb/>
Providence, and the additional charge of 3s. per <lb/>
head beyond that of the more steady-going <reg orig="three-|day">three-day</reg> <lb/>
coach points to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>It is a red-letter day when, in 1773, Hannah <lb/>
More starts on her first pilgrimage to London. <lb/>
Every step of the way is fraught with interest to <lb/>
the young traveller, whose ideal, Johnson, looms in <lb/>
elephantine grandeur as at the farther side of a <lb/>
great gulf. She has heard of him, read of him, <lb/>
dreamed of him, and now she is to see her hero&mdash; <lb/>
the scarred, uncouth scholar whose brilliant intellect <lb/>
<pb n="8" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0043"/>
could make even his enemies admire and tremble, <lb/>
and who has had the solitary glory of <hi rend="italic">creating</hi> <lb/>
a faithful biographer. For Boswell was that and <lb/>
more&mdash;a friend whose fidelity through good and <lb/>
evil report was as touching as it was rare. His <lb/>
Scottish foresight may have seen bawbees in the <lb/>
Biography which for twenty-one years he collated <lb/>
with such ardent hero-worship, but the worship <lb/>
was not less sincere on that account. And <hi rend="italic">we <lb/>
have the book</hi>&mdash;of which Carlyle, sternest of critics, <lb/>
says, "Out of the fifteen millions that then lived <lb/>
and had bed and board in the British Islands, this <lb/>
man &lsqb;Boswell&rsqb; has provided us a greater pleasure <lb/>
than any other individual at whose cost we now <lb/>
enjoy ourselves."</p>
<p>Starting at two o'clock in the morning, we can <lb/>
imagine the stir occasioned in the simple Park <lb/>
Street household. The young ladies "boarded on <lb/>
reasonable terms" are almost as much excited as <lb/>
the More sisters; but when the last Good-bye is <lb/>
said, the drowsy coach goes lumbering forward, <lb/>
through perils of waters and perils of robbers, <lb/>
as steadily as the exigencies of the way will allow, <lb/>
to the perils of the great city.</p>
<p>"There are only two bad things in this world&mdash; <lb/>
sin and bile," so Hannah More once declared, and <lb/>
this conclusion she probably arrived at during that <lb/>
monotonous journey, when the two evils waged a <lb/>
war with each other all night, all day and again all <lb/>
<pb n="9" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0044"/>
night, on the narrow battlefield of that Bristol <lb/>
coach!</p>
<p>Her interview with Sir Joshua Reynolds was <lb/>
also an event of enormous interest during this visit <lb/>
to London, and as she stood for the first time at the <lb/>
door of his house in Leicester Square she probably <lb/>
felt far more diffident than would many a <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;butante</hi> <lb/>
of to-day at Her Majesty's Drawing-room.</p>
<p>Under the careful training of her parents and <lb/>
sisters she probably was&mdash;like Charlotte Bront&euml;&mdash; <lb/>
"nourrit de la Bible," and there is no fear of her <lb/>
having betrayed such ignorance as did one visitor <lb/>
to Sir Joshua's studio, who, on being told the title <lb/>
of one of his famous pictures, exclaimed, "But who <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">was</hi> Samuel?"</p>
<p>In April 1775 much excitement was caused in the <lb/>
west of England by the announcement that John <lb/>
Weeks, of the Bush Inn, would run the "original <lb/>
Bristol Diligence or Flying Post - chaise" from <lb/>
Bristol to London in sixteen hours; and as the <lb/>
Miss Mores were very "up to date," we may feel <lb/>
pretty sure that this would be the "machine" <lb/>
chosen by them for the next visit to town&mdash;though <lb/>
its alarming speed was much deprecated by <reg orig="old-|fashioned">old-fashioned</reg> <lb/>
travellers, and filled them with mingled <lb/>
terror and dismay.</p>
<p>Arrived in London, she is the cynosure of all <lb/>
eyes; and as if to prove that Barabbas was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a <lb/>
publisher, T. Cadell of the Strand made her the <lb/>
<pb n="10" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0045"/>
handsome offer of the same remuneration for 'Sir <lb/>
Eldred of the Bower' and the 'Bleeding Well' as <lb/>
Goldsmith had received for the 'Deserted Village' <lb/>
&mdash;"be it what it might." This now "unconsidered <lb/>
trifle" was then much praised&mdash;and, what is still <lb/>
more remarkable, and certainly not in the very <lb/>
least a matter of sequence, it was also much read.</p>
<p>Hannah More among the prophets and Hannah <lb/>
More as a humorist are, possibly, characterisations <lb/>
under which she has not appeared upon any stage <lb/>
within the last fifty years. But this is a generation <lb/>
that knows not Hannah! and certainly, whoever <lb/>
else knows anything about her, Mr Augustine <lb/>
Birrell does <hi rend="italic">not</hi>. He may have read her Life and <lb/>
Works from cover to cover, but a man only gets <lb/>
out of a book that which he himself is capable of <lb/>
assimilating, and Mr Birrell is evidently not <hi rend="italic">en</hi> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">rapport</hi> with his subject, and had better have left <lb/>
his unworthy Essay<ref target="n1" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
<note id="n1" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>Collected Essays.</p></note>
 unwritten.</p>
<p>It has a spurious smartness about it which makes <lb/>
its misstatements all the more distasteful to an <lb/>
earnest student of her time, especially when coupled <lb/>
with a condescending air of patronage and <reg orig="superi-|ority">superiority</reg> <lb/>
which sits ill upon a man who has not done, <lb/>
and could not do, one tithe of the work that was <lb/>
done by this delicate woman.</p>
<p>As Charles Lamb whimsically said, "She is not <lb/>
Hany More," and Mr Birrell can therefore criticise <lb/>
<pb n="11" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0046"/>
as harshly as he thinks fit; but with men like <lb/>
Johnson, Garrick, Pitt, Wesley, and Macaulay as <lb/>
counsel for the defence, even her greatest admirers <lb/>
of to-day can afford to smile. In his self-evident <lb/>
desire to be smart, he has forgotten alike the <lb/>
"scrupulous justice which belongs to critics and <lb/>
the delicacy towards the sex which belongs to <lb/>
gentlemen," with which the 'British Review' wrote <lb/>
of her in 1811. To speak of an old woman and a <lb/>
dead woman as a "huge conger-eel floundering in a <lb/>
sea of dingy morality" <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be smart writing, but <lb/>
its taste is questionable, to say the least. The <reg orig="care-|less">careless</reg> <lb/>
condescension with which, in later years, he <lb/>
acknowledges her lineaments to be "very pleasant" <lb/>
is almost comical, when one looks at the strong <lb/>
sweet old face with its halo of silver curls, to which <lb/>
Time has but added the beautiful serenity of a <lb/>
well-spent life.</p>
<p>Let me die the death of the righteous, and let <lb/>
my last end be like&mdash;<hi rend="italic">hers!</hi></p>
<p>The Bristol election of 1774 was very hotly <reg orig="con-|tested">contested</reg>, <lb/>
and the intelligent and tactful sisters did <lb/>
their utmost to secure the return of the Whig <lb/>
candidates, Cruger and Burke, who were <reg orig="triumph-|antly">triumphantly</reg> <lb/>
declared successful by a large majority. This <lb/>
election, "the most interesting that ever took place <lb/>
in Bristol," must have been a time of unwonted <lb/>
excitement for the quiet sisterhood. Burke's own <lb/>
personality was singularly prepossessing, and his <lb/>
<pb n="12" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0047"/>
marvellous oratory was of a power and beauty <lb/>
which has passed almost into a proverb. The <reg orig="key-|note">keynote</reg> <lb/>
of his electioneering addresses on this occasion <lb/>
is contained in the well-known words now inscribed <lb/>
upon the bronze statue erected to his memory in the <lb/>
town of Bristol, "I wish to be a member of <reg orig="Parlia-|ment">Parliament</reg> <lb/>
to have my share in doing good and resisting <lb/>
evil." Goldsmith's 'Retaliation' gives a fair idea of <lb/>
his reputation, but the present generation can <lb/>
realise but little the witchery of his style. He <lb/>
was a frequent visitor at the Park Street house, <lb/>
and during the progress of the election a party of <lb/>
Whigs assembled outside and gave "Three cheers <lb/>
for Sappho," whom some of the crowd imagined <lb/>
to be a new candidate, and the cheers for the <lb/>
lady alternated with the cheers for Burke and <lb/>
Cruger.</p>
<p>The tea-services produced by Richard Champion, <lb/>
the head of the Bristol China Works, for <reg orig="presenta-|tion">presentation</reg> <lb/>
to Burke's hostess, Mrs Joseph Smith, and for <lb/>
Mrs Burke respectively, are triumphs of art, and <lb/>
have never been surpassed in beauty. In 1876 one <lb/>
cup and saucer sold for &pound;91, which was more than <lb/>
three times the value of their weight in gold. One <lb/>
wonders whether Hannah More ever drank her tea <lb/>
out of one of these wonderful cups,&mdash;if so, it must <lb/>
have been a dubious joy, for the thought of a <lb/>
possible accident would embitter the most fragrant <lb/>
Bohea that was ever brewed.</p>
<pb n="13" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0048"/>
<p>From 1775 her time was largely spent in the very <lb/>
heart of London life, and amid all the social and <lb/>
intellectual gaieties which the best society afforded. <lb/>
Her account of the trial of Elizabeth, Countess <lb/>
of Bristol, is full of humour, and her letters are <lb/>
brimming with vivacity and observant shrewdness, <lb/>
verifying her own declaration in her seventy-first <lb/>
year, "My temper is naturally gay. This gayety <lb/>
even time and sickness have not much impaired. I <lb/>
have carried too much sail. Nothing but the grace <lb/>
of God and frequent attacks of very severe sickness <lb/>
could have kept me in tolerable order. If I am <lb/>
no better with all these visitations, what should I <lb/>
have been without them?"</p>
<p>As the trial of Elizabeth Chudleigh is historically <lb/>
and legally noteworthy, it may not be without <lb/>
interest to give her description of the High Court <lb/>
as it appeared to an intelligent outsider:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Garrick would make me take his ticket to go to <lb/>
the trial of the Duchess of Kingston, a sight which, <lb/>
for beauty and magnificence, exceeded anything <lb/>
which those who were never present at a <reg orig="corona-|tion">coronation</reg> <lb/>
or a trial by peers can have the least notion of. <lb/>
Mrs Garrick and I were in full dress by seven. At <lb/>
eight we went to the Duke of Newcastle's, whose <lb/>
house adjoins Westminster Hall, in which he has a <lb/>
large gallery communicating with the apartments <lb/>
in his house. You will imagine the bustle of 5000 <lb/>
people getting into one hall! When they were all <lb/>
<pb n="14" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0049"/>
seated and the King-at-Arms had commanded <lb/>
silence on pain of imprisonment &lpar;which, however, <lb/>
was very ill observed&rpar;, the gentleman of the Black <lb/>
Rod was commanded to bring in his prisoner. <lb/>
Elizabeth, calling herself Duchess Dowager of <lb/>
Kingston, walked in, led by Black Rod and Mr <lb/>
La Roche, curtseying profoundly to her judges. <lb/>
When she bent, the Lord Steward called out, <lb/>
'Madam, you may rise,' which I think was literally <lb/>
taking her up before she was down. The prisoner <lb/>
was dressed in deep mourning, a black hood on her <lb/>
head, her hair modestly dressed and powdered, a <lb/>
black silk sacque with crape trimmings, black gauze, <lb/>
deep ruffles, and black gloves. The counsel spoke <lb/>
about an hour and a quarter each. Dunning's <lb/>
manner is insufferably bad, coughing and spitting <lb/>
at every three words, but his sense and his <reg orig="ex-|pression">expression</reg> <lb/>
pointed to the last degree; he made her <lb/>
Grace shed bitter tears. She imitated her great <lb/>
predecessor, Mrs Rudd,<ref target="n2" n="2"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
<note id="n2" place="foot" n="2"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>A remarkably beautiful woman who, in 1775, was associated with <lb/>
the twin brothers Robert and Daniel Perreau in the forgery of bonds <lb/>
to the extent of &pound;70,000. The brothers were hanged, but Mrs Rudd got <lb/>
off, by reason of her good looks, though all were believed to be equally <lb/>
guilty.</p></note>
 and affected to write very <lb/>
often, though I plainly perceived she only wrote as <lb/>
they do their love-epistles on the stage&mdash;without <lb/>
forming a letter. The Duchess has but small remains <lb/>
of that beauty of which kings and princes were once <lb/>
so enamoured: she is large and ill-shaped; there <lb/>
<pb n="15" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0050"/>
was nothing white but her face, and, had it not <lb/>
been for that, she would have looked like a bale of <lb/>
bombazine. There was a great deal of ceremony, a <lb/>
great deal of splendour, and a great deal of nonsense <lb/>
&mdash;they adjourned upon the most foolish pretences <lb/>
imaginable and did <hi rend="small-caps">nothing,</hi> with such an air of <lb/>
business as was truly ridiculous. I forgot to tell <lb/>
you that the Duchess was taken ill, but performed <lb/>
it badly.&hellip; Elizabeth was undignified and <reg orig="un-|duchessed">unduchessed</reg>, <lb/>
and very narrowly escaped burning in <lb/>
the hand. All the peers but two or three &lpar;who <lb/>
chose to withdraw&rpar; exclaimed with great emphasis, <lb/>
'Guilty, upon my honour!' except the Duke of <lb/>
Newcastle, who said 'Guilty erroneously, but not <lb/>
intentionally.' Great nonsense, by the bye&mdash;but <lb/>
peers are privileged!"</p>
<p>This "notorious evil-liver," Elizabeth, Countess of <lb/>
Bristol&mdash;self-styled Duchess of Kingston&mdash;shared <lb/>
with the American War the attention of England <lb/>
in 1776. Her secret marriage with John Hervey, <lb/>
grandson of the first Earl of Bristol, is a long story, <lb/>
alternately romantic and sordid; but her subsequent <lb/>
marriage with the Duke of Kingston was absolutely <lb/>
invalid, her first husband being still alive, and no <lb/>
divorce proceedings having been instituted. Her <lb/>
fascinations seem to have been irresistible; and even <lb/>
when, by incontrovertible evidence, she was proved <lb/>
"guilty," her judges allowed to her the privilege of <lb/>
exemption from corporal punishment&mdash;<hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of <reg orig="burn-|ing">burning</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="16" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0051"/>
in the hand, which was the old punishment for <lb/>
bigamy&mdash;by straining a point and allowing her to <lb/>
claim her right still to be classed as a member of <lb/>
the peerage.</p>
<p>Hannah More's account also of Burke's <reg orig="impeach-|ment">impeachment</reg> <lb/>
of Warren Hastings is worthy of record, if <lb/>
only for the interest attaching to the orator and his <lb/>
victim. So vividly was the guilt of Hastings <reg orig="por-|trayed">portrayed</reg> <lb/>
in the burning eloquence of his accuser, that <lb/>
for awhile he believed himself as guilty as Burke <lb/>
had painted him, and only when the spell of that <lb/>
marvellous oratory had passed away did he again <lb/>
believe in his own integrity. Surely no higher <lb/>
tribute was ever paid to the magic of the "silver <lb/>
tongue." The trial continued from 1788 to 1795, <lb/>
and for four days at the beginning and for nine days <lb/>
at the close that scathing arraignment went on. Of <lb/>
one speech in 1788 she says, "Such a splendid and <lb/>
powerful oration I never heard. Poor Hastings <lb/>
sitting by and looking so meek, to hear himself <lb/>
called 'villain' and 'cut-throat,' &amp;c.! The <reg orig="recapit-|ulation">recapitulation</reg> <lb/>
of the dreadful cruelties in India was worked <lb/>
up to the highest pitch of eloquence and passion, so <lb/>
that the orator was seized with a spasm which made <lb/>
him incapable of speaking another word, and I did <lb/>
not know whether he might not have died in the <lb/>
exercise of his powers, like Chatham. I think I <lb/>
never felt such indignation as when Burke, <hi rend="italic">with <lb/>

public duty,&mdash;it withers the power of his <reg orig="under-|standing">understanding</reg> <lb/>
and makes his mind paralytic.' I looked <lb/>
at his neighbours, and saw that they were quite <lb/>
free from any symptoms of palsy!"</p>
<p>Of this world-famous trial Macaulay writes, <lb/>
"The place was worthy of such a trial. It was <lb/>
the great hall of William Rufus. Neither military <lb/>
nor civil pomp was wanting. The judges in their <lb/>
vestments of state attended to give advice on <lb/>
points of law. Near a hundred and seventy lords <lb/>
walked in solemn order from their usual place of <lb/>
assembling to the tribunal. The grey old walls <lb/>
were hung with scarlet. There were gathered <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg>, <lb/>
from all parts of a great, free, enlightened, <lb/>
and prosperous empire, grace and female <reg orig="loveli-|ness">loveliness</reg>, <lb/>
wit and learning, the representatives of every <lb/>
science and of every art."</p>
<p>The Queen and the Princesses, the Prince of <lb/>
Wales, and ambassadors of great kings and <reg orig="Com-|monwealths">Commonwealths</reg>, <lb/>
the stern and hostile Chancellor and <lb/>
the high-souled Wyndham, Sarah Siddons in her <lb/>
majestic beauty, side by side with the dainty grace <lb/>
of the Duchess of Devonshire, Reynolds the greatest <lb/>
painter and Parr the greatest scholar of the age, <lb/>
were some of those who listened enraptured to the <lb/>
"sublime and beautiful" Burke; and among the <lb/>
noblest in the land sat the daughter of the <reg orig="Staple-|ton">Stapleton</reg> <lb/>
schoolmaster, and watched with breathless <reg orig="in-|terest">interest</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="18" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0053"/>
a display of colour, intellect, beauty, and rank <lb/>
which has perhaps been rarely, if ever, equalled.</p>
<p>Her tragedy of "Percy" was produced at Covent <lb/>
Garden Theatre in 1777. Four thousand copies of <lb/>
the "book o' the words" were sold in a fortnight, <lb/>
and the play itself had an unusually long run, <lb/>
Garrick taking the principal character, and <reg orig="enrich-|ing">enriching</reg> <lb/>
the performance by a prologue and epilogue <lb/>
of his own.</p>
<p>This tragedy seems to have made the greatest <lb/>
success of any of her plays, and excited the <lb/>
emotions alike of rich and poor. Johnson, Garrick, <lb/>
and Pitt united in praising it, and the author's <lb/>
place in the literary world was definitely secured. <lb/>
For several years she lived a life of adulation, but <lb/>
throughout it all she held tight on to her Sundays, <lb/>
and maintained a degree of real simpleness which <lb/>
could only be regarded as remarkable, were not her <lb/>
early influences taken into account. The Jesuits <lb/>
have a saying, "Give us a child to train until he <lb/>
be nine years old, and you may do what you like <lb/>
with him afterwards," and of the truth of this <lb/>
Hannah More is an example. The purity of her <lb/>
life remained untouched, and if to our modern <lb/>
notions she sometimes appears almost "priggish," <lb/>
it must be remembered that the line between faith <lb/>
and unfaith was more sharply defined in her day <lb/>
than it is now, and she was bold to avow that <lb/>
"Propriety is to a woman what the great Roman <lb/>
<pb n="19" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0054"/>
critic said that action is to an orator,&mdash;it is the <lb/>
first, the second, and the third requisite."</p>
<p>The strange millinery of the upper classes did <lb/>
not escape her observant eye, and both she and <lb/>
Garrick succeeded, by ridiculing the prevailing <lb/>
fashion, in putting a stop to the kitchen-gardens <lb/>
and flower-plots which ladies then wore upon their <lb/>
heads."The old order changeth, yielding place to <lb/>
new," but there are cycles in head-gear, as in other <lb/>
less mundane matters, and we are again threatened <lb/>
with abnormal-sized currants, grapes, and cherries, <lb/>
&amp;c., as well as every sort of possible and impossible <lb/>
insect and shrub, as parts of our toilet decoration. <lb/>
The appearance of Garrick with his head disfigured <lb/>
by bunches of carrots and turnips was enough to <lb/>
startle into common-sense all but the most <reg orig="thick-|skinned">thick-skinned</reg> <lb/>
of his audience, but, alas! in these days we <lb/>
have no Garrick, and the stage, in spite of all that <lb/>
culture can do, becomes less and less of an <reg orig="object-|lesson">object-lesson</reg> <lb/>
in decency and propriety. Her utopian <lb/>
schemes of reforming the character of theatrical <lb/>
representations seems to have died with Garrick, <lb/>
and the sight of his coffin in the same room where <lb/>
she had but lately witnessed him performing as <lb/>
Macbeth, made her resolve definitely to devote her <lb/>
talents to higher uses. David Garrick was buried <lb/>
in 1779, amid great mourning and splendid pomp, <lb/>
in the great Abbey of Westminster, but on the <lb/>
very night of his funeral the play-houses were as <lb/>
<pb n="20" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0055"/>
crowded as if no such thing had occurred, and the <lb/>
mourners of the day shared in all the revelries of <lb/>
the night. Such a satire upon "the fashion of this <lb/>
world" helped no doubt to intensify the sadness of <lb/>
his sudden death, and from that time the brilliant <lb/>
life of London, with all its triumphs and successes, <lb/>
seems to have palled upon her. With a woman of <lb/>
her nature this was no mere "phase," resulting <lb/>
from the painful emotions of the time, but a <reg orig="grad-|ual">gradual</reg> <lb/>
deepening of an innate piety, for which <reg orig="thou-|sands">thousands</reg> <lb/>
have had reason to be thankful. Never <lb/>
again did she enter a theatre, even when Sarah <lb/>
Siddons was taking a prominent part in "Percy," <lb/>
and we cannot but admire the consistent striving <lb/>
after the "highest," which is the keynote of all <lb/>
her subsequent career.</p>
<p>In 1785 we see her installed as mistress of a tiny <lb/>
house called "Cowslip Green," about ten miles from <lb/>
Cheddar; and when in 1789 her sisters gave up the <lb/>
Park Street school and settled in Pulteney Street, <lb/>
Bath, she spent part of every winter with them, <lb/>
and part with Mrs Garrick, for whom she retained <lb/>
the greatest affection and respect. John Wesley <lb/>
much deprecated her retirement to the country, <lb/>
and sent her a message more emphatic than <reg orig="gram-|matical">grammatical</reg>, <lb/>
which runs thus&mdash;</p>
<p>"Tell her," said he, "to live in the world. <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">There</hi> is her sphere of usefulness. They will not <lb/>
let <hi rend="italic">us</hi> come near them."</p>
<pb n="21" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0056"/>
<p>But retreat did not mean idleness, and, from the <lb/>
quiet village of Wrington, year by year issued <lb/>
pamphlets and tracts, which circulated in millions, <lb/>
and were instrumental in counteracting the torrent <lb/>
of infidel and licentious literature which threatened <lb/>
to inundate and undermine England&mdash;her religion <lb/>
and her government. Realising the enormous <lb/>
influence wielded by those in the van of society, <lb/>
she published an anonymous pamphlet on 'The <lb/>
Religion of the Fashionable World,' and, in spite <lb/>
of the absence of "original thought and happy <lb/>
phrases" which Mr Birrell deplores, its authorship <lb/>
was speedily discovered by Dr Porteous, Bishop of <lb/>
London, who at once declared "Aut Morus, aut <lb/>
angelus!"</p>
<p>Her 'Village Politics' by "Will Chip" was <reg orig="pub-|lished">published</reg> <lb/>
by Rivington, instead of by Cadell, in order <lb/>
to divert suspicion from its writer, and, to her <lb/>
amusement and gratification, it was sent to her by <lb/>
every post with laudatory reviews recommending its <lb/>
propagation in her own neighbourhood. It sold by <lb/>
thousands, and the following letter from her staunch <lb/>
friend Dr Porteous speaks for itself:&mdash; <lb/>

<p>In these days when "Quo Vadis" and "The <lb/>
Sign of the Cross" are fashionable plays, it is <lb/>
strange to think of Mrs More's 'Sacred Dramas' <lb/>
having been debarred from the stage by a strong <lb/>
outcry of Propriety. There must have been a <lb/>
sterner sense of Propriety &lpar;with a very big P.&rpar; in <lb/>
those "irreligious" days than there is to-day, when <lb/>
even a halfpenny daily can say of the former, "The <lb/>
tawdry and irreverent could no further go," and <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> <lb/>
&mdash;"the audience cheered itself hoarse in praise of <lb/>
play, playwright, and players."</p>
<p>Comment here is superfluous.</p>
<p>It was in 1789 that William Wilberforce visited <lb/>
the sisters at Cowslip Green, and during his visit <lb/>
an immense impulse was given to their work among <lb/>
<pb n="23" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0058"/>
the poor of the neighbourhood. After visiting the <lb/>
magnificent gorge known as "Cheddar Cliffs" he was <lb/>
observed to be unusually silent, but in the evening <lb/>
he exclaimed, <hi rend="italic">&acirc; propos</hi> of the amazing ignorance of <lb/>
the people there, "Miss Hannah, <hi rend="italic">something must <lb/>
be done</hi>&mdash;if you will be at the trouble, I will be at <lb/>
the expense." This was practically another <reg orig="turning-|point">turning-point</reg> <lb/>
in the life of Miss, or, as she now styled <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>, <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Mrs</hi> Hannah More; and her familiarity with <lb/>
the cottagers, her own tireless energy and <reg orig="abound-|ing">abounding</reg> <lb/>
sympathy, enabled her to write as powerfully of <lb/>
"Tom White the Postilion" and "Black Giles the <lb/>
Poacher," as she had written before in 'Hints to a <lb/>
Princess' and 'The Manners of the Great.'</p>
<p>But the schemes of Wilberforce and the More <lb/>
sisters for benefiting the population met with no <lb/>
response from the people of that benighted region. <lb/>
The very poor lived in a world of their own&mdash;less <lb/>
than half-civilised; and even among the farmers, <lb/>
the only argument for the better education of the <lb/>
children that had any effect was that "while they <lb/>
were at Sunday-school they could not be robbing <lb/>
orchards."</p>
<p>But these women worked on undauntedly&mdash; <lb/>
through evil and good report&mdash;with the energy of <lb/>
the Old and the sweetness of the New <reg orig="Dispen-|sation">Dispensation</reg>, <lb/>
until schools and scholars were alike <reg orig="estab-|lished">established</reg>, <lb/>
and out of a seeming Chaos order and <lb/>
discipline were evolved.</p>
<pb n="24" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0059"/>
<p>"Something must be done," Wilberforce had <lb/>
said, and "Miss Hannah" <hi rend="italic">did it</hi>. She aimed at <lb/>
the highest, but protested most strongly against <lb/>
making the poor into philosophers. Her desire to <lb/>
keep them in their proper place is now out of <lb/>
fashion, and the School Boards of 1906 would scoff <lb/>
at the short and simple lessons of 1799. Her <lb/>
theory was, "suitable education for each and <reg orig="Chris-|tian">Christian</reg> <lb/>
education for all," and the wedding-present <lb/>
for a girl who was married from Hannah More's <lb/>
schools was "a pair of white stockings knitted by <lb/>
herself, five shillings, and a Bible."</p>
<p>The world that now is and that which is to come <lb/>
were thus fairly represented, and many a Society <lb/>
bride goes out into her new life less well equipped <lb/>
than did those old-fashioned maidens of the Cheddar <lb/>
Valley. Truth and honesty are out of fashion too. <lb/>
A "smart boy" generally means a young scamp <lb/>
who has not been found out; a "smart man" is <lb/>
the polite synonym for a clever rogue. Education <lb/>
and knavery keep well in step nowadays. There <lb/>
is not much Bible knowledge in offices, but there is <lb/>
plenty of cheap literature; and boys and girls alike <lb/>
can gloat over it, and leave the "Old Story" until <lb/>
eyes and heart are weary and seared.</p>
<p>From 1799 to 1802 she was subjected to every <lb/>
kind of malicious calumny at the hands of the <lb/>
curate of Blagdon, who succeeded in making her <lb/>
life a burden. From his gratuitous <reg orig="scandal-|mongering">scandal-mongering</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="25" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0060"/>
she was at last delivered by the efforts <lb/>
of the Bishop of Bath and Wells, to whom she <lb/>
had appealed for redress,&mdash;having been, in her <lb/>
own words, "battered, hacked, scalped, and <reg orig="toma-|hawked">tomahawked</reg> <lb/>
for three years."</p>
<p>After the petted life which she had led in <reg orig="Lon-|don">London</reg>, <lb/>
the change must have been doubly trying, <lb/>
and it is no wonder that a serious illness at last <lb/>
laid her low. But her zealous attempts to make <lb/>
her bit of the world better were by no ordinary <lb/>
illness to be thwarted, and after her removal from <lb/>
Cowslip Green they were renewed with fresh <lb/>
vigour.</p>
<p>In 1802 the house now known as Barley Wood <lb/>
was finished, and thither the five sisters repaired, <lb/>
living happily together as they had done in the old <lb/>
days, to the admiring surprise of Dr Johnson&mdash; <lb/>
"Abyssinia's Johnson, Dictionary Johnson, the <lb/>
Rambler's, Idler's, Irene's Johnson," &mdash; whose <reg orig="ac-|quaintance">acquaintance</reg> <lb/>
she had so coveted nearly thirty years <lb/>
before.</p>
<p>The state of the villages round Bristol at that <lb/>
date seems almost incredible.</p>
<p>"Thirteen adjoining parishes without so much <lb/>
as a resident curate. Mr G<gap desc="long dash" reason="missing" id="g1"/>, incumbent of <lb/>
Axbridge, intoxicated about six times a-week, and <lb/>
frequently prevented from preaching by two black <lb/>
eyes&mdash;honestly earned by fighting."</p>
<p>Bristol itself was stigmatised by Horace Walpole <lb/>
<pb n="26" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0061"/>
as "the dirtiest great shop I ever saw"; and the <lb/>
merchant princes of Bristol battened on the unholy <lb/>
traffic in slaves, which was not altogether abolished <lb/>
until 1833. Men of colour were then declared <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">free</hi>, and &pound;20,000,000 of compensation money was <lb/>
flung forth by the English nation; but the worse <lb/>
slavery of ignorance and vice still continues, in <lb/>
spite of all the heroic efforts that have been <lb/>
made, and are being made, to promote the <lb/>
"lordlier chivalry" that would reclaim the boor, <lb/>
the drunkard, and the libertine.</p>
<p>To Barley Wood often resorted many leaders of <lb/>
the "Clapham sect." Henry Thornton, Zachary <lb/>
Macaulay, Wilberforce, and others were gladly <lb/>
welcomed to its old-fashioned hospitalities by the <lb/>
five ladies, now no longer young, who had <reg orig="per-|manently">permanently</reg> <lb/>
fixed their abode within its walls.</p>
<p>Thence issued the series of "Cheap Repository <lb/>
Tracts" published by the S.P.C.K., which had <lb/>
an enormous circulation, and which show that <lb/>
"Patty" also had a sprightly fancy and a ready <lb/>
pen. This sister we may fairly suppose to have <lb/>
been the most akin to "Miss Hannah," as hers <lb/>
is the name which occurs most frequently in <lb/>
connection with the social and literary interests <lb/>
of the latter; but all the five, in their devotion <lb/>
to one another, are perhaps unique in domestic <lb/>
annals. Of these tracts the most popular was <lb/>
'The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain,' the hero of <lb/>
<pb n="27" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0062"/>
which was modelled on a man whom she herself <lb/>
had met. The extraordinary sale of 1,000,000 <lb/>
copies shows its admirable suitability to, and <lb/>
popularity with, the class for whom it, as well <lb/>
as the other tracts, was written.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of Barley Wood was often <lb/>
enlivened by visits from Zachary Macaulay's <lb/>
son, little Thomas Babington, afterwards Lord <lb/>
Macaulay, and on one occasion he was <reg orig="accom-|panied">accompanied</reg> <lb/>
by Henry Sykes Thornton, his juvenile <lb/>
friend. The latter, when revisiting the house in <lb/>
his old age, pointed out with considerable <reg orig="amuse-|ment">amusement</reg> <lb/>
the respective corners to which he and "Tom" <lb/>
had been consigned for conspiring to tell a lie to <lb/>
their gentle entertainers. What the lie was he <lb/>
did not proclaim, but the facile wit of Tom <lb/>
Macaulay was probably more than half responsible <lb/>
for its inception. He told many less innocent <lb/>
lies afterwards; and Mr Birrell's criticism this <lb/>
time is just when he says, "Macaulay's style&mdash; <lb/>
his much - praised style&mdash;is ineffectual for telling <lb/>
the truth about anything. It is splendid, but <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">splendide mendax!"</hi></p>
<p>Another reminiscence of H. S. T. is amusing. <lb/>
On one occasion the two boys were again staying <lb/>
at Barley Wood, and, having regard to their <lb/>
probable tastes, an apple - tart was prepared for <lb/>
them. Hot pastry was Thornton's special delight, <lb/>
and, boylike, he set it aside as a <hi rend="italic">bonne bouche</hi> <lb/>
<pb n="28" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0063"/>
to be enjoyed at leisure when the fruit was <lb/>
devoured. His discomfiture was complete when <lb/>
Mistress Hannah said to her sister, "See, Patty, <lb/>
what a good boy Henry is. He knows that his <lb/>
parents would not wish him to eat hot pastry."</p>
<p>Oh, the misery of being misunderstood! "<reg orig="Dis-|appointed">Disappointed</reg>, <lb/>
unanneal'd," the soul of Henry <reg orig="Thorn-|ton">Thornton</reg> <lb/>
could but submit to fate, and the coveted <lb/>
morsel found its way either to the maw of the <lb/>
scullery-maid or the dust-bin. Sixty years later <lb/>
its ghost confronted him in the old dining-room <lb/>
at Barley Wood!</p>
<p>This same Henry Sykes Thornton, son of the <lb/>
leader of the "Clapham sect," had a quaint habit, <lb/>
in his later years, which will commend itself to <lb/>
all our younger readers and to some impecunious <lb/>
children of a larger growth.</p>
<p>Every Sunday after the midday dinner it was <lb/>
the custom for the footman to bring in a tray, <lb/>
upon which were two piles of coin&mdash;one of shillings, <lb/>
the other of half-crowns. Each person dining at <lb/>
the table was requested to repeat either a psalm <lb/>
or a hymn, and after its repetition every member <lb/>
of the household received a shilling and every <lb/>
visitor half-a-crown. Some children who had a <lb/>
visit to Battersea looming before them, learned <lb/>
Psalm cvii., which they duly repeated in parts, <lb/>
to the great delight of their host. When they <lb/>
had finished, he said to their teacher with much <lb/>
<pb n="29" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0064"/>
approval, "I see that you agree with my friend <lb/>
Mistress Hannah More. She used to say, 'Henry, <lb/>
if ever you commit the Psalms to memory, be <lb/>
sure it is the Prayer-Book version.'"</p>
<p>When it came to the turn of the children's <lb/>
father he could remember nothing but two verses <lb/>
of the "Old Hundredth," but he also received <lb/>
half-a-crown, Henry Thornton saying with his <lb/>
beaming smile&mdash;</p>
<p>"Never mind, Samuel, you have done your <lb/>
best!" which seems a sort of paraphrase on <lb/>
the parable of the punctual and unpunctual <lb/>
husbandmen.</p>
<p>It was Hannah More who first started Lord <lb/>
Macaulay's library, writing to advise him, when <lb/>
only six years old, to "lay a little tiny <reg orig="corner-|stone">cornerstone</reg>" <lb/>
for the same. Trevelyan says that she <lb/>
had the rare gift of knowing how to live with <lb/>
both young and old, and she often kept Macaulay <lb/>
with her for weeks together, the youthful prodigy <lb/>
meanwhile declaiming poetry and reading prose by <lb/>
the hour; and it is probable that the Stanleys in <lb/>
'C&oelig;lebs,' who gave up childish books at eight <lb/>
years of age, are drawn from the precocious <lb/>
Thomas, who devoured good literature wholesale, <lb/>
and assimilated it as readily. His subsequent <lb/>
appreciation of moral goodness and his <reg orig="persever-|ing">persevering</reg> <lb/>
energy in acquiring knowledge may be fairly <lb/>
traced to the influences of his childhood; but his <lb/>
<pb n="30" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0065"/>
"negativism" on religious subjects is a matter of <lb/>
surprise and regret, and his old friend of Barley <lb/>
Wood so deeply felt his defection "from the <lb/>
party of the saints to the party of the Whigs," <lb/>
as Mr Maurice significantly says, that she changed <lb/>
her intention of leaving him her own valuable <lb/>
library, as a testimony of her disapproval.</p>
<p>In 1852, when Macaulay revisited the spot <lb/>
where he had spent so many happy hours, the <lb/>
shrubs, which, when he was eleven, were not as <lb/>
tall as himself, had become masses of foliage, <lb/>
shutting out the prospect beyond; and the "root <lb/>
house," which was his favourite haunt, and where <lb/>
probably many a botany lesson was surreptitiously <lb/>
instilled, had altogether disappeared.</p>
<p>With little outward eventfulness flowed on those <lb/>
next few years, save for the inevitable visits of <lb/>
death, until in 1819 the last blow was struck in <lb/>
the passing away of Patty, whose loving co-<reg orig="opera-|tion">operation</reg> <lb/>
and care had cheered every step of her career <lb/>
from the time when the little sisters had sung <lb/>
themselves to sleep in the nursery bed at <lb/>
Stapleton.</p>
<p>It was in the autumn of that year that Mr and <lb/>
Mrs Wilberforce were staying with them at Barley <lb/>
Wood, and Hannah, whose health had never been <lb/>
strong, had left her sister to entertain their visitors.</p>
<p>Until nearly midnight they sat chatting, and <lb/>
almost Patty's last words were of her beloved <lb/>
<pb n="31" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0066"/>
sister's achievements&mdash;her early days in London, <lb/>
their united struggles against ignorance and sin in <lb/>
the Cheddar Valley.</p>
<p>But "in the flush before the dawning, between <lb/>
the night and morning," the summons came, and <lb/>
it was Hannah who was left, for fourteen years to <lb/>
live alone.</p>
<p>Unfitted by ill-health, temperament, and training <lb/>
to cope with the deceitfulness of servants, she was <lb/>
for many years the dupe of her employ&eacute;es; but <lb/>
when the facts of the case were made clear to her, <lb/>
her course of action was soon taken, albeit <reg orig="reluct-|antly">reluctantly</reg>. <lb/>
At first she so blamed herself for her own <lb/>
lack of perspicacity that she was inclined to remain <lb/>
as she was, and to submit to their wastefulness <lb/>
and ingratitude, as a punishment for her own <reg orig="in-|competent">incompetent</reg> <lb/>
housekeeping; but when it was <reg orig="repre-|sented">represented</reg> <lb/>
to her that she would be condoning sins <lb/>
against which all her lifelong energies had been <lb/>
consistently directed, she determined to move into <lb/>
Clifton, and in a smaller house, with a fresh staff <lb/>
of servants, to begin another chapter of her life. <lb/>
One can imagine that at eighty-three years of age <lb/>
the wrench must have been most painful, but when <lb/>
once the step was taken she never regretted it. <lb/>
Her many friends never allowed her to be dull, and <lb/>
the views on either side of the Windsor Terrace <lb/>
house were compensation in part for the country <lb/>
beauty of Wrington.</p>
<pb n="32" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0067"/>
<p>Three days a-week, from twelve to three o'clock, <lb/>
were set apart for the reception of visitors, and <lb/>
when remonstrated with for thus fatiguing herself, <lb/>
the unselfish old lady had always four reasons <lb/>
ready, which she considered unanswerable&mdash;If old, <lb/>
she saw them "out of respect; if young, hoping to <lb/>
do them good; if from a distance, because they <lb/>
had come from far; if from near home, because <lb/>
neighbours would be naturally aggrieved at being <lb/>
excluded when she was open to receiving <lb/>
strangers."</p>
<p>As her strength for earthly journeyings declined, <lb/>
her thoughts centred more and more on the "land <lb/>
of far distances," and she realised fully that the <lb/>
time of her departure was at hand. Her final <lb/>
illness lasted for eleven months&mdash;long enough for <lb/>
a whole treasury of dying sayings; but the <lb/>
"gayety" of which she spoke in her <reg orig="seventy-|first">seventy-first</reg> <lb/>
year never forsook her, and is not one of <lb/>
the least charming traits in the character of <lb/>
this quiet reformer.</p>
<p>On the 7th of September the end came, and after <lb/>
lying in a semi-delirious state for many hours, she <lb/>
passed away, murmuring as her last conscious <lb/>
words, "Patty&mdash;joy."</p>
<p>There is a deep pathos in the association of the <lb/>
words. One could almost believe that a glimpse <lb/>
of that beloved sister who had shared in so much <lb/>
of her earthly happiness was vouchsafed to her, <lb/>
<pb n="33" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0068"/>
waiting perhaps to welcome her within the golden <lb/>
gates of that beautiful country wherein is "fulness <lb/>
of joy, and pleasures for evermore."</p>
<p>On the 13th of September 1833, every church <lb/>
in Bristol rang a muffled peal, and the tired body <lb/>
of Hannah More was laid to rest in Wrington <lb/>
churchyard, amid every manifestation of respectful <lb/>
mourning.</p>
<p>There lie the five More sisters, of whom Johnson <lb/>
had said, "I love you all!" and of her, the last <lb/>
of the devoted band, it might be said, as of her <lb/>
friend Wilberforce, though in a less degree, that it <lb/>
was her portion to "go down to the grave amid <lb/>
the benedictions of the poor."</p>
<p>Judged by the present pyrotechnic style of <lb/>
literary composition, the success of her work seems <lb/>
phenomenal; but in her day books were not so <lb/>
much a matter of daily outputting as now, and <lb/>
for a publisher to be delivered into the hands of a <lb/>
woman was a welcome novelty.</p>
<p>Phrases, too, which to us seem "stilted" almost <lb/>
to absurdity, were then only the courtesies of <lb/>
everyday life&mdash;so much is the standard of <reg orig="polite-|ness">politeness</reg> <lb/>
in its decadence.</p>
<p>But it is not too much to say that Hannah <lb/>
More will always be remembered with respectful <lb/>
admiration, even by men of more literary culture <lb/>
than William Wilberforce, who said that he would <lb/>
"rather appear in Heaven as the author of 'The <lb/>
<pb n="34" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0069"/>
Shepherd of Salisbury Plain' than as the author of <lb/>
'Peveril of the Peak.'"</p>
<p>Such men as the shepherd doubtless still exist, <lb/>
though their conditions may be different; and <lb/>
among the many new editions that are continually <lb/>
cropping up, perhaps "C&oelig;lebs" and "Will Chip" <lb/>
may yet appear with their wholesome influences, <lb/>
to the displacement of some of our modern writers <lb/>
and the benefit of the next generation.</p>
<p>The facsimile letter here given has no literary <lb/>
value, but as the study of handwriting is so old as <lb/>
to be almost new, it seemed likely that the opinion <lb/>
of an expert thereon might be interesting.</p>
<p>The name and address of the writer were <reg orig="care-|fully">carefully</reg> <lb/>
obscured, and for more than an hour the <lb/>
writing was submitted to a searching analysis <lb/>
absolutely unbiassed by any knowledge of the <lb/>
writer's identity.</p>
<p>"A mass of contradictions" was the final verdict, <lb/>
"with Enthusiasm, Philanthropy, and <reg orig="Straight-|forwardness">Straightforwardness</reg> <lb/>
as its predominant features; especially <lb/>
conspicuous in the Capital letters.</p>
<p>"Probably written by a man not <reg orig="extraordin-|arily">extraordinarily</reg> <lb/>
original or intellectual, but with a marked <lb/>
individuality, combining cultured and refined tastes <lb/>
with an artistic sympathetic sensitiveness which <lb/>
would make literary society and pursuits a delight.</p>

a certain prompt deductiveness are shown respect- <lb/>

<q>A FACSIMILE OF AN ORIGINAL LETTER WRITTEN BY HANNAH MORE.</q>
<pb entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0071"/>
<pb n="35" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0072"/>
ively in the joining together of some of the words <lb/>
and the division of some of the letters.</p>
<p>"Determined and quick-tempered, but too <reg orig="affec-|tionate">affectionate</reg> <lb/>
and large-hearted to be easily offended.</p>
<p>"Rapid in thought and action, there is a lack <lb/>
of dogged determination evidenced in the general <lb/>
'attitude' of the letter, which begins with much <lb/>
flow and smoothness, but gradually droops to the <lb/>
signature.</p>
<p>"A certain tenacity, however, shows itself in <lb/>
the strong downward strokes of some of the final <lb/>
endings; and while aggressiveness is also apparent, <lb/>
the writer is not naturally critical, and, if given <lb/>
at all, the criticisms would be conscientious and <lb/>
kindly.</p>
<p>"Invariably successful, because all undertakings <lb/>
would be carried through, and other people carried <lb/>
along, by the hopeful energy and enthusiasm of <lb/>
their originator, rather than by any real <reg orig="intel-|lectual">intellectual</reg> <lb/>
superiority.</p>
<p>"Not careful or troubled about little things," <lb/>
says our graphologist, "as shown by the undotted <lb/>
i's and entire lack of punctuation &mdash; the details <lb/>
of a scheme would invariably be left to others.</p>
<p>"Ambitious, but with too much self-respect to <lb/>
have any false pride.</p>
<p>"Innate simplicity of character, combined with <lb/>
a keen observation and much versatility,&mdash;shown <lb/>
clearly by the varied formation of the same letters, <lb/>
&mdash;would make a delightful conversationalist.</p>
<pb n="36" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0073"/>
<p>"In any circle the presence of the writer would <lb/>
speedily make itself felt, by an almost unconscious <lb/>
self-assertiveness and a lively sagacity.</p>
<p>"Generous to a fault, but not extravagant, <lb/>
because common - sense would generally govern <lb/>
generosity and prevent squandering; though an <lb/>
impulsive kindliness would always turn the scale <lb/>
when a question arose between mere business <lb/>
and a higher and broader outlook.</p>
<p>"The dominance of some of the characteristics <lb/>
has been subdued by years of experience, as the <lb/>
writing is evidently that of an old person."</p>
<p>So much for graphology! The veracity of this <lb/>
delineation the preceding pages will either <reg orig="demon-|strate">demonstrate</reg> <lb/>
or impugn.</p>
<p>It is Carlyle who says, "Curious to consider <lb/>
the institution of the Right Hand among <reg orig="uni-|versal">universal</reg> <lb/>
mankind, probably the very oldest human <lb/>
institution that exists"; and again, "Of all <reg orig="priest-|hoods">priesthoods</reg>, <lb/>
aristocracies, and governing classes in the <lb/>
world at present, there is no class comparable for <lb/>
its importance to the priesthood of the writers of <lb/>
books."</p>
<p>Of Hannah More it may safely be asserted, that <lb/>
during the strenuous years of her long life that <lb/>
right hand of hers wielded the pen unceasingly <lb/>
in the cause of all that goes towards making the <lb/>
righteousness which exalteth a nation, and never <lb/>
through all those years did it lose its cunning.</p>
<p>I fancy that the left hand knew very well what <lb/>
<pb n="37" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0074"/>
its fellow was doing, and felt a sort of wifely pride <lb/>
in the same; but, after all, is that so very unusual <lb/>
that we can afford to cavil at it?</p>
<p>The ideal helpmate's special function is to be <lb/>
a loyal admirer, even if the only one!</p>
<p>Anyhow, she was fortunate enough to possess <lb/>
a heart so big that the world itself could never <lb/>
fill it, and neither the flatteries of a "miscellaneous <lb/>
society," nor the intellectual pleasures which she <lb/>
so thoroughly appreciated in London, were able <lb/>
to undermine or supersede the innate piety which <lb/>
always distinguished her.</p>
<p>She "saw life steadily and saw it whole," and <lb/>
appraising at their proper values the glories of this <lb/>
world and the next, the lesson is driven home&mdash; <lb/>
to the hilt, as it were&mdash;by Garrick's sudden death <lb/>
in 1779, shortly before the production of "The <lb/>
Fatal Falsehood," which he had been revising for <lb/>
the stage.</p>
<p>Her large-heartedness is conspicuously evidenced <lb/>
in her life-long friendship with Mrs Garrick&mdash;<hi rend="italic">n&eacute;e</hi> <lb/>
Eva Veigel&mdash;"La Violetta" of the Viennese ballet. <lb/>
The fact of a staunch Evangelical and a loyal <lb/>
Romanist being able to spend twenty winters <lb/>
together on terms of closest intimacy speaks for <lb/>
itself, though it is quite likely that in these days <lb/>
when the Italian Mission is becoming more and <lb/>
more realised as a proselytising agency, such an <lb/>
unfettered intercourse would be almost impossible, <lb/>
or at any rate impracticable.</p>
<pb n="38" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0075"/>
<p>Hannah More says candidly, "We dispute like <lb/>
a couple of Jesuits"; but it is clear that the <lb/>
love on either side was in no way affected, nor <lb/>
the possibility of compromise entertained.</p>
<p>Mrs Garrick's death ante-dated that of her friend <lb/>
by eleven years, and the little old lady with her <lb/>
gold-headed cane, who for forty-three years wore <lb/>
deep widow's mourning, and at ninety-seven talked <lb/>
continually of her "dear Davy," now lies by his <lb/>
side, buried in their wedding sheets, within the <lb/>
sheltering walls of Westminster Abbey. Strange <lb/>
to think of!</p>
<p>The versatility which shows itself in Hannah <lb/>
More's handwriting is manifested by the <reg orig="readi-|ness">readiness</reg> <lb/>
with which she devoted the ambitions, which <lb/>
had been fostered under Garrick's guidance, to <lb/>
other interests; and what dramatic powers she <lb/>
possessed were quickly overshadowed by the <reg orig="char-|acteristic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
enthusiasm with which she threw herself <lb/>
into religious and philanthropic reforms.</p>
<p>This divine enthusiasm, however, never waned, <lb/>
as her last book on 'The Spirit of Prayer' clearly <lb/>
shows. It proclaims, in tones as distinct, though <lb/>
less forcible, Carlyle's solemn message to the <lb/>
world&mdash;</p>
<p>"No prayer, no <hi rend="italic">religion</hi>, or at least only a <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">dumb</hi> and lamed one! Prayer is and remains <lb/>
always a native and deepest impulse of the soul <lb/>
of man; and, correctly gone about, is of the very <lb/>
highest benefit &lpar;nay, one might say <reg orig="indispens-|ability&rpar;">indispensability&rpar;</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="39" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0076"/>
to every man aiming morally high in this <lb/>
world. Prayer is a turning of one's soul in <lb/>
heroic reverence, in infinite desire and <hi rend="italic">endeavour,</hi> <lb/>
towards the Highest, the All Excellent, <reg orig="Omnipo-|tent">Omnipotent</reg>, <lb/>
Supreme."</p>
<p>The "sanctified common-sense" which would <reg orig="pre-|vent">prevent</reg> <lb/>
generosity from bursting into extravagance <lb/>
would inevitably be able to weigh well the <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="advant-|ages">advantages</reg></hi> <lb/>
of discriminating charity, and to assess <reg orig="de-|liberately">deliberately</reg> <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">pros</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cons</hi> of a sound judgment.</p>
<p>She was not infallible, however, and suffered <lb/>
much from the ingratitude of Anne Yearsley, the <lb/>
Bristol Milkwoman, whose poems she edited in <lb/>
1784, and on whose behalf she wrote hundreds of <lb/>
letters and collected hundreds of pounds.</p>
<p>This woman was hardworking and deserving until <lb/>
notoriety overtook her and it became the fashion to <lb/>
patronise Hannah More's <hi rend="italic">prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</hi>&mdash;"Lactilla."</p>
<p>To rise from scavenging and milk-selling &mdash; a <lb/>
curious combination, by the way &mdash; to the dignity <lb/>
of a Poetess must have been most upsetting; and <lb/>
Mrs Yearsley, being a very ordinary human being <lb/>
inflated with Success, forgot or ignored everything <lb/>
and everybody except <hi rend="italic">it</hi> and herself.</p>
<p>That her "Poems" had probably less to do with <lb/>
it than anything, would, of course, never occur <lb/>
to her; but we can see here a verification of the <lb/>
graphologist's dictum that Mrs More's energetic <lb/>
enthusiasm would carry success into every <reg orig="under-|taking">undertaking</reg>.</p>

 on Hannah More he still <lb/>
cannot refrain from the rudeness which he deplores <lb/>
with manifest insincerity and disingenuousness.</p>
<p>But her views on Education are so <reg orig="diametric-|ally">diametrically</reg> <lb/>
opposed to those enunciated in the so-called <lb/>
"Education Bill,"&mdash;then, perhaps &lpar;1905&rpar;, already <lb/>

inherent antipathy is not far to seek.</p>
<p>"Hannah More is incapable of a literary <reg orig="resur-|rection">resurrection</reg>," <lb/>
says the Minister of Education.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">It may be so</hi>, but when the struggle of 1906 is <lb/>
only remembered as one more illustration of the <lb/>
extraordinary bias which early training can give <lb/>
to the mind of a man learned in the Law and the <lb/>
Scriptures, the Church shall be quietly <reg orig="extend-|ing">extending</reg> <lb/>
her boundaries throughout the world, and <lb/>
educating generations of children whose Imperial <lb/>
instincts shall march side by side with the <reg orig="prin-|ciples">principles</reg> <lb/>
and practices for which Hannah More <lb/>
pleaded more than a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>"Practical Piety" is going out of fashion quite <lb/>
fast enough: we do not want to ignore its <reg orig="Prin-|ciples">Principles</reg> <lb/>
also.</p>
<p>Who knows but that the "ever-rolling waves" <lb/>
of Time may once again bear upon their crests <lb/>
the quaint old text - books of God - fearing Faith <lb/>
and Morality which were written&mdash;and acted upon <lb/>
&mdash;by the little lady of Barley Wood!</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> clever sketches of Phil May have rendered the <lb/>
tricks and manners of "gutter-snipes" familiar to <lb/>
most of us, but comparatively few are old enough, <lb/>
or willing to confess themselves old enough, to <reg orig="re-|member">remember</reg> <lb/>
the time when the streets teemed with <lb/>
scores of such urchins, who prowled about at their <lb/>
own sweet will, and were under the control or <reg orig="sur-|veillance">surveillance</reg> <lb/>
of no one more humane than the primitive <lb/>
policeman of those days.</p>
<p>It is to Mary Carpenter that the honour belongs <lb/>
of having been the pioneer of a movement which <lb/>
resulted in the establishment of Industrial and <lb/>
Reformatory Schools in every large town in the <lb/>
country.</p>
<p>She was born in Exeter on the 3rd of April 1807, <lb/>
but as the ministerial labours of her father were <lb/>
transferred in 1817 to Bristol, where he definitely <lb/>
settled himself and his family, she may fairly be <lb/>
claimed as a Bristolian.</p>
<p>When quite a child she showed a diversity <lb/>
<pb n="44" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0083"/>
and yet a definiteness of gifts which are seldom <lb/>
combined.</p>
<p>As a verse-maker her attempts were unusually <lb/>
melodious, but it was for perseverance in difficult <lb/>
subjects and a "patient waiting for" of <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
that her life from start to finish was chiefly <lb/>
remarkable.</p>
<p>"Something craggy to break my head upon," <lb/>
was Lord Byron's impatient aspiration, and it <lb/>
might have been Miss Carpenter's also; for when <lb/>
duty called, no obstacle was too great for her to <lb/>
attempt the mastering of it, and difficulties seemed <lb/>
only to brace her energetic mind into putting her <lb/>
ideas into action.</p>
<p>We reap with joy where she sowed with many <lb/>
tears; but it is a matter of thankfulness that she <lb/>
lived long enough to see many of her schemes <lb/>
carried into effect, and, while giving God the <lb/>
glory, to realise that the world was better <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
she had lived in it for seventy years of <lb/>
unsparing work and sacrifice. At first it seemed <lb/>
as if her high-born dreams were to be merged in <lb/>
genteel governessing and the uneventful routine <lb/>
of a first-class school, but she was only possessing <lb/>
her soul in patience, and when the fulness of time <lb/>
was come she was quick to seize her opportunity <lb/>
and to devote herself to more active and arduous <lb/>
duties.</p>
<p>Life to her was always a most earnest business <lb/>
<pb n="45" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0084"/>
&mdash;no mere game of chance to be carelessly enjoyed, <lb/>
but a solemn trusteeship to be sacredly discharged.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">How</hi> she discharged it this chapter shall strive <lb/>
to tell.</p>
<p>Although, from her earliest years, there was an <lb/>
innate purpose and religiousness underlying the <lb/>
varied gifts and accomplishments of Mary <reg orig="Car-|penter">Carpenter</reg>, <lb/>
perhaps the two great moving factors of <lb/>
her life were the Bristol Riots in 1831, and the <lb/>
visit to England, two years later, of Rammohun <lb/>
Roy.</p>
<p>These two events, diverse as they appear, stirred <lb/>
her to an intensity of earnestness and a realisation <lb/>
of personal responsibility which had previously only <lb/>
smouldered unseen, and the solemn vows then <reg orig="regis-|tered">registered</reg> <lb/>
by her were to be performed in after days <lb/>
with corresponding solemnity.</p>
<p>Mary Carpenter was at no time a handsome <lb/>
woman, but her "great grey eyes, so slow and <lb/>
wise," gave to her face a look of far-seeing <reg orig="intel-|ligence">intelligence</reg> <lb/>
which was accentuated by a broad brow <lb/>
and a determined but humorous mouth. Though <lb/>
loving beauty in all things, with a keen eye to <lb/>
nature's glories and a brain and hand which loved <lb/>
to portray and to write of them, she was singularly <lb/>
careless of her own personal appearance, and the <lb/>
first impression which she created was apt to be <lb/>
one of disappointment, on account of an <reg orig="indescrib-|able">indescribable</reg> <lb/>
lack of attention to feminine details which are <lb/>
<pb n="46" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0085"/>
supposed to be among a woman's charms. Tall and <lb/>
angular always, she certainly owed nothing to her <lb/>
"fixings," but all was forgotten when once her <reg orig="in-|terest">interest</reg> <lb/>
was aroused or her sympathies honestly <reg orig="awak-|ened">awakened</reg>; <lb/>
while her intelligent criticisms on science, <lb/>
art, and literature are enough to reassure us as to <lb/>
the charm of her conversation, and to testify to her <lb/>
busy and assimilative brain.</p>
<p>History, German literature, Poetry, Geology, and <lb/>
General Science were each and all a delight to her, <lb/>
and, while loving mystical and metaphysical <reg orig="sub-|jects">subjects</reg>, <lb/>
nothing ever diverted her from her self-chosen <lb/>
task of bettering the masses.</p>
<p>Scientific methods characterised all her <reg orig="philan-|thropic">philanthropic</reg> <lb/>
work, and the zeal and skill with which she <lb/>
had classified geological and botanical specimens in <lb/>
early years were not wanting when subsequently <lb/>
applied to the classification of the poor little <reg orig="mor-|tals">mortals</reg> <lb/>
who swarmed in the streets of Bristol.</p>
<p>It was on the evening of Sunday, October 30, <lb/>
1831, that all England was startled by an outbreak <lb/>
of brutish passions and insane destructiveness which <lb/>
to this day has left its traces on the old metropolis <lb/>
of the West. It is difficult in times of peace to <lb/>
realize the fury of war and the danger of a false <lb/>
security, but as long as the world lasts a substratum <lb/>
of crime and violence will always exist under the <lb/>
veneer of a superficial civilisation. This fact was <lb/>
painfully brought home to the sensitive spirit of <lb/>
<pb n="47" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0086"/>
Mary Carpenter by the horrors of that autumn <lb/>
Sunday. From her sheltered home in Great George <lb/>
Street she could hear the clamour of the infuriated <lb/>
mob, the roar of the burning buildings, and the <lb/>
tramp of the soldiery. Against the glare of the <lb/>
conflagrations the many spires of "the city of <lb/>
churches" stood out like stern fingers of <reg orig="judg-|ment">judgment</reg>; <lb/>
but all unheeding the rioters sped on, until <lb/>
the streets ran red with mingled wine and blood.</p>
<p>A stultified etiquette and a mistaken <reg orig="forbear-|ance">forbearance</reg> <lb/>
entailed the death of many, and the <reg orig="destruc-|tion">destruction</reg> <lb/>
of much that was of priceless value to the <lb/>
city; and while the "storm and stress" of life was <lb/>
brought home to her in such vivid colouring, we <lb/>
can imagine how all that was best in such a <lb/>
nature as hers would yearn, with a divine <reg orig="dis-|content">discontent</reg>, <lb/>
for the redemption and betterment of <lb/>
men. Not until then had she given much earnest <lb/>
thought to the wretched condition of the poor and <lb/>
friendless, though for many years she had devoted <lb/>
part of every Sunday and some hours of every <lb/>
week to teaching and visiting her Sunday-school <lb/>
scholars and their families.</p>
<p>But the Bristol Riots gave a fresh purpose to <lb/>
her life, and her real "soul's awakening" may <lb/>
justly be dated from the shock of that awful <lb/>
Sunday. The suicide of Colonel Brereton was not <lb/>
the least sad of the many sad results of that fatal <lb/>
day, for it could not have been personal cowardice <lb/>
<pb n="48" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0087"/>
that induced that unfortunate officer to send away <lb/>
the troops and to behave in a manner so contrary <lb/>
to all the traditions of the English army. A <lb/>
certain "iron-sidedness" is <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> sometimes, <lb/>
and summary retribution for rebellion is often the <lb/>
truest kindness in the end, even to the rebels <lb/>
themselves.</p>
<p>To the vow made by her, five months later, is <lb/>
directly traceable the work which eventually <reg orig="be-|came">became</reg> <lb/>
alike her goal and her monument. What <lb/>
she determined upon almost in desperation became <lb/>
the real love-story of her life, the motive power of <lb/>
all her subsequent career.</p>
<p>On the 1st of January 1832 she wrote, "How <lb/>
awful the state of public affairs in which we have <lb/>
entered this New Year! I feel deeply moved that <lb/>
I can do no more towards alleviating the distress <lb/>
of the poor, but I hope that I shall be enabled to <lb/>
do so"; and the following is the entry in her <lb/>
Diary on the Fast Day appointed in view of the <lb/>
first advent of cholera, on the 21st of March in <lb/>
the same year: "I wish on this day appointed for <lb/>
public humiliation before God to record my earnest <lb/>
desire to become more useful to my fellow-creatures, <lb/>
and my prayer to our Heavenly Father is, to <lb/>
guide me by His light into the way of discovering <lb/>
the means and of rightly employing them. The <lb/>
first and most obvious way is by myself giving <lb/>
to others such as may glorify their Father in <lb/>
<pb n="49" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0088"/>
Heaven, and I must do this by simply and humbly, <lb/>
but zealously and constantly, working the work of <lb/>
Him who placed us here. I must be careful never <lb/>
to neglect any <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> duties, for others which only <lb/>
appear to me useful and desirable; but when the <lb/>
hand of Providence does point out any way of <lb/>
doing good more extensively, I must engage in it <lb/>
with thankfulness and ardour but with humility, <lb/>
caring not at all for my own comfort or labour. <lb/>
These things I have written to be a witness against <lb/>
me if ever I should forget what ought to be the <lb/>
object of all my <hi rend="italic">active</hi> exertions in this life."</p>
<p>This is not the emotional utterance of a "<reg orig="kid-|glove">kid-glove</reg> <lb/>
philanthropist," but the deliberate resolution <lb/>
of one who "saw life steadily," and in the seeing of <lb/>
it was stimulated to a great desire to devote herself <lb/>
to the improvement of her fellow-creatures.</p>
<p>But the time was not yet.</p>
<p>Home duties, pressing and various&mdash;"the daily <lb/>
round, the common task"&mdash;involving as much real <lb/>
concentration and unselfishness, but without any of <lb/>
the "kudos" of public work, were all-absorbing for <lb/>
the time being, though the visits of Dr Tuckermann <lb/>
and Rammohun Roy alike re-inspired her ardent <lb/>
longings for a larger life and a more apparent <reg orig="self-|surrender">self-surrender</reg></p>
<p>But the inner life of Mary Carpenter was too <lb/>
sincerely religious for her to dream of neglecting <lb/>
the duties of home.</p>
<pb n="50" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0089"/>
<p>"Do the duty which lies nearest thee, which <lb/>
thou knowest to be a duty! Thy second duty <lb/>
will already have become clearer."</p>
<p>Carlyle's grand words might have been her motto <lb/>
throughout the seventy years of her manifold toil.</p>
<p>"The next thing" was with her always <hi rend="italic">the</hi> <lb/>
thing to be done,&mdash;the rest could wait for His <lb/>
good pleasure.</p>
<p>Never forgetting it, never for one moment really <lb/>
setting it aside, she just <hi rend="italic">waited</hi>&mdash;which is the <lb/>
hardest thing of all to do well&mdash;until the <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
developed itself, and then, strengthened by <lb/>
years of patient preparation, she came forward as <lb/>
one of the world's champions against the powers of <lb/>
evil, with a ripened experience and a vigour tenfold <lb/>
intensified.</p>
<p>"First the blade, then the ear, then the full <lb/>
corn in the ear."</p>
<p>Between 1831 and 1840 there were times of <lb/>
"gloomy sorrow," of exceeding depression, of <lb/>
"fightings and fears without, within," of physical <lb/>
and mental weariness, of disappointment and <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg> <lb/>
self-depreciation such as nearly all noble <lb/>
souls have endured, culminating in the death of <lb/>
that revered father whom most she loved on <lb/>
earth.</p>
<p>On the first Sunday of the year 1840 she "formed <lb/>
a resolution to give up all desires and hopes to <lb/>
God." "I feel from experience," she wrote on April <lb/>
<pb n="51" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0090"/>
3rd, "that the more I can do this, the more my <lb/>
mind will be at peace."</p>
<p>A few days later her faith was tested to its <lb/>
foundations, for just as the very shadow of the Cross <lb/>
was falling upon Christendom, the tidings came that <lb/>
Dr Carpenter had been drowned while on the way <lb/>
from Leghorn to Marseilles. In search of renewed <lb/>
health, he had gone abroad full of bright hopes of <lb/>
future usefulness, but "God took him," and <reg orig="hence-|forth">henceforth</reg> <lb/>
only his memory remained as an incentive and <lb/>
a benediction. There were times when she sorrowed <lb/>
under the realisation that none of his best-beloved <lb/>
had been with him at the last, but gradually it <lb/>
grew to be a comforting thought that he had been <lb/>
spared the long physical pain of dying, and had <lb/>
just been taken up by God's own hand from this <lb/>
world into <hi rend="italic">that.</hi></p>
<p>Life was never quite the same to her again. <lb/>
Tenacity of purpose almost involves tenacity of <lb/>
memory and of affection, but as earthly ties <lb/>
loosened, her purposes strengthened, and at last, <lb/>
in August 1846, the first Ragged School was opened <lb/>
in Bristol, with an attendance of seven boys, who <lb/>
brought with them a dozen more in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The scene must have been a strange <reg orig="one&mdash;dis-|couraging">one&mdash;discouraging</reg> <lb/>
and unpromising in the extreme. No <lb/>
boy present had any shoes, stockings, or shirt, and, <lb/>
what was far worse, none of them had any home <lb/>
or the most elementary ideas of order or discipline. <lb/>
<pb n="52" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0091"/>
Their novel surroundings held them in check for a <lb/>
few minutes, and then a voice was heard, friendly <lb/>
yet defiant, "Let's have a fight!"</p>
<p>The motion was carried unanimously, and in an <lb/>
instant a battle-royal was in full swing. One can <lb/>
imagine that on that sultry summer day those poor <lb/>
waifs found the confinement within four walls <reg orig="in-|supportably">insupportably</reg> <lb/>
irksome, and longed for the freedom of <lb/>
the gutter.</p>
<p>All of them, however, in spite of their scanty <lb/>
clothing, seemed better fed than the children of the <lb/>
respectable poor, for the former had no misgivings <lb/>
as to the rights of property, and promptly annexed <lb/>
anything eatable that came in their way. To be <lb/>
hungry was natural, to satisfy hunger was equally <lb/>
so in their estimation, and they recognised no <lb/>
barriers save the law, which punished but did <lb/>
not prevent either the hunger or the theft. The <lb/>
animal instinct of self-preservation was their only <lb/>
guide, and to all intents and purposes they were as <lb/>
guiltless as any other animal that refuses to die <lb/>
when the means for living are within its grasp.</p>
<p>This, however, was only the beginning of things, <lb/>
and four months later the experiment had proved <lb/>
so successful that new premises were opened in <lb/>
St James's Back, where for twenty-five years this <lb/>
small but important work was steadily carried on.</p>
<p>The knowledge which she had gained of the art <lb/>
of teaching was now an incalculable benefit. She <lb/>
<pb n="53" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0092"/>
was called to work upon the raw material, and all <lb/>
her tact and method were needed to keep order <lb/>
and educe intelligence. But her efforts were <reg orig="ulti-|mately">ultimately</reg> <lb/>
crowned with success, and not only were her <lb/>
scholars a credit to herself and to the schoolmaster, <lb/>
but the spirit of chivalry, which, paradoxical as it <lb/>
may appear, can and does exist even in the lowest <lb/>
stratum of society, prompted the worst denizens of <lb/>
Bristol slumland to receive her visits with friendly <lb/>
recognition, and enabled her to go alone, and at <lb/>
night, into courts and alleys which a policeman did <lb/>
not dare to enter save in the company of another. <lb/>
They appreciated her services loyally, and this brave <lb/>
woman was to many of them the only person whom <lb/>
they held sacred&mdash;the incarnation of all that they <lb/>
recognised as good and true.</p>
<p>The influence which she had over her scholars <lb/>
was a practical one, because she realised their <lb/>
temptations so fully. It was to her no surprise <lb/>
that they should sink&mdash;rather that they should <lb/>
possess any power of rising. Their failures in <lb/>
honesty, their frequent relapses into vice, only <lb/>
stirred her into more active sympathy and more <lb/>
urgent work. The life of Mary Carpenter was <lb/>
one incessant mission.</p>
<p>Trained as she had been, mentally and <reg orig="spirit-|ually">spiritually</reg>, <lb/>
every fibre of her being thrilled to the <lb/>
beauty of the Gospel story, and the children felt <lb/>
and acknowledged it also.</p>
<pb n="54" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0093"/>
<p>"This Jesus" of whom she spoke so lovingly was <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">worthy</hi> of their service at any rate, and even in <lb/>
their short experience they had sifted the elements <lb/>
of life pretty thoroughly, and had early found that <lb/>
"the way of transgressors is hard."</p>
<p>"Within that rugged block is an angel!" said <lb/>
Michael Angelo the sculptor, and often must Mary <lb/>
Carpenter, and workers such as she, have thought <lb/>
of his words when from beneath some scarred <reg orig="sur-|face">surface</reg> <lb/>
gleamed out the face divine.</p>
<p>On one occasion she held a lev&eacute;e of ragged school <lb/>
children at Druid Stoke &lpar;then tenanted by Mr D. <lb/>
Sykes&rpar;. They were all drawn up in the avenue <lb/>
leading to the house, and sang several of their <lb/>
favourite school-songs, finally, and at her special <lb/>
request, singing with touching fervour&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Here we suffer grief and pain,</l>
<l>Here we meet to part again&mdash;</l>
<l rend="indent">In heaven we part no more!" &amp;c.</l>
</lg></q>
The appearance of the children was most pathetic, <lb/>
many of them being almost indecently ragged. <lb/>
One tiny girl whose mother was evidently more <lb/>
at home in making bargains than in readapting <lb/>
them, was garbed in a long dress which trailed <lb/>
upon the ground with most ludicrous effect. But <lb/>
the entire absence of anything save pride and <lb/>
pleasure in her new frock sustained the poor mite <lb/>
even in these trying circumstances, and her <reg orig="enjoy-|ment">enjoyment</reg> <lb/>
was complete.</p>
<pb n="55" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0094"/>
<p>A conference of workers, on her initiative, now <lb/>
appointed a committee to urge upon the <reg orig="Govern-|ment">Government</reg>, <lb/>
and the country generally, the desirability <lb/>
of establishing reformatory schools for convicted <lb/>
children, instead of sending them to prison; and <lb/>
in order to demonstrate that such a plan was <reg orig="prac-|ticable">practicable</reg>, <lb/>
she started one on her own account at <lb/>
Kingswood, four miles from Bristol, in premises <lb/>
most generously given by a Mr Scott.</p>
<p>Sufficient interest and sympathy having been <lb/>
excited throughout the country, she was relieved <lb/>
from any anxiety as to pecuniary matters, and on <lb/>
September 4, 1852, these premises were opened.</p>
<p>In 1852 there was no "Clifton Extension <reg orig='Rail-|way"&mdash;electric'>Railway"&mdash;electric</reg> <lb/>
tramways were all undreamed of <lb/>
&mdash;and the physical fatigue involved by such an <lb/>
undertaking is easy to be imagined. Her <reg orig="brother-|in-law">brother-in-law</reg>, <lb/>
Mr Herbert Thomas, travelled for his firm <lb/>
&lpar;Christopher Thomas Brothers, soap manufactures&rpar; <lb/>
in those days, and, as his journeys had to be done <lb/>
regularly, he depended almost entirely upon the <lb/>
carriage which was placed at his service. He was <lb/>
sometimes therefore, able to drive Mary Carpenter <lb/>
from Bristol to Kingswood, but the distance more <lb/>
frequently had to be done on foot, and often the <lb/>
indefatigable woman would return between nine <lb/>
and ten o'clock at night "ready to drop"&mdash;only <lb/>
able to fall asleep in the chair by the fireside. <lb/>
So great, however, were her recuperative powers, <lb/>
<pb n="56" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0095"/>
that in the morning she would be quite ready to <lb/>
start off again on her self - imposed duty. No <lb/>
weather was allowed to interfere, no womanly <lb/>
weakness was taken into account, and work which <lb/>
would tax the strongest was undertaken, and <reg orig="per-|formed">performed</reg>, <lb/>
with cheerful willingness and unswerving <lb/>
purpose. The story of her struggles with these <lb/>
juvenile offenders is deeply interesting, and amid <lb/>
much discouragement she had frequent evidences <lb/>
as to the good resulting from her efforts, while <lb/>
letters from boys and girls in the after days <reg orig="tes-|tified">testified</reg> <lb/>
to the permanence of the teaching received <lb/>
and the love which she inspired among these poor <lb/>
waifs.</p>
<p>Of one John Shawny &lpar;Shaughnessy<hi rend="italic">?</hi>&rpar;, an <reg orig="in-|corrigible">incorrigible</reg> <lb/>
young thief with whom she had much <lb/>
influence, we know that the last thing heard of <lb/>
him after his enlistment was that, during the <lb/>
Indian Mutiny of 1858, he was told off to take <lb/>
care of the English ladies.</p>
<p>He was never heard of again, and there is every <lb/>
likelihood that, in the horrors of that awful time, <lb/>
he lost his life for their sakes. During the <reg orig="night-|watches">night-watches</reg>, <lb/>
under those star-lit skies, he would often <lb/>
doubtless recall some seemingly chance word of <lb/>
counsel given in the Kingswood Reformatory <lb/>
School; and it may well be that he who had cost <lb/>
her so many hours of painful anxiety will have <lb/>
been among the first to welcome her on the other <lb/>
<pb n="57" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0096"/>
side. Not in vain were kindness and sympathy <lb/>
lavished on that poor friendless Irish boy.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"He saw his Duty&mdash;a dead sure thing&mdash;</l>
<l rend="indent">And <hi rend="italic">went for it</hi> there and then,</l>
<l>And God isn't going to be too hard</l>
<l rend="indent">On a man who died for men."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>But the time came at last when she was to be <lb/>
"set aside for stillness," and for many weeks Mary <lb/>
Carpenter lay upon a sick-bed; the vitality that <lb/>
was in her fighting fiercely against the torturing <lb/>
ravages of rheumatic fever. Through all that <lb/>
time the tender inquiries of her scholars and of <lb/>
a far-reaching circle of admiring friends were a <lb/>
touching evidence to the value of her life and <lb/>
work; and when again she was able to take an <lb/>
active share in the organisations which she had <lb/>
promoted, it was with a deepened sympathy in <lb/>
human suffering and a wider outlook upon heavenly <lb/>
things.</p>
<p>Not until she had personally tested the working <lb/>
of the Reformatory at Kingswood did she undertake <lb/>
the formation of another, for <hi rend="italic">girls only,</hi> at the Red <lb/>
Lodge, and of this she took the entire management, <lb/>
Lady Noel Byron assisting in the purchase of the <lb/>
property and giving invaluable help both in money <lb/>
and encouragement.</p>
<p>The name of Lady Byron carries us back to the <lb/>
days when the passionate poetry of her husband <lb/>
was flooding the world. At this time, 1857, she <lb/>
<pb n="58" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0097"/>
had been a legal widow for more than thirty years, <lb/>
but in reality she was widowed from the day of her <lb/>
marriage in 1815. No more disastrous union could <lb/>
have been made. "Fire is a good servant, but a <lb/>
bad master," and poor Byron was <hi rend="italic">all</hi> fire, as the <lb/>
quiet and simple-minded Miss Milbanke very soon <lb/>
discovered. The reformation of a rake is an <reg orig="un-|gracious">ungracious</reg> <lb/>
task at best, and no one less fitted for <lb/>
such an office could well be imagined. Whether <lb/>
this was her day-dream we know not, but the <lb/>
awakening came only too soon.</p>
<p>On the anniversary of their wedding-day in 1821 <lb/>
Lord Byron wrote:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"This day of all our days has done</l>
<l rend="indent">The worst for me and you:</l>
<l>'Tis just six years since we were <hi rend="italic">one,</hi></l>
<l rend="indent">And five since we were <hi rend="italic">two.</hi>"</l>
</lg></q>
But we know that there could never have been <lb/>
any true union between this most ill-assorted pair, <lb/>
though they did not separate until 1816.</p>
<p>Henceforward Lady Byron devoted herself to <lb/>
their child Ada, and to the furtherance of <reg orig="benefi-|cent">beneficent</reg> <lb/>
schemes among the poor. Because her own <lb/>
life had been spoiled she seemed to long all the <lb/>
more intensely for the happiness of others, and <lb/>
this Red Lodge Home was only one among many <lb/>
good agencies with which she was associated.</p>
<p>The "sanctified common-sense" and enthusiastic <lb/>
but practical Christianity of Mary Carpenter were <lb/>
<pb n="59" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0098"/>
very attractive to one whose calm, quiet goodness <lb/>
was conspicuous. It had never varied even in the <lb/>
subtle agony of an unrequited affection, the <reg orig="hyster-|ical">hysterical</reg> <lb/>
accusations of her husband's admirers and the <lb/>
unhomeliness of her own home; but the stronger <lb/>
individuality of the Bristol philanthropist gained <lb/>
her loving confidence, which was warmly <reg orig="recipro-|cated">reciprocated</reg>, <lb/>
and of her three literary executors Mary <lb/>
Carpenter was one.</p>
<p>Her death in 1860 was an unspeakable sorrow to <lb/>
the surviving friend, and a few verses composed by <lb/>
the latter at this time may not be out of place here.</p>

<p>The Red Lodge stands at the top of Lodge Street <lb/>
on the foundation of an ancient Carmelite abbey <lb/>
dating back to 1590. Its history has much in it <lb/>
that appeals to the imagination, for which we must <lb/>
refer our readers to books on the subject, but there <lb/>
is a striking contrast, which the least imaginative <lb/>
mind can readily grasp, between the past and <lb/>
present inmates of that historic house.</p>
<p>After forty years of varied experiences Mary <lb/>
Carpenter left Great George Street, and, in 1858, <lb/>
took up her abode in the Red Lodge, where she <lb/>
laboured with ever-increasing zeal for six years.</p>
<p>As an instance of her perspicuity and ready wit <lb/>
we may relate the following anecdote:&mdash;</p>
<p>A girl at the Red Lodge had a rooted objection <lb/>
to laundry-work, and the weekly washing-day was <lb/>
invariably the signal for a seizure of the most <lb/>
alarming kind. She became absolutely rigid, <lb/>
foaming at the mouth, and altogether in a most <lb/>
abnormal condition. Miss Carpenter's observant <lb/>
mind took cognisance of these regularly recurrent <lb/>
fits, and in her own practical fashion she formed <lb/>
her conclusions and determined on the remedy <lb/>
required. Having sent for the doctor she saw <lb/>
him alone, and requested him to notice the <lb/>
<pb n="61" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0100"/>
symptoms and to corroborate her proposed method <lb/>
of treatment.</p>
<p>"I have been strictly investigating the nature of <lb/>
these fits, doctor," she said quietly, as they stood <lb/>
together by the bedside of the apparently <reg orig="uncon-|scious">unconscious</reg> <lb/>
girl, "and I find that the most efficacious <lb/>
cure is the application of hot iron to the soles of <lb/>
the feet."</p>
<p>The doctor acquiesced with a professional gravity <lb/>
that did him infinite credit. Turning to the nurse <lb/>
Miss Carpenter said sharply, "Heat me that poker <lb/>
red-hot immediately."</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">prescription alone</hi> was instantaneously <lb/>
effective!</p>
<p>The maiden sat up and began to speak. There <lb/>
were no more fits on washing-days!</p>
<p>We stated at the beginning of this chapter that <lb/>
the two great moving factors in her life were &lpar;1&rpar; <lb/>
the Bristol Riots, and &lpar;2&rpar; the visit of Rammohun <lb/>
Roy. The manifold results of the former having <lb/>
been imperfectly sketched, we must now touch <lb/>
briefly upon the influence which the memory of <lb/>
the latter exerted upon the last ten years of her <lb/>
eventful life.</p>
<p>In 1864 the subject of Female Education in <lb/>
India was strongly brought home to her by a <lb/>
visit from Mr Tagore and Mr Ghose, two Hindu <lb/>
gentlemen from Bengal who were studying in <lb/>
London; and having once been imbued with the <lb/>
<pb n="62" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0101"/>
idea that she was to be the pioneer of that <reg orig="move-|ment">movement</reg>, <lb/>
she waited patiently until once more her <lb/>
way should be made clear.</p>
<p>Two years later that time came. It was in 1866 <lb/>
that she sailed for India, and on arriving she at <lb/>
once set to work to establish a free school for <lb/>
"the poorest of the poor" at Calcutta.</p>
<p>After six months of glorious work she returned <lb/>
to England, feeling that the establishment of <lb/>
Female Normal Training Schools in India was <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">en train;</hi> and Lord Dufferin, than whom none <lb/>
can speak more weightily, lays much stress upon <lb/>
this first visit.</p>
<p>The interest shown by the Queen was most <reg orig="in-|spiring">inspiring</reg>, <lb/>
and Miss Carpenter's interview with Her <lb/>
Majesty at Windsor, in 1868, gave a prestige <lb/>
to this fresh undertaking which would otherwise <lb/>
have been lacking. On this, as on all occasions, <lb/>
her personal feelings were absorbed in the <hi rend="italic">object <lb/>
of her visit.</hi> She characteristically says, "I was <lb/>
not in the least nervous. I was not going for <lb/>
myself, but for the Women of India."</p>
<p>The two womanly women saw all that was best <lb/>
in each other,&mdash;the Queen-mother and the motherly <lb/>
old maid,&mdash;met and conversed and parted, mutually <lb/>
gratified.</p>
<p>Later in that year she went out again, but was <lb/>
obliged to hurry back on account of illness, <reg orig="re-|turning">returning</reg> <lb/>
in 1869 to see how the good seed was <lb/>
<pb n="63" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0102"/>
fructifying. Her satisfaction on this occasion was <lb/>
extreme; and when she returned to England in <lb/>
1870 she exclaimed, "The work <hi rend="italic">will</hi> go on. In <lb/>
faith and hope I can say, 'India, farewell!'"</p>
<p>But she paid one more last visit in 1875, <reg orig="re-|turning">returning</reg> <lb/>
the following year with the two eldest <lb/>
boys of a Bombay Babu, who were to be brought <lb/>
up in England under her care. The appearance <lb/>
of these boys was most quaint.</p>
<p>The dusky figures, surmounted by small peaked <lb/>
caps, with black tunics belted over loose white <lb/>
trousers, looked as if they had just stepped out <lb/>
of one of Mrs Trimmer's illustrated story - books. <lb/>
They were objects of much interest in Clifton, and <lb/>
thoroughly enjoyed their position; but after her <lb/>
death they were recalled to India by their parents, <lb/>
and were soon safely deposited upon their native <lb/>
shore. After the inevitable f&ecirc;ting which resulted <lb/>
from their close association with Mary Carpenter, <lb/>
and the personal interest shown in themselves, <lb/>
one of the boys found Indian life very flat and <lb/>
unprofitable, and determined to make his way <lb/>
back to England. This he succeeded in doing, <lb/>
but found his reception very different from that <lb/>
which he had experienced on the former occasion. <lb/>
No welcome was accorded him, but only <reg orig="re-|proaches">reproaches</reg>; <lb/>
and within a few days of landing he <lb/>
was once more on his way to India&mdash;Mr Estlin <lb/>
Carpenter having secured a free passage for him <lb/>
<pb n="64" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0103"/>
on condition that he performed the duties of a <lb/>
steward's assistant! There is something <reg orig="tragic-|comic">tragic-comic</reg> <lb/>
in the whole proceeding, but it is <reg orig="satisfac-|tory">satisfactory</reg> <lb/>
to know that he subsequently filled a good <lb/>
position in an Indian Government Office.</p>
<p>The visits of Mary Carpenter to India which <lb/>
we have so briefly summarised were productive <lb/>
of enormous good. Jails were visited, schools were <lb/>
established, and the emancipation of Indian women <lb/>
was advanced in every direction.</p>
<p>The discipline of prisons also received her special <lb/>
attention, and, at the request of the Indian <reg orig="Govern-|ment">Government</reg>, <lb/>
she made many suggestions relative to the <lb/>
treatment of prisoners and the non-imprisonment of <lb/>
children.</p>
<p>These suggestions have for the most part been <lb/>
carried out, and the influences first started by her <lb/>
are still rippling on. The phonograph of life is <reg orig="re-|issuing">reissuing</reg> <lb/>
in varying tones the words that she uttered <lb/>
years ago, and she, though dead, "yet speaketh."</p>
<p>It is not a hundred years since the children of <lb/>
the streets were regarded only as a part of that <lb/>
huge social problem roughly tabulated as "the <lb/>
lower classes," and it was left to Mary Carpenter <lb/>
to disintegrate them.</p>
<p>By her they were divided into three distinct <lb/>
sets of scholars:&mdash;</p>
<list>
<item>1. <hi rend="italic">Habitually depraved children,</hi> for whom a <lb/>
Reformatory only was suitable;</item>
<pb n="65" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0104"/>
<item>2. <hi rend="italic">Lesser delinquents and vagrants,</hi> who were <lb/>
worthy of training in a Certified Industrial <lb/>
School;and</item>
<item>3. <hi rend="italic">Neglected waifs,</hi> whose worst feature was <lb/>
ignorance, and who might be early weaned from <lb/>
an atmosphere of vice to one of pure living and <lb/>
hopefulness by a Day-feeding Industrial School.</item>
</list>
<p>All these institutions she secured to the nation <lb/>
by unremitting hard work and heroic self-sacrifice; <lb/>
while in India to - day much is still going on <lb/>
which may be indirectly traced to her efforts and <lb/>
her example. As one of England's living thinkers<ref target="n4" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
<note id="n4" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>Rev. H. N. Hutchinson.</p></note>
 <lb/>
strikingly puts it: "Force is never lost or <reg orig="de-|stroyed">destroyed</reg>, <lb/>
but only changed from one form to <lb/>
another. As in the material world every physical <lb/>
action produces an effect and thereby leaves a <lb/>
record, so in the moral world does every act, <lb/>
whether good or bad. There must be a <reg orig="conser-|vation">conservation</reg> <lb/>
of moral as well as of physical energy. <lb/>
The effects of every thought and of every action <lb/>
are immortal, and cannot be lost."</p>
<p>Within a month of her death she delivered the <lb/>
last of her six lectures on India; and so clear <lb/>
was her diction, so accurate her phraseology, that <lb/>
no waste of time was involved, and for an hour <lb/>
and a quarter she was able to rivet the attention <lb/>
of a cultivated and critical audience.</p>
<p>Not least among the gifts of this remarkable <lb/>
<pb n="66" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0105"/>
woman was that of knowing exactly what she <lb/>
wanted to say and how to say it, so that at the <lb/>
end of her longest addresses the reporters had <lb/>
no need to make any emendations in their <reg orig="short-|hand">shorthand</reg> <lb/>
notes.</p>
<p>There was no appearance of impaired vitality, <lb/>
no falling off of energetic sympathy, when, on the <lb/>
6th of June, she delivered her last message on <lb/>
"The Religious Aspect of India."</p>
<p>The extraordinary strain which she had put <lb/>
upon herself all her life, and the frequent <reg orig="rheu-|matic">rheumatic</reg> <lb/>
attacks from which she had suffered, lessened <lb/>
somewhat the shock of her death, though the end <lb/>
was nearer than any mortal could foresee.</p>
<p>Only a few days before, she went to visit an <lb/>
old gardener, and he subsequently declared, "I <lb/>
never in my life saw any one <hi rend="italic">so</hi> tired,&mdash;she just <lb/>
sat down in that chair as if she would have <lb/>
gone through it."</p>
<p>It was on Thursday the 14th of June 1877 <lb/>
that God's hand "beckoned unawares."</p>
<p>After a longer time at her desk than was usual <lb/>
to her at this date, she lay down to rest after her <lb/>
last day's work, and so&mdash;<hi rend="italic">resting</hi>&mdash;they found her.</p>
<p>Four days later a long procession filed past the <lb/>
stately burial - place in Arno's Vale Cemetery of <lb/>
Rammohun Roy, whose influence had so permeated <lb/>
her life; and side by side, near the open grave, <lb/>
stood the two Hindu boys who represented his race, <lb/>
<pb n="67" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0106"/>
and some of the ragged boys and girls of Bristol <lb/>
for whom the cry of her life had been, "Save <lb/>
the children!"</p>
<p>Truly are there many "mothers in Israel" who <lb/>
have never known the anguish of bringing another <lb/>
life into the world, or the rapture of a child's <lb/>
first kiss.</p>
<p>Such an one is Mary Carpenter&mdash;the children's <lb/>
friend&mdash;the saviour of many a broken life,&mdash;whose <lb/>
influence in slumland will be felt for generations <lb/>
to come. Servant of God&mdash;well done!</p>

<ornament type="line"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Sisters</hi> have played an important part in the <lb/>
world's history.</p>
<p>Though eclipsed by their more brilliant brothers, <lb/>
there were none more ready to acknowledge their <lb/>
indebtedness than William Wordsworth, William <lb/>
Herschel, Charles Lamb, and others, whose names <lb/>
stand out prominently in the literary roll-call of <lb/>
England.</p>
<p>And of these sisters, perhaps the one whose <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg> <lb/>
history is the most interesting is Caroline <lb/>
Herschel, without whose invaluable aid the success <lb/>
of her brother would have been hindered, if not <lb/>
prevented.</p>
<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century the <lb/>
Protestants of Moravia fled from the persecutions <lb/>
which were rife in that part of the Continent, and <lb/>
took up their abode in other less conservative <lb/>
quarters.</p>
<p>Among these refugees were three brothers, <lb/>
Herschel by name, who settled in Saxony. One <lb/>
<pb n="72" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0113"/>
of these&mdash;Hans&mdash;was a brewer at Pirnau, near <lb/>
Dresden, and the great - grandfather of William <lb/>
and Caroline. Their grandfather was Abraham <lb/>
Herschel, landscape - gardener to the King of <lb/>
Saxony, and his youngest son Isaac, born in 1707, <lb/>
was their father.</p>
<p>Abraham was most anxious that Isaac should <lb/>
succeed him in the same honourable and probably <lb/>
lucrative calling, but the young man early <reg orig="devel-|oped">developed</reg> <lb/>
a passion for music, and his father's <reg orig="per-|suasions">persuasions</reg> <lb/>
were of no avail. Devoting himself to <lb/>
the study of the hautboy &lpar;oboe&rpar;, he speedily&mdash;in <lb/>
1731&mdash;was installed as player of that instrument <lb/>
in the Royal Hanoverian Band. This was no slight <lb/>
honour for a young man of twenty-four, as no <lb/>
ordinary performer, even on a drum, was admitted; <lb/>
and a year later he felt justified in marrying.</p>
<p>The woman of his choice was Anna Ilse Moritzen, <lb/>
a typical "hausfrau," who doubtless took a vague <lb/>
pride in her husband's achievements, but had very <lb/>
strong views as to the mission of women. Their <lb/>
large family was mostly born before the battle of <lb/>
Dettingen in 1743, which was destined to affect <lb/>
the after-life of all the family, and during these <lb/>
ten years Isaac Herschel was the acknowledged <lb/>
leader of the musical circle in Hanover.</p>
<p>The Hanoverian line having been established on <lb/>
the English throne, the Germans naturally joined <lb/>
with the English in fighting for Maria Theresa, <lb/>
<pb n="73" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0114"/>
who, as the only daughter of the Emperor Charles <lb/>
II., claimed the Austrian throne.</p>
<p>George II. in person conducted the advance of <lb/>
his 30,000 men, assisted by his son the Duke of <lb/>
Cumberland, but on the 27th of June 1743 they <lb/>
found themselves face to face with a French army <lb/>
of 60,000 under the Duc de Noailles, who were <lb/>
encamped on the opposite side of the river Maine.</p>
<p>Feeling the inadequacy of his numbers, the king <lb/>
thought it best to retreat, but the van of the French <lb/>
army outmarched him, and when he reached the <lb/>
village of Dettingen he saw that they were rapidly <lb/>
coming up on his flank. It was a clear case of <lb/>
"Hobson's choice," for a retreat would have been <lb/>
no less hazardous than an advance. Fortunately, <lb/>
however, a narrow pass lay between the opposing <lb/>
armies, down which the French, relying on their <lb/>
superior numbers, rushed with characteristic <reg orig="im-|petuosity">impetuosity</reg>. <lb/>
English stability now rose to the <lb/>
occasion, and with dogged bravery we, with the <lb/>
assistance of the Hanoverians, were able to <reg orig="with-|stand">withstand</reg> <lb/>
even the onset of such a vast force.</p>
<p>Up and down the lines rode George II., amid <lb/>
the roar of cannon and the snapping of musketry, <lb/>
encouraging and commanding, and by his own <reg orig="per-|sonal">personal</reg> <lb/>
valour inciting his army to fresh effort and <lb/>
redoubled resistance. The result was a decisive <lb/>
victory for the Allies, after a short but desperate <lb/>
fight. The loss of life was enormous, the French <lb/>
<pb n="74" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0115"/>
sacrificing 6000 men and the Allies about half that <lb/>
number. This signal victory&mdash;of which it is said <lb/>
that "the conduct of George deserves the highest <lb/>
praise; and it was undoubtedly through him, and <lb/>
through his son far more than through any of his <lb/>
generals, that the day was won"&mdash;is notable in the <lb/>
annals of our national history as being the last <lb/>
occasion on which a King of England exposed <reg orig="him-|self">himself</reg> <lb/>
under fire. Many a time since have royal <lb/>
personages distinguished themselves on the <reg orig="battle-|field">battlefield</reg>, <lb/>
but at present George II. enjoys the distinction <lb/>
of being the last English monarch who personally <lb/>
conducted a campaign.</p>
<p>So ended, from an historic point of view, the <lb/>
famous battle of Dettingen, but the result to the <lb/>
poor leader of the Guards Band, who was present <lb/>
throughout, was most disastrous. From the effects <lb/>
of lying all night in a wet furrow Isaac Herschel <lb/>
never recovered, and, though he kept his position <lb/>
in the army for seventeen years afterwards, he <lb/>
was never again as he had been, and suffered <reg orig="in-|cessantly">incessantly</reg> <lb/>
from acute rheumatism, which ultimately <lb/>
caused his death.</p>
<p>Shortly after Dettingen he was ordered to <reg orig="Eng-|land">England</reg> <lb/>
with the Regiment of the Guards, but his <lb/>
absence from Hanover was not of long duration, <lb/>
and there, two years later &lpar;1745&rpar;, Caroline was <lb/>
born.</p>
<p>In 1755 Lisbon was decimated by one of the <lb/>
<pb n="75" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0116"/>
most awful earthquakes that have ever convulsed <lb/>
the face of nature. Even as far north as Hanover <lb/>
the shock was severely felt, and it is not surprising <lb/>
that to the end of her life Caroline still remembered <lb/>
the look of utter helplessness and awe depicted on <lb/>
the faces of her father and mother as the ground <lb/>
quivered with horrible distinctness, and each one <lb/>
wondered what the next moment might bring. <lb/>
Thus far and no farther did the phenomenon go&mdash; <lb/>
then all again was still.</p>
<p>All the children, except the eldest daughter <lb/>
Sophia Elizabeth, very early exhibited distinct <lb/>
musical talent, but Caroline's gifts in that <reg orig="direc-|tion">direction</reg> <lb/>
were almost entirely neglected,&mdash;writing and <lb/>
reading being, in her mother's estimation, the only <lb/>
necessary accomplishments for a woman. During <lb/>
her father's lifetime he supplied her with occasional <lb/>
lessons on the violin, and to him may be traced <lb/>
the musical and scientific tastes which distinguished <lb/>
his children. When asthma and rheumatism finally <lb/>
necessitated his retirement from the army in 1760, <lb/>
it was his great delight to discuss musical and <lb/>
scientific matters with them; but after his death <lb/>
in 1762 Caroline was entirely relegated to the <lb/>
kitchen, and to the manifold duties which accrue <lb/>
to a servantless household.</p>
<p>But Caroline Herschel never thought of herself; <lb/>
she had a "royal instinct for serving others," and <lb/>
to be useful in the narrow sphere of a modest <reg orig="Ger-|man">German</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="76" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0117"/>
home was as much a religion to her as was <lb/>
afterwards the loving service which she devoted <lb/>
to her brother in England.</p>
<p>Entirely devoid of self-consciousness, with an <lb/>
hereditary spirit of discipline running in her veins, <lb/>
united with an instinctive love of self-sacrifice for <lb/>
the sake of duty, there is a nobility and a "divine <lb/>
enthusiasm" about Caroline Herschel which invests <lb/>
all her deeds with an enduring grandeur which she <lb/>
herself would have sincerely deprecated.</p>
<p>For many years the daily routine of cleaning and <lb/>
cooking and knitting went on, but at last the relief <lb/>
came, in the shape of a request that was almost a <lb/>
command, from her beloved brother William, that <lb/>
she should go back with him to England, where he <lb/>
had been promoted from Halifax parish church to <lb/>
the post of Organist to the Octagon Chapel at <lb/>
Bath, then recently consecrated.</p>
<p>Travelling in those days was a very dismal <reg orig="pro-|cess">process</reg>, <lb/>
and for six days and nights the "little lady," <lb/>
then aged twenty-seven, rumbled along in the old <lb/>
post-wagon from Hanover to Hellevoetsluis, and, <lb/>
after a disastrous sea passage, was literally tossed <lb/>
upon English shores at Harwich in August 1772.</p>
<p>But before leaving Hanover she busied her <lb/>
nimble fingers in behalf of the family at home, and <lb/>
made stockings enough for her mother and "little <lb/>
Dietrich" to last them for two years. This at an <lb/>
average computation of human wants would mean <lb/>
<pb n="77" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0118"/>
a work of considerable length and labour, and it <lb/>
is rather pathetic to read, in an earlier account, <lb/>
that the first stocking she made for the elder boy <lb/>
Alexander reached from the floor to her chin, so <lb/>
diminutive was her stature. Eighty years later <lb/>
she was known as the "little old lady." The <lb/>
wages of a servant to take her place were defrayed <lb/>
by William, to whom her loving devotion was now <lb/>
to be wholly dedicated. "Little Dietrich," as she <lb/>
called him, was of all her family the one least <lb/>
able to appreciate his sister, and the one next to <lb/>
William to whom, by a strange perversity, she <lb/>
gave most of the love with which her nature <lb/>
overflowed. Even when in Bath, the labours of <lb/>
her brother and herself were disturbed for several <lb/>
weeks by frantic tidings from Hanover that <reg orig="Diet-|rich">Dietrich</reg> <lb/>
and "another young idler" had run away from <lb/>
home. The strong family love which distinguished <lb/>
William induced him to forego his own pursuits <lb/>
and to start off immediately for London, where <lb/>
after much anxiety, in a disreputable corner of <lb/>
Wapping, he found the runaway, dangerously ill. <lb/>
He was thence brought to Bath and nursed back <lb/>
to health on roast apples and barley-water. On <lb/>
a later occasion &lpar;1809&rpar; he again gave them great <lb/>
trouble, and for four years the devoted sister had <lb/>
not a day free from secret anxiety on his account. <lb/>
Of this time her only remark is, full of pathetic <lb/>
self-distrust, "I hope that I have acquitted myself <lb/>
<pb n="78" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0119"/>
to everybody's satisfaction, for I have never <reg orig="neg-|lected">neglected</reg> <lb/>
my eldest brother's business; and the time <lb/>
I devoted to Dietrich was taken entirely from my <lb/>
sleep, or from what is generally allowed for meals, <lb/>
which were mostly taken running, or sometimes <lb/>
forgotten entirely."</p>
<p>At the time of her arrival in England &lpar;1772&rpar; she <lb/>
could only read and write, so we may well believe <lb/>
that it was with mingled delight and diffidence <lb/>
that she entered upon her new life at Bath. From <lb/>
being a maid-of-all-work in Hanover to being the <lb/>
coadjutor of a man like William Herschel was <lb/>
indeed a change which our imagination "boggles <lb/>
at"; and had she been a woman of less heroic <lb/>
mould, she might have given herself up to alternate <lb/>
moods of exaltation and despair, without our feeling <lb/>
any reasonable wonder.</p>
<p>But Caroline was made of true Teutonic stuff, <lb/>
and this was soon made manifest in her everyday <lb/>
life with the "Hanoverian fiddler" whose scientific <lb/>
discoveries and deductions subsequently electrified <lb/>
the whole civilised world. Seven years his junior, <lb/>
disliking publicity, and a "hausfrau" bred if not <lb/>
born, it is simply amazing to watch the loyalty <lb/>
and devotion with which she followed and smoothed <lb/>
every step of the path which her brother elected <lb/>
to pursue.</p>
<p>Strait was the gate and narrow was the way, <lb/>
but no stumbling-block was allowed to interfere, no <lb/>
<pb n="79" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0120"/>
difficulties discouraged. An innate spirit of <reg orig="obedi-|ence">obedience</reg> <lb/>
enabled her to perform what seem almost <lb/>
like miracles; and the young woman whose <reg orig="ac-|quirements">acquirements</reg> <lb/>
would now be sneered at by many a <lb/>
girl in her teens, was thereby made capable of <lb/>
carrying through schemes, both musical and <reg orig="scien-|tific">scientific</reg>, <lb/>
which at first sight must have seemed <reg orig="well-|nigh">wellnigh</reg> <lb/>
impossible, had such a word ever occurred to <lb/>
her in connection with any of her brother's desires <lb/>
or designs.</p>
<p>Housekeeping in England was a very different <lb/>
thing from housekeeping in Germany, even in 1772, <lb/>
and the frugal and simple-minded Caroline was <lb/>
often disturbed by what seemed to her the <reg orig="un-|warrantable">unwarrantable</reg> <lb/>
extravagance of an ordinary English <lb/>
household. Her account of the hot-tempered old <lb/>
Welshwoman who was her aide-de-camp in the <lb/>
kitchen is as pathetic as Mrs Carlyle's experiences <lb/>
of dishonest and incorrigible Betties; and no doubt <lb/>
she often thought, as did Mrs Carlyle, with a <lb/>
"chastened vanity," of the superiority of her own <lb/>
management. In her case the difficulties were at <lb/>
first increased by her partial ignorance of the <lb/>
English language, which, however, her musical ear <lb/>
soon enabled her to conquer, as regarded <reg orig="conversa-|tion">conversation</reg>, <lb/>
though never was she able to write and spell <lb/>
it correctly. However, as some one quaintly puts <lb/>
it, a woman who discovered eight comets may surely <lb/>
spell a word as she likes!</p>
<pb n="80" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0121"/>
<p>On Sundays she received her weekly <reg orig="housekeep-|ing">housekeeping</reg> <lb/>
money, accompanied in early days with due <lb/>
directions as to "debit" and "credit"; and, after <lb/>
six weeks in England, she was trusted to go <lb/>
marketing alone, though her brother Alexander <lb/>
generally hovered at no great distance, in case she <lb/>
should find any insuperable difficulty in making <lb/>
known her requirements.</p>
<p>William was now making a considerable income <lb/>
by concerts, compositions, teaching, and <reg orig="organ-|playing">organ-playing</reg>, <lb/>
and for a time her attention was <reg orig="princi-|pally">principally</reg> <lb/>
devoted to making herself of service to him <lb/>
in the musical world.</p>
<p>By diligent practising, she made herself equal to <lb/>
performing in oratorios and concerts with no <reg orig="incon-|siderable">inconsiderable</reg> <lb/>
success, the only stipulation which she <lb/>
ventured to make being that, <hi rend="italic">only</hi> when William <lb/>
was conducting should she be asked to do so. The <lb/>
marvellous activity of those first ten years may be <lb/>
guessed from the fact that William Herschel was <lb/>
giving from thirty-five to thirty-eight music lessons <lb/>
every week, and that during this time Caroline <lb/>
persevered in her novel duties&mdash;practising, <reg orig="perform-|ing">performing</reg>, <lb/>
and copying scores, just as directed by the <lb/>
beloved brother. She saw and heard nothing save <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">through him;</hi> but it is evident that, had <reg orig="self-|aggrandisement">self-aggrandisement</reg> <lb/>
been ever in her thoughts, she <lb/>
might have made for herself a permanent position <lb/>
in the musical world. For, incredible as it may <lb/>
<pb n="81" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0122"/>
appear, she was soon counted worthy, even by such <lb/>
stern critics as her own brothers, to take the part <lb/>
of leading treble in oratorios; and the fashionable <lb/>
leaders of Bath society were loud in their praises <lb/>
of her voice and manner. This admiration, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
was not reciprocated, and, in her blunt <lb/>
German fashion, she denounced the ordinary young <lb/>
ladies as "very little better than idiots."</p>
<p>But the poor little prima-donna housekeeper had <lb/>
by no means exhausted her duties when she <reg orig="re-|turned">returned</reg> <lb/>
weary and jaded from a long evening of <lb/>
responsibility and exertion in the crowded <reg orig="concert-|rooms">concert-rooms</reg> <lb/>
of Bristol or Bath. Music to William was <lb/>
but a means to an end, and that end was <reg orig="Astron-|omy">Astronomy</reg>. <lb/>
Unconscious of fatigue himself, he seems to <lb/>
have lost all count of time when bent upon solving <lb/>
some of the mighty mysteries of infinite space; and <lb/>
his sister's aid was found invaluable. He had <lb/>
tested his brothers, but had found them wanting; <lb/>
and her obedient zeal in helping forward all his <lb/>
schemes made him realise that here, at last, was <lb/>
one upon whose deftness, adaptability, and <reg orig="stren-|uous">strenuous</reg> <lb/>
help he could confidently depend. Night <lb/>
after night for eight years they worked together&mdash; <lb/>
calculating, measuring, mirror-grinding, examining, <lb/>
writing memoranda,&mdash;and not until daylight had <lb/>
chased away the stars did she allow herself to be <lb/>
tired.</p>
<p>Never was a man of science so favoured in his <lb/>
<pb n="82" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0123"/>
assistant. Alexander, though both musical and <lb/>
mechanical, had no perseverance; and, while his <lb/>
'cello solos were "divine," he lacked the steady <lb/>
fixedness of purpose which would have raised him <lb/>
to the first rank of public performers. It was <lb/>
Caroline, therefore, on whom William relied for <lb/>
help in the construction of tools, for grinding and <lb/>
polishing. "Logarithms made easy" is a book <lb/>
which has yet to be written; but with these also <lb/>
Caroline had to be conversant, as well as with <lb/>
mathematical problems of which her ready brain <lb/>
had to assimilate the working, while her tiny hands <lb/>
dispensed the frugal meals. Sometimes William <lb/>
used laughingly to make her forego part of her <lb/>
dinner if she could not describe the angle of the <lb/>
piece of pudding which she was cutting. She it <lb/>
was who fashioned the pasteboard model of the <lb/>
tube to hold the first large telescope, and her <lb/>
dexterous fingers and eager longing to be of <lb/>
service made her&mdash;as, with a touchingly proud <lb/>
modesty, she herself expresses it &mdash; "almost as <lb/>
useful as a boy."</p>
<p>At one stage of fashioning a reflector it is <reg orig="neces-|sary">necessary</reg> <lb/>
for the workman to remain for many hours with <lb/>
his hands on the mirror. On one occasion William <lb/>
never stirred for sixteen hours, his sister meanwhile <lb/>
feeding him and reading to him, ready at any <lb/>
minute to obey his slightest wish. At such times <lb/>
as these she read aloud the novels of Sterne and <lb/>
<pb n="83" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0124"/>
Fielding, and the gorgeous stories of 'The Arabian <lb/>
Nights'; but the fairy tales of science were all <lb/>
their own, and we can fancy that silence would <lb/>
often fall between them as they speculated upon <lb/>
the wonder - lands of the moon with its <reg orig="flame-|breathing">flame-breathing</reg> <lb/>
craters, the mazy labyrinths of the <lb/>
"Milky Way," or the faithful satellites of Saturn.</p>
<p>And she <hi rend="italic">never failed him</hi>. In all his work she <lb/>
was his veritable "alter ego." In winter nights, <lb/>
when the ink froze upon her pen, she still was by <lb/>
his side&mdash;in garden or in garret&mdash;helping him to <lb/>
do work which, without her, would have been <reg orig="well-|nigh">wellnigh</reg> <lb/>
impossible. As in music so in astronomy&mdash;her <lb/>
one idea was, "All I am, all I know, I owe to him. <lb/>
I did nothing for my brother but what a well-trained <lb/>
puppy-dog would have done: that is to say, I did <lb/>
what he commanded me. I was a mere tool, which <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">he had the trouble of sharpening</hi>." The italics are <lb/>
our own, and in them, between the lines, we can <lb/>
read the faint, underlying bitterness with which she <lb/>
looked back upon her neglected education. In a <lb/>
note to her nephew &lpar;afterwards Sir John Herschel&rpar; <lb/>
she says, "My only reason for saying so much of <lb/>
myself is to show with what miserable assistance <lb/>
your father made shift to obtaining the means of <lb/>
exploring the heavens." This was her own <reg orig="self-|estimate">self-estimate</reg>; <lb/>
ours is far different, and so we are <reg orig="con-|vinced">convinced</reg> <lb/>
was his also. He might have discovered <lb/>
scores of planets; but, had he not appreciated her <lb/>
<pb n="84" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0125"/>
skilful help, he would nevertheless have been a <reg orig="con-|temptible">contemptible</reg> <lb/>
cur.</p>
<p>For some years they lived at 7 New King Street, <lb/>
but for the sake of better accommodation they <reg orig="sub-|sequently">subsequently</reg> <lb/>
&lpar;in 1779&rpar; removed to No. 19, where, on <lb/>
the 13th of March 1781, a planet of the third <reg orig="mag-|nitude">magnitude</reg>, <lb/>
with a diameter of 35,000 miles, was <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg> <lb/>
by William Herschel. This vast planet <lb/>
was called by him Georgium Sidus&mdash;the Star of <lb/>
George&mdash;in honour of George II.; but the name of <lb/>
Uranus was subsequently given to it, as being more <lb/>
in harmony with those of the other planets. Not <lb/>
much imagination is needed to reproduce that <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg> <lb/>
occasion before our eyes.</p>
<p>It is evening, in the early spring; the sky is <lb/>
clear and all is quiet, save when at intervals the <lb/>
watchman can be heard chanting the hours. Only <lb/>
too quickly to the busy students do they pass, for <lb/>
when dawn breaks upon the world their self-imposed <lb/>
labours must be discontinued. The telescope has <lb/>
been fixed for the nightly "sweeping"&mdash;star by <lb/>
star is carefully examined&mdash;but a new object in the <lb/>
silver-spangled sky arrests his attention. Caroline, <lb/>
who is taking rapid notes beside him, is called <reg orig="hur-|riedly">hurriedly</reg> <lb/>
to the instrument, lest perchance he should <lb/>
have been deceived; and not until her quick eye <lb/>
and ready intelligence have ratified it, does he feel <lb/>
for the first time the thrill resulting from a great <reg orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg>. <lb/>
Never again can they have felt quite the <lb/>
<pb n="85" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0126"/>
same proud delight, for never again had they the <lb/>
same obstacles to overcome; and though the <reg orig="mar-|vellous">marvellous</reg> <lb/>
40-foot telescope subsequently enabled them <lb/>
to make many and valuable discoveries, it was not <lb/>
quite the same, we may be sure, to either of them as <lb/>
the home-made instruments which, almost unaided, <lb/>
this wonderful pair had constructed and set up in <lb/>
the little garden behind 19 King Street, Bath.</p>
<p>A hundred years ago Bath was a small provincial <lb/>
town. The population was a varying one&mdash;never <lb/>
numbering more than 31,000&mdash;and there was not <lb/>
a single optician in the place. Every lens and <lb/>
piece of mechanism had to be sent from London, <lb/>
thus increasing their difficulties enormously, as waste <lb/>
of time, trouble, and money were thereby entailed. <lb/>
In spite of the most careful frugality, they still <lb/>
found it impossible to give up the earnings derived <lb/>
from music.</p>
<p>The "heavenly maid" had helped them <reg orig="consist-|ently">consistently</reg> <lb/>
hitherto, but the time was nigh, even at the <lb/>
door, when organ and oboe should be put aside, and <lb/>
when science, the first love of William Herschel's <lb/>
life, should reign pre-eminent over the lives of both <lb/>
brother and sister. They made their last public <lb/>
appearance together, on the Whit-Sunday of 1782 <lb/>
at St Margaret's Chapel, Bath,&mdash;the anthem, in <lb/>
which Caroline sang, being composed and conducted <lb/>
by William himself.</p>
<p>Henceforward, astronomy was their only care and <lb/>
<pb n="86" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0127"/>
study; though, when her allotted threescore years <lb/>
and ten were long past, Caroline was constantly to <lb/>
be seen at the concerts in Hanover, and the "little <lb/>
old lady" was a familiar figure in the stalls of the <lb/>
opera-house.</p>
<p>It was in August 1782 that, through the <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg> <lb/>
of His Majesty, George II., the Herschels left <lb/>
Bath for Datchet, William having been created <lb/>
Astronomer-Royal, with a salary of &pound;200 per annum. <lb/>
It was a post that brought with it more honour than <lb/>
honoraria; but money with the Herschels had never <lb/>
been plentiful, and the deceitfulness of riches was <lb/>
to them an unknown danger. They cheerfully <reg orig="de-|termined">determined</reg> <lb/>
to live upon eggs and bacon, and set to <lb/>
work upon the construction of that wonderful <reg orig="40-|foot">40foot</reg> <lb/>
telescope which swept the heavens with such <lb/>
unthought-of results. Recognising her share in its <lb/>
construction with gratitude and astonishment, we <lb/>
see in it a monument of unremitting industry and <lb/>
endurance, such as dwarfs all other astronomical <lb/>
instruments into insignificance, and her woman's <lb/>
wit doubtless supplied suggestions as to ways and <lb/>
means, and expedients which would not have <reg orig="oc-|curred">occurred</reg> <lb/>
to the less practical mind of her brother. <lb/>
Hers is not a solitary instance of deliberate <reg orig="self-|effacement">self-effacement</reg>, <lb/>
but the world will never know how much <lb/>
more than the mere discovery of eight comets was <lb/>
due to the tireless energy and unselfish adaptability <lb/>
of Caroline Herschel. It is beautiful to think that <lb/>
<pb n="87" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0128"/>
she lived to enjoy the fruits of their joint labours, <lb/>
and to see her brother recognised as one of the most <lb/>
celebrated men of the day. The house at Datchet <lb/>
was in a state of great dilapidation, but at any <lb/>
rate it was large, and the stables and laundry <lb/>
were speedily glorified by them into workshops <lb/>
and observatories.</p>
<p>One winter's night, when the snow lay a foot <lb/>
deep upon the ground, they were examining stars <lb/>
outside the house. She was hurrying to a little <lb/>
distance from the telescope to make some special <lb/>
observation when she fell heavily upon an unseen <lb/>
butcher's hook, which penetrated deeply into her <lb/>
leg. "Make haste, Caroline," came his voice <lb/>
across the dark whiteness. "I can't William, <lb/>
I'm hooked," was the feeble answer; and when, <lb/>
with much difficulty, the bleeding limb was <reg orig="ex-|tricated">extricated</reg>, <lb/>
nearly two ounces of flesh had to be left <lb/>
behind. Even then her only thought was of him, <lb/>
and her only comfort amid the pain was that, as <lb/>
clouds were coming up rapidly, she had not <lb/>
materially hindered his night's work.</p>
<p>Such fortitude as this reminds us of the <reg orig="well-|known">well-known</reg> <lb/>
"carriage incident" of which Mrs Disraeli, <lb/>
to whom the great Prime Minister was so justly <lb/>
devoted, was the heroine. On an anxious House <lb/>
of Commons night in the early 'Fifties she drove <lb/>
down with him to Palace Yard. Her finger was <lb/>
caught and crushed in the door on entering the <lb/>
<pb n="88" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0129"/>
carriage; but she bore the agony unflinchingly for <lb/>
fear of disturbing his thoughts, and not until he <lb/>
had left her for the House of Commons was she <lb/>
released from her torture.</p>
<p>The Datchet landlady proved herself a failure, <lb/>
and Clay Hill, Windsor, their next abode, was <lb/>
insufferably damp, so that in April 1786 they <lb/>
again had to move themselves and their weighty <lb/>
belongings,&mdash;no slight consideration,&mdash;and at last <lb/>
got comfortably settled in Slough. The king now <lb/>
gave to William Herschel a further grant, in <lb/>
order to enable him to prosecute his scientific <lb/>
labours unhampered by pecuniary anxiety, and, as <lb/>
Astronomer - Royal, he was frequently summoned <lb/>
to London. Many of Caroline's observations were <lb/>
now made in solitude. Alone, in the cold star-lit <lb/>
nights, the sweeping of the heavens was not an <lb/>
unmixed pleasure, though the discovery of "the <lb/>
first lady's comet," which so much interested <lb/>
Fanny Burney, must have been a really <reg orig="delight-|ful">delightful</reg> <lb/>
experience. When she found herself invested <lb/>
with the dignity of a discoverer she surely must <lb/>
have realised, if only for the first time, that she <lb/>
was neither a tool nor a fool. In reply to her <lb/>
modest announcement, we find the famous scientist <lb/>
Alexander Aubert writing&mdash;</p>
<p>"You have immortalised your name, and you <lb/>
deserve such a reward from the Being who has <lb/>
ordered all these things to move as we find them, <lb/>
<pb n="89" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0130"/>
for your assiduity in the business of Astronomy, <lb/>
and for your love for so celebrated and so deserving <lb/>
a brother."</p>
<p>A salary of &pound;50 per annum was now granted <lb/>
her as "assistant" to the Astronomer-Royal, and <lb/>
in 1787 she received "the first money that ever <lb/>
in all my life I thought I could spend as I <lb/>
liked."</p>
<p>We find from another entry in her Diary that <lb/>
she had been accustomed to put down her little <lb/>
personal expenses in her brother's account-book as <lb/>
"for Car."; but that, since leaving Bath, they had <lb/>
never exceeded &pound;8 per annum. Such a statement <lb/>
is too touching in its simple honesty to need <lb/>
comment; but in these days, when the papers <lb/>
think it worth while to discuss the question as <lb/>
to whether &pound;100 per annum is a niggardly dress <lb/>
allowance, we can but admire, and wonder, and <lb/>
adore!</p>
<p>It was to Slough that there came one day the <lb/>
Princesse de Lamballe and her suite to see <hi rend="italic">the</hi> <lb/>
telescope, and to make the acquaintance of the <lb/>
astronomers. Little did any of the party think <lb/>
what a few weeks would bring to that dainty <lb/>
and beautiful lady. In Carlyle's matchless history <lb/>
the last scene of her life is thus described:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Princesse de Lamballe has laid down on bed.</p>
<p>"'Madame, you are to be removed to the <lb/>
Abbaye.'</p>
<pb n="90" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0131"/>
<p>"'I do not wish to remove; I am well enough <lb/>
here.'</p>
<p>"There is a need-be for removing. She will <lb/>
arrange her dress a little then. Rude voices <lb/>
answer, 'You have not got far to go.' She too <lb/>
is led to the hell-gate&mdash;a manifest Queen's Friend. <lb/>
She shivers back at the sight of bloody sabres; <lb/>
but there is no return! Onwards! That fair <lb/>
hind head is cleft with the axe, the neck is <lb/>
severed. That fair body is cut in fragments, with <lb/>
indignities and obscene horrors of moustachio <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">grands l&egrave;vres</hi> which human nature would fain <lb/>
find incredible,&mdash;which shall be read in the original <lb/>
language only. She was beautiful, she was good, <lb/>
she had known no happiness. Young hearts, <lb/>
generation after generation, will think with <reg orig="them-|selves">themselves</reg>, <lb/>
'O worthy of worship, thou king-descended, <lb/>
God-descended, and poor sister woman! Why was <lb/>
not I there, and some Sword Balmung or Thor's <lb/>
Hammer in my hand?' Her head is fixed on a <lb/>
pike, paraded under the windows of the Temple, <lb/>
that a still more hated, a Marie Antoinette, may <lb/>
see."</p>
<p>Luridly realistic as this description reads in <lb/>
1906, the effect of the news upon the household <lb/>
at Slough in 1792 must have been startlingly <lb/>
intensified by the so recent visit of the unfortunate <lb/>
victim&mdash;one bit of special personal interest and <lb/>
regret in the tragedies of great seething Paris, <lb/>
<pb n="91" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0132"/>
which had its army of martyrs in the Revolution <lb/>
as surely as had, and has, and will have, the <lb/>
Church militant here on earth.</p>
<p>Another aristocratic visitor who may be <reg orig="men-|tioned">mentioned</reg> <lb/>
was the Prince of Orange, who, not finding <lb/>
any one at home, left a quaint note to inquire <lb/>
whether it were true that Mr Herschel had <reg orig="dis-|covered">discovered</reg> <lb/>
a new star whose light was not as that <lb/>
of common stars, but with swallow-tails! The <lb/>
reply may be guessed, as also the amusement <lb/>
caused in the scientific <hi rend="italic">m&eacute;nage</hi> by the ingenuous <lb/>
inquiry.</p>
<p>But the happy days of <hi rend="italic">solitude &acirc; deux,</hi> as the <lb/>
French prettily call it, were now drawing to a <lb/>
close, and it was another woman's hand that was <lb/>
destined for many a long day to darken the <lb/>
happiness of the devoted little sister.</p>
<p>On the 8th of May 1788 William Herschel <lb/>
married Mary, only child of James Baldwin, and <lb/>
widow of Mr John Pitt.</p>
<p>For sixteen years Caroline had devoted herself <lb/>
to him with an identity of interest and a supreme <lb/>
self-sacrifice, unique even among the histories of <lb/>
unselfish women; and we can almost see the <reg orig="tear-|dimmed">tear-dimmed</reg> <lb/>
eyes and quivering fingers with which <lb/>
she made the last entry in her Journal of that <lb/>
year, "I gave up my place as housekeeper."</p>
<p>We cannot doubt that expostulations ensued, <lb/>
and that propositions were made that she should <lb/>
<pb n="92" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0133"/>
continue to live at Collingwood; but she was no <lb/>
longer <hi rend="italic">needed,</hi>&mdash;there lay the sting. Through evil <lb/>
report and good report she had never thought but <lb/>
of him, and now another was to enter into her <lb/>
kingdom. That the bride was gentle and amiable, <lb/>
and that she brought with her a jointure which <lb/>
enabled her husband to experiment still more <reg orig="un-|fetteredly">unfetteredly</reg>, <lb/>
did not make the blow any less hard <lb/>
for Caroline to bear; and, in the destruction of all <lb/>
her personal papers from 1788 to 1798, we can <lb/>
see plainly that she thought it best to destroy <lb/>
what in the very anguish of her soul she had <lb/>
written. In after years she learned to love and <lb/>
esteem her sister-in-law, for her own sake as well <lb/>
as for the sake of him whom both loved so dearly.</p>
<p>As we read of the lonely vigils of Caroline <lb/>
Herschel in the poor cottage of Spratt, the <reg orig="work-|man">workman</reg>, <lb/>
and the unwritten story of her aching heart, <lb/>
we think irresistibly of Mrs Carlyle and her less <lb/>
reasonable, but somewhat similar, sorrow. As Mrs <lb/>
Ireland touchingly says, "She had clung to her <lb/>
husband through long weary years of obscurity and <lb/>
struggle, having given lavishly of her own health <lb/>
and strength to make his path smooth for him, and <lb/>
now she began to feel as if, after all, it were not she <lb/>
who reaped the golden harvest of his rapidly-<reg orig="grow-|ing">growing</reg> <lb/>
success, but this other lady, whom she could not <lb/>
feel to be her intellectual superior, and who knew <lb/>
none of the dark, terrible, sunless hours spent in <lb/>
<pb n="93" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0134"/>
the Chelsea home. Poverty had been hard, <reg orig="loneli-|ness">loneliness</reg> <lb/>
had been hard; but these she could bear&mdash;the <lb/>
other she could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> bear."</p>
<p>"Get up and work," said Mazzini to Mrs Carlyle, <lb/>
in answer to her letter on the subject; but this she <lb/>
was unable to do with any real buoyancy of <lb/>
interest, while to Caroline Herschel these sad years <lb/>
were some of the busiest in her busy life. In hard <lb/>
work she tried to live down the soreness&mdash;natural, <lb/>
but which she felt to be unworthy&mdash;caused by her <lb/>
brother's marriage, and <hi rend="italic">succeeded</hi>.</p>
<p>But Caroline had a more sunny nature than had <lb/>
the noble but passionate Jane Welsh Carlyle, and <lb/>
the masculine elements in both tragedies were <lb/>
totally different, so that it does not do to follow <lb/>
the analogy too closely, for the differences are <lb/>
as striking as the similarities. Both women lived <lb/>
down their sorrow, though the scars of it were <lb/>
never effaced; but one rose triumphantly above it, <lb/>
while the other only "crushed down her own <reg orig="dis-|satisfaction">dissatisfaction</reg>" <lb/>
with a stoicism that was quite foreign, <lb/>
and proportionately painful, to her proud and <lb/>
independent spirit.</p>
<p>"I gave up my place as housekeeper"&mdash;the <lb/>
sorrowful undertone is in every word of the brief <lb/>
entry&mdash;but she reserved to herself the right of <lb/>
access at all times to the roof of her brother's <lb/>
house, the observatory, and the workroom. Hither <lb/>
she came daily, returning for her meals to the <lb/>
<pb n="94" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0135"/>
Spratt <hi rend="italic">m&eacute;nage.</hi> When the family were away she <lb/>
used to go and stay in the house, looking after the <lb/>
interests of him whom she loved so well; but there <lb/>
is a profound melancholy in an entry in her Journal <lb/>
made on one of these occasions, "All came home; <lb/>
and I went to my solitude again."</p>
<p>Her "Book of work done" shows no decrease <lb/>
of mental or physical activity, but the contrast <lb/>
between her own small lodging and the happy <lb/>
home-life so near, from which, rightly or wrongly, <lb/>
she felt herself debarred, must often have been very <lb/>
bitter. Within a stone's-throw was all that she <lb/>
most cared for, brother and nephew&mdash;the little John <lb/>
Herschel, born in 1792, who in after years inherited <lb/>
the love which she had lavished upon his father, <lb/>
and the genius which enabled him to sweep the <lb/>
southern hemisphere, from his observatory at <reg orig="Feld-|hausen">Feldhausen</reg>, <lb/>
with the same earnest assiduity which had <lb/>
characterised his father and his aunt in their <lb/>
northern surveys.</p>
<p>Of this South African Expedition she exclaimed <lb/>
in her vigorous Anglo-German, "Ja, if I was thirty <lb/>
or forty years younger and could go too! In Gottes <lb/>
Namen!"</p>
<p>"Bills and receipts for my Comets" is the quaint <lb/>
way in which she docketed her memoranda relative <lb/>
to these erratic phenomena, for five of which, at <lb/>
least, she could claim undisputed priority of <reg orig="dis-|covery">discovery</reg>. <lb/>
The most laborious of her undertakings, <lb/>
<pb n="95" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0136"/>
however, was a catalogue of all the star-clusters <lb/>
and nebul&aelig; observed by her brother, and it was for <lb/>
this that the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical <lb/>
Society was voted to her in 1828, followed by the <lb/>
extraordinary distinction of an honorary <reg orig="member-|ship">membership</reg>. <lb/>
This catalogue was the outcome of many <lb/>
years of labour, but it was a labour of love, as being <lb/>
the corner-stone in the temple of his fame.</p>
<p>Her nephew's career was a source of infinite <lb/>
interest to her, and, in 1813, when he obtained the <lb/>
Senior Wranglership, her pride in his success may <lb/>
be imagined.</p>
<p>The Royal Family showed much attention to the <lb/>
clever Herschels, and there are several entries in <lb/>
her Diary as to days at Frogmore and dinners with <lb/>
the Queen.</p>
<p>She was under some anxiety at this time as to <lb/>
her eyes, but the oculist having reassured her, she <lb/>
continued her work with unabated interest. Her <lb/>
constitution must have been extraordinarily good, <lb/>
for though the strain upon it for many years must <lb/>
have been excessive, she never spent a day in bed <lb/>
from 1761 to 1821. She is but another <reg orig="illustra-|tion">illustration</reg> <lb/>
of the truth of Bacon's aphorism&mdash;"One of the <lb/>
rewards of philosophy is long life." That her <lb/>
brother should die before her does not seem to have <lb/>
entered into her calculations, and, with a view to <lb/>
her death, she made all arrangements for <reg orig="simplify-|ing">simplifying</reg> <lb/>
matters for her survivors; but the love of living <lb/>
<pb n="96" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0137"/>
was still strong in Caroline when, in 1822, the tie <lb/>
of more than fifty years was for ever broken, and <lb/>
William Herschel, full of age, wisdom and honour, <lb/>
saw the sun set for the last time on earth, and woke <lb/>
to find himself beyond the stars. It was when <lb/>
stupefied with grief that Caroline took the fatal <lb/>
step of making over herself and all her little capital <lb/>
to the care of Dietrich. What was at the root of <lb/>
her action we can only guess. Possibly she had <lb/>
some sort of craving to take up once more a place <lb/>
in the home of her childhood, and hoped to bury <lb/>
her sorrow in associations that would be both old <lb/>
and new.</p>
<p>"Distance lends enchantment," and she forgot <lb/>
that she had been steadily moving and progressing, <lb/>
while Hanover had been comparatively standing <lb/>
still. At seventy-two the "knitting up" of old <lb/>
friendships was an impossibility, and there was <lb/>
nothing to compensate for, nothing to reconcile her <lb/>
to, the dull commonplaceness of the life to which <lb/>
she had condemned herself.</p>
<p>"A few books and my sweeper" is the <reg orig="pathetic-|ally">pathetically</reg> <lb/>
brief inventory of her possessions at this time; <lb/>
and her only capital, &pound;500&mdash;the savings of fifty <lb/>
years of toil&mdash;she transferred to Dietrich, thus <lb/>
giving herself no possibility of retracting her <lb/>
determination of leaving England for ever and <lb/>
settling in Hanover with him. Little did she <lb/>
expect that twenty-five years more of life would <lb/>
<pb n="97" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0138"/>
be given her, in which to chafe against the narrow <lb/>
interests of that small German town. After the <lb/>
width and wisdom which she had enjoyed in <lb/>
"happy England" the monotonous flatness of her <lb/>
life was almost unbearable. Her nephew's advice <lb/>
had been all against her going, and deeply did she <lb/>
regret her hasty action, as the long years passed <lb/>
uneventfully by. But she had "burned her boats," <lb/>
and retreat was impossible. Dietrich, who knew <lb/>
his own inferiority, despised the sister whose <reg orig="per-|spicacity">perspicacity</reg> <lb/>
had not been equal to seeing it also. She <lb/>
made up her mind to endure, thinking that she <lb/>
must soon die; but Death&mdash;who claims so many <lb/>
unwilling followers&mdash;seemed to have forgotten her, <lb/>
and home-sick, lonely, and sad, she rusted there for <lb/>
another quarter of a century. Her books and <reg orig="tele-|scope">telescope</reg> <lb/>
she sent back to England shortly after her <lb/>
arrival in Hanover, as she soon had reason to fear <lb/>
that Dietrich's extravagant habits might induce <lb/>
him to sell them after her death. She found it <lb/>
very difficult even to remain mistress of her own <lb/>
actions and opinions,&mdash;and this must have been <lb/>
especially galling to one who, for so many years, <lb/>
had been in constant sympathy and fellowship with <lb/>
such men as William and John Herschel, of whom <lb/>
it might have been said, literally, that their <reg orig="con-|versation">conversation</reg> <lb/>
was in the heavens.</p>
<p>Till 1827 she lived with, and nursed, this <reg orig="frac-|tious">fractious</reg> <lb/>
and ill-conditioned mortal&mdash;of whom she says, <lb/>
<pb n="98" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0139"/>
"I hardly ever knew a man of his age labouring <lb/>
under more infirmities, nor bearing them with less <lb/>
patience." Then her patience and his impatience <lb/>
alike ended, and he went to his own place.</p>
<p>That Caroline Herschel was merry as well as <lb/>
wise, we have ample proofs in her quaint <reg orig="observa-|tions">observations</reg> <lb/>
upon men and things.</p>
<p>After Dietrich's death she removed to 376 <lb/>
Braunschweiger Strasse, where, with her <reg orig="confi-|dential">confidential</reg> <lb/>
servant Betty, she lived for fifteen years <lb/>
in an eventide that had in it some faint after-glow <lb/>
of the days that were gone.</p>
<p>The sparseness of her belongings seems to have <lb/>
been a source of amusement to her rather than <lb/>
of chagrin, as witness the following items in her <lb/>
household inventory:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Plate. Ha! ha! ha! ha!</p>
<p>"Requisites for self and servant, mostly bought <lb/>
at fairs.</p>
<p>"Cane-bottomed chairs, each valued at <reg orig="eighteen-|pence">eighteen-pence</reg>" <lb/>
&lpar;of which she says proudly, "after seven <lb/>
years' use, <hi rend="italic">like new</hi>"&rpar;.</p>
<p>"About fifty books, and a few tea-things."</p>
<p>Little tea-parties would seem sometimes to have <lb/>
ensnared her in their giddy vortex, for we observe <lb/>
that she had twelve tea - spoons; but pudding, <lb/>
vegetables, and salt must have been "unconsidered <lb/>
trifles," for each of which she had but one spoon.</p>
<p>On her nephew's forty-first birthday, she being <lb/>
<pb n="99" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0140"/>
then eighty - eight, she and Betty jingled their <lb/>
glasses together, and the old astronomer and the <lb/>
faithful Abigail together cried in quaint German <lb/>
custom, "Es lebe Sir John! Hoch!"</p>
<p>At this age, in one of her merry moods, she put <lb/>
her foot behind her back, and scratched her ear <lb/>
with it! This astounding acrobatic feat beats the <lb/>
record as far as we are aware! But apparently it <lb/>
created no great surprise, for Sir John Herschel <lb/>
says of her only a year or two earlier, "In the <lb/>
morning she is dull and weary, but as the day <lb/>
advances she gains life, and is quite fresh and <lb/>
funny at 10 P.M., and sings hymns, nay, even <lb/>
dances, to the great delight of all who see her."</p>
<p>This is really most discouraging to female <reg orig="scien-|tists">scientists</reg>. <lb/>
Glycero - phosphate of sodium may have <lb/>
splendid rejuvenating properties, but, so far, <lb/>
nothing short of discovering eight comets has <lb/>
enabled an octogenarian to scratch her ear with <lb/>
her foot!</p>
<p>It is evident that the not unnatural and not <lb/>
wholly unworthy pride which the rest of his family <lb/>
took in Sir William Herschel, Astronomer - Royal <lb/>
to his Majesty George II., was very repugnant to <lb/>
her, because it was a <hi rend="italic">selfish</hi> pride, and partook in <lb/>
no sense of the reverent and loving identification <lb/>
with his life and work which she herself had <lb/>
always felt.</p>
<p>Her sister's husband&mdash;Griesbach&mdash;had never <lb/>
<pb n="100" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0141"/>
been more than a "poor musician" in every sense <lb/>
of the word, and that his children should aspire to <lb/>
the honour of military and naval distinctions, <hi rend="italic">solely</hi> <lb/>
through the reflected interest which they possessed <lb/>
through their uncle and aunt, seems to have ruffled <lb/>
her considerably. She says plainly, "The lot of <lb/>
the children of a poor musician, and descendants of <lb/>
a menial servant, is not to look too high but to <lb/>
trust to their own good behaviour, and serving <lb/>
faithfully those who can employ them."</p>
<p>Herein speaks a very royalty of pride,&mdash;the <lb/>
nobility of Work has its <hi rend="italic">cachet</hi> put upon it, by <lb/>
one of the best - worked women of this or any <lb/>
other age.</p>
<p>In 1796, only a few months before her death, <lb/>
Alexander von Humboldt conveyed to her the <lb/>
Science Gold Medal. It was a tardy recognition <lb/>
from the King of Prussia, but we can fancy that <lb/>
it gave enormous pleasure both to the envoy and <lb/>
the recipient, for Humboldt and Brewster were <lb/>
not the least admiring of her many admirers.</p>
<p>Within four days of her death, in reply to <lb/>
General Halkett's message that he hoped soon <lb/>
to come and give her a kiss, as he had done on <lb/>
her ninety-seventh birthday, the dear old lady <lb/>
looked up quite saucily and said, "Tell the <lb/>
General that I have not tasted anything since <lb/>
that I liked so well."</p>
<p>Her characteristic fortitude never forsook her, <lb/>
<pb n="101" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0142"/>
but at last she "fell asleep," and on the 9th of <lb/>
January 1848 she joined her brother in that land <lb/>
where no sun, no moon appeareth, where no <lb/>
shadow ever falls.</p>
<p>In the old garrison church where she had been <lb/>
baptised ninety-seven years before, the burial <reg orig="ser-|vice">service</reg> <lb/>
was read over the body of Caroline Lucretia <lb/>
Herschel. Garlands of laurel and cypress covered <lb/>
the coffin, and within it, at her express desire, were <lb/>
buried with her a lock of her brother William's <lb/>
hair, and an old almanac which had belonged to <lb/>
her father.</p>
<q>"Earth had attained to heaven, there was no more near nor far.</q>
<q>On the earth the broken arcs; in the heaven, a perfect round."</q>

era, in a far village in the north of Yorkshire, <lb/>
Dorothy Wyndlow Pattison was born.</p>
<p>Times have changed since then,&mdash;railways and <lb/>
penny postage, steamships and bicycles, have <lb/>
brought English people very much nearer together <lb/>
than was possible in those days; but the little <lb/>
village of Hauxwell is almost as unknown now <lb/>
as it was then, except for the interest attaching <lb/>
to it as the birthplace of Sister Dora. And even <lb/>
that fact is comparatively little known, as <reg orig="com-|pared">compared</reg> <lb/>
with the world - wide notoriety of Walsall, <lb/>
where she lived and laboured and died. Life in <lb/>
the 'Thirties was a very different thing even in a <lb/>
country rectory, and the delicate child had largely <lb/>
to make amusements for herself, as she was not <lb/>
strong enough to enter fully into the frolics of <lb/>
her brothers and sisters. There were no less than <lb/>
twelve little Pattisons&mdash;two boys and ten girls,&mdash; <lb/>
and of these Dorothy was the youngest but one. <lb/>
<pb n="106" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0149"/>
A bright and happy party they were, full of <lb/>
energy and fun, and all devoted to the youngest <lb/>
girl, whose frequent illnesses seemed but to endear <lb/>
her to the sturdier members of the family.</p>
<p>In spite of much petting, little Dorothy was <lb/>
never spoiled, for she was innately unselfish and <lb/>
grateful, and her judicious parents early instilled <lb/>
habits of strict obedience and self-discipline, which <lb/>
were of incalculable value to her in later life.</p>
<p>Very early, however, she exhibited much force <lb/>
of character and a determination to obtain, in <lb/>
some way or other, whatever she had set her <lb/>
mind upon. This characteristic is apparent all <lb/>
through her life, but fortunately it was tempered <lb/>
in most cases by an equally characteristic justice <lb/>
and common - sense, so that even those who at <lb/>
first most resented her "domineering ways" <reg orig="grad-|ually">gradually</reg> <lb/>
came round to her view, and surrendered <lb/>
gracefully to what seemed as inevitable as the <lb/>
income-tax.</p>
<p>Possibly, too, her fascinating personality had <lb/>
a good deal to do with the power that she <reg orig="al-|most">almost</reg> <lb/>
unconsciously wielded over all with whom <lb/>
she came in contact, for the crisp curly hair, <lb/>
twinkling brown eyes, beautiful teeth, and dainty <lb/>
colouring must have made her very fair to look <lb/>
upon, apart from the charm of manner and <reg orig="un-|usual">unusual</reg> <lb/>
mental qualities which made her almost <lb/>
irresistible when she meant to be so.</p>
<pb n="107" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0150"/>
<p>The loving care which had been lavished upon <lb/>
her in childhood brought her safely through attacks <lb/>
of illness which were serious and prolonged, and <lb/>
at twenty years of age few more beautiful or <lb/>
more healthy girls could have been found. For <lb/>
nine years more she apparently sat at ease in the <lb/>
quiet country home, but all the time she was <reg orig="in-|wardly">inwardly</reg> <lb/>
chafing at the monotonous comfort of her <lb/>
daily life. To spend and be spent for others was <lb/>
second nature to her, and in the restricted life of <lb/>
a lonely village there was no sufficient outlet for <lb/>
her active mind and energetic body. Riding and <lb/>
driving were delightful, as amusements, and the <lb/>
poor people of the parish were a great source of <lb/>
interest to all the sisters; but even the greatest <lb/>
pleasures pall when they are matters of routine, <lb/>
and to a restless spirit they gradually become <reg orig="in-|sufferable">insufferable</reg>, <lb/>
as still "the days go on."</p>
<p>We had mentally bracketed Sister Dora with <lb/>
Saint Theresa long before the publication of <reg orig="Baring-|Gould's">Baring-Gould's</reg> <lb/>
delightful book, 'Virgin Saints and Martyrs,' <lb/>
and probably they will often be thought of together. <lb/>
The same dominating will and cheerful obstinacy <lb/>
characterised each, but, luckily for Walsall, Sister <lb/>
Dora had not the iron rules of the Roman <reg orig="com-|munion">communion</reg> <lb/>
to retard her errands of mercy or her <lb/>
schemes of charity. It may well be that her <lb/>
father, who was a Low Churchman of the old <lb/>
school, yet knew enough of the 'Lives of the <lb/>
<pb n="108" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0151"/>
Saints' to feel some alarm lest his "Sunshine" <lb/>
should gradually merge her winning individuality <lb/>
in the hard - and - fast uniformity and the mild <lb/>
terrorisms of a Sisterhood. It was a needless <lb/>
fear, for Dorothy Pattison was too practical a <lb/>
Christian ever to have taken any vows which <lb/>
would permanently have hampered her free will; <lb/>
but after her mother's death, in 1861, the quiet <lb/>
respectability of Hauxwell, with its population of <lb/>
two or three hundred people, became almost <reg orig="un-|bearable">unbearable</reg>, <lb/>
and, in spite of all that her father could <lb/>
say, she compromised matters for the time being <lb/>
by taking charge of the village school at Little <lb/>
Woolston, in Buckinghamshire.</p>
<p>One wonders at this point whether his ideas of <lb/>
parental guardianship and filial duty were not <lb/>
rather overstrained.</p>
<p>In the twentieth century it is such an <reg orig="every-|day">every-day</reg> <lb/>
occurrence for the girls of a family to earn <lb/>
their own living when they are hardly out of <lb/>
their teens, that Mr Pattison's objections seem <lb/>
groundless and almost unreasonable, especially <lb/>
when we remember that she was now <reg orig="twenty-|nine">twenty-nine</reg> <lb/>
years of age, and had no special home <lb/>
duties to need fulfilment by her. Be that as it <lb/>
may, it is pretty certain that affection for his <lb/>
winsome daughter was at the bottom of his <reg orig="op-|position">opposition</reg>; <lb/>
and on her deathbed, when speaking of <lb/>
this time, she said most earnestly, "I was very <lb/>
<pb n="109" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0152"/>
wilful, I did very wrong; let no one take me for <lb/>
an example."</p>
<p>Duty is one of the hardest things in the world <lb/>
to define, but to do that which "lay nearest" <lb/>
seemed to her, who had a positive distaste for an <lb/>
easy everyday life, too luxurious a course to be <lb/>
justifiable when there was within her the <reg orig="insati-|able">insatiable</reg> <lb/>
longing to be up and doing. In America <lb/>
the first thing asked of any one professing <reg orig="conver-|sion">conversion</reg> <lb/>
is, "And now what are you going to <hi rend="italic">do?"</hi> but <lb/>
there is a hymn, the authorship of which is <reg orig="un-|known">unknown</reg> <lb/>
to us, which has in it a verse beginning&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Cast thy deadly doing down&mdash;</l>
<l rend="indent">Down at Jesus' feet."</l>
</lg></q>
Such a sentiment is surely strangely subversive <lb/>
of all Biblical teaching, which insists with almost <lb/>
ceaseless reiteration upon the faithful stewardship <lb/>
of such gifts as the great Giver of all has bestowed. <lb/>
Love and Service generally go together, and as St <lb/>
James has it, "Faith without works is dead"; and <lb/>
again, with a sort of veiled satire, "Show me thy <lb/>
faith without thy works, and I will show thee my <lb/>
faith by my works."</p>
<p>Granted that it is often easier to do than to <lb/>
suffer, there is still human nature to be taken <lb/>
into account. There are times when it is almost <lb/>
a matter of self-preservation to use those energies <lb/>
which would otherwise atrophy and dwindle, for, <lb/>
<pb n="110" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0153"/>
as Drummond says, "If the stimulus to the <reg orig="exer-|cise">exercise</reg> <lb/>
of all the innumerable faculties concerned in <lb/>
nutrition be withdrawn, by the conditions and <lb/>
circumstances of life becoming, or being made to <lb/>
become, too easy, there is first an arrest of <lb/>
development and finally a loss of the parts <lb/>
themselves."</p>
<p>Anyhow, in the autumn of 1861, she left the <lb/>
sheltered boredom of Hauxwell for the independent, <lb/>
arduous, and useful life of a village schoolmistress. <lb/>
Her love of children made teaching a real pleasure, <lb/>
and she very quickly made her influence felt among <lb/>
the pupils and their parents. Her early training <lb/>
as a country parson's daughter now proved very <lb/>
useful, and her natural love for the poor and needy <lb/>
made her visits a delight to those who received <lb/>
them. There was no air of patronage about her,&mdash; <lb/>
spontaneous goodwill to all, made her sympathy a <lb/>
very real thing; and although the small salary <reg orig="at-|taching">attaching</reg> <lb/>
to her position, and the same allowance <lb/>
from her father which had been given to her when <lb/>
at home, must have made extensive or promiscuous <lb/>
charity impossible, she was soon recognised as a <lb/>
"real lady," whose help and interest could be <reg orig="re-|lied">relied</reg> <lb/>
upon in all times of anxiety or trouble. The <lb/>
loneliness inevitable to her life was less felt than <lb/>
would superficially appear, by reason of her <reg orig="in-|dependence">independence</reg>. <lb/>
Her time was her own, or rather <lb/>
she had no ties within the four walls of her tiny <lb/>
<pb n="111" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0154"/>
cottage which rendered her accountable to any one <lb/>
else for the arrangement of her leisure hours. Her <lb/>
meals probably were very sketchy affairs, and she <lb/>
soon learned how much she could do without. It <lb/>
was not so hard for her as it would have been to <lb/>
some people, and she never speaks of any <reg orig="back-|ward">backward</reg> <lb/>
looking. Faithfully did she fulfil her <reg orig="self-|imposed">self-imposed</reg> <lb/>
labours, and when, at the end of three <lb/>
years, she left Little Woolston, she left behind <lb/>
her a record of untiring service and carried with <lb/>
her many happy and abiding memories.</p>
<p>A severe attack of pleurisy, arising from a <lb/>
neglected cold, ended in her being sent to Redcar <lb/>
to recover, and the old longing for the discipline <lb/>
of a Sisterhood reasserted itself so strongly, that <lb/>
on her recovery she resolved to attach herself to <lb/>
the "Good Samaritans," who had a community at <lb/>
that place. Her early experiences here were <reg orig="suffi-|ciently">sufficiently</reg> <lb/>
arduous and distasteful to have quenched <lb/>
all enthusiasm in any one less in earnest than was <lb/>
Sister Dora, for her manual duties were heavier than <lb/>
she had expected, and her will had to be submitted <lb/>
entirely to that of the Mother Superior. Her first <lb/>
efforts at real nursing were made at a Cottage <lb/>
Hospital near Middlesborough, soon interrupted, <lb/>
however, by an attack of scarlet fever. She was, <lb/>
indeed, specially subject to infection of all sorts, <lb/>
and said of herself, "I always catch everything <lb/>
that's going."</p>
<pb n="112" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0155"/>
<p>It was in June 1863 that she was sent to Walsall, <lb/>
which was henceforward to be her headquarters, <lb/>
though she little knew what the years had in store <lb/>
for her there. At first she only went to fill the <lb/>
place of another Sister who had fallen ill from <lb/>
overwork in the accident hospital, but her own <lb/>
labours were again arrested by smallpox caught <lb/>
from one of the out-patients. From this, however, <lb/>
she safely recovered, and once more was established <lb/>
in her position as nurse&mdash;sometimes alone, <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
with the assistance of other members of the <lb/>
"Good Samaritan" community.</p>
<p>Early in 1865 she was recalled to Redcar to <lb/>
act as nurse to an insane old lady who was one <lb/>
of Sir James Simpson's patients, but in <reg orig="Novem-|ber">November</reg> <lb/>
of the same year she was again sent to <lb/>
Walsall.</p>
<p>At first she only occupied a subordinate position, <lb/>
but when those in authority saw her capacity for <lb/>
work, and her determination to achieve success as <lb/>
a nurse, they in their turn helped her to develop <lb/>
that genius for surgery which she undoubtedly <lb/>
possessed.</p>
<p>The in-patients at Walsall Hospital were mostly <lb/>
of the male sex, and her influence with them was <lb/>
wonderful. She had also the knack of inspiring <lb/>
confidence, and the poor, half-civilised, mutilated <lb/>
sufferers who were brought in from the coal <reg orig="dis-|tricts">districts</reg> <lb/>
were charmed into patience by her skilful <lb/>
<pb n="113" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0156"/>
handling and cheery sympathy. Of experience she <lb/>
soon had plenty, and at last she was thoroughly <lb/>
happy; having found work&mdash;real and absorbing&mdash; <lb/>
for which all her life she had longed.</p>
<p>Before leaving Redcar she was strongly urged to <lb/>
marry, but, though of a very affectionate nature, <lb/>
she felt that her love for the gentleman in question <lb/>
was not sufficiently real to draw away her heart <lb/>
from the plan of action which she had mapped out <lb/>
for herself.</p>
<p>To do good and to distribute had always been <lb/>
part of her life, and, like the Jebusite of old, she <lb/>
found no pleasure in giving to God that which cost <lb/>
her nothing. She seems to have weighed the <reg orig="com-|fortable">comfortable</reg> <lb/>
usefulness of the average married woman <lb/>
against the larger activities for which she felt <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
so capable, and the latter finally turned the <lb/>
scale. In grappling with the diseases, both physical <lb/>
and spiritual, of others, she hoped also to obtain <lb/>
some "clear shining" for herself upon the <reg orig="intellect-|ual">intellectual</reg> <lb/>
difficulties which assailed her with regard to <lb/>
the authenticity and inspiration of the Bible, and <lb/>
she was not disappointed. A complete surrender <lb/>
of her intellect to historical Christianity resulted <lb/>
in a complete surrender of her personal devotion to <lb/>
the Saviour of men. Henceforward her life was <lb/>
consecrated to Him in whose service there is perfect <lb/>
freedom.</p>
<p>A good doubter, like a good hater, is at any rate <lb/>
<pb n="114" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0157"/>
no fossil. There must be some <hi rend="italic">thinking</hi> in a man <lb/>
who has "honest doubts," and there is far more <lb/>
chance, as Bunyan so quaintly puts it, for pilgrims <lb/>
who stray into grounds the owner whereof is <lb/>
"Giant Despair" than for the vainglorious fools <lb/>
like "By-ends" and "Vain-confidence," who cared <lb/>
so little for the hope set before them that they <lb/>
never even emerged from "By-path meadow." The <lb/>
curse of the church to-day is not doubt, not <reg orig="infidel-|ity">infidelity</reg>, <lb/>
but indifferentism,&mdash;the respectable religiosity <lb/>
that has never crystallised the creed which it <reg orig="pro-|fesses">professes</reg>, <lb/>
and thinks that Christianity is either a <lb/>
safety-valve for emotional women, or a sort of <lb/>
moral deterrent for men who are not cultured <lb/>
enough to be philosophical.</p>
<p>People who were too low down in the social scale <lb/>
to come to the hospital were attended to by her in <lb/>
their filthy dens and reeking alleys, and the <reg orig="out-|patients">outpatients</reg> <lb/>
increased in number and in faith after her <lb/>
final settlement in Walsall.</p>
<p>These out-patients, however, were nearly the death <lb/>
of her, for, after coming in, drenched with rain, <lb/>
she constantly allowed her clothes to dry upon her <lb/>

while attending to their needs, and at last nature <lb/>
took its revenge. For weeks she lay in an almost <lb/>
dying state, and then, for the first time, it was fully <lb/>
realised what a power she had become in the town. <lb/>
Anxious inquirers besieged the doors of the <reg orig="hos-|pital">hospital</reg>, <lb/>
and those who had before known but little <lb/>
<pb n="115" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0158"/>
of her, became on her recovery some of her warmest <lb/>
friends.</p>
<p>In 1867 it was determined to build a new <reg orig="hos-|pital">hospital</reg>, <lb/>
and, as funds rapidly flowed in, it was opened <lb/>
in 1868. The entire management now devolved <lb/>
upon Sister Dora, and with almost superhuman <lb/>
fortitude she not only attended to all her <reg orig="multi-|farious">multifarious</reg> <lb/>
indoor duties, but nursed numbers of <reg orig="small-|pox">smallpox</reg> <lb/>
patients in their own homes during an epidemic <lb/>
of that disease which broke out in Walsall just at <lb/>
this time. One striking instance of her innate <reg orig="per-|spicacity">perspicacity</reg> <lb/>
in diagnosis may be given here. A fine <lb/>
young fellow, full of health and strength, was <lb/>
brought to the hospital with his arm terribly <lb/>
mangled by a machine. The doctor prepared to <lb/>
amputate it at once, but Sister Dora, in answer to <lb/>
the man's imploring cry, "Oh Sister, save my arm!" <lb/>
turned to him and said, "I believe I can save it <lb/>
if you will let me try." The doctor was angrily <lb/>
doubtful as to the possibility of doing so, and left <lb/>
all the responsibility upon her, saying, "Are you <lb/>
mad? Mortification will set in, and nothing but <lb/>
amputation can save his life. If you choose to have <lb/>
his death on your conscience, I shall not interfere, <lb/>
but I wash my hands of him."</p>
<p>Day and night for three weeks she watched and <lb/>
tended and prayed over that young fellow's arm. <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">"How</hi> I prayed!" she said afterwards. At the <lb/>
end of that time she was able to show to the doctor <lb/>
<pb n="116" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0159"/>
a straight and healthy-looking arm, which for many <lb/>
years made life worth living to the young <reg orig="work-|man">workman</reg>. <lb/>
The surgeon's magnanimous pride in her <lb/>
achievement was the last drop in her cup of <reg orig="happi-|ness">happiness</reg>, <lb/>
and she simply cried for joy.</p>
<p>This was not a solitary instance of her skill and <lb/>
perseverance. "Conservative surgery" was not so <lb/>
much practised then as it is now, and it was her <lb/>
delight, whenever she was allowed to do so, to spare <lb/>
no trouble or time in doing her very utmost to save <lb/>
not only the lives but the limbs of those who <reg orig="en-|tered">entered</reg> <lb/>
the hospital. Her patience and sympathy <lb/>
with children was quite remarkable to one so <reg orig="im-|petuous">impetuous</reg>. <lb/>
Though she had put aside the idea of <lb/>
having children of her own, she was a mother <reg orig="in-|deed">indeed</reg> <lb/>
to all the dirty, sickly little things who were <lb/>
constantly admitted to the hospital; and the sense <lb/>
of being loved calmed many a frightened child, <lb/>
while a story told by Sister Dora was a treat in <lb/>
which both they and her older patients delighted.</p>
<p>She had many quaint devices for coaxing the <lb/>
men into good behaviour, and one man who swore <lb/>
hard on every possible opportunity, she condemned <lb/>
to say "Poker and tongs, poker and tongs" at <lb/>
intervals, instead of the profane oaths with which <lb/>
he had previously polluted the whole ward.</p>
<p>Many a night she was aroused from her brief <lb/>
and hardly earned rest to attend to sufferers from <lb/>
drunken brawls, or to men who were brought in <lb/>
from some accident in pit or engine-room. When <lb/>
<pb n="117" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0160"/>

<note id="n5" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>Motto of John Hacket, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry. Died <lb/>
1670, aged 78.</p></note>
 the little bell at the head of her bed rang, she <lb/>
used to say to herself, "The Master is come, and <lb/>
calleth for thee," and straightway hurry down to <lb/>
do her Master's work in His own way, first <reg orig="dress-|ing">dressing</reg> <lb/>
their wounds, and then giving a word of <reg orig="re-|proof">reproof</reg> <lb/>
or warning or sympathy, as the case might <lb/>
require. As one of her poor friends said after <lb/>
her death, "Sister Dora was as like the Lord <lb/>
Jesus Christ as any one could be."</p>
<p>But she never "rubbed in" her religion. It was <lb/>
all about her; as one of her friends told us, "It <lb/>
shone in her face."</p>
<p>Spurgeon says truly, "It is too often taken for <lb/>
granted that wit is wicked and humour sinful, <lb/>
while dulness is holy and solemn stupidity full <lb/>
of grace; but we have our doubts about both <lb/>
propositions, for if dulness were a divine power <lb/>
the world would have been converted by now, <lb/>
for the pulpit has never been without a <reg orig="super-|abundant">superabundant</reg> <lb/>
supply of it."</p>
<p>"Make you laugh!" said a big Irishman&mdash;"she'd <lb/>
make you laugh if you were dying."</p>
<p>Full of spirits, dauntlessly cheerful in the most <lb/>
uncongenial surroundings, she was yet recognised <lb/>
as "real tender-hearted," and her patients found <lb/>
in her a never - failing friend who could always <lb/>
be reckoned upon in every phase of suffering or <lb/>
disease.</p>
<pb n="118" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0161"/>
<p>It was while at Walsall that her affections really <lb/>
became engaged. Her life, though lived as it were <lb/>
in the midst of a crowd, was singularly lonely. <lb/>
There was no one with whom she could associate <lb/>
on terms of friendly equality as regarded <reg orig="intel-|lectual">intellectual</reg> <lb/>
matters, nor indeed had she much time <lb/>
for things outside the wards of the hospital. <lb/>
Just when least prepared for the temptation, and <lb/>
perhaps, too, when most ready to succumb, she <lb/>
met a gentleman who was her equal in all ways <lb/>
but one, and, like Christina Rossetti, she had to <lb/>
choose between all that this world could give of <lb/>
happiness and fellowship without God, and a life <lb/>
which must often have been very wanting in <lb/>
social communion. It may be that half <reg orig="uncon-|sciously">unconsciously</reg> <lb/>
the independence which she had snatched <lb/>
so eagerly had begun to pall, and that a womanly <lb/>
longing for nearer and dearer ties asserted itself <lb/>
all the more strongly because of the self-abnegation <lb/>
which she had practised for so long. Passionately <lb/>
attached to each other, she doubtless hoped that to <lb/>
her might be given the joy of bringing over this <lb/>
man to her own way of thinking.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, after a brief delay she <reg orig="sur-|rendered">surrendered</reg> <lb/>
herself utterly, and for the first time, to <lb/>
the joy of loving, and for a short time they were <lb/>
engaged. She was very human in spite of all <lb/>
her saintliness, and this new happiness was for a <lb/>
while all-sufficing. The best and wisest part of <lb/>
<pb n="119" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0162"/>
her nature, however, came to her rescue, and the <lb/>
friend who had before helped her in her <reg orig="intel-|lectual">intellectual</reg> <lb/>
difficulties now urged upon her the <reg orig="alter-|natives">alternatives</reg> <lb/>
of suffering, which she would probably be <lb/>
called upon to bear did she deliberately marry a <lb/>
man whose highest aspirations ended at the grave. <lb/>
He pointed out that either her own faith would <lb/>
be overthrown, or else that she would have the <lb/>
misery of differing with the one she loved best <lb/>
upon those subjects which she knew to be <reg orig="all-|important">all-important</reg>.</p>
<p>His arguments, and her own sense of their <lb/>
justice, determined her to break off the <reg orig="engage-|ment">engagement</reg>; <lb/>
but the trial was tremendous, and the <lb/>
mental and spiritual strain almost unbearable.</p>
<p>No wonder that a severe illness ensued. <reg orig="Weak-|ened">Weakened</reg> <lb/>
by the conflict between love and duty, and <lb/>
the sense of injury inflicted on the man she loved <lb/>
by her own temporary failure in principle, her <lb/>
physical health naturally suffered. An attack of <lb/>
blood-poisoning supervened, from which it seemed <lb/>
likely that she would never rally. The doctor <lb/>
feared that her leg would have to be amputated, <lb/>
and when she declared that she would sooner die <lb/>
than submit to such an operation, the poor old <lb/>
surgeon left the hospital in tears, saying, "If Sister <lb/>
Dora dies, I'll never enter these doors again."</p>
<p>Her strong will, no doubt, helped her to recover, <lb/>
and without any period of convalescence she rose <lb/>
<pb n="120" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0163"/>
from bed to attend an important case which needed <lb/>
the best nursing available.</p>
<p>But the "luminous steps of Duty," as Farrar <lb/>
puts it, were not as yet lighted for her, and <lb/>
once more she had, as it were, to begin the <lb/>
ascent of the hill Difficulty burdened with a <reg orig="re-|doubled">redoubled</reg> <lb/>
sense of loneliness and renunciation.</p>
<p>Sister Dora was specially skilful in her treatment <lb/>
of burns, owing to her extensive experience in this <lb/>
particular line, and in the case of children she had <lb/>
a plan of her own which proved eminently <reg orig="success-|ful">successful</reg>. <lb/>
To soothe their nerves was her first solicitude <lb/>
even before dressing their injuries, from which, <lb/>
however, she carefully excluded the air. After a <lb/>
few hours of sleep the little ones generally allowed <lb/>
her to do as she liked, for her magnetic <reg orig="mother-|liness">motherliness</reg> <lb/>
fascinated them into obedience, and <reg orig="some-|times">sometimes</reg> <lb/>
she even lay down to rest with a burnt baby <lb/>
on each arm.</p>
<p>The one rule of the hospital was Love,&mdash;first for <lb/>
God and then for Work; and even the servants <lb/>
were taught to understand that service was a <lb/>
privilege.</p>
<p>Eye practice was another of her specialities. <lb/>
The frequency and severity of accidents to the <lb/>
eyes rendered it necessary that prompt treatment <lb/>
should be available, and as there was no resident <lb/>
surgeon in the hospital, the "first aid," at any <lb/>
rate, generally devolved upon Sister Dora.</p>
<pb n="121" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0164"/>
<p>To help others, unconsciously as well as <reg orig="con-|sciously">consciously</reg>, <lb/>
was one of her special gifts, and even <lb/>
the clergy acknowledged the influence of her <reg orig="un-|hasting">unhasting</reg>, <lb/>
unresting enthusiasm and her infectious <lb/>
cheerfulness.</p>
<p>It was in 1875, however, that her faith and <lb/>
service were tried to the utmost, for in that year <lb/>
an epidemic of smallpox again broke out with <lb/>
terrific severity. The poor people, with that <reg orig="ig-|norant">ignorant</reg> <lb/>
fatalism which distinguishes them as a <lb/>
class, would not send their invalids to the hospital <lb/>
which was prepared for them, but preferred to <reg orig="con-|ceal">conceal</reg> <lb/>
their condition, saying by way of excuse that <lb/>
"they would far rather nurse them and let them <lb/>
die at home, and were not afraid for themselves."</p>
<p>Things were getting desperate when Sister Dora <lb/>
came to the rescue, offering to leave her own <lb/>
general work to nurse the patients at the Epidemic <lb/>
Hospital. Such an offer could not be refused, for <lb/>
the authorities knew well that nothing would have <lb/>
such an effect upon the masses as the spell of Sister <lb/>
Dora's name.</p>
<p>And they were right in their conjecture, for no <lb/>
sooner was it known that she was the nurse in <lb/>
charge, than the people were as desirous of being <lb/>
sent there as they had before dreaded going. All <lb/>
the king's army and all the king's men would <lb/>
never have persuaded them to take this <reg orig="reason-|able">reasonable</reg> <lb/>
measure for checking the epidemic; but the <lb/>
<pb n="122" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0165"/>
mere fact of her presence was sufficient to inspire <lb/>
them with confidence, and almost unaided she <lb/>
fought hand to hand with the fell disease. One <lb/>
or two of her former patients at the cottage <lb/>
hospital persisted in coming over to see her, <lb/>
but otherwise she was often quite alone, and <lb/>
her behaviour during those months of horror <lb/>
and isolation was in many cases heroic beyond <lb/>
description.</p>
<p>She did not expect to leave the Epidemic Hospital <lb/>
alive, thinking it almost certain that she would <reg orig="suc-|cumb">succumb</reg> <lb/>
to a second attack of smallpox. But, <reg orig="wonder-|ful">wonderful</reg> <lb/>
to relate, she did not take it again, though many <lb/>
times did she bring back the life into patients who <lb/>
were sinking into a state of fatal collapse, by <reg orig="put-|ting">putting</reg> <lb/>
her mouth to theirs and breathing into them <lb/>
until they could once more breathe for themselves.</p>
<p>Another instance of her fearlessness of infection <lb/>
&mdash;to which, as we have said, she was peculiarly <lb/>
susceptible&mdash;was evidenced in the case of a child <lb/>
in the last stage of diphtheria. After the doctor <lb/>
had made an incision in the trachea, she <reg orig="deliber-|ately">deliberately</reg> <lb/>
sucked the poisonous mucus from the little <lb/>
one's throat and saved it from choking to death. <lb/>
In all these things prayer sanctified her work, and, <lb/>
like Elisha of old, she in effect "shut the door <lb/>
upon them twain"&mdash;herself and her patient&mdash;"and <lb/>
prayed unto the Lord."</p>
<p>The English Church truly can boast of many <lb/>
<pb n="123" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0166"/>
uncanonised saints, and on that golden roll the <lb/>
name of Sister Dora is writ large in <reg orig="inefface-|able">ineffaceable</reg> <lb/>
characters. <hi rend="italic">"For His sake"</hi> was her lifelong <lb/>
motto. The more loathsome the patient, the more <lb/>
pitiful and compassionate did she become. Only <lb/>
infinite love can fully gauge the pathos of human <lb/>
life and suffering; but the spirit of the Great Healer <lb/>
was meted out in fullest measure to this intrepid <lb/>
woman, who gave up her life, not grudgingly but <lb/>
gladly, to the tendance of sickness and of sorrow.</p>
<p>To her was given to realise the poet's dream <lb/>
which, we are told, held James Russell Lowell in a <lb/>
sort of ecstasy for forty-eight hours&mdash;that exquisite <lb/>
paraphrase on the words, "Inasmuch as ye did it <lb/>
unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye did <lb/>
it unto Me."</p>
<p>The gruesome leper at Sir Launfal's gate who <lb/>
begged an alms for "Christ's sweet sake" was <lb/>
transformed when, in the name of "mild Mary's <lb/>
Son," the alms was bestowed.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"The leper no longer crouched at his side,</l>
<l>But stood before Him glorified,</l>
<l>Shining and tall and fair and straight</l>
<l>As the pillar that stood by the Beautiful Gate,&mdash;</l>
<l>Himself the Gate whereby men can</l>
<l>Enter the temple of God in man;</l>
<l>And the voice that was calmer than silence said,</l>
<l>'Lo, it is I, be not afraid!'"</l>
</lg></q>
<p>Full of vigour and vitality, she counted time lost <lb/>
that was not devoted to the Master's service; and <lb/>
<pb n="124" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0167"/>
if sometimes we almost wonder at the apparent lack <lb/>
of affection which she showed to her family, we <lb/>
must remember that she dreaded above all things <lb/>
any looking backward, and with single-eyed <reg orig="de-|votion">devotion</reg> <lb/>
kept straight on the path which she <reg orig="be-|lieved">believed</reg> <lb/>
to have been made plain for her feet to <lb/>
walk in.</p>
<p>Had it been in any way possible for her to have <lb/>
discussed such a subject, she would doubtless have <lb/>
vindicated her absorbedness in hospital work by <lb/>
contrasting the comfort of her relatives with the <lb/>
need of her patients. These last so depended upon <lb/>
her, that even when the end was within measurable <lb/>
distance when she should be parted from them, <lb/>
they could not believe it, and the general conviction <lb/>
among the poor of Walsall was, "Her never can be <lb/>
going to die!" For more than twelve years she had <lb/>
laboured among them, and they could not believe <lb/>
that the capable fingers would soon be still for ever, <lb/>
and the warm heart cease to beat in the form which <lb/>
to them was associated with nothing but life and <lb/>
strength and beauty.</p>
<p>Of her mortal disease nothing was known, for <lb/>
with almost unreasonable wilfulness she concealed <lb/>
the fact that cancer was fast eating away her life. <lb/>
Until the weakness which it induced became too <lb/>
overpowering she dressed her own wound, and only <lb/>
the doctor was aware of the incurable nature of <lb/>
her malady, he being pledged by her to strictest <lb/>
<pb n="125" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0168"/>
secrecy. It was early in the year 1876 that she <lb/>
first became conscious of some loss of her usual <lb/>
ease in lifting heavy weights, and her own medical <lb/>
knowledge doubtless conveyed to her the fact, which <lb/>
the doctor's opinion only confirmed, that, for her, <lb/>
life was nearly over.</p>
<p>"The night cometh when no man can work" was <lb/>
not to her as the message of a death-knell, but <lb/>
rather a trumpet-call to added service, to more <lb/>
loving discipleship. As the days slipped by she <lb/>
grudged herself even the moments spent in sleep, <lb/>
and for many months of suffering she carried <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
undauntedly, egged on by the knowledge that <lb/>
the time was short wherein she could work for the <lb/>
Master.</p>
<p>No better description of those later days could <lb/>
be given than that which Charlotte Bront&euml; gives of <lb/>
her sister Emily; and indeed the two natures have <lb/>
much in common, though their lives and aspirations <lb/>
were so strikingly different. "While physically <lb/>
she perished, mentally she grew stronger than we <lb/>
had yet known her. Day by day, when I saw with <lb/>
what a front she met suffering, I looked on her with <lb/>
an anguish of wonder and love. Stronger than a <lb/>
man, simpler than a child, her nature stood alone. <lb/>
The awful part was that, while full of ruth for <lb/>
others, on herself she had no pity; the spirit was <lb/>
inexorable to the flesh; from the trembling hand, <lb/>
the unnerved limbs, the faded eyes, the same <lb/>
<pb n="126" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0169"/>
service was exacted as they had rendered in <lb/>
health."</p>
<p>The same inflexible will and tireless energy <reg orig="char-|acterised">characterised</reg> <lb/>
both; the same magnanimity and warm <lb/>
high-spiritedness are, in each, distinguishing traits; <lb/>
but while Emily Bront&euml; languished when away <lb/>
from the moors, and only knew happiness in the <lb/>
midst of their bleak solitudes, Sister Dora found <lb/>
her delight in work&mdash;the harder the better,&mdash;and <lb/>
the beauties of nature were to her more of a luxury <lb/>
than a necessity.</p>
<p>Hopeless as was their recovery, they each kept <lb/>
their independence almost to the last, and it was <lb/>
the watchers perhaps who suffered most, at the <lb/>
sight of weakness and pain which they could not <lb/>
alleviate and of physical effort which they were not <lb/>
permitted to help or share. The conduct of both in <lb/>
this respect, and in this respect only, was prompted <lb/>
less by the resignation of a meek and quiet spirit <lb/>
that bears all with a sort of passive saintliness, than <lb/>
by a relentless stoicism and self-control such as <lb/>
nerved the pagans of old&mdash;the spirit of Epictetus <lb/>
rather than that of the Christ.</p>
<p>But the time came at last to Sister Dora when <lb/>
concealment was no longer possible, and when, one <lb/>
by one, the daily duties had to be laid aside. From <lb/>
October 1878 she never left her bed, and the <reg orig="suffer-|ings">sufferings</reg> <lb/>
which she endured were terrible&mdash;even opiates <lb/>
finally failing to take any effect. But at intervals <lb/>
<pb n="127" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0170"/>
her old spirit reasserted itself, and when able to see <lb/>
her friends, she was sometimes "that cheerful and <lb/>
jolly" that they, not knowing of her incurable <reg orig="dis-|ease">disease</reg>, <lb/>
came away from her deathbed quite hopeful <lb/>
of her recovery. Outward forms had but little <lb/>
attraction for her; it was on a personal Saviour <lb/>
that she wholly relied, and His Cross and Passion <lb/>
were to her such a very real thing that at times she <lb/>
could not look at the crucifix which hung upon the <lb/>
wall opposite her bed, saying, "I cannot bear the <lb/>
sight of His sufferings; my own sink into nothing <lb/>
by the side of them, and yet I am <hi rend="italic">so</hi> impatient." <lb/>
Hymns had been a great comfort to her at many <lb/>
crises of her life, and when at last she had to give <lb/>
in, she often begged that they might be read or <lb/>
repeated to her.</p>
<p>The rumour of Sister Dora's secession to the <lb/>
Roman Church was altogether unfounded, and her <lb/>
simple faith and trust in our Father's gracious <lb/>
keeping was well known to all those who were <lb/>
connected with her either in friendship or work. <lb/>
But Faber's hymns were a continual refreshment <lb/>
to her, second only to the Bible. No wonder that <lb/>
she whose life had been one long "Entsagung" should <lb/>
sigh for the rest of which he sings, and that, in <reg orig="real-|ising">realising</reg> <lb/>
the welcome to the weary which Heaven's <lb/>
morning will bring, she could find consolation and <lb/>
joy even in her saddest hours. The "huge <reg orig="tender-|ness">tenderness</reg>" <lb/>
of the Good Shepherd was her strong rock <lb/>
<pb n="128" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0171"/>
in times when physical and spiritual weakness lay <lb/>
most heavily upon her, and knowing in Whom she <lb/>
believed, she knew also that <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"There is no place where earth's sorrows</l>
<l rend="indent">Are more felt than up in heaven;</l>
<l>There is no place where earth's failings</l>
<l rend="indent">Have such kindly judgment given."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Next to the Bible there is no branch of literature <lb/>
so remarkable for its catholicity as hymnology. <lb/>
Almost every sect is represented in the most <lb/>
ordinary hymn - book. Roman and Methodist, <lb/>
Ritualist and Evangelical, vie with one another <lb/>
in their singing, and all their differences are <lb/>
merged in the one great chord of love and praise <lb/>
with which the whole creation rings.</p>
<p>Vainly was it hoped that Sister Dora would be <lb/>
able to open in person the new hospital which she <lb/>
had been instrumental in raising, but not until six <lb/>
weeks before her death was the ceremony possible, <lb/>
and her last earthly anxiety was that some one <lb/>
thoroughly competent to undertake its <reg orig="manage-|ment">management</reg> <lb/>
might be found before she herself passed <lb/>
away.</p>
<p>The opening was naturally a very simple and sad <lb/>
one, for all hearts were full of sorrowful regret for <lb/>
that "dear lady" who could never bless it with her <lb/>
presence. The little silver key, presented to her by <lb/>
the Hospital Committee, was one of the last things <lb/>
which gave her any real pleasure, and this she was <lb/>
<pb n="129" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0172"/>
able to give into the hands of the Mayor, <reg orig="ask-|ing">asking</reg> <lb/>
him to open the doors in her name. <reg orig="Al-|though">Although</reg> <lb/>
every day showed increasing weakness, she <lb/>
lingered on through weeks of intensest suffering, <lb/>
aggravated by paroxysms of coughing in one of <lb/>
which it seemed inevitable that the end would <lb/>
come.</p>
<p>But not until the 24th of December did she hear <lb/>
the last call from the Master, and then, very gladly, <lb/>
she rose up and followed Him&mdash;through the gates, <lb/>
into the City.</p>
<p>All pain had left her some hours before, and alone <lb/>
with Him whom she had so loved to serve, she met <lb/>
and conquered the last enemy.</p>
<p>Some people know little of solitude. Life for <lb/>
them is made up of society, and until death sets <lb/>
them apart in the solemn mystery that can come to <lb/>
every one but once, they appear, at any rate, as if <lb/>
only in association with their fellows was life worth <lb/>
living.</p>
<p>Sister Dora had never been one of these&mdash;her <lb/>
work, though carried on in the midst of <reg orig="appreci-|ative">appreciative</reg> <lb/>
surroundings, was singularly solitary. The <lb/>
greatest fault that could be laid to her charge <lb/>
was the monopoly of labour which she claimed, <lb/>
which made it so difficult to find an adequate <lb/>
successor to take her place. Doubtless she herself <lb/>
realised this fact when, with the clearer vision and <lb/>
wisdom of her deathbed, she looked upon the <reg orig="back-|ward">backward</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="130" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0173"/>
way, which she had trodden with a pathetic <lb/>
loneliness not altogether unmixed with a very <lb/>
human pride in her own self-reliance and powers <lb/>
of resource.</p>
<p>"I have lived alone&mdash;let me die alone&mdash;let me <lb/>
die alone," was her cry as the watchers stood <lb/>
beside her, and once more her strong will <reg orig="pre-|vailed">prevailed</reg>, <lb/>
and in the silent room they left her. Her <lb/>
prayer was granted, and ere Christmas morning <lb/>
broke she sank into the arms of God and fell <lb/>
asleep in an unclouded calm.</p>
<p>Four days later almost the whole of the Walsall <lb/>
population followed her body to the cemetery. By <lb/>
her express wish the funeral itself was of the simplest <lb/>
character, but the long procession of mourners was <lb/>
rendered doubly impressive by the personal love <lb/>
and sorrow which had brought together such masses <lb/>
of people, many of them maimed and poor and <lb/>
miserable, to whom she had ministered.</p>
<p>For more than a mile they followed her to her <lb/>
last resting-place, and she, the silent centre of that <lb/>
silent crowd, was borne upon the shoulders of <reg orig="eigh-|teen">eighteen</reg> <lb/>
railway-men whom she had nursed back to <lb/>
health and strength.</p>
<p>Not even in death was she divided from the poor, <lb/>
whom she had so loved and served, for the funeral <lb/>
service was read simultaneously over her coffin and <lb/>
those of four paupers&mdash;"Just as Sister Dora would <lb/>
have wished," as one of her nurses said.</p>
<pb n="131" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0174"/>
<p>The years have come and gone since then, but <lb/>
still working-men are often seen standing by Sister <lb/>
Dora's statue at Walsall, talking of the accidents <lb/>
which are sculptured round its base. For many <lb/>
years it had the unique honour of being the only <lb/>
uncrowned woman's statue in England, and it is <lb/>
likely that for many more it will stand alone as a <lb/>
memorial of what can be done, not in the vast fields <lb/>
of literature and art but, in a sphere where the mere <lb/>
right to live is challenged.</p>
<p>It is here that a woman's hand and a woman's <lb/>
heart are more to be desired than even the highest <lb/>
efforts of medical science and surgical skill, for <lb/>
without good nursing the wisdom of the physician <lb/>
is practically nullified.</p>
<p>As Florence Nightingale, the grandest of nurses <lb/>
and of our living "old maids," truly says, "Nursing <lb/>
is an art, and requires as exclusive a devotion, as <lb/>
hard a preparation, as any painter's or sculptor's <lb/>
work."</p>
<p>Her touching words relative to Agnes Jones, the <lb/>
pioneer of workhouse nursing, in 1868, are no less <lb/>
applicable to Sister Dora. "She lived the life and <lb/>
died the death of the saints and martyrs, though <lb/>
the greatest sinner would not have been more <reg orig="sur-|prised">surprised</reg> <lb/>
than she to have heard this said of herself. <lb/>
All, of all shades of religious creed, seemed to have <lb/>
merged their differences in her, seeing in her the <lb/>
one true essential thing, compared with which they <lb/>
<pb n="132" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0175"/>
acknowledged their differences to be as nothing. <lb/>
She was always filled with the thought that she <lb/>
must be about her 'Father's business.' To follow <lb/>
Him she spent herself in activity; she overworked <lb/>
because others underwork.</p>
<p>"Shall we let her have died in vain?"</p>

<ornament type="line"/>
<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">I was</hi> born in Islington&mdash;let alone it being highly <lb/>
ridiculous for it to matter where," was Mary <reg orig="Kings-|ley's">Kingsley's</reg> <lb/>
quaint answer to a person of inquiring mind <lb/>
who was anxious to locate her birthplace.</p>
<p>The answer is very characteristic. She couldn't <lb/>
imagine that any one would be interested enough <lb/>
in her for the question to be worth asking; and to <lb/>
find herself suddenly famous was a revelation which <lb/>
appealed more to her sense of humour than to any <lb/>
personal feeling of vanity or ambition. This <lb/>
absence of self-consciousness was one of Mary <lb/>
Kingsley's greatest charms throughout a life that <lb/>
was all too short. In her earlier days it took the <lb/>
form of selflessness, and father, mother, and brother <lb/>
were always the first to be considered by her.</p>
<p>Her father, Dr George Henry Kingsley, was the <lb/>
third son of the Rev. Charles Kingsley, who was <lb/>
successively rector of Barnack, Clovelly, and Chelsea. <lb/>
His four sons all distinguished themselves, but while <lb/>
the Canon of Westminster was the greatest of the <lb/>
<pb n="136" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0181"/>
brothers, George appears to have been a man of <lb/>
almost limitless capabilities, though without the <lb/>
fixity of purpose the possession of which would <lb/>
have made him really famous.</p>
<p>Everything by turns and nothing long, he <reg orig="gradu-|ated">graduated</reg> <lb/>
at Edinburgh University in 1847, when only <lb/>
twenty years of age; and two years later, during <lb/>
the outbreak of cholera in Flintshire, he devoted <lb/>
himself, with the practical compassion of his nature, <lb/>
to the poor non-paying villagers who needed his <lb/>
services.</p>
<p>We have his daughter's authority for saying that <lb/>
Charles Kingsley, when writing 'Two Years Ago,' <lb/>
drew "Tom Thurnall" from his recollections of the <lb/>
life which George Henry led at that time.</p>
<p>"He just thought nothing about death and <lb/>
danger at all&mdash;always smiling, always cheerful, <lb/>
always busy yet never in a hurry, he went up <lb/>
and down seemingly ubiquitous. Sleep he got <lb/>
when he could, and food as often as he could&mdash; <lb/>
the only person in the town who seemed to <lb/>
grow healthier and actually happier as the work <lb/>
went on."</p>
<p>From this time till 1862 he did much good work <lb/>
both in literature and science, and in 1856 was <lb/>
elected a Fellow of the Linn&aelig;lig; Society, for his <lb/>
valuable investigations into the structure of some <lb/>
of the lower forms of animal life.</p>
<p>His marriage with Miss Mary Bailey was one of <lb/>
<pb n="137" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0182"/>
affection on both sides; but, strangely enough, no <lb/>
sooner had he established himself as a "family <lb/>
man" than the fever of travel seems to have taken <lb/>
possession of him. With a wife whom he tenderly <lb/>
loved, and two children to whom both were <reg orig="de-|voted">devoted</reg>, <lb/>
it would have seemed quite natural had he <lb/>
settled down to literary and scientific pursuits <lb/>
in London, and reserved for holiday intervals the <lb/>
more active delights of fishing and shooting. But <lb/>
it is always the unexpected that happens, and his <lb/>
cruise on the Mediterranean with Admiral Egerton, <lb/>
in H.M.S. St George, in 1863, was but the first of <lb/>
a series of journeys which continued almost to his <lb/>
life's end. The systematic study of medicine was <lb/>
forsworn for the more fascinating pleasures of <lb/>
scientific travel, and his home was decorated with <lb/>
queer weapons, skins and trophies, which he was <lb/>
constantly accumulating during his wanderings.</p>
<p>His parents were alike remarkable, Charles <lb/>
Kingsley, senior&mdash;so his son says&mdash;"possessing <lb/>
every talent except that of using them"; while the <lb/>
mother, "on the contrary, had a quite <reg orig="extra-|ordinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
practical and administrative power, my <lb/>
father's passion for knowledge, and the sentiment <lb/>
and fancy of a young girl." This grandmother of <lb/>
Mary Kingsley was the daughter of Mr Lucas, a <lb/>
judge in Barbadoes, who was also a great traveller; <lb/>
and it was probably from association with him that <lb/>
the young Kingsleys imbibed that passion for <reg orig="trav-|elling">travelling</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="138" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0183"/>
which showed itself so strikingly in them <lb/>
all. Their early boyhood was spent at Clovelly, <lb/>
and the many memories of storm and tragedy and <lb/>
charm connected with that seaboard parish were <lb/>
doubtless an element in the subsequent <reg orig="develop-|ment">development</reg> <lb/>
of their characters. Though the study of <lb/>
"fresh-water fishes" was afterwards one of George <lb/>
Kingsley's great hobbies, there may have been <lb/>
some subtle connection between them and their <lb/>
salt-water brethren that we wot not of. That his <lb/>
first love, however, was by no means forsaken, we <lb/>
can see plainly in an extract from one of his <reg orig="note-|books">notebooks</reg> <lb/>
which his daughter transcribes. "You can <lb/>
have no idea of what a glorious pleasure there is <lb/>
in fishing in a new sea, in ignorance of what you <lb/>
are going to catch, more particularly if you have <lb/>
the slightest interest in ichthyology. Shall I ever <lb/>
forget the moment when I saw my first <hi rend="italic">Chim&oelig;ra <lb/>
australis</hi> handed into the boat! A fish which I <lb/>
had marvelled at from my boyhood upwards, and <lb/>
almost fancied to be the dream of some mad <lb/>
naturalist, so wild and weird was his delineation, <lb/>
&mdash;not half so wild and weird, however, as his <lb/>
reality."</p>
<p>The Kingsleys were all born travellers, and the <lb/>
terrible havoc wrought by the sea seems rather to <lb/>
have stirred the boys into a wild longing to brave <lb/>
its dangers than to have had any deterrent effect <lb/>
upon their imaginations.</p>
<pb n="139" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0184"/>
<p>We cannot resist quoting a few sentences from <lb/>
Charles Kingsley's 'Prose Idylls,' which give in <lb/>
his uniquely vigorous language an account of what <lb/>
one storm had wrought:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The old bay lay darkened with the grey <lb/>
columns of the water-spouts stalking across the <lb/>
waves before the northern gale, and the tiny <reg orig="her-|ring">herring</reg> <lb/>
- boats fleeing from the nets right for the <lb/>
breakers, hoping more mercy from those iron walls <lb/>
of rock than from the pitiless howling waste of <lb/>
spray behind them; and that merry beach beside <lb/>
the town covered with shrieking women and old <lb/>
men, casting themselves upon the pebbles in <reg orig="fruit-|less">fruitless</reg> <lb/>
agonies of prayer, as corpse after corpse swept <lb/>
up at the feet of wife and child; till, in one case <lb/>
alone, a single dawn saw upwards of sixty widows <lb/>
and orphans of men who had gone out the night <lb/>
before in the fullness of strength and courage."</p>
<p>Tales like these would be told to Mary and her <lb/>
brother by their father, and the children would <lb/>
dream over them in the town-girt homes of <reg orig="High-|gate">Highgate</reg> <lb/>
and Bexley, and long for a sight of that <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Great, wide, beautiful, wonderful, world,</l>
<l rend="indent">With the wonderful water round it curled,</l>
<l>And cities and gardens and cliffs and isles,</l>
<l rend="indent">And people upon it for thousands of miles."</l>
</lg></q>
No wonder that the brother and sister were devoted <lb/>
to each other. Fine times they must have had <lb/>
when their father came home, brimming over with <lb/>
<pb n="140" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0185"/>
yarns of travel, which he loved to relate with all <lb/>
the glowing fancy and enthusiasm which <reg orig="character-|ised">characterised</reg> <lb/>
the Kingsleys.</p>
<p>We can almost see the children, talking together <lb/>
of what the future might bring, little recking of <lb/>
the long Between, little dreaming of the fame <lb/>
which would come to the demure - looking little <lb/>
maiden, and the imperial interests which she was <lb/>
destined to speak of and to promote.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that the influence of the sea was <lb/>
upon him all through his life. "No landscape," he <lb/>
said, "seems perfect to my eyes unless they can <lb/>
see therein a bit of the blue water; therefore I <lb/>
love an island. I love the sigh and the sough of <lb/>
the wind in the black pine-forests of Germany; I <lb/>
love the swish of the Northern birch-trees in the <lb/>
fresh, odorous early morning, when the gale has <lb/>
just gone by and the wet is sweeping in little <lb/>
glittering showers off their lissom branches; I love <lb/>
the creak and groan and roar of the great oaks in <lb/>
a storm, and I love the lazy whispering murmur <lb/>
of the light green limes in the lazy golden summer <lb/>
afternoons; but, above all the sounds of nature, I <lb/>
love the voices of the sea, for they speak to me in <lb/>
more varied tones, and I know that they tell me <lb/>
more, though I know not what they tell me, than <lb/>
the voices of a million sibilant leaves,&mdash;therefore <lb/>
I love an island."</p>
<p>Beautiful writing this, in its terse descriptiveness, <lb/>
<pb n="141" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0186"/>
worthy, surely, of being set alongside of one of his <lb/>
brother's Idylls: but we quote it only for its <lb/>
striking contrast to his daughter's predilection for <lb/>
large tracts of country, born, perhaps, of her inland <lb/>
upbringing. This is expressed with much of the <lb/>
same graphic word-painting, though, as it seems <lb/>
to us, with less poetic grace, and with an almost <lb/>
masculine forcefulness. "I greatly prefer a tropical <lb/>
continental land mass, with thousands of square <lb/>
miles of dark forest, swamps, and mountain-ranges <lb/>
&mdash;not mere peaks which have got adrift and <lb/>
anchored out at sea, &mdash;a land with great rivers <lb/>
which come from a thousand miles away, and swing <lb/>
past you in a cavalry charge over rapids, mark <lb/>
time in dangerous muddy estuaries, bound seawards <lb/>
ever, whatever their pace may be when you see <lb/>
them&mdash;things that mean business,&mdash;a spacious land <lb/>
you have no fear of falling over the edge of into <lb/>
the ocean, when either a pack of misguided heathen <lb/>
or an isolated big-game lunatic makes rapid action <lb/>
advisable, whether you have a boat ready on the <lb/>
beach or no."</p>
<p>Of school-life Mary Kingsley knew nothing; but <lb/>
the object-lessons which surrounded her on every <lb/>
hand were sufficient incentives to study, and in <lb/>
helping her father and brother she was <reg orig="uncon-|sciously">unconsciously</reg> <lb/>
educating herself. Home duties were <reg orig="al-|ways">always</reg> <lb/>
paramount; and, as Dr Kingsley had a <lb/>
perfect horror of "blue-stockings," she rose early, <lb/>
<pb n="142" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0187"/>
and late took rest, in order to make time for those <lb/>
intellectual pleasures in which she soon found a <lb/>
delight that was hers by inheritance. Science had <lb/>
a special charm for her, and in order the better to <lb/>
understand it, she learned German, though leave <lb/>
was not given her to do so until she had satisfied <lb/>
her father that she was able to starch and iron a <lb/>
shirt both properly and well.</p>
<p>For sixteen years&mdash;1863 to 1879&mdash;the family <lb/>
lived at Highgate, and on sunny days Henry <lb/>
Kingsley, ex-stockrider, miner, and mounted <reg orig="police-|man">police-man</reg>, <lb/>
might often be seen basking on the little lawn <lb/>
in a haze of tobacco smoke, telling hair-raising <lb/>
tales of bush-life in Australia, and thinking of the <lb/>
"hot grey plains and the great wooded ranges" <lb/>
of the Antipodes, rather than of the fame which <lb/>
he had achieved as the author of 'Geoffrey <lb/>
Hamlyn' and 'Ravenshoe.'</p>
<p>In 1879 they removed to Bexley Heath, where, <lb/>
upon drier soil, it was hoped that Mrs Kingsley <lb/>
might have better health than she had hitherto <lb/>
experienced. Here the friendship of Mr Varley, <lb/>
an electrical engineer of no small repute, was a <lb/>
great advantage to Mary Kingsley, and for five <lb/>
years she worked steadily at her home duties and <lb/>
mathematics. She was then what is colloquially <lb/>
known as a "slip of a girl"&mdash;thin and <reg orig="colour-|less">colourless</reg>, <lb/>
with straight pale hair, high forehead, and <lb/>
large, splendid blue eyes, of quiet habits, and well <lb/>
<pb n="143" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0188"/>
accustomed to the decorous domesticities of an <lb/>
unpretentious and frugal English household.</p>
<p>These domestic habits proved of great use to <lb/>
her in after-life, but do not quite fit in with the <lb/>
"slap-dash" roving disposition which we generally <lb/>
presuppose&mdash;though often erroneously&mdash;in a lady <lb/>
explorer.</p>
<p>All the same, it seems to us that to one who, as <lb/>
'The Times' says, "had an hereditary love of living <lb/>
in the byways rather than in the highways of <lb/>
civilisation,' the conventionalities of life must <lb/>
sometimes have appeared not only irksome but <lb/>
absurd."</p>
<p>"I was my mother's chief officer from the day <lb/>
I could first carry a duster, and I had to do the <lb/>
tidying up&mdash;that is to say, I became responsible for <lb/>
everything lost in the establishment."</p>
<p>This is her brief epitome of her life at this time, <lb/>
and between the lines we can read plainly that <lb/>
such an office was no sinecure. George Kingsley's <lb/>
"awful temper" was as harmless a factor in the <lb/>
household as sheet-lightning in a summer sky, but <lb/>
to be responsible for everything, in a house which <lb/>
was nothing less than a miniature museum, was, to <lb/>
say the least of it, "no joke." She seems, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
to have discharged her duties with the cheery <lb/>
whole-heartedness which was natural to her, and a <lb/>
book thrown at her head occasionally was merely <lb/>
something to be "dodged," as we dodge an April <lb/>
<pb n="144" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0189"/>
shower, and to be reckoned with philosophically as <lb/>
a mere incident in the day's work.</p>
<p>Her account of the fighting-cocks, that seemed <lb/>
always and only to burst into full crow when "the <lb/>
master" came home, is full of humour, and reminds <lb/>
us of Carlyle's description of the "demon fowls" <lb/>
which caused him and his faithful Goody such <reg orig="in-|finite">infinite</reg> <lb/>
discomfiture. But the vagaries of "Ki-ki," <lb/>
and "Chickums," and "Attila the Ostrogoth," were <lb/>
a great amusement to Dr Kingsley when he <reg orig="hap-|pened">happened</reg> <lb/>
to be in the mood; and like fathers who <lb/>
alternately spoil and spurn their children, it was <lb/>
difficult for the "chief officer" to foresee what the <lb/>
course of events might be.</p>
<p>All the members of the little household were on <lb/>
their best behaviour when the master was at home, <lb/>
and the loving welcome of his reception was only <lb/>
equalled by the regretful "speeding" with which, <lb/>
after two or three months&mdash;often less&mdash;he once <lb/>
more started on his travels, to the Rocky Mountains, <lb/>
or Africa, or the South Sea Islands.</p>
<p>His love for his wife and family was true and <lb/>
faithful, and it was warmly reciprocated. When <lb/>
on his most delightful cruises he longed with a very <lb/>
real longing for their sympathy and companionship, <lb/>
but unfortunately he loved the "bright eyes of <lb/>
danger" better than aught else.</p>
<p>Some chapters in 'South Sea Bubbles' &lpar;published <lb/>
by Bentley in 1872&rpar;, recording a trip to the South <lb/>
<pb n="145" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0190"/>
Seas with the Earl of Pembroke, a few magazine <lb/>
articles and his letters home, are the only writings <lb/>
extant of this many-sided man, who might have <lb/>
made a name in the literary world. In these few <lb/>
specimens, which he deemed most unworthy, we <lb/>
can see the same sparkling vivacity and "straight <lb/>
from the shoulder" style of writing which <reg orig="charac-|terises">characterises</reg> <lb/>
every page of his daughter's light-hearted <lb/>
log-books, and the earnest thoroughness in <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> <lb/>
which we loved in Parson Lot.</p>
<p>Mary Kingsley says that "the Kingsleys were <lb/>
all fishers," but, equally, they were all fighters. <lb/>
By hereditary instinct and by natural development <lb/>
they all loved fighting&mdash;victory if possible, but at <lb/>
any rate the bracingness of struggle.</p>
<p>In 1884 they removed to Cambridge, and there <lb/>
she had fuller scope for mental activities, though <lb/>
never did she allow the fascinations of learning to <lb/>
allure her from those filial duties which it was her <lb/>
delight to render to her father and mother. It has <lb/>
been said truly that "Duty can be either a bracelet <lb/>
or a handcuff, according to the light in which it is <lb/>
regarded," and to Mary Kingsley it was an <reg orig="adorn-|ment">adornment</reg> <lb/>
only, never depreciated or cast aside until <lb/>
Death, in a few short weeks, deprived her of the <lb/>
parents whom she had served so faithfully and well.</p>
<p>In the watches of the night, which her mother's <lb/>
long illness rendered necessary, she kept herself <lb/>
awake by the study of oriental languages, and her <lb/>
<pb n="146" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0191"/>
mental grip grew stronger and more self - reliant <lb/>
from intercourse with such men as Darwin, <reg orig="Lub-|bock">Lubbock</reg>, <lb/>
and Huxley. Her health, too, improved <lb/>
astonishingly at Cambridge; and, though never <lb/>
robust-looking, it was difficult to identify in the <lb/>
alert, resolute, and wiry figure whom we afterwards <lb/>
knew as the West African traveller, the delicate <lb/>
girl of Bexley Heath. This dual life of mental <lb/>
effort and physical fatigue, combined with the <reg orig="re-|sponsibilities">responsibilities</reg> <lb/>
which attached to her position as <lb/>
nurse and housekeeper, early made her a woman; <lb/>
and, had it not been for her wonderful faculty for <lb/>
looking on the bright side of things, it would have <lb/>
made an <hi rend="italic">old</hi> woman of her. But we cannot think <lb/>
of age and Mary Kingsley together. She must <lb/>
always have been young in heart, had she been <lb/>
spared to live among us for twice the length of <lb/>
time allotted to her. Bubbling over with vitality <lb/>
and enthusiasm, interested in everything, and with <lb/>
a keen sense of humour that exalted every <reg orig="discom-|fort">discomfort</reg> <lb/>
into a source of amusement, she is one of those <lb/>
people who seem to stand apart&mdash;a <hi rend="italic">rara avis</hi> whose <lb/>
like we may not expect often to look upon.</p>
<p>She had need of all her inherent tact and <reg orig="hope-|fulness">hopefulness</reg> <lb/>
during Dr Kingsley's absences; for, she says <lb/>
of her mother, "no amount of experience in her <lb/>
husband's habit of surviving ever made her feel he <lb/>
was safe," and all Mary Kingsley's loving ingenuity <lb/>
was needed, to in any way lessen or brighten the <lb/>
<pb n="147" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0192"/>
anxious hours of the delicate woman while he was <lb/>
facing death and danger in every quarter of the <lb/>
globe. For months at a time she lived in a <reg orig="con-|stant">constant</reg> <lb/>
state of nervous anxiety, and those long <lb/>
silences, during which she suffered so acutely, were <lb/>
indirectly the cause of her serious illness.</p>
<p>But "man is immortal till his work is done," and <lb/>
not by shark or grizzly bear, not by massacre or <lb/>
shipwreck, was George Kingsley to meet his end. <lb/>
In February 1892, when only sixty-six years of <lb/>
age, while quietly sleeping in his own hired house, <lb/>
all unawares the pulses of his human life grew <lb/>
still; and six weeks later his wife followed him <lb/>
into that pleasant land whence there is no <reg orig="re-|turning">returning</reg>.</p>
<p>Of Mary Kingsley's mother we know but little, <lb/>
but the devotion of her daughter almost speaks for <lb/>
itself; and when we read that "the only thing <lb/>
that ever tempted her to go about among her <lb/>
neighbours was to assist them in mind, body, or <lb/>
estate," and that, so strongly marked a <reg orig="character-|istic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
was this of the home life, that it seemed to the <lb/>
daughter as if she too had no right to associate <lb/>
with people unless there was something the matter <lb/>
with them, we feel sure that she was one of those <lb/>
gentle saintly folks whose quiet influence is not <lb/>
fully realised until it is taken away.</p>
<p>"I had been sitting up all night with mother <hi rend="italic">as <lb/>
usual</hi>," says Mary Kingsley in her brief account of <lb/>
<pb n="148" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0193"/>
her father's death, and the two words which we <lb/>
have italicised give us a hint of the faithful service <lb/>
which she had rendered so unswervingly to the <lb/>
patient invalid. The continual strain of her life <lb/>
at home was far more trying to her than the worst <lb/>
adventures which she subsequently experienced in <lb/>
Africa, and we do not wonder at her outspoken <lb/>
contempt for those who, on the score of sex alone, <lb/>
were amazed at her exciting exploits and <reg orig="hair-|breadth">hairbreadth</reg> <lb/>
escapes.</p>
<p>She was not one of those who are for ever <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Seeking for some great thing to do,</l>
<l rend="indent">Some secret thing to know."</l>
</lg></q>
Not until she had done all her duty to those <reg orig="de-|pendent">dependent</reg> <lb/>
upon her did she feel free to indulge her <lb/>
innate love of travel, and then, worn out as she <lb/>
was with sorrow and nervous exhaustion, she <reg orig="deter-|mined">determined</reg> <lb/>
to recruit her health in the Canary Islands. <lb/>
She was now thirty years of age, and, as far as <lb/>
we are aware, had never been farther afield than <lb/>
Guernsey. Hitherto we have spoken more of the <lb/>
influences which surrounded her than of herself. It <lb/>
was necessary to do so in order rightly to <reg orig="under-|stand">understand</reg> <lb/>
the woman whose 'Travels in West Africa' <lb/>
so astonished us all in 1897.</p>
<p>While visiting the Canary Islands in 1892 she <lb/>
heard much about West Africa, and was stirred into <lb/>
a sort of defiant curiosity and determination to see <lb/>
<pb n="149" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0194"/>
and judge for herself as to that country, its <reg orig="pro-|ducts">products</reg> <lb/>
and its inhabitants.</p>
<p>During her first visit in 1893 she gleaned a great <lb/>
deal of miscellaneous information, and evidently <reg orig="en-|joyed">enjoyed</reg> <lb/>
herself thoroughly, though not on such strictly <lb/>
scientific lines as she afterwards pursued. The <lb/>
"fine hearse and plumes" which had been promised <lb/>
her on behalf of the Wesleyan Mission, by a friend <lb/>
who wanted to discourage her from visiting that <lb/>
part of the "Dark Continent," was not required; <lb/>
and, had she been spared, it was her intention to <lb/>
spend the next few years in studying on the spot <lb/>
the fishes and the fetishes, and above all the tribal <lb/>
differences which must for so long make the Imperial <lb/>
riddle so hard to read.</p>
<p>Miss Kingsley had more than a "slight interest <lb/>
in ichthyology," and the officials of the British <lb/>
Museum, who are always ready to make choice of <lb/>
fit persons to serve in the ministry of Science, <reg orig="en-|listed">enlisted</reg> <lb/>
her services to collect fishes and insects on <lb/>
their behalf. The combination strikes us as being <lb/>
curious, so little kinship does there appear between <lb/>
the cold-blooded denizens of the water and the airy <lb/>
fairy flutterers in the summer sun, or the <reg orig="business-|like">business-like</reg> <lb/>
insects that do their work in the world with <lb/>
such silent deftness.</p>
<p>Through bush and swamp, undaunted by danger, <lb/>
inspirited by difficulties, she made her way, and <lb/>
returned to England with a number of specimens of <lb/>
<pb n="150" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0195"/>
rare fishes which she had collected principally in the <lb/>
Ogow&eacute;, a river north of the Congo. Of fatigue and <lb/>
privation she had plenty; but while she says that <lb/>
the treadmill life of a society woman in London <lb/>
would soon kill her, she speaks of her adventures&mdash; <lb/>
of which so much "fuss" was made&mdash;with the <reg orig="in-|dulgent">indulgent</reg> <lb/>
satire with which, in England, we describe <lb/>
the self-sought discomforts of a picnic.</p>
<p>It was not, however, until after her second visit <lb/>
that Mr George Macmillan induced her to write of <lb/>
her experiences, the result of which was one of the <lb/>
most wonderful records of womanly pluck and <reg orig="en-|durance">endurance</reg> <lb/>
which has ever been published. In this <lb/>
somewhat ponderous volume of seven hundred and <lb/>
thirty pages there is not a dry paragraph. Every <lb/>
chapter is full of incident, related with the bubbling <lb/>
vivacity which characterises her writings&mdash;always <lb/>
perspicuous; racy and pathetic by turns.</p>
<p>It was in December 1894 that she once more <lb/>
started for West Africa&mdash;and this time she set to <lb/>
work earnestly to study not only insects and fishes <lb/>
but the "animistic-minded inhabitants," of whose <lb/>
virtues and failings we know so little. <reg orig="Ethno-|logically">Ethnologically</reg> <lb/>
we fancy that we know a good deal; but <lb/>
is it not a fact that, as regards the natives of vast <lb/>
continents, we are too apt to generalise?</p>
<p>Robert Louis Stevenson and Mary Kingsley would <lb/>
have been the first to disclaim their right to be <lb/>
entitled ethnologists, and yet their practical <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="151" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0196"/>
is probably more dependable than the theoretic <lb/>
and systematic classification of Samoan and West <lb/>
African tribes upon which we are wont to rely.</p>
<p>To some of our readers we commend "Animism" <lb/>
as a subject for study. It opens up a vast field of <lb/>
inquiry as to the "making of religions," which in a <lb/>
paper such as this we could not dare to touch upon, <lb/>
save in the most tentative and superficial way. Mr <lb/>
Harland, the ex-President of the Folklore Society, <lb/>
says truly of this religious evolution that "its <lb/>
attraction is perennial." Animism may be defined <lb/>
as the "universal attribution of souls to all things"; <lb/>
and that, we take it, involves a sort of "real <lb/>
presence" in inanimate objects. Close upon this <lb/>
conception follows the belief in "the awful," as <lb/>
Mr Marett calls it&mdash;namely, the existence of spirits, <lb/>
ghosts, witches, gods, and, by easy sequence, a <lb/>
belief in the transmigration of souls from one object <lb/>
to another.</p>
<p>To an "animistic-minded" tribe the terrors of <lb/>
what we call death are minimised on the one side <lb/>
and magnified on the other. The possibilities are <lb/>
certainly awful and infinite, but <hi rend="italic">there is no death.</hi> <lb/>
As Miss Kingsley puts it, "You never get the <lb/>
strange idea of the differences between time and <lb/>
eternity&mdash;the idea, I mean, that they are different <lb/>
things&mdash;in the African, that one frequently gets in <lb/>
cultured Europeans; and as for the human soul, <lb/>
the African always believes that 'still the spirit <lb/>
<pb n="152" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0197"/>
is whole, and life and death but shadows of the <lb/>
soul.'"</p>
<p>Apropos of this subject, Dr Nassau &lpar;the pioneer and <lb/>
explorer of the Ogow&eacute;regions&rpar; and Miss Kingsley <lb/>
were both agreed that "dead black men go white <lb/>
when soaked in water"; and it has occurred to us <lb/>
that this may have accounted for the fact that, <lb/>
when entering a village near Lake N'Covi, each <lb/>
child as soon as it saw her face fled headlong into <lb/>
the nearest hut; while she herself considered that <lb/>
her colour, or rather her want of it, was some <lb/>
protection even among the most savage tribes. <lb/>
Possibly they may have invested her with some <lb/>
ghostly attributes which rendered her an unfit <lb/>
subject for the omnivorous stew-pot.</p>
<p>Mary Kingsley had no sympathy for ordinary <lb/>
Christian missions, but she gives unqualified praise <lb/>
to the Mission &Eacute;vang&eacute;lique, which she considered <lb/>
the perfection of what may be called purely spiritual <lb/>
work, and the influence of which upon the natives <lb/>
was altogether for good.</p>
<p>An 'Academy' critic tells us that it will probably <lb/>
be found by-and-by that she "lacked the time to <lb/>
co-ordinate her facts"; but, on the other hand, <lb/>
may it not be found, with equal probability, that <lb/>
she understated those facts, and that could she, <hi rend="italic">and <lb/>
we</hi>, revisit these glimpses of the moon hereafter, the <lb/>
"co-ordination," of which he rather patronisingly <lb/>
speaks, would have resolved itself into a scientific <lb/>
<pb n="153" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0198"/>
certainty? Her intellect was not of the spasmodic <lb/>
order, either by heredity or development. Quick in <lb/>
observation, resolute in action, with a mental grasp <lb/>
rare in both sexes, and the intuitive insight and <lb/>
perception which is peculiar to a woman, it seems <lb/>
unlikely that she should have been mistaken in her <lb/>
estimate as to things African.</p>
<p>We have read somewhere that "literature is <lb/>
broader than sex," and this may be said most <lb/>
emphatically of Mary Kingsley's West African <lb/>
literature. It is "exceeding broad." No trace <lb/>
of femininity lurks in it, though, equally, there <lb/>
is no unwomanliness. It stands alone in its <lb/>
wide far-seeing intelligence. Keen common-sense <lb/>
prompts every theory that she initiates. For <lb/>
emotionalism that only "means well" her <reg orig="con-|tempt">contempt</reg> <lb/>
is as sincere as it is good-natured, and she <lb/>
would have all men to "learn things <hi rend="italic">as they are,</hi> <lb/>
and to keep their given word."</p>
<p>She spoke only of what she had known, and <lb/>
testified as to what she had seen, and we receive <lb/>
her testimony with hopefulness&mdash;nothing <reg orig="doubt-|ing">doubting</reg>, <lb/>
save of the slowly moving policy that takes <lb/>
years to realise that, at the back of all so-called <lb/>
heathenism, there is something that can be dealt <lb/>
with by common-sense methods, and not by the <lb/>
wholesale substitution of a lucrative cant for a <lb/>
sincere if mistaken superstition.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">To adapt rather than to abolish</hi> is the keynote <lb/>
<pb n="154" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0199"/>
of Mary Kingsley's message. To tell of a "more <lb/>
excellent way" is one thing, but to rub in the <lb/>
Gospel story with the point of the sword, or to <lb/>
dispense the balm of Gilead alternately with <reg orig="fire-|water">firewater</reg>, <lb/>
is quite another.</p>
<p>Far be it from us to depreciate the work of <lb/>
the heroic missionaries who, taking their lives in <lb/>
their hands, have gone forth with the divine <lb/>
commission. But too often "sanctified <reg orig="common-|sense">common-sense</reg>" <lb/>
has been lacking; and heathens, like <lb/>
children, are quicker to see the weaknesses of <lb/>
their teachers than the value of the lessons which <lb/>
they fain would teach.</p>
<p>She insists most urgently on a detailed <reg orig="know-|ledge">knowledge</reg> <lb/>
of tribal characteristics, and warns us, as a <lb/>
nation, of the danger of dealing <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> with <lb/>
West African races, the mental, physical, and <lb/>
moral capabilities of which are so numerous and <lb/>
so varied.</p>
<p>Lord Lawrence, in his celebrated despatch, <lb/>
speaks most strikingly on this point when <reg orig="allud-|ing">alluding</reg> <lb/>
to the awful tragedies of the Indian Mutiny. <lb/>
He says: "Christian things done in a Christian <lb/>
way will never alienate the heathen. About such <lb/>
things there are qualities which do not provoke, <lb/>
nor excite distrust, nor harden to resistance. It <lb/>
is when Christian things are done in an <hi rend="italic">un</hi>- <lb/>
Christian way that mischief and danger are <lb/>
occasioned. The difficulty is amid the political <lb/>
<pb n="155" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0200"/>
complications, the conflicting social considerations, <lb/>
the fears and hopes of self-interest, which are so <lb/>
apt to mislead human judgment, to discern clearly <lb/>
what is imposed upon us by Christian duty and <lb/>
what is not. Having done this, we have but to <lb/>
put it into practice."</p>
<p>To this high-souled dictum Mary Kingsley would <lb/>
unreservedly agree, adding, after her own <reg orig="experi-|ences">experiences</reg>, <lb/>
"England has an excellent idea regarding <lb/>
her duty to native races in West Africa. She <lb/>
has an excellent actual in the West African <lb/>
nature to superimpose her idea upon. All that <lb/>
is wanted is the proper method; and this method, <lb/>
I assure you, that Science, true knowledge &lpar;which <lb/>
Spinoza termed the 'inward aid of God'&rpar;, can give."</p>
<p>It is rather singular that, while Miss Kingsley <lb/>
continually exalts the <hi rend="italic">Erdgeist</hi> and deprecates the <lb/>
claim of superior interest in human nature, she <lb/>
still is sufficiently under the influence of the latter <lb/>
to speak more fully of man than of matter. The <lb/>
aborigines clearly interested her more than their <lb/>
haunts, and she tells us that "unless you live <lb/>
alone among the natives you never get to know <lb/>
them. If you do this you gradually get a light <lb/>
into the true state of their mind-forest. At first <lb/>
you see nothing but a confused stupidity and <lb/>
crime, but when you get to see&mdash;well, as in the <lb/>
other forest&mdash;you see things worth seeing"; and <lb/>
again, while on Lambarene Island, she says, "Ah <lb/>
<pb n="156" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0201"/>
me! if the aim of life were happiness and pleasure, <lb/>
Africa should send us missionaries instead of our <lb/>
sending them to her."</p>
<p>English women would do well to lay to heart <lb/>
her quaint remarks as to the garments sent out <lb/>
for the use of the natives by the charitable ladies <lb/>
of Europe. "Evidently, part of their opinion of <lb/>
the African figure is that it is very like a tub." <lb/>
Some remarkable specimens that she exhumed from <lb/>
a mission-box were supposed by her to be "frills <lb/>
for palm-oil puncheons," and she at once suggested <lb/>
in her funny way that "a few stuffed negroes <lb/>
should be sent home for distribution in the <reg orig="working-|party">working-party</reg> <lb/>
centres, and then the ladies could try the <lb/>
things on." As the figures of the Lambarene <lb/>
females are in reality quite charming, it is likely <lb/>
that these garments are not as much appreciated <lb/>
as the industry of their creators deserves.</p>
<p>To clothe a woman solely in a cloak consisting <lb/>
of a long flounce depended from a yoke at the <lb/>
shoulders, and dependent on the reliability of <lb/>
chain-stitch machinery, is also an experiment to <lb/>
be avoided. One day in church a child pulled at <lb/>
an end of white cotton which was sticking out <lb/>
from the yoke of a woman garbed in this fashion <lb/>
who was solemnly saying her prayers in front of <lb/>
her, and, naturally, it came out by the yard. You <lb/>
foresee the result: "When the unconscious victim <lb/>
rose from her devotions the whole of what might <lb/>
<pb n="157" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0202"/>
be called the practical part of her attire subsided <lb/>
on to the floor."</p>
<p>No wonder that, as she says in another place, <lb/>
"half the African ingratitude is really not so very <lb/>
bad, for half the time you have been asking him <lb/>
to be grateful to you for doing to, or giving, him <lb/>
things he does not care a row of pins about."</p>
<p>Her ascent of the peak of the Cameroons was <lb/>
a marvellous business, and, though the beautiful <lb/>
view which she had hoped to get was blotted out <lb/>
by the mist and the rain, she had the satisfaction <lb/>
of feeling that she was only the "third <reg orig="English-|man">Englishman</reg>" <lb/>
to surmount all the difficulties of the way, <lb/>
and the twenty-eighth ascender all told.</p>
<p>After adding a few stones to the cairn at the <lb/>
top, and leaving her visiting-card upon the "King <lb/>
of the Mountain," Mungo Ma Lobeh, she made <lb/>
her way down through a raging hurricane, and <lb/>
two days later arrived safely at Victoria, "looking <lb/>
even more lovely than ever in the dying light of <lb/>
the crimson sunset, with all its dark shadows <lb/>
among the hills begemmed with countless fireflies; <lb/>
heard the soft rush of the Lukola river, and the <lb/>
sound of the sea-surf on the rocks, and the <reg orig="tom-|tomming">tom-tomming</reg> <lb/>
and singing of the natives all matching <lb/>
and mingling together. 'Why did I come to <lb/>
Africa?' thought I. Why! Who would not <lb/>
come to its twin - brother hell itself for all the <lb/>
beauty and the charm of it?"</p>
<pb n="158" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0203"/>
<p>Even of the equatorial climate she has <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
good to say, in spite of hosts of red ants, <lb/>
mosquitoes as the sand of the sea for multitude, <lb/>
crocodiles, wild beasts, and "wet seasons," which <lb/>
recurred with most unseasonable frequency.</p>
<p>It must have been a treat to have heard a <lb/>
discussion between Mary Kingsley and Dr Nansen <lb/>
as to the respective delights of the Poles and the <lb/>
Tropics. The beauty of the Arctic night had no <lb/>
charms for her, in spite of all that he could say <lb/>
in its favour. A place where "the temperature <lb/>
was goodness knows what below zero, no soap, <lb/>
no wood for fire," seemed to her a place of horror <lb/>
indeed; while the gallant Swede, in his turn, <lb/>
regarded her as "a sort of devoted martyr for <lb/>
going to the Equator, and adopted a sympathetic <lb/>
kind of tone about fever, &amp;c., to my extreme <lb/>
amazement. It was positively comic to see how <lb/>
we both regarded our own individual region as <lb/>
a kind of almshouse, but each held the other's <lb/>
region in an awesome respect."</p>
<p>Yet she was not blindly indifferent to the climatic <lb/>
perils of which she spoke so light-heartedly. One <lb/>
of the last, if not the last, of her public <reg orig="appear-|ances">appearances</reg> <lb/>
was at the Livingstone Exhibition held at <lb/>
St Martin's Town Hall, Charing Cross, in January <lb/>
1900, when, in an address full of wit and humour, <lb/>
she took the opportunity of pleading most earnestly <lb/>
for the establishing of a Hospital Ship on the deadly <lb/>
<pb n="159" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0204"/>
West African coast, where malarial fever works its <lb/>
wicked will almost unhindered.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards she left England again, <hi rend="italic">en <lb/>
route</hi> for the great forests and mighty rivers <lb/>
which for her had such an absorbing fascination. <lb/>
"I wander always, and wander I always will, as <lb/>
long as there is a fresh bit of the world to see," <lb/>
Dr Kingsley had said; and the hereditary <reg orig="in-|stinct">instinct</reg> <lb/>
of travelling was strong in his daughter <lb/>
as she started once more "to learn the tropics."</p>
<p>Not as an amateur nurse did she "break the <lb/>
journey" at Simonstown, but with just an <reg orig="un-|selfish">unselfish</reg> <lb/>
longing to <hi rend="italic">do something</hi> in aid of the <lb/>
wounded. Very gladly was her offer of service <lb/>
accepted, and very helpful must have been her <lb/>
powers of organisation and human sympathy. <lb/>
Originally she had thought of being a doctor, <lb/>
and her long training in a sick-room ensured her <lb/>
a warm welcome from the overworked officials at <lb/>
the hospital&mdash;though she had no credentials as to <lb/>
fitness, no certificate to present upon arriving.</p>
<p>She worked hard, we may be sure&mdash;it was not <lb/>
possible to her to work otherwise,&mdash;but only, as <lb/>
it were, for a day. By a strange irony of fate, <lb/>
she who had lived triumphantly through the <lb/>
worst dangers of the West Coast&mdash;climatic and <lb/>
cannibalistic &mdash; succumbed to the effects of an <lb/>
operation, incidental to an attack of typhoid <lb/>
fever, on the 3rd of June 1900. In the healthy <lb/>
<pb n="160" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0205"/>
South, whither so many have gone to regain the <lb/>
vigour which they had lost at home, she who <lb/>
had done and suffered so much for others laid <lb/>
down the life of which she had made such <reg orig="valu-|able">valuable</reg> <lb/>
use, and suffered the crowning tragedy of <lb/>
so many gracious lives, in dying with her work <lb/>
unaccomplished.</p>
<p>Mary Kingsley had all the modesty which <reg orig="be-|longs">belongs</reg> <lb/>
to real worth. She owed all her infinite <lb/>
charm to her expression and manner, for her face <lb/>
in repose was not even pleasing. But then it <lb/>
was hardly ever in repose, so that such a criticism <lb/>
goes for nothing. Though somewhat reticent in <lb/>
her public utterances, she was a brilliant and <lb/>
delightful conversationalist. Everything interested <lb/>
her, and to be dull when she was in the room <lb/>
was impossible. She had all the humour and <lb/>
many - sidedness of her father's nature, mingled <lb/>
with the overflowing kindliness and sympathy <lb/>
that characterised her mother.</p>
<p>When speaking or smiling she was irresistibly <lb/>
attractive, and though her curious inability to <lb/>
sound the letter <hi rend="italic">h</hi> was at first rather <reg orig="disconcert-|ing">disconcerting</reg>, <lb/>
it was soon forgotten. The omission failed <lb/>
to jar, and became at last almost a distinctive <lb/>
peculiarity rather than a grammatical error.</p>
<p>"I simply can't pronounce the letter <hi rend="italic">h</hi>," was <lb/>
her own quaint explanation; but, <reg orig="notwithstand-|ing">notwithstanding</reg> <lb/>
this strange defect, she was "a lady to <lb/>
<pb n="161" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0206"/>
her finger - tips," as a dainty friend of ours <reg orig="ex-|pressed">expressed</reg> <lb/>
it.</p>
<p>Her conversation was brimming over with fun&mdash; <lb/>
an endless stream of anecdote and humour, like <lb/>
her books. In fact, her books give an excellent <lb/>
idea of her mental characteristics: wit and wisdom, <lb/>
the graceful and the grotesque, are constantly to <lb/>
be found side by side, and we rise from reading <lb/>
them full of admiring wonder and a secret <reg orig="long-|ing">longing</reg> <lb/>
to have had some share in the experiences <lb/>
which she describes.</p>
<p>The "stinging and bitterly cheerful irony" on <lb/>
which one of her reviewers comments was due <lb/>
more to her brilliantly incisive manner of <reg orig="speak-|ing">speaking</reg> <lb/>
than to any real misanthropy or lack of <lb/>
feeling. Originality of expression is often <reg orig="mis-|taken">mistaken</reg> <lb/>
for affectation; but did the Palace of Truth <lb/>
exist as an English dwelling-house and not only <lb/>
as a "castle in Spain," it would be found that people <lb/>
really have some ideas of their own, occasionally, <lb/>
which they consistently stultify; lest, forsooth, they <lb/>
should be accused of being "eccentric" or peculiar. <lb/>
Any such cowardly attitude was impossible to the <lb/>
daughter of a man like George Kingsley, of whom <lb/>
her verdict is that "he never did a mean act <lb/>
or thought a mean thought, and never felt a <lb/>
fear."</p>
<p>The little sealskin cap was the invariable centre <lb/>
of every gathering, simply because of its wearer's <lb/>
<pb n="162" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0207"/>
vivid personality, her sparkling and racy way of <lb/>
describing things, and her unusual adaptability. <lb/>
All those who knew her best would endorse the <lb/>
words of the 'Morning Post,' which calls her "a <lb/>
woman at once learned and humorous, adventurous <lb/>
and wise."</p>
<p>One more scene yet remains for us to describe, <lb/>
and then our brief study of Mary Kingsley must <lb/>
close. By her own express wish she was buried <lb/>
at sea; and on the day following Whit-Sunday, <lb/>
June 4, the sad procession moved down the main <lb/>
street of Simonstown, headed by the band of the <lb/>
West Yorkshire Regiment. Arrived at the town <lb/>
pier, the body was placed on Torpedo Boat No. <lb/>
29, and then slowly they steamed out beyond Cape <lb/>
Point and committed it to the deep&mdash;the rector of <lb/>
Simonstown, as military chaplain, officiating.</p>
<p>No better description of the scene could be given <lb/>
than that which her father gives of a burial at sea; <lb/>
and there seems a strange fitness that he should, as <lb/>
it were, finish her life-story for us.</p>
<p>"All hats off; a dead silence; even the ship <lb/>
hardly making a sound; a gentle cheeping of <lb/>
blocks and gurgling of water, more like a hush <lb/>
than a noise; all quiet except the ship's bell <lb/>
jarring on the silence once a minute. Bright <lb/>
glorious sun. The voice of the chaplain sounding <lb/>
strangely distinct in the stillness."</p>
<p>As the deeply impressive words, "We therefore <lb/>
<pb n="163" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0208"/>
commit her body to the deep, to be turned into <lb/>
corruption, looking for the resurrection of the <lb/>
body &lpar;when the sea shall give up her dead&rpar; and <lb/>
the life of the world to come," were uttered, the <lb/>
body was reverently lowered &mdash; one light splash, <lb/>
and then in the mystery of those dark - blue <lb/>
waves they left her&mdash;alone!</p>
<p>Mr Harland's testimony in 'Folk - Lore' is as <lb/>
eloquent as it is sincere: "All phrases seem cold <lb/>
when we think of her. Her insight into the <lb/>
mind of the West African native, and her bold <lb/>
and humorous advocacy of careful study of, and <lb/>
rational treatment for, him had hardly begun to <lb/>
impress the powers that be in the political and <lb/>
religious worlds. A band of friends are seeking <lb/>
to fulfil that task. To do so will be to <reg orig="per-|petuate">perpetuate</reg> <lb/>
in the worthiest way, the way she <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
would have wished, the memory and the aims <lb/>
of one of the noblest among women."</p>

<ornament type="line"/>
<p>"<hi rend="small-caps">My</hi> life might be put into an epigram," said <lb/>
Charles Lamb, and the same might be said of <lb/>
Adelaide Anne Procter, so uneventful was her <lb/>
short and saintly life.</p>
<p>Her father, W. P. Procter, under the pseudonym <lb/>
of "Barry Cornwall," was well known as a writer, <lb/>
when in 1825 his "well-beloved firstborn" was <lb/>
born. His legal training accentuated an <reg orig="instinct-|ive">instinctive</reg> <lb/>
dislike for "hazy horizons," and probably <lb/>
narrowed his mental outlook; but his personality <lb/>
was full of charm, as is evinced by the troops of <lb/>
friends who rejoiced continually in his company.</p>
<p>Carlyle, in his 'Reminiscences,' gives us one of <lb/>
his word-pictures of Barry Cornwall at this time: <lb/>
"A decidedly rather pretty little fellow, Procter, <lb/>
bodily and spiritually; manners prepossessing, <lb/>
slightly London elegant, not unpleasant; clear <lb/>
judgment in him, though of narrow field; a sound <lb/>
honourable morality, and airy friendly ways; of <lb/>
slight neat figure, vigorous for his size; fine, <lb/>
<pb n="168" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0215"/>
genially rugged little face; fine head; something <lb/>
curiously dreamy in the eyes of him,&mdash;had <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
of real fun, and was always good and <lb/>
kind."</p>
<p>After his marriage in 1824 with Anne Skepper, <lb/>
the only child of Mrs Basil Montagu by her first <lb/>
husband, the young couple returned to her <reg orig="step-|father's">stepfather's</reg> <lb/>
house in Bedford Square, and there in the <lb/>
following year the little Adelaide was born.</p>
<p>Fanny Kemble mentions that in 1832, at one of <lb/>
the delightful receptions that formed part of the <lb/>
daily life in the Montagu <hi rend="italic">m&eacute;nage</hi>, she had enjoyed <lb/>
a chat with Mrs Procter, "one of the <reg orig="kindest-|hearted">kindest-hearted</reg> <lb/>
people possible." She talked a great deal <lb/>
about Adelaide, who, says Miss Kemble, "must be <lb/>
a most wonderful creature." So it is clear that the <lb/>
beautiful little girl, who looked "as if she knew <lb/>
that she was a poet's child," must have displayed <lb/>
her unusual gifts at a very early age. In this year <lb/>
Barry Cornwall made his farewell to poetry, in a <lb/>
volume of songs, and was made Commissioner in <lb/>
Lunacy,&mdash;an office which he held with <reg orig="extraordin-|ary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
success until 1861, when the witchery of <reg orig="Writ-|ing">Writing</reg> <lb/>
seems once more to have asserted its sway, <lb/>

and betaking himself to the study of Shakespeare, <lb/>
Lamb, and others, he published several prose works <lb/>
with more or less success.</p>
<p>Few have enjoyed the friendship of so many men <lb/>
whose names are still of world - wide notoriety. <lb/>
<pb n="169" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0216"/>
Scarcely a man could be mentioned among those <lb/>
who distinguished themselves in the early literature <lb/>
of the nineteenth century who had not the entr&eacute;e <lb/>
of his hospitable home.</p>
<p>Byron and Peel were Harrovian schoolfellows, <lb/>
while Lamb and Coleridge, Lytton, Campbell, De <lb/>
Quincey, Macaulay, Macready, Scott, Landor, <lb/>
Edward Irving, Hood, Hunt, Rossetti, Arnold, <lb/>
Browning, and Tennyson are only a few of the <lb/>
many eminent men whom Barry Cornwall could <lb/>
number among his friends.</p>
<p>Though the father and mother of Adelaide Anne <lb/>
Procter were Protestants, it is somewhat <reg orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
that three of their four daughters became <lb/>
Roman Catholics, and it is no less remarkable <lb/>
that the happiness of the family does not seem <lb/>
to have been impaired thereby. It is probable <lb/>
that to the gentle dignity of the mother, whose <lb/>
love never wavered, was largely due the harmony <lb/>
of the household,&mdash;for it is certain that sympathy <lb/>
must be difficult between those who are, <reg orig="respect-|ively">respectively</reg>, <lb/>
staunch adherents to sects opposed to each <lb/>
other in so many doctrines which each considers <lb/>
fundamental.</p>
<p>Where the chiefest interest of Time and of <lb/>
Eternity is not one in which members of a family <lb/>
are at union, there must of necessity be a certain <lb/>
restraint; and it speaks well for the loving <reg orig="tactful-|ness">tactfulness</reg> <lb/>
of all, that nothing was allowed to disturb the <lb/>
<pb n="170" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0217"/>
family loyalty or to mar the daily comfort of its <lb/>
home life.</p>
<p>No doubt religious questions must have been <lb/>
often discussed in a circle where men and women <lb/>
of such various views met in friendly intercourse, <lb/>
and it is probable that the young people felt many <lb/>
unspoken difficulties in realising the elastic nature <lb/>
of Anglicanism, and in reconciling points of doctrine <lb/>
which have always been stumbling-blocks, and upon <lb/>
which even theologians have agreed to differ.</p>
<p>Not a few have been induced by the unfortunate <lb/>
dissensions within the English Church to settle the <lb/>
matter, as they think, by joining the only Church <lb/>
which claims infallibility. The "ever generous, <lb/>
loving, and noble" Edward Irving would think it <lb/>
his duty to declaim upon "the gift of tongues"; <lb/>
such strict "one Goddites" as Coleridge and Lamb, <lb/>
Hazlitt and Hunt, would fain have won recruits for <lb/>
their "reasonable" unorthodoxy; and the various <lb/>
religious opinions of the many interesting visitors <lb/>
must surely have been a fruitful source of <reg orig="conversa-|tion">conversation</reg>, <lb/>
while the musical and artistic temperaments <lb/>
of the sisters would no doubt insensibly incline them <lb/>
towards a Church in which the Poetry of religion is <lb/>
conspicuously apparent.</p>
<p>"Of all priesthoods, there is no class comparable <lb/>
for its importance to the priesthood of the writers <lb/>
of books," says Carlyle, and of this class of priests <lb/>
Adelaide Anne Procter and her sisters must have <lb/>
<pb n="171" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0218"/>
seen many of the best specimens; but the delights <lb/>
of literature were not sufficing enough for hearts <lb/>
that longed restlessly for "more light," and one by <lb/>
one they flung their weakness into the strength of <lb/>
the Roman Church, where, like Mary Howitt, whose <lb/>
Quaker upbringing renders her secession the more <lb/>
remarkable, they found all that they had longed for <lb/>
in their youthful dreams. We are told, however, <lb/>
that the one thing never mentioned by Miss Procter <lb/>
was her own change of views; and with a nature <lb/>
like hers, it did indeed matter but little to what <lb/>
creed her intellect subscribed, for her heart was <lb/>
right with God, and her life-work speaks for itself.</p>
<p>Before she was able to write, Charles Dickens <lb/>
tells us, in his touching sketch of her life, prefacing <lb/>
the second volume of 'Legends and Lyrics,' that <lb/>
she had her favourite poems copied into a tiny <lb/>
album by her mother, and was accustomed to carry <lb/>
them about with the devotion which at that age is <lb/>
generally given to dolls only.</p>
<p>And this devotion to poetry never decreased, <lb/>
though for many years her own compositions seem <lb/>
to have been a delight to herself only and to some <lb/>
of her most intimate friends. In the early 'Fifties <lb/>
typewriters and duplicating machines were <reg orig="un-|known">unknown</reg>, <lb/>
and her sweet verses were copied from <lb/>
hand to hand &mdash; a laborious but loving testimony <lb/>
to their charm and adaptability. In 1843 she <reg orig="con-|tributed">contributed</reg> <lb/>
some verses to 'The Book of Beauty,' but <lb/>
<pb n="172" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0219"/>
not until 1853 did she think of appealing to the <lb/>
suffrages of a larger audience, and it was as an <lb/>
anonymous contributor that she then offered a <lb/>
"short poem" to the editor of 'Household Words.' <lb/>
Although the name of Dickens is connected in the <lb/>
minds of most people with such creations as <reg orig="Pick-|wick">Pickwick</reg>, <lb/>
Pecksniff, and Sarah Gamp, there was in <lb/>
the great novelist that intense capacity for pathos <lb/>
which invariably accompanies a strong sense of <lb/>
humour, and without which, indeed, humour at its <lb/>
best is wellnigh impossible.</p>
<p>Editing in those days was not so onerous a <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg> <lb/>
as it is now, when every one who can, or cannot, <lb/>
turn a sentence or be happy enough to fix up a <lb/>
rhyme, would fain rush into print, and when every <lb/>
post brings with it shoals of manuscripts to the <lb/>
offices of even the least important papers.</p>
<p>"Miss Berwick's" poem at once appealed to <lb/>
Dickens, and he recognised that here at last was <lb/>
something "very different," and possessing much <lb/>
more merit than the average contributions of <lb/>
would - be poets. A continuous correspondence <lb/>
passed between them, but "Miss Berwick" was <lb/>
as much of a personal mystery to the editor of <lb/>
'Household Words' as "Currer Bell" had been <lb/>
to her publishers in 1847.</p>
<p>For eighteen months this went on, until in the <lb/>
winter of 1854 the truth came out.</p>
<p>Charles Dickens was an old friend of W. P. Procter, <lb/>
<pb n="173" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0220"/>
and, when dining with him just before Christmas, <lb/>
the two naturally began talking about 'Household <lb/>
Words,' which was then at the zenith of its <reg orig="popu-|larity">popularity</reg>. <lb/>
Incidentally Dickens mentioned that the <lb/>
current number contained some very pretty verses <lb/>
by a Miss Berwick.</p>
<p>Nothing further was said at the time, but on <lb/>
the following day he received a letter containing a <lb/>
statement which caused him no little surprise, to <lb/>
the effect that the name had been adopted by <lb/>
Barry Cornwall's eldest daughter, in order that <lb/>
she might obtain an honest opinion as to the merit <lb/>
of her writings. Wire-pulling was an impossibility <lb/>
to her, and "a friend at court" almost a treachery <lb/>
to the public, from her high-minded point of view; <lb/>
so she had determined to conceal her identity, and <lb/>
to stand or fall as an "unknown volunteer." This <lb/>
is by no means a solitary instance of literary <reg orig="in-|dependence">independence</reg>; <lb/>
but in these days there is too often <lb/>
a tendency to apportion praise or blame according <lb/>
to the status of the man rather than according to <lb/>
the value of the matter, and much that would be <lb/>
better left unpublished is palmed off upon the <lb/>
public by virtue of a previous success, or the <lb/>
weight of some unseen but powerful influence.</p>
<p>It was against such a possibility that Miss <lb/>
Procter so effectively guarded herself, and we <lb/>
cannot but admire the self-reliance and honesty <lb/>
of purpose which actuated her little scheme.</p>
<pb n="174" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0221"/>
<p>When in 1858 her collected poems were <reg orig="pub-|lished">published</reg> <lb/>
under the title of 'Legends and Lyrics,' <lb/>
there was an immediate rush for the book, and so <lb/>
great was its popularity that she was soon the <reg orig="best-|read">best-read</reg> <lb/>
poet in England, with the exception of Alfred <lb/>
Tennyson. No less than twelve editions followed <lb/>
one another, and her success was complete. Miss <lb/>
Procter had joined the Roman communion in 1851, <lb/>
but there is no tinge of what has been called a <lb/>
"persecuting and privileged orthodoxy" in her <lb/>
poems. They have penetrated into many schools <lb/>
and families without raising any alarm in the most <lb/>
ultra-Protestant parent or guardian, for doctrine is <lb/>
never dragged into them; and though here and <lb/>
there in the Legends we can trace the influence <lb/>
of Romish teachings and traditions, they are so <lb/>
beautifully told, and the lesson of them all is so <lb/>
definitely to "do justly, to love mercy, and to <lb/>
walk humbly," that they appeal to the most <reg orig="puri-|tanical">puritanical</reg>. <lb/>
We are told by Dickens and by Madame <lb/>
Belloc &lpar;both intimate friends&rpar; that Adelaide Anne <lb/>
Procter "bubbled over" with wit and irony, but <lb/>
there are no signs of either characteristic in her <lb/>
writings. They are full of sympathy and <reg orig="tender-|ness">tenderness</reg>, <lb/>
and there is no morbid or maudlin sentiment <lb/>
about them, but equally they are destitute of all <lb/>
mirthfulness, and her muse is at its best when <lb/>
singing of Home and Heaven and Love. The tide <lb/>
of her poetry "sets ever towards Eternity."</p>
<pb n="175" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0222"/>
<p>Clifford Harrison incorporated several of her <lb/>
longer poems into his <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;pertoire</hi>, and no one <lb/>
who heard him recite "The Story of a Faithful <lb/>
Soul" will forget the chilling effect with which <lb/>
he rendered the dramatic verses which precede <lb/>
the triumphant finale.</p>
<p>The Legends have a special charm of their own, <lb/>
but it is upon her Lyrics that her popularity will <lb/>
abidingly rest. The works of many greater writers <lb/>
will stand upon the bookshelves, almost unread <lb/>
save for selfish motives&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Calculating profits; so much help</l>
<l>By so much reading"&mdash;</l>
</lg></q>
but a goodly company will for many years plunge <lb/>
"soul-forward" into her volumes, and find therein <lb/>
a spell for relieving heartache, and a reflection of <lb/>
their moods as in a looking-glass.</p>
<p>Her keen knowledge of human nature is not the <lb/>
result of morbid self-dissection, but inspired by a <lb/>
wide sympathy and an innately loving fellowship <lb/>
that has gauged sorrow, and knows that in "some <lb/>
far bright to-morrow" our treasures are living yet <lb/>
&mdash;saved from sin's pollution&mdash;held in faithful <reg orig="keep-|ing">keeping</reg> <lb/>

<p>The land of far distances was very near to her at <lb/>
all times, and she seems to have caught something <lb/>
of its spirit. We all know the undefinable <reg orig="atmo-|sphere">atmosphere</reg> <lb/>
that surrounds certain personalities&mdash;it is <lb/>
indescribable, but <hi rend="italic">it is there.</hi> A subtle influence <lb/>
emanates from them, and harsh voices grow sweeter, <lb/>
earth's vexations more bearable in their presence. <lb/>
That is just the spell which the poetry of Adelaide <lb/>
Anne Procter possesses. There is no profundity of <lb/>
expression, no varied imagery, no catching refrains, <lb/>
but the common-places of life gleam into beauty, <lb/>
and every theme is burnished as with a touch of <lb/>
sunlight.</p>
<p>Of the legends, perhaps the most perfect in <reg orig="con-|struction">construction</reg> <lb/>
and musical thought is the "Legend of <lb/>
Provence"&mdash;the story of a novice who, during one <lb/>
of the French wars, was given the charge of a <lb/>
knight whose "wounds were painful, but whose <lb/>
danger slight." The beautiful convent-bred girl is <lb/>
fascinated by his stories of the world outside, and <lb/>
when the knight leaves the convent he does not go <lb/>
alone. Poor Angela, who has given up all for <lb/>
love, soon finds herself forsaken amid the dangers <lb/>
of a cruel city, and the glories which he had painted <lb/>
fade into the misery of a cold bleak world which <lb/>
knows no pity for an outcast. After long years, <lb/>
when her face had lost all trace of the pure happy <lb/>
girl who was known as the novice Angela, she <lb/>
determines to make her way back to the white <lb/>
<pb n="178" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0225"/>
convent in the hawthorn wood. She rang the <lb/>
bell, and laid her weary head against the iron <lb/>
bars until the pitying portress should open the <lb/>
gate,&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"But what soft voice was that which sounded near,</l>
<l>And stirred strange trouble at her heart to hear?</l>
<l>She raised her head; she saw&mdash;she seemed to know&mdash;</l>
<l>A face that came from long, long years ago:</l>
<l>Herself; yet not as when she fled away</l>
<l>The young and blooming novice, fair and gay,</l>
<l>But a grave woman, gentle and serene.</l>
<l>The outcast knew it&mdash;<hi rend="italic">what she might have been.</hi></l>
<l>But as she gazed and gazed, a radiance bright</l>
<l>Filled all the place with strange and sudden light;</l>
<l>The Nun was there no longer, but instead,</l>
<l>A figure with a circle round its head,</l>
<l>A ring of glory; and a face so meek,</l>
<l>So soft and tender. &hellip; Angela strove to speak,</l>
<l>And stretched her hands out, crying, 'Mary mild,</l>
<l>Mother of mercy, help me!&mdash;help your child.'</l>
<l>And Mary answered, 'From thy bitter past,</l>
<l>Welcome, my child! oh, welcome home at last!</l>
<l>I filled thy place. Thy flight is known to none,</l>
<l>For all thy daily duties I have done&mdash;</l>
<l>Gathered thy flowers, and prayed, and sung, and slept;</l>
<l>Didst thou not know, poor child, <hi rend="italic">thy place was kept?</hi></l>
<l>Kind hearts are here; yet would the tenderest one</l>
<l>Have limits to its mercy: God has none.</l>
<l>And man's forgiveness may be true and sweet,</l>
<l>But yet he stoops to give it. More complete</l>
<l>Is Love that lays forgiveness at thy feet,</l>
<l>And pleads with thee to raise it. Only Heaven</l>

<l>Back hurried Sister Monica; but where</l>
<l>Was the poor beggar she left lying there?</l>
<l>Gone; and she searched in vain, and sought the place</l>
<l>For that wan woman with the piteous face;</l>
<l>But only Angela at the gateway stood,</l>
<l>Laden with hawthorn blossoms from the wood."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<pb n="179" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0226"/>
<p>When on her deathbed she told them all her <lb/>
tale&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"Then clear, low and calm,</l>
<l>'Praise God for me, my sisters,' and the psalm</l>
<l>Rang up to Heaven, far and clear and wide,</l>
<l>Again and yet again, then sank and died;</l>
<l>While her white face had such a smile of peace,</l>
<l>They saw she never heard the music cease.</l>
<l>And weeping sisters laid her in her tomb,</l>
<l>Crowned with a wreath of perfumed hawthorn bloom."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>And thus the legend ends,&mdash;the sweet epilogue <lb/>
rounding it&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">

<l>No star is ever lost we once have seen,&mdash;</l>
<l>We always may be what we might have been."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Such poetry as this is always sure of a welcome. <lb/>
The simplest can read its lesson, the most <reg orig="culti-|vated">cultivated</reg> <lb/>
can feel its charm.</p>
<p>In 1853, Fanny Kemble in her 'Recollections' <lb/>
mentions that she was on the eve of escorting Miss <lb/>
Procter to Italy, where the latter was going on a <lb/>
visit to her aunt, Madame de Viry. Between the <lb/>
two travellers there would seem to have been little <lb/>
or no sympathy, for, as Fanny Kemble na&iuml;vely says, <lb/>
"I do not think that she will like me any better <lb/>
when she knows me better."</p>
<p>They were a strangely dissimilar pair truly, but <lb/>
the affection of the actress for Mr and Mrs Procter, <lb/>
and Adelaide's own sweetness of character, made a <lb/>
pleasant journey possible for them both.</p>
<pb n="180" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0227"/>
<p>This year in Italy must have been full of <reg orig="en-|chantment">enchantment</reg> <lb/>
for the gentle poet, and her letters <lb/>
home are full of vivid word-pictures, while many <lb/>
of her poems were doubtless written at this <lb/>
time.</p>
<p>Every womanly woman is at heart a <reg orig="philanthro-|pist">philanthropist</reg>, <lb/>
and Adelaide Anne Procter was no exception <lb/>
to the rule. She was too innately good and <reg orig="un-|selfish">unselfish</reg> <lb/>
to be regardless of the manifold sufferings <lb/>
of humanity. The Association for the Promotion <lb/>
of Social Science had been but recently established <lb/>
when she was elected a member of its Committee, <lb/>
with a view to providing employment for the <lb/>
women of the metropolis. Into this scheme she <lb/>
threw herself with all the ready sympathy of her <lb/>
warm heart, and, with her co-workers, she did her <lb/>
utmost to stem the tide of unemployed women <lb/>
that was flooding the London streets with misery <lb/>
and sin.</p>
<p>The Committee was composed of an equal <reg orig="num-|ber">number</reg> <lb/>
of ladies and gentlemen who were chosen on <lb/>
account of their practical knowledge of, and <reg orig="inter-|est">interest</reg> <lb/>
in, the scheme:&mdash;</p>

<p>Under their auspices the "Victoria Press" was <lb/>
opened in 1860&mdash;printing having been chosen as <lb/>
an employment singularly suitable for women,&mdash;and <lb/>
in the following year it was suggested that a <lb/>
special volume should be published as a specimen <lb/>
of the choice work which they were able to execute. <lb/>
This suggestion resulted in the production in 1861 of <lb/>
'Victoria Regia,' which was dedicated by "special <lb/>
permission" to the Queen, who from the first had <lb/>
taken much interest in the undertaking. It was <lb/>
published by Emily Faithfull &amp; Co., and to Miss <lb/>
Procter was deputed the task of its editing. To this <lb/>
volume no less than fifty-five other distinguished <lb/>
writers in prose and verse contributed; but one of <lb/>
the most beautiful poems therein contained is her <lb/>
own "Links with Heaven," which we here insert.</p>
<div3 type="poem" id="d27">
<lg type="stanza">
<head>I.</head>
<l>"Our God in Heaven, from that holy place</l>

<head>III.</head>
<l>How can she sin? Our hearts may be unheeding&mdash;</l>

<l rend="indent">And thrust those little angel hands aside?</l>

<pb n="182" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0229"/>
<lg type="stanza">
<head>IV.</head>
<l>Those little hands stretched down to draw her ever</l>
<l rend="indent">Nearer to God by mother love: we all</l>
<l>Are blind and weak,&mdash;yet surely She can never,</l>
<l rend="indent">With such a stake in Heaven, fail or fall.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<head>V.</head>
<l>She knows that when the mighty Angels raise</l>
<l rend="indent">Chorus in Heaven, one little silver tone</l>
<l>Is hers for ever&mdash;that one little praise,</l>
<l rend="indent">One little happy voice is all her own.</l>
</lg>

<head>VI.</head>
<l>We may not see her sacred crown of honour,</l>
<l rend="indent">But all the angels flitting to and fro</l>
<l>Pause smiling as they pass&mdash;they look upon her</l>
<l rend="indent">As Mother of an angel whom they know,</l>

<head>VII.</head>
<l>One whom they left nestled at Mary's feet&mdash;</l>
<l rend="indent">The children's place in Heaven&mdash;who softly sings</l>
<l>A little chant to please them, slow and sweet,</l>
<l rend="indent">And smiling strokes their little folded wings.</l>

<l>Or gives them her white lilies or her beads</l>

<head>IX.</head>
<l>Then our dear Queen makes answer&mdash;they may call</l>

<head>X.</head>
<l>Ah! Saints in Heaven may pray with earnest will</l>

<p>With the feverish energy that so often <reg orig="char-|acterises">characterises</reg> <lb/>
consumptive patients, she spared herself <lb/>
no fatigue in prosecuting her charitable schemes. <lb/>
The expostulations of friends were all in vain. <lb/>
As if knowing that the time was short, she heeded <lb/>
no warnings, but worked on at her self-imposed <lb/>
duties until nature took its last revenge, and she <lb/>
was laid aside for ever.</p>
<p>For fifteen months she never left her room, <lb/>
though she only took to her bed a few days <lb/>

before the end. Her great delight was to be <lb/>
talked to. Conversation would often have been <lb/>
far too tiring, but for hours she could listen <reg orig="un-|weariedly">unweariedly</reg>, <lb/>
and partially forget her pain. Like <lb/>
her mother and grandmother, she was scrupulously <lb/>
dainty in all her personal habits; and, with her <lb/>
pretty fluffy hair tastefully arranged under a little <lb/>
cap, and a pale blue bed-jacket, the sick-chamber <lb/>
was bereft of half its terrors, while her <reg orig="cheerful-|ness">cheerfulness</reg> <lb/>
was a source of wondering admiration to <lb/>
those who witnessed it.</p>
<p>Such a pathetically short life! Only a few years <lb/>
in which to reap the fame that was universally <lb/>
accorded to her, and then the daily increasing <lb/>
weariness of consumption, the hacking cough, the <lb/>
long months of patient suffering, and the <reg orig="triumph-|ant">triumphant</reg> <lb/>
yet peaceful passing into the Silent Land.</p>
<p>It was on Candlemas Day, Feb. 2, 1864, that <lb/>
the struggle for life ended, and the laboured <lb/>
<pb n="184" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0231"/>
breathing ceased. Just before the end, she looked <lb/>
up at her mother and said, "Mamma, has it <lb/>
come?" "Yes, my dear," was the heart-broken <lb/>
reply, as the loving arms clasped the poor fragile <lb/>
body in a last embrace, and the gentle spirit of <lb/>
Adelaide Anne Procter passed away into "joy so <lb/>
pure, so mighty, so eternal," as human <reg orig="understand-|ing">understanding</reg> <lb/>
cannot even imagine.</p>
<p>The Love of which she had sung so sweetly <lb/>
was with her to the end; and, amid masses of <lb/>
snowdrops, she lay as if lulled to sleep by the <lb/>
"beautiful Angel Death," until the snowy <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
when her sorrowing friends followed her to <lb/>
the quiet grave in Kensal Green Cemetery. There <lb/>
the ivy planted by her mother's hands still grows <lb/>
thickly, and in "the far-off skies" father, mother, <lb/>
sisters, brother, have met once more.</p>

<head><hi rend="bold">MARIANNE NORTH.</hi></head>
<ornament type="line"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> is difficult to know from which standpoint to <lb/>
view the subject of our present paper.</p>
<p>The versatility of her talents is somewhat <reg orig="re-|markable">remarkable</reg>, <lb/>
and whether as traveller, artist, botanist, <lb/>
or singer, she was equally conspicuous for her <lb/>
strong individuality and thorough knowledge of <lb/>
the subject in hand.</p>
<p>And there was so much of her, too, in every <lb/>
way! Not only mentally but physically, she <lb/>
could give points to nearly every member of a <lb/>
large gathering, and her tall, commanding, yet <lb/>
graceful figure seemed to dominate both the <lb/>
minds and bodies of those with whom she was <lb/>
brought in contact.</p>
<p>Mr North was member for Hastings for many <lb/>
years, and the house was a rendezvous for people <lb/>
of culture and varied interests.</p>
<p>In those days Hastings was only a fishing <lb/>
village, and though one of the Cinque Ports, <lb/>
scarcely seems to have merited the dignity of a <lb/>
<pb n="188" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0237"/>
member all to itself. It is strange to read of <lb/>
an "Election" which was settled by the ten <lb/>
"Free - men" of the place, and it must surely <lb/>
have been difficult to get up much excitement <lb/>
under such conditions. For thirty-nine years her <lb/>
father represented that borough almost <reg orig="continu-|ously">continuously</reg>, <lb/>
and was indefatigable in his efforts to <lb/>
promote the passing of the Reform Bill and to <lb/>
bring about any change which appeared to be <lb/>
for the good of the country at large.</p>
<p>From a village, Hastings has now developed into <lb/>
a fashionable watering - place, and has to pay the <lb/>
usual penalty of popularity by yearly visitations <lb/>
of trippers, and their accompaniments of negro <lb/>
minstrels and weird noises. Musical glasses and <lb/>
banjo solos now mingle with the song of the <lb/>
wild waves; but in 1830 there was more personal <lb/>
acquaintance between the rich and poor than is <lb/>
possible to-day, and "Muster North and his little <lb/>
gal" were viewed with friendly interest by the <lb/>
fisher folk, as they passed along the beach or <lb/>
stood to watch the unlading of the glittering <lb/>
freights when the fishing-boats came in.</p>
<p>Those were happy days, for the father and <lb/>
daughter were everything to each other. He <lb/>
was her "one idol and friend from first to last," <lb/>
and the "little gal" was so brightly observant <lb/>
that she derived fullest benefit from the constant <lb/>
changes with which fortune supplied her.</p>
<pb n="189" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0238"/>
<p>Of the routine of education she knew little; but <lb/>
the lack of it was more than compensated for by <lb/>
the constant intercourse with her father, who lost <lb/>
no opportunity of improving a mind so ready and <lb/>
willing to improve itself.</p>
<p>A few months at a Norwich boarding - school <lb/>
seemed very long to a girl who had been <reg orig="accus-|tomed">accustomed</reg> <lb/>
to the freedom of home life, and we can <lb/>
well believe that when, in 1847, it was decided <lb/>
that the family should go abroad for three years, <lb/>
the prospect was eagerly welcomed.</p>
<p>Marianne North was seventeen when the whole <lb/>
party&mdash;consisting of the parents, the two daughters, <lb/>
an old governess, and the servants&mdash;migrated to <lb/>
Heidelberg. Her account of that Christmas in <lb/>
Germany is most fascinating; and though France <lb/>
was in a state of turmoil, and all Europe was <lb/>
vibrating with the shock of Revolution, the happy <lb/>
English family were but little troubled by outside <lb/>
matters, and thoroughly enjoyed the variety which <lb/>
their Continental life daily afforded.</p>
<p>An attack of typhoid at Munich in the following <lb/>
year induced Mr North to move on to Starnberg <lb/>
for a short time, in order that Marianne might <reg orig="re-|cover">recover</reg> <lb/>
her strength, and in the country life of that <lb/>
idyllic spot she soon threw off the effects of what <lb/>
might have been a most serious illness.</p>
<p>Starnberg is a sweet village lying at the entrance <lb/>
of the Starnberger &lpar;or W&uuml;rm&rpar; See. In 1848 it <lb/>
<pb n="190" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0239"/>
would be even more beautiful than it is now, <reg orig="be-|cause">because</reg> <lb/>
more primitive and less easy of access. In <lb/>
these days it is within two hours' railway journey <lb/>
of Munich, and about half-way between that town <lb/>
and the picturesque valley where the "World's <lb/>
Tragedy" is represented every ten years by the <lb/>
poetic peasants of Ober-Ammergau.</p>
<p>It was in this lovely little lake that Ludwig&mdash; <lb/>
the mad King of Bavaria &mdash; drowned himself in <lb/>
1886, and to his memory a "Votif Kapelle" was <lb/>
consecrated on its shores, on the fourteenth <lb/>
anniversary of his "Sterbe Tag" in 1900. Every <lb/>
corner of this dainty lakelet is full of interest, and <lb/>
peak above peak in the near distance rise the <lb/>
Bavarian Alps, with the Zug Spitze and the Ettaler <lb/>
Berge lifting their snow-caps above the rest&mdash;even <lb/>
in midsummer.</p>
<p>To-day there are steamers constantly plying from <lb/>
village to village on its banks; but, in 1848, there <lb/>
would seem to have been only little rowing-boats, <lb/>
in which the convalescent could just rest and be <lb/>
thankful, with nothing more exciting than <reg orig="occa-|sional">occasional</reg> <lb/>
fishing and driving expeditions to break <lb/>
the health-giving monotony of the glorious <reg orig="sum-|mer">summer</reg> <lb/>
days.</p>
<p>Mr and Mrs North had intended to winter at <lb/>
Vienna, but the Revolution had spread with great <lb/>
rapidity, and it was found impossible to fulfil that <lb/>
part of their programme. At Dresden it was not <lb/>
<pb n="191" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0240"/>
much better, but there Miss North had the <reg orig="oppor-|tunity">opportunity</reg> <lb/>
of cultivating her beautiful voice under the <lb/>
tuition of Ceccarelli, the chief singer of the King's <lb/>
chapel.</p>
<p>The charm of music would seem to have been the <lb/>
only thing in which father and daughter could not <lb/>
sympathise&mdash;all music being to him "a horrid noise <lb/>
which must be submitted to for the sake of those <lb/>
who like it." It is curious to notice that the <lb/>
father's hatred for music was in the daughter <reg orig="trans-|muted">transmuted</reg> <lb/>
into a hatred for poetry, which she <reg orig="con-|sidered">considered</reg> <lb/>
to be "sense worrited, and often worrit <lb/>
without the sense."</p>
<p>Miss North was able to take every advantage <lb/>
that came in her way, and on her return to England <lb/>
she developed a contralto voice which was beautiful <lb/>
enough to win the rare praise of Miss Sainton, <lb/>
afterwards Madame Sainton - Dolby. It was in <lb/>
England, too, that she gained that knowledge of <lb/>
flower-painting which was to be such a real joy to <lb/>
her in the lonely after-days.</p>
<p>In 1855 Mrs North died, and the old home at <lb/>
Hastings was again for a time broken up. As Mr <lb/>
North quaintly and pathetically expressed it in his <lb/>
diary, "The leader is cut off from the main trunk of <lb/>
our home. No branches, no summer shoots, can <lb/>
take its place, and I feel myself just an old pollard <lb/>
tree."</p>
<p>But the "tree" bore transplanting to <reg orig="West-|minster">Westminster</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="192" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0241"/>
and there, in the haunts of busy London, <lb/>
plans were made for extended journeys. Several of <lb/>
these came to pass; and in Miss North's <reg orig="autobio-|graphy">autobiography</reg> <lb/>
there are hints of delightful visits to <reg orig="Hun-|gary">Hungary</reg>, <lb/>
Switzerland, Egypt, and Spain, which the two <lb/>
daughters and their now venerable father enjoyed to <lb/>
the full. It was at M&uuml;rren that the love-story of <lb/>
John Addington Symonds and Catherine North <lb/>
began, which came to its happy conclusion on the <lb/>
10th of November 1864, when they were married in <lb/>
St Clement's Church, Hastings.</p>
<p>In thirty years the constituents of Hastings had <lb/>
largely increased, and in the election of 1865 Mr <lb/>
North lost his seat by nine votes, which afforded <lb/>
him&mdash;albeit unwillingly&mdash;a leisure time. During <lb/>
many months the devoted father and daughter <lb/>
travelled about&mdash;in Europe, Syria, and Egypt,&mdash; <lb/>
returning to Hastings in 1867.</p>
<p>They then gave all their attention to the <reg orig="im-|provement">improvement</reg> <lb/>
of the "Weedery," which, by their <lb/>
combined efforts, was soon made to blossom as the <lb/>
rose. Loving flowers as she did, it was no wonder <lb/>
that they grew well, and it was her great delight to <lb/>
make colour pictures in unexpected corners, and to <lb/>
watch the gradual development of a quaint <reg orig="old-|world">old-world</reg> <lb/>
garden, where shady nooks were hidden away <lb/>
behind the great bay - trees, and rare orchids <lb/>
bloomed&mdash;a careful joy&mdash;in the glass-house which <lb/>
her father built for their reception.</p>
<pb n="193" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0242"/>
<p>In 1869 came the last journey which they were <lb/>
to make together; and then, on the 29th of <lb/>
October, for him began another and a fairer <reg orig="ex-|perience">experience</reg>, <lb/>
and for her the twenty years of lonely <lb/>
pilgrimage which ended at Alderley in 1890.</p>
<p>To visit the Tropics had often been the desire of <lb/>
both father and daughter; and, though that desire <lb/>
was not able to be realised, we can well imagine <lb/>
that, when invited to the States in the summer of <lb/>
1871, Miss North gladly availed herself of the <lb/>
opportunity thus afforded.</p>
<p>To paint tropical vegetation in the tropics had <lb/>
been a day-dream of long standing, but the precious <lb/>
legacy of her father's constant companionship, left <lb/>
to her by her dying mother, had been too lovingly <lb/>
and loyally guarded for her ever to have thought of <lb/>
accepting any invitation, however tempting, while <lb/>
that dear presence was with her upon earth. But <lb/>
all was changed when he was gone; and, though <lb/>
she had "schooled herself into cheerfulness" for the <lb/>
sake of others, there was now no binding tie to <lb/>
England.</p>
<p>To Canada, therefore, she bent her steps, and <lb/>
after a delightful visit and many experiences, she <lb/>
set sail for the West Indies, where the mango-trees, <lb/>
giant ferns, bignonias, and the tangle of flowers in <lb/>
all their beautiful colourings, filled her with ecstasy. <lb/>
She says in her charming, na&iuml;ve way, "I hardly <lb/>
knew what to paint first." The rich grouping of <lb/>
<pb n="194" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0243"/>
the palms, and the extraordinary greenery of <lb/>
Jamaica, where Nature has done everything and <lb/>
man nothing, delighted her inexpressibly, and many <lb/>
beautiful sketches were the result of her six months' <lb/>
sojourn in that garden island.</p>
<p>But the fever of travel was upon her, and after <lb/>
two months in London, she started in August <lb/>
1872 for Brazil, where the variety of scenery was <lb/>
an hourly revelation; and the trees "draped in <lb/>
bougainvillea," the orange-flowered cassia, and the <lb/>
lovely blue of the marica, were each and all an <lb/>
inspiration for her brush.</p>
<p>"Every bit of the way was <reg orig="interesting&mdash;beauti-|ful">interesting&mdash;beautiful</reg>. <lb/>
Every day's ramble showed me fresh wonders. <lb/>
Did I not paint, and wander, and wonder at <lb/>
everything?"</p>
<p>After spending two winters in the tropics, Miss <lb/>
North found the English climate most trying, and <lb/>
though she weathered the November fogs, she <lb/>
determined to visit Teneriffe, for which she started <lb/>
on New Year's Day, 1875, returning only in time to <lb/>
start for Japan in August of the same year, <hi rend="italic">vi&acirc;</hi> <lb/>
California, the Yosemite Valley, Borneo, and Java, <lb/>
and home again, <hi rend="italic">vi&acirc;</hi> Ceylon and Europe, to London, <lb/>
where she arrived in February 1877. Here the <lb/>
Emperor of Brazil paid her a visit, and showed <lb/>
much interest in the curiosities collected and the <lb/>
paintings made, during her stay in his kingdom.</p>
<p>More than five hundred studies were the result <lb/>
<pb n="195" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0244"/>
of her labours during these six years, and this <lb/>
large number shows with what zeal she must <lb/>
have painted, when we take into account the <lb/>
inevitable delays caused by journeys and social <lb/>
duties.</p>
<p>These paintings were subsequently borrowed for <lb/>
the Kensington Museum by The M'Leod and Mr <lb/>
Thompson, who were much surprised at their <lb/>
variety and talent, having expected only to see <lb/>
the mediocre productions of a lady amateur.</p>
<p>Six months of English life again proved enough <lb/>
for our traveller, and in September she left for <lb/>
India.</p>
<p>Here, as elsewhere, nothing escaped her <reg orig="ob-|servation">observation</reg>. <lb/>
The Hindu and Moslem costumes, <lb/>
customs, and ceremonies, the elaborate carvings <lb/>
and gorgeous colourings, have all a place in her <lb/>
pictures; but in reading a full account of her <lb/>
'Happy Life' we are especially struck by her <lb/>
interest in <hi rend="italic">everything</hi>. To paint trees and flowers <lb/>
may have been the primary object of her incessant <lb/>
journeyings, but no instance either of intelligence <lb/>
or ignorance on the part of the people among <lb/>
whom she temporarily sojourned was unnoticed: <lb/>
every beast, bird, and insect left its image <reg orig="im-|printed">imprinted</reg> <lb/>
upon her mental retina. The forest-studies <lb/>
among the hills were an endless delight, while <lb/>
the cream-coloured balsams, the lovely pale-blue <lb/>
poppies, with their golden centres, growing upon <lb/>
<pb n="196" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0245"/>
brown velvet stems, the giant rhododendrons, <lb/>
hydrangeas, and orchids, and maidenhair ferns <lb/>
growing as freely as does grass in England, were <lb/>
a daily revelation of beauty and colour. To read <lb/>
of heliotrope hedges six feet in height, and of <lb/>
gorgeous creepers of many kinds covering the <lb/>
tree - stems and framing the houses in beauty, <lb/>
makes us sigh for the scents and sights of <lb/>
Keenur; but, unfortunately, it was too near the <lb/>
jungle to be healthy, and she found it advisable <lb/>
to go westward. She tells us that Lord Lytton <lb/>
knew more about the plants and trees than any <lb/>
one whom she met in India, and it is interesting <lb/>
to hear that he was never too busy, even when <lb/>
Viceroy of India, to enjoy talking and walking <lb/>
with the gifted traveller during her visit to Simla.</p>
<p>As in England so in India, it is the busiest <lb/>
people who always have the most time, and he <lb/>
never spared himself either trouble or strength, <lb/>
emulating in that respect Sir Richard Temple, the <lb/>
Governor of Bombay, who did everything that <lb/>
he had to do "with all his might."</p>
<p>She reached England again in March 1879, and <lb/>
finding the business of incessantly describing her <lb/>
sketches very wearisome, she hired a room in <lb/>
Conduit Street, where they were on view during <lb/>
the summer months. This little exhibition excited <lb/>
general interest, and saved her from much boredom <lb/>
and fatigue. When it was over Miss North made <lb/>
<pb n="197" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0246"/>
a short trip to Italy, stopping <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> to pay a <lb/>
visit to the Symonds at Davos am Platz, where <lb/>
the talented author of 'The Renaissance' had <lb/>
settled with his family three years before, hoping <lb/>
to recover the health which had become so <reg orig="seri-|ously">seriously</reg> <lb/>
impaired. For many years that valuable <lb/>
life was prolonged, and Davos has since that <lb/>
time become the resort of thousands, who were <lb/>
encouraged by his experiences to try the effects <lb/>
of the wonderful air.</p>
<p>The exhibition in Conduit Street resulted in a <lb/>
suggestion from a contributor to 'The Pall Mall <lb/>
Gazette' that these valuable additions to botanical <lb/>
knowledge should be secured to the nation by <lb/>
giving them a permanent home at Kew. This <lb/>
suggestion at once commended itself to Miss <lb/>
North, who, with characteristic large-heartedness, <lb/>
not only offered to build a gallery for their <lb/>
reception, but a rest - house where refreshments <lb/>
could be obtained, and also a small studio where <lb/>
she and any other flower-artist could paint quietly, <lb/>
undisturbed by the constant traffic of visitors. <lb/>
These generous offers were gladly accepted by <lb/>
Sir Joseph Hooker, with the exception of the <lb/>
refreshment saloon, which he considered <reg orig="imprac-|ticable">impracticable</reg> <lb/>
owing to the vast number of holiday-makers <lb/>
who visit the Kew Gardens, and for whom such <lb/>
great preparations would necessarily have to be <lb/>
made.</p>
<pb n="198" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0247"/>
<p>The choice of the site and of the designs for <lb/>
the building was a great interest to her, and was <lb/>
indirectly the beginning of her friendship with <lb/>
Charles Darwin, who had long been an object of <lb/>
hero - worship to one who was so well able to <lb/>
appreciate his genius. After seeing her collection <lb/>
of sketches, he recommended her to defer their <lb/>
arrangement until she had painted from the <reg orig="ab-|solutely">absolutely</reg> <lb/>
unique vegetation of Australia, and acting <lb/>
on his advice she started for that continent in the <lb/>
spring of 1880.</p>
<p>On arriving at Brisbane she was struck by the <lb/>
unattractiveness of the town and the hospitality <lb/>
of the townsfolk. But away in the hills the <lb/>
scenery was magnificent, and bush - life <reg orig="ap-|pealed">appealed</reg> <lb/>
strongly to the free and independent <lb/>
woman who roamed so fearlessly amid the wilds <lb/>
of Chili and Borneo.</p>
<p>The eucalyptus with its aromatic fragrance, the <lb/>
grass-trees in their spherical beauty, the clumps <lb/>
of bottle- and gum-trees, and the gardens teeming <lb/>
with oranges and peaches, were each and all <lb/>
subjects for her pencil and brush; while the <lb/>
multi - coloured parrots and cockatoos vied with <lb/>
each other in welcoming her to their native <lb/>
haunts. The waratah, gorgeous in colour, bloomed <lb/>
luxuriously in forests "full of wonders," and the <lb/>
giant fig-trees and white gums&mdash;the latter often <lb/>
more than 300 feet high&mdash;seemed stupendous, even <lb/>
<pb n="199" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0248"/>
to one who had seen Nature in all its grandeur <lb/>
in nearly every continent.</p>
<p>She describes Western Australia as "a natural <lb/>
flower-garden," and to our insular ideas it seems <lb/>
almost incredible that it could be possible to <lb/>
pluck twenty-five different flowers without moving <lb/>
from one spot.</p>
<p>New Zealand appeared to her somewhat bare <lb/>
and savage for some miles after reaching <reg orig="Queens-|town">Queenstown</reg>; <lb/>
but the todeas and "vegetable sheep" <lb/>
&lpar;<hi rend="italic">Raoulia</hi>&rpar;, and the wonderful colourings of the <lb/>
small-leaved drac&aelig;na, filled her with admiration as <lb/>
she penetrated into the interior of the islands. <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Vi&acirc;</hi> Honolulu and America she slowly made her <lb/>
way back to England, making fresh friends at <lb/>
every stopping-place, and being everywhere greeted <lb/>
as an artistic "lion."</p>
<p>Every one who knew her loved her, and while <lb/>
she threw herself and all her energies into the <reg orig="de-|lights">delights</reg> <lb/>
of travel and of research, those with whom <lb/>
she came in contact fell under the spell of her <lb/>
nature&mdash;as noble and kindly as it was enthusiastic.</p>
<p>After eighteen months in the Antipodes she <lb/>
reached London again in 1881, and her first <lb/>
thought, of course, was of the Kew Gallery. She <lb/>
now devoted a year to sorting and arranging her <lb/>
pictures, with the result that in June of 1882 <lb/>
the beautiful little museum was opened to the <lb/>
public.</p>
<pb n="200" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0249"/>
<p>This same "public" found it most difficult to <lb/>
believe that all the paintings upon the walls had <lb/>
been done by one hand, and that hand a woman's! <lb/>
"It is lucky for you," said one admiring visitor, <lb/>
"that you did not live two hundred years ago, or <lb/>
you would have been burned as a witch."</p>
<p>It was on the occasion of this her sixth <reg orig="home-|coming">homecoming</reg> <lb/>
that she first met Miss Gordon Cumming <lb/>
and Mrs Bishop &lpar;<hi rend="italic">n&eacute;e</hi> Bird&rpar;, both artists and <lb/>
travellers of no inconsiderable fame; and the <lb/>
meeting of these three intrepid women must have <lb/>
been a great pleasure to them all.</p>
<p>The former has since that date started a <lb/>
crusade in aid of the "Caxton of China"; and as <lb/>
she too is one of the goodly fellowship of "old <lb/>
maids," a few words with regard to her mission <lb/>
may be allowable here, especially as she is most <lb/>
anxious to interest all sorts and conditions of men <lb/>
in the noble work of Mr W. H. Murray.</p>
<p>She met him "by chance," as we say, in a <lb/>
Chinese compound, where he was engaged as <lb/>
colporteur to the Bible Society. Having, after <lb/>
great difficulties, reduced the 4000 complicated <lb/>
Chinese characters into 420 distinct sounds, he <lb/>
at first set to work to represent these sounds <lb/>
by embossed dots, each group of dots differently <lb/>
placed representing numerals, by which means a <lb/>
blind untaught Chinaman can read his own <reg orig="lan-|guage">language</reg> <lb/>
in three months. A sighted Chinaman of <lb/>
<pb n="201" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0250"/>
average intelligence generally takes six years to <lb/>
master the art of reading; and when Mr Murray <lb/>
found that a blind man was by the new system <lb/>
put at an advantage, he never rested until, by <lb/>
connecting these dots by black lines into a <lb/>
series of simple geometric forms also representing <lb/>
numerals, a sighted Chinaman was likewise <reg orig="en-|abled">enabled</reg> <lb/>
to read easily in that short time. It may <lb/>
not unnaturally be asked why this man was led <lb/>
to invent, what is practically an alphabet, for the <lb/>
blind <hi rend="italic">first</hi> and for the sighted <hi rend="italic">afterwards</hi>. But <lb/>
one of the first things which every traveller must <lb/>
notice on entering China is the extraordinary <lb/>
number of blind people. This is mostly due to <lb/>
one or other of four causes &mdash; leprosy, smallpox, <lb/>
ophthalmia, and dirt; but so superstitious is the <lb/>
"heathen Chinee" that many a child is purposely <lb/>
blinded by its parents in order that it may earn <lb/>
money by fortune-telling, as the Chinese believe <lb/>
that the blind can see into the hearts of others, <lb/>
and are thus enabled to reveal secrets.</p>
<p>To excite the interest of all Englishmen in the <lb/>
Chinese Reading Reform, and to gain friends for its <lb/>
support and its extension, is Miss Gordon Cumming's <lb/>
latest object in life. So we doubt not that <reg orig="through-|out">throughout</reg> <lb/>
the United Kingdom the "yellow book" which <lb/>
she has compiled relative to this great movement <lb/>
will be sown and sold broadcast by her energetic <lb/>
efforts. To help in the evangelisation of China is <lb/>
<pb n="202" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0251"/>
a grand work, and one in which the noblest might <lb/>
be proud to have a share, and it is to this end <lb/>
that her present labours are entirely devoted. <lb/>
"My sketches are all very well; interesting&mdash;yes, <lb/>
very&mdash;to me, and to everybody here, I daresay. <lb/>
But <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is what I have come for&mdash;to tell people <lb/>
about Mr Murray and his numeral type,&mdash;about <lb/>
the blind and the sighted Chinese, who can read <lb/>
and sing by his methods. Wonderful! <reg orig="Extra-|ordinary">Extraordinary</reg>! <lb/>
Mustn't talk to you any more now; <lb/>
must save up my voice a bit. Come and hear <lb/>
me talk in half an hour."</p>
<p>And whatever she does she puts her whole heart <lb/>
into. There is nothing lukewarm about her. The <lb/>
twinkling honest eyes, the firm resolute step, the <lb/>
hearty grasp of her large capable hand, are all <lb/>
but the outward and visible signs of the strong, <lb/>
independent, yet sweet nature dwelling within that <lb/>
massive frame. Thus did Miss Gordon Cumming <lb/>
strike us as we lately met her in a crowded <lb/>
Exhibition Room &mdash; brimming over with <reg orig="mission-|ary">missionary</reg> <lb/>
zeal for the millions of Chinamen who, <lb/>
without education, can never rise above their <lb/>
present miserable standards of morality and <lb/>
religion.</p>
<p>And we are told by Mrs Symonds that the <lb/>
qualities which distinguish Miss Gordon Cumming <lb/>
belonged pre-eminently to Miss North. Her large <lb/>
yet simple manner made friends for her <reg orig="every-|where">everywhere</reg>. <lb/>
<pb n="203" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0252"/>
Even when travelling absolutely alone she <lb/>
inspired all whom she met with chivalry and <reg orig="re-|spect">respect</reg>; <lb/>
while she was so "infinitely kind," that <lb/>
respect soon merged itself into friendships that <lb/>
were loving and lifelong.</p>
<p>She had visited nearly every part of the world <lb/>
except South Africa, and she now determined that <lb/>
the Dark Continent must be represented in the <lb/>
picture-gallery which will henceforward immortalise <lb/>
her name.</p>
<p>In August 1882 she left England in the <reg orig="Grand-|tully">Grandtully</reg> <lb/>
Castle, and in less than three weeks was <lb/>
safely landed at the Cape. The variety and beauty <lb/>
of the flowers in this wonderful land filled her with <lb/>
delight. The "silver tree" gleaming in the <reg orig="sun-|light">sunlight</reg>, <lb/>
the gorgeous proteas, the wattles covered <lb/>
with golden blossoms, the aloes and pelargoniums, <lb/>
the red leafless lilies, and the hedges hung with <lb/>
rare and fragrant creepers, arrested her attention <lb/>
at every turn; while, anon, the miles of veldt, the <lb/>
bare kopjes, and the fantastically shaped rocks, <lb/>
made contrasts which were not wholly unbeautiful. <lb/>
The birds and insects of South Africa proved most <lb/>
interesting; but the baboons &lpar;or "black people," <lb/>
as they are colloquially called&rpar; made it dangerous <lb/>
for her to visit some of the mountain - passes <lb/>
alone.</p>
<p>Her experiences of Transvaal life are <reg orig="interest-|ing">interesting</reg> <lb/>
to read of, but do not give us an elevated <lb/>
<pb n="204" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0253"/>
idea of the tastes or manners of our "brother" <lb/>
Boers at home. Ignorant shrewdness and callous <lb/>
indifference to the sufferings of the lower creation <lb/>
are not amiable characteristics; while a self-<reg orig="com-|placent">complacent</reg> <lb/>
pietism, combined with a distinct lack of <lb/>
courtesy and cleanliness, did not, and does not, <lb/>
commend them, as a nation, to English ideas.</p>
<p>The ostriches, however, set a most excellent <lb/>
example of conjugal affection. "If one of a pair <lb/>
dies, the survivor seldom marries again."</p>
<p>Nine months in South Africa enabled her to <lb/>
make many valuable studies; but she was getting <lb/>
very tired and home-sick, when in May 1883 she <lb/>
left that country for England.</p>
<p>In September, however, she started off again&mdash;this <lb/>
time for the Seychelles Islands, where she found <lb/>
an endless variety of trees and ferns, glorious <lb/>
scenery and marvellous colouring. For several <lb/>
months she revelled in the wonderful foliage of <lb/>
primeval forests and the festooning grace of <reg orig="pitcher-|plants">pitcher-plants</reg> <lb/>
and nepenthes, returning home in breaking <lb/>
health, but with her brave spirit still dominating <lb/>
all physical weakness, to arrange her new pictures <lb/>
in the gallery at Kew.</p>
<p>During the few months which she now decided <lb/>
to spend in England, that womanly Queen, whose <lb/>
tactful sympathy in every scheme for the benefit <lb/>
of her people, and personal interest in all workers, <lb/>
whether artistic, literary, or scientific, has so <reg orig="en-|deared">endeared</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="205" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0254"/>
her to the nation, caused the following <lb/>
letter to be sent:&mdash; <lb/>

</div1></body></text></q>
</p>
<p>Such a letter as this needs no comment. It is <lb/>
an honour both to the heart that indited it and <lb/>
the hand that received it. Its keynote is the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">personal interest</hi> of "our late Sovereign Lady <lb/>
Queen Victoria, of blessed and glorious memory." <lb/>
<pb n="206" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0255"/>
It will ever be a priceless heirloom in Miss North's <lb/>
family, and we can easily imagine the pleasure and <lb/>
encouragement which it gave to its recipient.</p>
<p>Only once more did she cross the Atlantic&mdash;in <lb/>
November 1884&mdash;to paint on the spot from the <lb/>
forest growths of Chili. It was the last journey <lb/>
involved by the task which she had set herself, <lb/>
of painting all the biggest trees in the world, <lb/>
each in its respective habitat.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Araucaria imbricata</hi> &lpar;or "puzzle monkey <lb/>
tree," as we inconsequently call it &mdash; there being <lb/>
no monkeys in Chili&rpar; was the primary object of her <lb/>
expedition; but the tangles of lapageria, with their <lb/>
trumpet - shaped flowers of brilliant scarlet, the <lb/>
great groups of <hi rend="italic">Puya chilensis</hi>, of which there are <lb/>
three varieties, and the noble white cacti that <lb/>
abound, were not overlooked in her rambles. People <lb/>
did their best to persuade her from attempting to <lb/>
penetrate the Araucaria Forests, prophesying every <lb/>
sort of danger and difficulty; but no amount of <lb/>
discouragement availed, and, as is often the case <lb/>
under similar circumstances, the difficulties dwindled <lb/>
as they drew near. She succeeded in doing what <lb/>
she had set out to do, though not with such <reg orig="satis-|factory">satisfactory</reg> <lb/>
results as she had hoped.</p>
<p>Returning <hi rend="italic">vi&acirc;</hi> Jamaica, which appeared to her <lb/>
even more lovely than it had done on her visit <lb/>
thirteen years before, she reached England in 1885. <lb/>
Her last journey, alas! had indeed been taken.</p>
<pb n="207" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0256"/>
<p>After a year's labour in the Kew Gallery, where <lb/>
every painting had to be re - numbered, and the <lb/>
geographical arrangement of the plants definitely <lb/>
fixed, she finally, in 1886, settled down for a real <lb/>
"rest," in the pretty home which she had chosen <lb/>
at Alderley, in Gloucestershire. Every yard of her <lb/>
little domain was full of interest to her, and she <lb/>
hoped to spend many happy years in the quaint <lb/>
old-fashioned village.</p>
<p>Botanical treasures from every part of the world <lb/>
were constantly arriving &mdash; every day saw fresh <lb/>
developments in her unique garden. Stumps of <lb/>
trees were made into marvels of beauty, as she <lb/>
coaxed the honeysuckles and roses to drape them <lb/>
with blossom,&mdash;every bulb and plant had just the <lb/>
corner which best suited it. Long before the <reg orig="work-|men">workmen</reg> <lb/>
arrived in the morning the artist - gardener <lb/>
was at work among her flowers, planting, <reg orig="water-|ing">watering</reg>, <lb/>
training, with all the freshness of a youthful <lb/>
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Truly age cannot be measured by years, and of <lb/>
all that is popularly considered to belong to middle <lb/>
life&mdash;ennui and blas&eacute;ness &lpar;we can think of no better <lb/>
word&rpar;&mdash;Miss North knew nothing. At fifty-six her <lb/>
heart was as young, her interests as varied and <lb/>
vivid, as when she sought for the wild valley-lilies <lb/>
that grow in the neighbourhood of the Starnberger <lb/>
See.</p>
<p>The long toilsome journeys and incessant strain <lb/>
<pb n="208" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0257"/>
and exposure had insidiously undermined her <reg orig="nat-|urally">naturally</reg> <lb/>
strong physique, and in the autumn of 1888 <lb/>
a deep-seated disease developed itself, from which <lb/>
for many months it seemed impossible that she <lb/>
could even temporarily recover. But her splendid <lb/>
constitution kept it in partial abeyance for eighteen <lb/>
months, and in all her weakness she managed now <lb/>
and again to visit the garden in which she had <lb/>
taken so much pride and pleasure. The flowers <lb/>
were blooming in all the rich luxuriance of August, <lb/>
when she was called to leave them for ever &mdash; <lb/>
"transplanted" from Earth to Heaven.</p>

<ornament type="line"/>
<p>To have succeeded in the realms both of Poetry <lb/>
and Prose is a lot which has fallen to few, even in <lb/>
these latter days when "of making books there is <lb/>
no end"; and in this hurrying life it is almost <lb/>
equally remarkable that a woman who possessed <lb/>
the double gift should have refrained her soul and <lb/>
kept it low until she had attained the maturity of <lb/>
forty-three years.</p>
<p>Even then it seemed almost by accident that the <lb/>
public was admitted into the confidence of Jean <lb/>
Ingelow, for it was only through the brothers' pride <lb/>
in her prolific writings that they were ever printed.</p>
<p>To write poetry on the inside of a shutter is an <lb/>
original mode of procedure, but poets are a law <lb/>
unto themselves, and it is possible that somewhere <lb/>
or other some future poet - laureate is even now <lb/>
immortalising himself in some such droll fashion.</p>
<p>Every one knows Napoleon's famous words about <lb/>
mothers; and Mrs Ingelow, being a very clever <lb/>
woman herself, was well able to understand and <lb/>
<pb n="212" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0263"/>
to encourage the talents of her clever family, and <lb/>
to recognise their literary abilities.</p>
<p>Their father was originally a banker in Boston, <lb/>
Lincolnshire, where Jean was born; but <reg orig="subse-|quently">subsequently</reg> <lb/>
he removed to Ipswich, where they <reg orig="re-|mained">remained</reg> <lb/>
for many years. He was a staunch <lb/>
Evangelical, and consistently upheld the traditions <lb/>
of that section of the English Church. We wonder <lb/>
why Banking and Evangelicalism so often go <reg orig="to-|gether">together</reg>. <lb/>
For they do. Baring, Bosanquet, Coutts, <lb/>
are all pillars of the Church. Not "flying <reg orig="but-|tresses">buttresses</reg>," <lb/>
as some one has wittily called those who <lb/>
are more ornamental than useful, but staunch <reg orig="sup-|porters">supporters</reg>, <lb/>
by words and works, of all that is now so <lb/>
unworthily sneered at as "Protestantism." <reg orig="Pos-|sibly">Possibly</reg> <lb/>
there is a <hi rend="italic">realness</hi> about both, which may <lb/>
account for the association; for there is no romance <lb/>
about either the one or the other. Both are, or <lb/>
should be, "upright and downright and true to <lb/>
the backbone." No ambiguities can be tolerated; <lb/>
no hair - splitting sophistries can hold a place in <lb/>
either; and the straightforward, perpendicular <reg orig="char-|acter">character</reg> <lb/>
of both has helped to make England what <lb/>
she is, whether from a religious or a financial point <lb/>
of view.</p>
<p>All the young Ingelows must have had a natural <lb/>
gift for versifying and for writing generally, or the <lb/>
production of a little home-periodical would have <lb/>
been impossible. Probably, however, it was Jean <lb/>
<pb n="213" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0264"/>
whose contributions were the mainstay of the paper; <lb/>
for, as she na&iuml;vely expressed it in the after-days, <lb/>
"I could not help writing."</p>
<p>There is a striking contrast here between this <lb/>
happy group of bright, clever children, growing up <lb/>
in healthy surroundings amid merry friends, and <lb/>
the little pale-faced, motherless trio in the bleak <lb/>
Haworth parsonage, who wrote their "secret plays" <lb/>
and vivid word-pictures in the long lonely evenings, <lb/>
with only the blaze of the kitchen fire and their <lb/>
own glowing fancies to distract them from the <lb/>
dreary monotony of their daily lives.</p>
<p>What a contrast!</p>
<p>And the pathos that surrounds the childhood of <lb/>
the Bront&euml;s does but deepen as the years go on.</p>
<p>This gift for writing poetry was with Jean <reg orig="Inge-|low">Ingelow</reg> <lb/>
not merely a passing inspiration, of which, as <lb/>
"Aurora Leigh" declares, <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Near all the birds will sing at dawn,"</l>
</lg></q>
and <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="hang">"Many tender souls have strung their losses on a rhyming <lb/>
thread</l>
<l>As children cowslips&mdash;the more pains they take</l>
<l>The work more withers."</l>
</lg></q>
Rather did she strive against it, feeling, as so many <lb/>
have felt, that the capacity for writing in some <lb/>
sort set her apart from other people. Some natures <lb/>
have as much horror of eccentricity as they have of <lb/>
crime, and in their falsely conceived interpretation <lb/>
<pb n="214" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0265"/>
of the word have strangely perverted it from its <lb/>
real meaning. To be "eccentric," after all, is but <lb/>
to be out of the one orbit which conventionality <lb/>
has prescribed.</p>
<p>"There is one glory of the sun, another glory of <lb/>
the moon, another glory of the stars, and one star <lb/>
differeth from another star in glory."</p>
<p>To every man his own orbit, would be a safer <lb/>
axiom, with more interesting results, than that <lb/>
every man should have the same orbit, in which <lb/>
to revolve at greater or less velocity.</p>
<p>"It's the way of the world." "Everybody says <lb/>
so." Then, in God's name, do not go that way,&mdash; <lb/>
say something else; and there are nine chances to <lb/>
one that the world itself will end by blessing you.</p>
<p>Her reluctant diffidence, however, having been <lb/>
overcome, the next step was to take the "Poems" <lb/>
to a publisher, and the one selected by her brother <lb/>
and mother was Mr Longman, who at once <reg orig="recog-|nised">recognised</reg> <lb/>
their unusual merit, and did his utmost to <lb/>
promote the sale of the modest volume. He had <lb/>
no cause to regret its publication, for edition after <lb/>
edition has been called for; and in America even <lb/>
more than in England the music of her style has <lb/>
been sincerely appreciated. In the first year, 1863, <lb/>
four editions of a thousand each were sold, and <lb/>
since that time nearly thirty thousand copies have <lb/>
circulated throughout the length and breadth of <lb/>
the land.</p>
<pb n="215" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0266"/>
<p>The second edition of her Poems came out, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg>, <lb/>
under somewhat unusual circumstances, which <lb/>
are worthy of notice. In spite of the fact that the <lb/>
first edition was exhausted, the cautious publisher <lb/>
did not seem inclined to issue a second. Mrs and <lb/>
Miss Ingelow called to propose it, but left his office <lb/>
somewhat crestfallen. In the passage they met a <lb/>
man with a slip of paper in his hand, and two <lb/>
or three minutes later a messenger hurried after <lb/>
them to say that this man had come with an order <lb/>
for five hundred copies, so that another edition <lb/>
would have to be printed immediately.</p>
<p>Henceforward, success&mdash;embodied in the <reg orig="per-|sons">persons</reg> <lb/>
of publishers&mdash;waited upon her. Book after <lb/>
book was eagerly caught up, and her name and <lb/>
fame spread steadily not only in England but in <lb/>
America.</p>
<p>It is possible that, had her poems appeared fifty <lb/>
years later, their success would not have been so <lb/>
immediate or so great, for the public taste of 1906 <lb/>
is very different from that of even a few years ago. <lb/>
It is less demurely simple&mdash;more sensational, more <lb/>
dramatic. Nowadays there is a continual cry for <lb/>
"strong" work&mdash;less landscape painting and <reg orig="sun-|shine">sunshine</reg>, <lb/>
more dash and flare and lime-light.</p>
<p>But the touch of nature would perhaps have <lb/>
redeemed them, even in the eyes of the most <lb/>
"up-to-date" critics; for there is a healthy <reg orig="human-|ness">humanness</reg> <lb/>
about her simplest verses which must surely <lb/>
<pb n="216" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0267"/>
appeal to most men, and many of her poems are <lb/>
gems of their kind.</p>
<p>Rumour in those days would seem to have been <lb/>
as unreliable as now; for in a letter, dated December <lb/>
31, 1863, Christina Rossetti speaks of the "<reg orig="wonder-|ful">wonderful</reg> <lb/>
poet &mdash; aged twenty-one," who had just risen <lb/>
upon the literary horizon. This rumour of extreme <lb/>
youth may have had something to do with the <reg orig="ex-|traordinary">extraordinary</reg> <lb/>
interest and success with which Jean <lb/>
Ingelow's first volume was greeted; but, as the <lb/>
truth leaked out, there was no diminution of the <lb/>
popularity which she so justly deserved. Jean <lb/>
Ingelow was in reality Miss Rossetti's senior by <lb/>
ten years, but the latter had made for herself a <lb/>
permanent place in the literary world before the <lb/>
former had published a line.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that 'Barrack-Room Ballads' <lb/>
would have found in her no admirer, and the <lb/>
"Absent-minded Beggar" would have been <reg orig="Ana-|thema">Anathema</reg> <lb/>
Maranatha &mdash; as it probably is to Kipling <lb/>
himself by this time. War was to her only a <lb/>
huge blunder, an unfathomable "woe," for which <lb/>
she could find no justification, and of which no <lb/>
word of praise or sympathy is to be found <reg orig="through-|out">throughout</reg> <lb/>
her writings.</p>
<p>Her love of children is evinced in many a tender <lb/>
line, but she never left the shelter of her own <lb/>
home save for cosy expeditions on the Continent <lb/>
with some of her family.</p>
<pb n="217" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0268"/>
<p>A curious feature in her poems is the absence of <lb/>
all allusions to her foreign experiences. Nearly all <lb/>
poets have drawn inspiration from foreign sources, <lb/>
but Jean Ingelow is essentially English throughout. <lb/>
In spite of many winters spent abroad, and <reg orig="ex-|haustive">exhaustive</reg> <lb/>
visits to every cathedral in France in the <lb/>
company of her brother, who was an "ecclesiastical <lb/>
architect" &mdash; whatever that term may comprehend <lb/>
&mdash;we find scarcely any mention of things outside <lb/>
England. To Longfellow and many others <reg orig="travel-|ling">travelling</reg> <lb/>
was an inspiration; but possibly her brother's <lb/>
architectural interests may have dominated the <lb/>
trend of her thoughts. At any rate, nothing less <lb/>
than the "dread purity of Alpine snows" seems <lb/>
to have lifted itself above the stern outside <reg orig="influ-|ences">influences</reg> <lb/>
of stone and structure, even when glorified <lb/>
into immortal monuments, in the time when "Art <lb/>
was still Religion." She has sung of "the nobility <lb/>
of labour&mdash;the long pedigree of toil," but on English <lb/>
soil only: and it is probably as the fisherman's poet <lb/>
that she will be longest remembered. Many of her <lb/>
poems seem to "smell of the sea," and she is at her <lb/>
best when writing about it.</p>
<p>The 'Athen&aelig;um' gives rather an amusing account <lb/>
of a needlework competition which was proposed <reg orig="be-|tween">between</reg> <lb/>
Dora Greenwell, Christina Rossetti, and Jean <lb/>
Ingelow in the year 1863, in which year the latter <lb/>
first signalised herself as a poet. Each of these <lb/>
ladies determined to show the others that she could <lb/>
<pb n="218" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0269"/>
work with the needle as well as with the pen, but <lb/>
there is no record of Christina Rossetti's "<reg orig="Meister-|st&uuml;ck">Meisterst&uuml;ck</reg>," <lb/>
though Dora Greenwell presented her with <lb/>
a well-made reticule of her own handiwork. The <lb/>
pattern of the bag which Jean Ingelow gave to Dora <lb/>
Greenwell was designed by herself, and seems to <lb/>
have given as much pleasure to the donor as to the <lb/>
recipient; while Jean Ingelow was much gratified <lb/>
by the gift of a very superior kettle-holder worked <lb/>
by Dora Greenwell's adaptable fingers.</p>
<p>A letter of hers with regard to children's books, <lb/>
published about this time, gives us a clue as to <lb/>
her own ideas of literary work. "Mystical fancies," <lb/>
she says, "are a mere luxury. They never do us <lb/>
any good."</p>
<p>On the principle of the meeting of extremes, Jean <lb/>
Ingelow and Christina Rossetti should have been <lb/>
great friends, but, as far as we are aware, nothing <lb/>
but a "very slight acquaintance" and a mutual <lb/>
admiration existed between them. Jean Ingelow's <lb/>
poems are full of a "detailed knowledge of nature," <lb/>
and the hopefulness of spring permeates most of her <lb/>
works; and this quality no doubt greatly <reg orig="com-|mended">commended</reg> <lb/>
her to Miss Rossetti, whose life was <lb/>
dominated by the Cross rather than by the <lb/>
Anchor.</p>
<p>Tennyson and Ruskin were among her earliest <lb/>
and kindliest critics; but away in the Fen country, <lb/>
where first she saw the light, many a man has hung <lb/>
<pb n="219" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0270"/>
over her pages as he seemed to see the eddying <lb/>
waters of the high tide at Enderby, and to hear <lb/>
the song of the Northern Sea as it chanted its long <lb/>
dirge for the dead fishermen.</p>
<p>All the characters in her more dramatic poems <lb/>
were very real to her, many of them being probably <lb/>
drawn from the life.</p>
<p>Her poor people are never written of as a class. <lb/>
They are just units of the world's big family who <lb/>
happened to be born poor; and there is no tinge <lb/>
of patronage in her tones, only the frank <reg orig="friendli-|ness">friendliness</reg> <lb/>
which characterised her whole nature. She <lb/>
knew but little of the world's great sorrows from <lb/>
personal experience, but that did not prevent her <lb/>
from entering with wide sympathy into the sorrows <lb/>
of others, and her advice and counsel were eagerly <lb/>
sought by many whose faces she had never seen. <lb/>
The following sweet lines epitomise in some measure <lb/>
her beliefs in this respect:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"And even I, who know</l>
<l rend="indent">But little of earth's woe,</l>
<l>Can take from other hearts into my own</l>
<l rend="indent">Reflected griefs that bring,</l>
<l rend="indent">With every tear they wring,</l>
<l>Knowledge that love must seek for peace in heaven alone."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Set as they were to most harmonious music, her <lb/>
songs will long be remembered, when perhaps her <lb/>
more ambitious efforts are forgotten. "When <lb/>
Sparrows build" is full of an indefinable pathos, <lb/>
and one wonders how a woman who apparently <lb/>
<pb n="220" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0271"/>
led such a sheltered and emotionless life could <lb/>
write such lines. Many a desolate soul has craved <lb/>
for <hi rend="italic">just one</hi> glimpse through the gates into the <lb/>
City, and has thrilled to the yearning of Tennyson's <lb/>
passionate aspiration&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Oh God, that it were possible</l>
<l rend="indent">For one short hour to see</l>
<l>The forms we love, that we might know</l>
<l rend="indent">How and where they be!"</l>
</lg></q>
But there is almost a more subtle knowledge of <lb/>
human nature in those two lines of Jean Ingelow&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Is there never a chink in the world above</l>
<l>Where they listen for words from below?"</l>
</lg></q>
They just express the natural repulsion of us poor <lb/>
mortals to the belief that those who have crossed <lb/>
the bar are so absorbed in their own bliss as to be <lb/>
wholly oblivious of all that is befalling their best <lb/>
beloved on earth. The stillness may be unbroken <lb/>
betwixt us and them, but to be justified in believing <lb/>
that we are not forgotten and unheeded, would be <lb/>
some pale sort of consolation, even to the most <lb/>
spiritually minded mourner. The great <reg orig="under-|tow">undertow</reg> <lb/>
of life must surely have been dragging at <lb/>
her heart, and she could hear the minor, which <lb/>
is present in all nature's music, even amid the <lb/>
joyous harmony of her own peaceful existence. <lb/>
But she was still strong to say&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"No man can be always sad,</l>
<l>Unless he wills to have it so,"&mdash;</l>
</lg></q>
<pb n="221" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0272"/>
and we can trace here the cheery optimism of <lb/>
her frequent visitor and faithful friend, Robert <lb/>
Browning.</p>
<p>Of all her poems, perhaps the most scholarly is <lb/>
"Honours," which, however, suffers from being <lb/>
unduly spun out. In this poem, geologists are <lb/>
supposed to say that they are "sorry for what <lb/>
they find" in the Book of Nature. From this <lb/>
statement we most emphatically beg to differ, <lb/>
for scientists, more than most men, are always <lb/>
pleased at any new discovery. If religious men, <lb/>
they <hi rend="italic">find no difficulties,</hi> as was the case with Owen, <lb/>
Lyell, Drummond, and many others; if otherwise, <lb/>
they leave the matter, knowing full well, as Huxley, <lb/>
Tyndall, and Darwin were not ashamed to own, that <lb/>
there is a point beyond which no finite mind can go.</p>
<p>Napoleon the Great was distinctly no saint, yet <lb/>
even he did not hesitate to rebuke his scoffing <lb/>
courtiers on a starlit night, saying as he pointed <lb/>
upwards, "It's all very fine, gentlemen, but <hi rend="italic">who <lb/>
made all that?</hi>"</p>
<p>The poem ends with this noble poetic <reg orig="peror-|ation:&mdash;">peroration:&mdash;</reg> <lb/>
<lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent2">"Far better in its place the lowliest bird</l>
<l rend="indent">Should sing aright to Him the lowliest song,</l>
<l>Than that a seraph strayed should take the word</l>
<l rend="indent">And sing His glory wrong."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Cardinal Bellarmine meant no disrespect to the <lb/>
Bible when he likened it to "a nose of wax that <lb/>
<pb n="222" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0273"/>
can be pulled any way." This statement, made in <lb/>
the heat of controversy, is only another tribute to <lb/>
its grand catholicity. The "Higher Critics" may <lb/>
twist and turn it as much as they like; the Roman <lb/>
Church may evolve Mariolatry and Sacerdotalism; <lb/>
and Evangelical and Nonconformist may <reg orig="respect-|ively">respectively</reg> <lb/>
deduce Baptismal Regeneration and <reg orig="Predestin-|ation">Predestination</reg> <lb/>
from its pages; and yet the old Book lives <lb/>
on, untouched in its majestic vitality. It stands <lb/>
like the Apocalyptic City, "four-square," and its <lb/>
marvellous adaptabilities do but harmonise with the <lb/>
twelve gates of the Holy Jerusalem, through which <lb/>
Papist and Pagan, Anglican and Salvationist, can <lb/>
enter in, and so entering, go not out henceforth, <lb/>
at all, for ever.</p>
<p>It is in no way meant to depreciate her ability <lb/>
when we say that there is a strange irony about <lb/>
the success of some books.</p>
<p>The success for which Jean Ingelow cared so <lb/>
little, and which from a pecuniary point of view <lb/>
was of no account to her, would to many a man be <lb/>
a real godsend. There have been many singers <lb/>
who have <hi rend="italic">died</hi> singing, for lack of the <reg orig="encourage-|ment">encouragement</reg> <lb/>
which came to her so easily; died sobbing, <lb/>
unrecognised and unknown &mdash; "marvellous boys" <lb/>
who have not had even the posthumous fame of a <lb/>
Chatterton.</p>
<p>Of writing for money she knew nothing; the <lb/>
driving-wheel of a stern necessity had no place in <lb/>
<pb n="223" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0274"/>
her life. Her message was delivered at leisure, <lb/>
and in ease that almost approached to luxury. <lb/>
There were no anxious watchings for the postman, <lb/>
no dear ones dependent on her daily toil. One of <lb/>
the chief pleasures connected with her books was <lb/>
the friendship which they ensured to her of such <lb/>
men as Sir Arthur Helps, John Ruskin, and Robert <lb/>
Browning. Tennyson also she knew well, and they <lb/>
were proud of each other as being worthy <reg orig="repre-|sentatives">representatives</reg> <lb/>
of the Fen country &mdash; of the <reg orig="compar-|atively">comparatively</reg> <lb/>
little-known regions of the sobbing, <reg orig="throb-|bing">throbbing</reg> <lb/>
river, where the reeds and rushes quiver on <lb/>
the sandy lonesome shore, of <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"The meads where melick groweth,</l>
<l>Where the water winding down,</l>
<l>Onward floweth to the town."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Of these most deeply valued friends, only John <lb/>
Ruskin survived her; and he too has now passed <lb/>
over, to find in Heaven's completeness the solution <lb/>
for all the riddles which he strove so hard to read.</p>
<p>For womanhood, as such, she had a great respect, <lb/>
not unmingled with awe, holding that a woman to <lb/>
a woman is either her best friend or her worst <lb/>
foe. She viewed "woman's rights" with <reg orig="dispassion-|ate">dispassionate</reg> <lb/>
eyes, knowing and feeling strongly the claim <lb/>
which <hi rend="italic">all</hi> women have to the highest consideration, <lb/>
but finding in their weaknesses the strongest <reg orig="argu-|ment">argument</reg> <lb/>
against any possible equality with man. She <lb/>
recognised the fact, which most women are so loth to <lb/>
<pb n="224" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0275"/>
acknowledge, that they themselves have forged <lb/>
their own fetters, and that they alone could break <lb/>
the chain which bound them to mediocrity.</p>
<p>Amiable and charitable in character, she yet <lb/>
hated all artificiality; and once in London, when <lb/>
a reciter began to play elocutionary tricks with <lb/>
her "High Tide on the Lincolnshire coast," she <lb/>
quietly, but hurriedly, left the room.</p>
<p>Strictly evangelical, but large - hearted, <reg orig="single-|minded">single-minded</reg>, <lb/>
and high-principled, purity and simplicity <lb/>
were among her most distinguishing traits.</p>
<p>Her life in the main was a thoroughly happy <lb/>
one, and she was content to try no experiments <lb/>
upon herself. Her parents had disapproved of the <lb/>
theatre; and though she was spared the pain of <lb/>
losing them until she herself was past middle age, <lb/>
she so maintained the true spirit of loyalty to their <lb/>
memory that she never even tried the effect of one <lb/>
theatrical performance. Such allegiance is rare <lb/>
indeed nowadays; but probably Jean Ingelow was <lb/>
deeply imbued with the doctrines of Ruskin, her <lb/>
greatest teacher-friend, who wrote, "This thing I <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">know</hi>, and which, if you labour faithfully, you shall <lb/>
know also, that in Reverence is the chief joy and <lb/>
power of life."</p>
<p>Living, she had submitted to them as to the <lb/>
incarnation of God's message to her, and the old <lb/>
ties were but strengthened by reverent <reg orig="remem-|brance">remembrance</reg> <lb/>
when they "whom we call dead" had <lb/>
<pb n="225" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0276"/>
passed to the Beyond. There was nothing of <reg orig="in-|tolerance">intolerance</reg> <lb/>
in her creed, and though her interests <lb/>
may not have been wide, they were high enough <lb/>
to reach the stars. Music and literature seem <lb/>
to have been her chief enjoyments. Not only was <lb/>
she a great reader, but an admirable performer <lb/>
upon harp, violin, and piano; while, in earlier <lb/>
years, her beautiful voice was a proud delight to <lb/>
all the members of that happy and united family.</p>
<p>Jean Ingelow may have seen, though she never <lb/>
experienced, the misery needlessly and <reg orig="unintention-|ally">unintentionally</reg> <lb/>
caused by the cruel undemonstrativeness of <lb/>
some English households, and we find her saying <lb/>
in one of her books&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Love me, and <hi rend="italic">tell me so.</hi>"</l>
</lg></q>
We have no clue to the meaning of those few <lb/>
words, but it may be that they were the outcome <lb/>
of some unspoken pain. As far as we know, her <lb/>
life was like that of some nations, happy because <lb/>
of its uneventfulness, and the words may have had <lb/>
no special meaning beyond that which an individual <lb/>
reader may put into them.</p>
<p>But the simple exclamation carries us far away <lb/>
from Jean Ingelow to the lonely old man in the <lb/>
desolate home in Cheyne Row, "broken and <reg orig="soli-|tary">solitary</reg>, <lb/>
the lamp of my life, which 'covered <reg orig="every-|thing">everything</reg> <lb/>
with gold,' as it were gone out&mdash;gone out. <lb/>
&hellip; Blind and deaf that we are! Oh think, if <lb/>
<pb n="226" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0277"/>
thou yet love anybody living, wait not till death <lb/>
sweeps down the paltry little dust-clouds and idle <lb/>
dissonances of the moment, and all be at last so <lb/>
mournfully clear and beautiful, when it is <hi rend="italic">too late!"</hi></p>
<p>George Eliot reiterates this same thought in <lb/>
'Adam Bede,' where she says, "When Death, the <lb/>
great Reconciler, has come, it is never our <reg orig="tender-|ness">tenderness</reg> <lb/>
that we repent of."</p>
<p>An instance of Jean Ingelow's ready kindliness <lb/>
may be given here. A child of our acquaintance, <lb/>
who much admired her poetry, wrote a simple <lb/>
ingenuous letter telling her so, and asking for her <lb/>
autograph. Many a less famous writer would have <lb/>
taken no notice of such a letter; but, though the <lb/>
business of literature just then was specially <reg orig="ardu-|ous">arduous</reg>, <lb/>
and the request doubtless only one of many, <lb/>
she lost no time in replying; and with gracious <lb/>
tact, guessing truly how much it would be valued, <lb/>
she enclosed a signed copy of the following <lb/>
stanza from her "Contrasted Songs." Why she <lb/>
chose these particular lines we cannot surmise, <lb/>
as they are scarcely typical of her usual style, <lb/>
but it may be that they were special favourites <lb/>
of her own.</p>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"Sorrow was a ship, I found,</l>
<l>Wrecked with them that in her are,</l>
<l>On an island richer far</l>
<l>Than the port where they were bound.</l>

<l>Of the old great bell of doom,</l>

<p>In writing to young aspirants after literary fame <lb/>
she never discouraged or patronised, but <reg orig="consist-|ently">consistently</reg> <lb/>
urged them to attend to the structure of <lb/>
language itself, giving, as the best of all reasons, <lb/>
the irrefragable one that if they did not succeed <lb/>
in winning an audience they would at any rate <lb/>
have enriched their own minds.</p>
<p>Her prose writings will never be as well read <lb/>
as her poetry, though some of them ran through <lb/>
several editions: and a collection of short tales, <lb/>
written in her early years under the pseudonym <lb/>
of "Orris," and republished under the title of <lb/>
'Stories told to a Child,' was illustrated by <lb/>
Millais and other distinguished artists. Her <lb/>
standard of excellence for a child's book was <lb/>
that it should be "simple and straightforward," <lb/>
and to this standard she faithfully adhered. <lb/>
While their construction is simple, the style is <lb/>
delightful; and there is no one, whether young <lb/>
or old, who would not be the better for reading <lb/>
such a book as 'Studies for Stories' or 'Mopsa <lb/>
the Fairy.'</p>
<p>In later life her novels excited much interest, <lb/>
<pb n="228" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0279"/>
notably 'Off the Skelligs' and 'Fated to be <lb/>
Free,' which may be bracketed together, as the <lb/>
one is the sequel to the other. Admirable both <lb/>
in design and in execution, the poet's heart throbs <lb/>
through them all. Her descriptions of scenery are <lb/>
veritable prose poems, while wit and humour flash <lb/>
out here and there with a sudden spontaneity <lb/>
which is in itself indicative of genius.</p>
<p>Generous always, she delighted in giving two <lb/>
meals a-week to twelve poor people, who had but <lb/>
just left some one of the London hospitals. Much <lb/>
help and happiness were dispensed by her in this <lb/>
quiet way; and these "copyright dinners," as she <lb/>
jokingly called them, were but samples of her <lb/>
thoughtful and unostentatious kindness.</p>
<p>But the time came when charity had to be done <lb/>
by proxy&mdash;when threescore years and ten were <lb/>
passed, and the pen of the ready writer had <lb/>
grown rusty with disuse.</p>
<p>Paralysis laid its withering touch upon her, <lb/>
and for months of weariness and suffering she <lb/>
lay waiting, until the gates should open and the <lb/>
"abundant entrance" be given. Though watched <lb/>
over by a devoted friend and nurse, Time seemed <lb/>
to linger as it passed, and when the last day on <lb/>
earth came it was not unwelcome; for beyond <lb/>
the River of Death lay a better country &mdash; that <lb/>
is, a heavenly.</p>
<p>On the 24th of July 1897 they laid all that was <lb/>

mortal of Jean Ingelow in the cemetery at West <lb/>
Brompton, "in the sure and certain hope of <reg orig="resur-|rection">resurrection</reg> <lb/>
to eternal life."</p>
<p>Dr Walsham How, Bishop of Wakefield, read <lb/>
the funeral service; and, over the open grave, <lb/>
the glorious voice of Madame Antoinette Stirling <lb/>
lent fresh meaning and pathos to the words of <lb/>
the King of Poets as she sang the exquisite <lb/>
anthem, "The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall <lb/>
not want. He maketh me to lie down in <lb/>
green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still <lb/>
waters."</p>
<p>Sunshine and flowers robbed the scene of all <lb/>
but its inherent mournfulness; and among the <lb/>
many floral tributes was conspicuous the beautiful <lb/>
cross of roses sent by John Ruskin,</p>
<p>"IN SORROW AND AFFECTIONATE MEMORY."</p>

<ornament type="line"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Of</hi> Louisa Alcott it may be said that her books <lb/>
were made up of personal experiences, and that <lb/>
to the widening of those experiences the writing <lb/>
of her books largely contributed. This may seem <lb/>
a somewhat paradoxical statement, but it is <reg orig="liter-|ally">literally</reg> <lb/>
true, as we shall hope to show in this paper.</p>
<p>Her best work is that in which she speaks of <lb/>
the things which she has seen and known, and <lb/>
the things themselves are vitalised and ennobled <lb/>
by the long apprenticeship to her pen which began <lb/>
when she was but ten years old. Her life was <lb/>
no ordinary one: it brimmed over with incident. <lb/>
Hardships which would have caused many a girl <lb/>
hours of fruitless mortification were glorified by <lb/>
her into bits of amusing melodrama, and in a <lb/>
world of imaginary luxury she forgot all actual <lb/>
privations.</p>
<p>Her parents &mdash; Amos Bronson and Abba May <lb/>
Alcott &mdash; came of good old English stock, whose <lb/>
pedigree dated back to the early days of the <lb/>
<pb n="234" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0287"/>
seventeenth century. Her father's family could <lb/>
not be reckoned among those fortunate few who <lb/>
reaped golden harvests out of the soil of the <lb/>
New World, for at the time when Amos was <lb/>
born his father was only a small farmer, and he <lb/>
himself began life as a pedlar. Such a career, <lb/>
however, was not long possible for such a man, <lb/>
and he soon showed great aptitude both for <lb/>
learning and teaching. We are not aware of the <lb/>
circumstances under which he first met his wife, <lb/>
but it was inevitable that the two natures would <lb/>
be infinitely fascinating the one to the other.</p>
<p>The noble and high-souled idealist and the brave <lb/>
noble-hearted woman were all in all to each other <lb/>
always; but, as Louisa says somewhere, "All the <lb/>
philosophy in our house is not in the study; a good <lb/>
deal is in the kitchen, where a fine old lady thinks <lb/>
high thoughts and does kind deeds while she cooks <lb/>
and scrubs."</p>
<p>Louisa May Alcott was the second daughter, <lb/>
and was born on her father's thirty-third <reg orig="birth-|day">birthday</reg>, <lb/>
November 29, 1832. From her earliest years <lb/>
she seems to have shown unusual intelligence and <lb/>
unselfishness, and having no brothers she "made <lb/>
believe" to be a boy. Her three sisters&mdash;Anna, <lb/>
Elizabeth, and May &mdash; were willing enough to <lb/>
have it so, though sometimes her ultra - boyish <lb/>
pranks were distinctly trying to the more <reg orig="sober-|minded">sober-minded</reg> <lb/>
youngest.</p>
<pb n="235" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0288"/>
<p>When Louisa was two years old the family <reg orig="re-|moved">removed</reg> <lb/>
to Boston, where for six years Mr Alcott <lb/>
carried on a school in the Masonic Temple. His <lb/>
gift for teaching was remarkable, and Emerson <lb/>
was enthusiastic in his praise, describing him as <lb/>
"a man whose conversation is unrivalled in its <lb/>
way &mdash; such insight, such discernment of spirits, <lb/>
such pure intellectual play, such revolutionary <lb/>
impulses of thought."</p>
<p>But he was a pure idealist, and the reputation <lb/>
which he obtained for heresy and abolitionism <lb/>
soon served to break up his school. Intellectually <lb/>
Boston has some likeness to Edinburgh. There is <lb/>
the same width of wisdom to be found there, and <lb/>
it is the apex of transatlantic learning. But there <lb/>
the similarity ends, for instead of the "old city" <lb/>
there are the frame-houses of American build, and <lb/>
instead of ancient cathedrals there are only the <lb/>
State House and its collateral buildings. There <lb/>
are some churches, of course,&mdash;but Bostonians <lb/>
thought then, and probably still think, that its <lb/>
civic life is better served by a well-ordered <reg orig="demo-|cratic">democratic</reg> <lb/>
polity than by theology, while the religious <lb/>
atmosphere is not Presbyterian but Unitarian.</p>
<p>"The Church," as popularly considered, was a <lb/>
rigid and formalistic institution in those days&mdash;a <lb/>
mixture of Pharisaic propriety and priestly <reg orig="luke-|warmness,&mdash;while">lukewarmness,&mdash;while</reg> <lb/>
Unitarianism stood for all that <lb/>
was cordial, sympathetic, and inspiring; so it is <lb/>
<pb n="236" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0289"/>
not surprising to find that the religion of Boston <lb/>
mostly depended upon such exceptional men as <lb/>
Theodore Parker and his followers. The kindness <lb/>
of this "Orson of divines" to the home-sick Louisa <lb/>
in the after - days was as unfailing as it was <reg orig="dis-|interested">disinterested</reg>; <lb/>
and in 1856 we find her "fighting" <lb/>
for him, when some less large - hearted guest, at <lb/>
the boarding - house where she was temporarily <lb/>
staying, said that he was "not a Christian." <lb/>
With the simple directness of her usual style she <lb/>
says, "He is <hi rend="italic">my sort,</hi> for though he may lack <lb/>
reverence for other people's God he works bravely <lb/>
for his own, and turns his back on no one who <lb/>
needs help, as some of the pious do."</p>
<p>Mr and Mrs Alcott were ideal parents in the best <lb/>
sense of the word. No time or trouble was spared <lb/>
by them to make life a real and an earnest thing, <lb/>
not only for themselves but for their children, and <lb/>
they were richly rewarded by the loving loyalty of <lb/>
them all. One of Mrs Alcott's sayings was, "Cast <lb/>
thy bread upon the waters, and after many days it <lb/>
will come back buttered." Many a time did she see <lb/>
this verified, not only in her own life, but in the <lb/>
lives of others.</p>
<p>"Mr March" making compasses of his long legs <lb/>
and therewith drawing letters and diagrams for the <lb/>
edification of his little grandson, is a descriptive <lb/>
memory of Mr Alcott's early lessons to his own <lb/>
children; and we can imagine the delight of the <lb/>
<pb n="237" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0290"/>
quartette of little girls as they gathered round their <lb/>
philosopher - father, who forgot his Plato and his <lb/>
philosophy in the joy of "the children's hour."</p>
<p>The school as a financial scheme was a failure, <lb/>
and in 1840 the family removed to Concord, where <lb/>
for two years, "the happiest of my life," the children <lb/>
revelled in the freedom of the country, and where <lb/>
every day disclosed fresh wonders to the little people <lb/>
who were still so "fresh from God." It was during <lb/>
these years that the lifelong friendship with Emerson <lb/>
began, from whom all the family were to receive such <lb/>
untold benefit&mdash;their "good angel," as Louisa <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
called him. Here, too, they had the <reg orig="com-|panionship">companionship</reg> <lb/>
of the little Emersons, Channings, <reg orig="Haw-|thornes">Hawthornes</reg>, <lb/>
and Goodwins, while the seniors enjoyed <lb/>
congenial fellowship, and shared in all the frolics <lb/>
of their fun-loving children. For there was no <lb/>
Puritanism in the Concord cottage, and the <reg orig="Tran-|scendental">Transcendental</reg> <lb/>
movement had not as yet invaded the <lb/>
family life.</p>
<p>"But that is another story," as Kipling says.</p>
<p>Dickens tells us in his 'American Notes':&mdash;</p>
<p>"There has sprung up in Boston a sect of <reg orig="phil-|osophers">philosophers</reg> <lb/>
known as Transcendentalists. On inquiring <lb/>
what this appellation might be supposed to signify, <lb/>
I was given to understand that whatever was <lb/>
unintelligible would be certainly Transcendental. <lb/>
Transcendentalism has its occasional vagaries &lpar;what <lb/>
school has not?&rpar;, but it has good healthful qualities <lb/>
<pb n="238" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0291"/>
in spite of them: not least among the number a <lb/>
hearty disgust of cant, and an aptitude to detect <lb/>
her in all the million varieties of her everlasting <lb/>
wardrobe. And therefore, if I were a Bostonian, I <lb/>
would be a Transcendentalist."</p>
<p>It was in effect a rebound from the meretricious <lb/>
ostentation of the American cities, a struggle for <lb/>
fresh air, a protest against the waste and <reg orig="aimless-|ness">aimlessness</reg> <lb/>
of luxury.</p>
<p>To reorganise life and to put things social on a <lb/>
higher plane had always been one of Mr Alcott's <lb/>
dreams; but, until his visit to England in 1842, <lb/>
he had not attempted to put his theories into <lb/>
practice. On this occasion, however, he fell in with <lb/>
some kindred spirits, as he supposed, who were <lb/>
willing to exploit the new ideas in a practical &lpar;?&rpar; <lb/>
fashion. They returned with him to America, and <lb/>
in 1843 this strangely-assorted band took possession <lb/>
of a farm with fourteen acres of ground about <lb/>
twenty miles from Concord, in which they proposed <lb/>
to develop a scheme for the attainment of a higher <lb/>
life than had as yet been possible amid the struggles <lb/>
and cares of a more mundane existence. The whole <lb/>
history of this time reads like a medieval romance; <lb/>
but there is a great pathos about it, when we <reg orig="con-|sider">consider</reg> <lb/>
that Mrs Alcott, though outwardly faithful to <lb/>
her husband's plans, was all the while chafing at <lb/>
heart against the absurdity of trying to make their <lb/>
narrow resources sufficient not only for the adequate <lb/>
<pb n="239" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0292"/>
upbringing of her own children but also for the <lb/>
support of five enthusiasts, of whom she knew <lb/>
little, and for whom she cared less.</p>
<p>The account which Louisa Alcott gives of this <lb/>
experiment in 'Transcendental Wild Oats' is funny <lb/>
beyond description: the utter unconsciousness of all <lb/>
humour in the enthusiasts themselves, their lack of <lb/>
everyday knowledge and their fatuous reliance upon <lb/>
"the spirits' dictates," are touched upon with the <lb/>
pen of an artist, and as only an artist could do it. <lb/>
The chief charm of the housekeeping, from a modern <lb/>
and utilitarian point of view, seems to have been <lb/>
that very little cooking was required, and nowadays <lb/>
when the "domestic question" is assuming such <lb/>
gigantic proportions, it would be an easy way of <lb/>
solving it if the average John Bull would adopt the <lb/>
frugal <hi rend="italic">menu</hi> of the Fruitlands <hi rend="italic">m&eacute;nage:</hi>&mdash;</p>
<list>
<item><hi rend="italic">Breakfast.</hi>&mdash;Unleavened bread. Porridge. Water.</item>
<item><hi rend="italic">Dinner.</hi>&mdash;Bread. Vegetables. Water.</item>
<item><hi rend="italic">Supper.</hi>&mdash;Bread. Fruit. Water.</item>
</list>
<p>Not much luxury here! A Barmecide's banquet, <lb/>
indeed!</p>
<p>Within this "kingdom of peace" all things lovely <lb/>
and of good report were supposed to bloom and <lb/>
blossom, but whatever the dream may have been, <lb/>
the awakening was swift and sad. After six years <lb/>
of anxiety and toil the Alcott "assets" had to be <lb/>
sold to pay the debts of the concern, as the <reg orig="respon-|sibilities">responsibilities</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="240" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0293"/>
of it all fell upon its promoter&mdash;"the airy <lb/>
philosopher of Apple Slump," as Hawthorne calls <lb/>
him.</p>
<p>When the scanty crop, sown at random by the <lb/>
amateur farmers, was gathered in, it had to be done <lb/>
by the hands of Mrs Alcott and her children, as one <lb/>
by one the Transcendental band had fallen away. <lb/>
The last pathetic little harvest - home was soon <lb/>
accomplished, and the husband and wife were left <lb/>
alone&mdash;he mourning over the failure of his high <lb/>
hopes, and she over his bitter disappointment. He <lb/>
had thought to make a Paradise regained, to "tell <lb/>
high messages, to see white presences upon the <lb/>
hills, and hear the voices of the eternal gods"&mdash; <lb/>
and behold, it was only a dream!</p>
<p>But this time was never forgotten by any of them, <lb/>
knitting together, even more closely than before, the <lb/>
bonds of family love; for Mr Alcott nearly died of <lb/>
heartache, and only a sense of duty to wife and <lb/>
family enabled him at last to fight for his life against <lb/>
the overwhelming depression which overtook him. <lb/>
The ideal, which to him had been a living truth, <lb/>
had been rudely shattered; and though Heaven's <lb/>
light still remained, it was darkened for a while by <lb/>
clouds of debt and discouragement which wellnigh <lb/>
culminated in despair and death. In later years, <lb/>
when asked for a definition of a philosopher, Louisa <lb/>
Alcott replied promptly, "He is a man up in a <lb/>
balloon, with his family and friends holding the <lb/>
<pb n="241" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0294"/>
ropes which confine him to earth and trying to haul <lb/>
him down."</p>
<p>Her experiences of "practical philosophy" had <lb/>
not been satisfactory. She had seen the futility of <lb/>
utopian schemes, and with the keen shrewdness of <lb/>
an observant child had noticed that too often, in <lb/>
discussing great deeds and duties, the performance <lb/>
of little ones was altogether forgotten.</p>
<p>Henceforward she put into practice the <reg orig="beauti-|ful">beautiful</reg> <lb/>
lines of Miss A. L. Waring&mdash;another of "the <lb/>
glorious phalanx of old maids," as Theodore Parker <lb/>
calls them&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"I would not have the restless will</l>
<l rend="indent">That hurries to and fro,</l>
<l>Seeking for some great thing to do,</l>
<l rend="indent">Or secret thing to know:</l>
<l>I would be treated as a child,</l>
<l rend="indent">And guided where to go."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>Mrs Whitney, with true American humour and <lb/>
insight, goes to the root of the matter when she <lb/>
speaks of the Transcendental period as the time <lb/>
when people "tried on" ideas. "People eager <lb/>
after the true, the beautiful, thinking that they <lb/>
can lay hold of it abstractly, and forgetting that <lb/>
it must grow out of them,&mdash;the thing is, to rise to <lb/>
the real height of it." And that is just what so <lb/>
many failed to do, and why failure was inevitable.</p>
<p>Dr O. W. Holmes says of Thoreau, one of the <lb/>
Transcendental leaders: "A greater familiarity with <lb/>
ordinary men would have done him good. The <lb/>
<pb n="242" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0295"/>
radical vice of his theory of life was that he <reg orig="con-|founded">confounded</reg> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">physical</hi> with <hi rend="italic">spiritual</hi> remoteness from <lb/>
men."</p>
<p>The Transcendental cult was no more and no less <lb/>
than that of the dwellers in the Thebaid. Nature <lb/>
does not change with change of scene, and from <lb/>
them both we may learn, as Farrar so eloquently <lb/>
says, to "hallow, broaden, and ratify" the lessons <lb/>
which both alike would wish to teach "by the spirit <lb/>
of Him who sat at the banquets alike of the publican <lb/>
and the Pharisee, who took the little children in His <lb/>
arms and blessed them, who beautified with His <lb/>
presence and first miracle the humble marriage-feast <lb/>
of Cana in Galilee. Whatever ideals pass away, <lb/>
that one remains in its unchangeable applicability, <lb/>
in its infinite and eternal beauty."</p>
<p>Although Emerson was pre-eminently the <reg orig="Tran-|scendental">Transcendental</reg> <lb/>
leader, it is remarkable that he never <lb/>
encouraged the "cranks" of his disciples, and lived <lb/>
as sane a life as any one. As has been said, "He <lb/>
never let go the string of his balloon. He never <lb/>
threw over his ballast of common-sense so as to <lb/>
rise above an atmosphere in which a rational being <lb/>
could breathe."</p>
<p>Still more remarkable, it appears to us, is the <lb/>
fact that, in spite of his poetic nature, he found <lb/>
European cities, with all their wealth of antiquity <lb/>
and interest, "poor, grey, and shabby." It seems <lb/>
as if in him the dominant spirit of the New World <lb/>
<pb n="243" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0296"/>
was so accentuated that freshness and futurity <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> <lb/>
had any real charm, and all things beautiful had of <lb/>
necessity to be bright, before they could appeal to <lb/>
his imagination.</p>
<p>We have dwelt thus much upon the <reg orig="Transcen-|dental">Transcendental</reg> <lb/>
period because of the influence which it had <lb/>
upon all the Alcott family, and which more or less <lb/>
affected their whole lives.</p>
<p>Mr Alcott next took up a Socratic fashion of <lb/>
lecturing, called "Conversations"; but though many <lb/>
people came, drawn by the charm of the lecturer, <lb/>
the price of admission was too low for much gain to <lb/>
have accrued to the family coffers, and the children <lb/>
early began to assist in councils as to ways and <lb/>
means. One of Louisa's entries in her diary of 1850 <lb/>
runs as follows: "I think mother is a very true, <lb/>
good woman, and my dream is to have a lovely <lb/>
quiet home for her, with no debts or troubles to <lb/>
burden her. But I'm afraid she will be in heaven <lb/>
before I can do it."</p>
<p>In 1852 her dream began to come true, for her <lb/>
first story, 'Flower Fables,' was printed, and five <lb/>
dollars paid for it. This "firstborn," as she calls it, <lb/>
was written for Ellen Emerson, when she herself <lb/>
was only sixteen, and its success was a great <reg orig="en-|couragement">encouragement</reg>. <lb/>
Henceforward she lived, as she says, <lb/>
"a most dramatic life&mdash;never knowing what would <lb/>
come next." She tried sewing, teaching, and <reg orig="writ-|ing">writing</reg>, <lb/>
conscientiously striving to do that by which she <lb/>
<pb n="244" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0297"/>
could earn most, without regard to her own personal <lb/>
inclinations.</p>
<p>"Hope and keep busy" was one of her mother's <lb/>
well - worn mottoes, and Louisa seems to have <lb/>
steadily acted up to it.</p>
<p>In 1858 her first great sorrow fell upon her in the <lb/>
loss of Beth&mdash;her refuge in all moods, of whom she <lb/>
writes so lovingly in 'Little Women.' After two <lb/>
years of suffering&mdash;sweet and patient always&mdash;the <lb/>
life of the gentle sister who had been so much to the <lb/>
impulsive and high-spirited prototype of "Jo" passed <lb/>
visibly away "as in a light mist." It was no trick of <lb/>
the imagination, for the doctor who was present <reg orig="con-|firmed">confirmed</reg> <lb/>
the testimony of the watching family. It is <lb/>
worth noticing as a phenomenon, but seems to us <lb/>
a sort of parable of blessing, a visible drawing up&mdash; <lb/>
as of a dewdrop&mdash;into the warmth and sunlight of <lb/>
heaven.</p>
<p>These were stirring times. Slavery had not been <lb/>
abolished, and the tragedy of Harper's Ferry was <lb/>
yet to be enacted. One of her earliest recollections <lb/>
was of a "contraband" slave whom her mother <lb/>
had hidden in the oven; and the execution of John <lb/>
Brown in December 1859 awoke all the chivalry in <lb/>
her nature. At a meeting in Concord, Emerson, <lb/>
Thoreau, and Mr Alcott took part, and his <reg orig="martyr-|dom">martyrdom</reg> <lb/>
was naturally denounced with all the reverent <lb/>
and admiring eloquence which they could command.</p>
<p>The raid of John Brown upon Harper's Ferry was <lb/>
<pb n="245" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0298"/>
one of those glorious blunders which stand out <reg orig="in-|effaceably">ineffaceably</reg> <lb/>
upon the pages of American history. He <lb/>
was the embodiment of the slave confederacy, and <lb/>
gave his life and the lives of his sons, freely and <lb/>
gladly, for the negroes of Virginia.</p>
<p>He had chosen Harper's Ferry because there were <lb/>
mountains all about it, and he knew every turn of <lb/>
them, and hoped to hide himself and the liberated <lb/>
slaves in their fastnesses&mdash;but it was not to be. He <lb/>
and his handful of men were no match for the <lb/>
soldiers of Charlestown, and the bloody conflict, <lb/>
though sharp, was short. He led a forlorn hope <lb/>
and failed to realise it, but as "the blood of the <lb/>
martyrs was the seed of the Church," so his blood <lb/>
and that of his followers was more eloquent than <lb/>
aught else could have been, and freedom now reigns <lb/>
throughout the length and breadth of the United <lb/>
States. He was taken prisoner, and for forty-two <lb/>
days he lay wounded and sick unto death. On <lb/>
the 2nd of December they took him out "to be <lb/>
hanged by the neck till he was dead," and about <lb/>
1500 soldiers were stretched over fifteen miles of <lb/>
country to prevent any possibility of rescue. The <lb/>
place of execution was half a mile from the jail, and <lb/>
thither he was driven in a waggon drawn by two <lb/>
white horses.</p>
<p>"This is a lovely country; I have not seen it <lb/>
before," said the old man calmly. The jailer could <lb/>
hardly answer him, so surprised was he to see John <lb/>
<pb n="246" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0299"/>
smiling quietly, as if only taking a drive on that <lb/>
lovely winter's morning.</p>
<p>"You are more cheerful than I am, Captain <lb/>
Brown," said the undertaker.</p>
<p>"Yes," he answered gently; "<hi rend="italic">I ought to be</hi>."</p>
<p>He had given up all for love of the slaves&mdash;his <lb/>
home, his sons, himself&mdash;and now he had come to <lb/>
the border of that beautiful country where Jesus is <lb/>
the King.</p>
<p>Truly he did well to be cheerful.</p>

<p>George Thompson and William Garrison were <lb/>
personal friends of Mr Alcott, and no one could <lb/>
have been more calculated to stir up enthusiasm <lb/>
than the former, whose manly bearing and <reg orig="intel-|lectual">intellectual</reg> <lb/>
conversation we well remember. He was <lb/>
an old man when we knew him in 1871, but hale <lb/>
and handsome to the last. The slave trade was <lb/>
ancient history then, but he could still warm to <lb/>
the subject, though the gallant fight which he had <lb/>
waged and won against the "diabolical traffic in <lb/>
human flesh" seemed wellnigh forgotten in the <lb/>
overwhelming grief in which he was plunged by <lb/>
the death of his son. In spirit, however, they <reg orig="fre-|quently">frequently</reg> <lb/>
communicated. Spiritualism may or may <lb/>
not be a dangerous fable and a blasphemous deceit, <lb/>
<pb n="247" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0300"/>
but to him it was in those days a source of great <lb/>
comfort, and he often spoke to us of the <reg orig="consola-|tion">consolation</reg> <lb/>
which he derived from these conversations <lb/>
with another world.</p>
<p>Louisa has headed 1860 in her Journal as "a <lb/>
year of good luck," but it seems to have been one <lb/>
of exceptional struggle, from which, however, she <lb/>
came out victorious. A series of sensational stories <lb/>
had up to this time brought "grist to the mill," <lb/>
but in the after-days she did not like to think of <lb/>
them, though they were never coarse or unseemly.</p>
<p>Crude and highly seasoned they doubtless were, <lb/>
but if ever an end justified a means, these early <lb/>
productions had ample justification, for they <lb/>
brought many needful comforts to the family for <lb/>
whom she wrote these "pot-boilers"; and, as she <lb/>
so pathetically says, "I know God is always ready <lb/>
to hear, but heaven is so far away in the city, and <lb/>
I so heavy, that I can't fly up to find Him."</p>
<p>In this year Mr Alcott was appointed <reg orig="Super-|intendent">Superintendent</reg> <lb/>
of Schools in Concord, and though the <lb/>
salary attached to the office was not large, it gave <lb/>
him congenial work, and was a civic recognition of <lb/>
his character and abilities, in which his family <lb/>
basked with exceeding joy. 'The Atlantic' now <lb/>
began to take her stories, and she was better paid <lb/>
than heretofore, so that we can sympathise in the <lb/>
cheery hopefulness with which she writes to a <lb/>
friend at this time: "Father continues to stir up <lb/>
<pb n="248" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0301"/>
the schools like a mild pudding-stick, Mother to <lb/>
sing Hebron among her pots and pans, Anna and <lb/>
the Prince Consort &lsqb;Mr and Mrs J. Pratt&rsqb; to bill <lb/>
and coo in the little dovecot, Oranthy Bluggage <lb/>
&lsqb;herself&rsqb; to launch ships on the Atlantic and make <lb/>
a huge blot of herself in working the vessel, Abby <lb/>
&lsqb;May&rsqb; to teach the fine arts and play propriety for <lb/>
the family, and the old house to put its best foot <lb/>
foremost, and hoot at the idea of ever returning to <lb/>
the chaos from which it came."</p>
<p>In April 1861 the little village of Concord was <lb/>
shaken to its foundations by the departure of many <lb/>
of its sons for the war, and Louisa longed more <lb/>
than ever that she had been born a boy. "As I <lb/>
can't fight, I will content myself with working for <lb/>
those who can," she says bravely, and in the <reg orig="inter-|vals">intervals</reg> <lb/>
which literary and household work allowed, <lb/>
she busied herself with making "comforts for men <lb/>
at the front." We all know nowadays, alas! what <lb/>
that phrase means, and can easily imagine the <lb/>
enthusiasm with which the willing fingers worked. <lb/>
For John Brown's daughters were now boarding <lb/>
with the Alcotts, and the children of "St John <lb/>
the Just" were received with open arms by such <lb/>
"a regular anti-slavery set."</p>
<p>As the needles darted to and fro, it needs no <reg orig="im-|agination">imagination</reg> <lb/>
to realise how the busy workers would talk <lb/>
of Harper's Ferry, of Lincoln and of Grant, and <lb/>
of the possible consequences of this terrible strife.</p>
<pb n="249" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0302"/>
<p>The Civil War between the Northern or <lb/>
Federal, and the Southern or Confederate, States <lb/>
lasted for four years, and had it not been for the <lb/>
skill and firmness displayed by Lord <reg orig="Palmer-|ston">Palmerston</reg>, <lb/>
it is more than probable that England <lb/>
also would have been embroiled. The real cause <lb/>
of the contest was the question of slavery, which <lb/>
was as strongly opposed by the Northern as <lb/>
it was supported by the Southern States. The <lb/>
eleven Confederate States were sufficiently <reg orig="power-|ful">powerful</reg> <lb/>
to make their secession from the Union a very <lb/>
serious matter, especially when, by the blockading <lb/>
of the cotton ports by the Northerners, all the raw <lb/>
material from the Southern States was withheld <lb/>
from England. The consequences were terrible to <lb/>
the mill-hands in Lancashire, and the cotton famine <lb/>
which ensued cost the English nation no less than <lb/>
&pound;2,000,000, in spite of the fact that supplies of <lb/>
cotton from India and Egypt were imported long <lb/>
before the end of the war in 1865.</p>
<p>By the complete victory of the North over the <lb/>
South, slavery was for ever abolished, while by the <lb/>
wise and discreet action of President Lincoln the <lb/>
integrity of the Union was preserved.</p>
<p>In his own speeches we have the frank avowal, <lb/>
"My paramount object is to save the Union, and <lb/>
not to save or destroy slavery"; and as Walt <reg orig="Whit-|man">Whitman</reg> <lb/>
says, "He had faults, and showed them in the <lb/>
Presidency, but honesty, goodness, shrewdness, <reg orig="con-|science">conscience</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="250" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0303"/>
and a new virtue &lpar;unknown to other lands, <lb/>
and hardly yet really known here, but the <reg orig="found-|ation">foundation</reg> <lb/>
and tie of all, as the future will grandly <lb/>
develop&rpar; &mdash; Unionism &mdash; in its truest and amplest <lb/>
sense &mdash; formed the hard - pan of his character. <lb/>
These he sealed with his life. The tragic <reg orig="splen-|dour">splendour</reg> <lb/>
of his death, purging, illuminating all, throws <lb/>
round his form, his head, an aureole that will <reg orig="re-|main">remain</reg> <lb/>
and will grow brighter through time, while <lb/>
history lives and love of country lasts."</p>
<p>Since that date Unionism has indeed "grandly <lb/>
developed," until in England it is almost <reg orig="synony-|mous">synonymous</reg> <lb/>
with patriotism and imperialism. The "Peace <lb/>
Congress" has come and gone. Its results are yet <lb/>
to be tested; but as Senator Walcott in his speech <lb/>
at the Washington Senate House so strikingly said, <lb/>
when speaking of the mutual relations of England <lb/>
and America, "Blood is thicker than water, and <lb/>
until a great quarrel divides us&mdash;which Heaven <lb/>
forbid!&mdash;may these two great nations, of the same <lb/>
speech, lineage, and traditions, stand as brothers <lb/>
shoulder to shoulder in the interests of humanity, <lb/>
by a union-compelling peace."</p>
<p>Much against her own inclination, Miss Alcott <lb/>
was persuaded in 1862 to open a kindergarten <lb/>
school, but the routine of teaching was not at all <lb/>
to her taste. Her own education had been very <lb/>
unmethodical, and though she thoroughly <reg orig="under-|stood">understood</reg> <lb/>
children and loved them well, she <reg orig="instinct-|ively">instinctively</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="251" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0304"/>
disliked the necessary discipline of a school <lb/>
too much, ever to become a successful teacher. <lb/>
After five months' trial she joyfully returned to <lb/>
literary work, and "reeled off" stories in the <reg orig="inter-|vals">intervals</reg> <lb/>
between Sewing-bees and Lint-picks for the <lb/>
"boys" at the war.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that with natural gifts which <lb/>
eminently qualified her for a nurse she should <reg orig="pres-|ently">presently</reg> <lb/>
think of volunteering in that capacity. Her <lb/>
proffered services were gladly accepted, and in <lb/>
December 1862 we find her installed in a small <reg orig="mili-|tary">military</reg> <lb/>
hospital at Georgetown, near Washington.</p>
<p>She was there for only six weeks, but they were <lb/>
weeks of thrilling interest, for she loved her work, <lb/>
and her patients found in her an unfailing comforter <lb/>
and friend.</p>
<p>But the crowded, ill - ventilated ward was ill <lb/>
suited to one who had always been accustomed to <lb/>
a simple and wholesome life, and at the end of <lb/>
that six weeks she was stricken down with typhoid <lb/>
fever in its worst form. She says, "I was never ill <lb/>
before this time, and never well afterwards."</p>
<p>The 'Hospital Sketches' written on her recovery <lb/>
"made a great hit," and were perhaps one of the <lb/>
turning-points in her career, not so much for their <lb/>
own literary excellence as for the widespread <reg orig="inter-|est">interest</reg> <lb/>
which they excited both in the subject and in <lb/>
the writer. They were "noticed, talked of, and <lb/>
inquired about," and certainly paved the way for <lb/>
<pb n="252" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0305"/>
the production of 'Moods,' the copyright of which <lb/>
she sold for a handsome sum.</p>
<p>So 1865 dawned triumphantly, and after a short <lb/>
visit to Boston the dream of her life was fulfilled, <lb/>
and she set sail for Europe. During this visit to <lb/>
Boston she was able to enjoy everything, and came <lb/>
in for much attention as the writer of 'Moods,' <lb/>
which, however, met with diverse criticism on <reg orig="ac-|count">account</reg> <lb/>
of the unusual freedom with which <reg orig="matri-|monial">matrimonial</reg> <lb/>
difficulties were discussed in its pages. The <lb/>
city was in the midst of its public rejoicing over <lb/>
the taking of Richmond, after seven days of <reg orig="stren-|uous">strenuous</reg> <lb/>
fight, when, on the 15th of April, the dastardly <lb/>
murder of Abraham Lincoln plunged the whole <lb/>
nation into sadness.</p>
<p>"Never before that startled April morning," says <lb/>
Dr O. W. Holmes, "did such multitudes of men <lb/>
shed tears for the death of one they had never <lb/>
seen, as if with him a friendly presence had been <lb/>
taken away from their lives, leaving them colder <lb/>
and darker. He left behind him a fame beyond <lb/>
that of any conqueror, the memory of a grace <lb/>
higher than that of outward person, and of a <lb/>
gentlemanliness deeper than mere breeding."</p>
<p>Although she was at this time thirty-three years <lb/>
of age, the heart of Louisa Alcott was full of <reg orig="youth-|ful">youthful</reg> <lb/>
buoyancy, and the Journal of her European <lb/>
tour shows us how keenly she enjoyed every step <lb/>
of the way. London especially was a great delight <lb/>
<pb n="253" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0306"/>
to her, and in seeing the places and people of whom <lb/>
she had so often heard and read, the "free and <lb/>
jolly" days passed only too quickly.</p>
<p>July 1866 found her harder at work than ever, <lb/>
for things at home had got into arrears while the <lb/>
chief bread-winner was away, and she returned to <lb/>
find her mother looking "old and sick and tired." <lb/>
So there was much to do&mdash;nursing, sewing, and <lb/>
writing short stories, for which she received <reg orig="num-|erous">numerous</reg> <lb/>
orders, but somewhat inadequate payment. <lb/>
A chance suggestion of her publisher was to the <lb/>
effect that she should write a girls' book, and in <lb/>
spite of her predilection for boys she determined to <lb/>
try. In 1868 the book came out, and little indeed <lb/>
did she imagine what the result of that effort would <lb/>
be, for her own modest estimate of 'Little Women' <lb/>
was only, "It reads better than I expected; but we <lb/>
really lived most of it, and if it succeeds, that will <lb/>
be the reason of it."</p>
<p>We who, thirty-eight years later, are still <reg orig="rejoic-|ing">rejoicing</reg> <lb/>
in its publication, can scarcely remember the <lb/>
hearty welcome with which it was greeted. <reg orig="Prob-|ably">Probably</reg> <lb/>
no book of the kind has met with such <reg orig="imme-|diate">immediate</reg> <lb/>
and enormous success. There is an indefinable <lb/>
charm about it,&mdash;the pathos is so very pathetic, <lb/>
the humour so intensely humorous. There is in it <lb/>
a breeziness which is wholesomely bracing, a strong <lb/>
common-sense which is infectious, and a brave <reg orig="good-|ness">goodness</reg> <lb/>
which tones and glorifies the whole. No <lb/>
<pb n="254" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0307"/>
moral sandwiches are contained in its pages, but <lb/>
the whole book teems with incidents, and the <lb/>
reality with which they are invested testifies to the <lb/>
pen of an expert. Her long apprenticeship to <lb/>
literary work now stood her in good stead, and <lb/>
there is no chapter in 'Little Women' with which <lb/>
we could willingly dispense. It is identified with <lb/>
the pleasantest hours of many a child, and her older <lb/>
readers have cause to thank her for hints and <lb/>
phrases which have become familiar as household <lb/>
words.</p>
<p>If some of our English fiction is as well read in <lb/>
America as in England, it is no less certain that <lb/>
'Little Women' is as popular in Europe as it is on <lb/>
the other side of the Atlantic. It has been <reg orig="trans-|lated">translated</reg> <lb/>
into several languages, and in Holland <reg orig="especi-|ally">especially</reg> <lb/>
she is so much esteemed that her Dutch <lb/>
translator says, "Miss Alcott was and is so much <lb/>
beloved here by her books, that you could scarce <lb/>
find a girl that had not read one or more of <lb/>
them."</p>
<p>Though none of her books has attained as much <lb/>
popularity as 'Little Women,' and its sequel, 'Good <lb/>
Wives'&mdash;published in 1869&mdash;there is probably no <lb/>
writer, whether English or American, who is better <lb/>
loved by those for whom she specially wrote. If <lb/>
stern and childless critics may say that the fine <lb/>
line between colloquial ease and slang is sometimes <lb/>
passed, we are ready to forgive it for the sake of <lb/>
<pb n="255" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0308"/>
the purity of her sentiments and the touches of <lb/>
tenderness which redeem the exuberance of her <lb/>
expressions.</p>
<p>Success was to her no selfish dream, but a means <lb/>
to an end, and that end the comfort of her family, <lb/>
and especially of the mother whom she loved so <lb/>
deeply. Over 1,000,000 copies of her works have <lb/>
been already sold, and still they sell and will <reg orig="con-|tinue">continue</reg> <lb/>
to sell, for no writer has yet risen to take <lb/>
her place.</p>
<p>As she says somewhere, "The 'little women' <lb/>
helped their rejected sisters to good places where <lb/>
once they went a-begging," and people began to <lb/>
haunt the house of the now noted authoress, whose <lb/>
work never abated, in spite of ill-health and low <lb/>
spirits. A delightful trip to Europe with her sister <lb/>
May and a friend, in 1870, did much to restore her <lb/>
usual hopefulness; but while she was in Rome the <lb/>
news of the death of her beloved brother-in-law, <lb/>
Mr John Pratt, came as a terrible shock, and she <lb/>
at once set to work on 'Little Men,' in order that <lb/>
she might provide fresh funds for the widowed Nan <lb/>
and the two boys, to whom she at once decided, <lb/>
"I must be a father now." The home in Concord, <lb/>
where they subsequently lived, was partially bought <lb/>
by Louisa, who supplemented the savings of Mr <lb/>
Pratt in order to secure a home for his widow and <lb/>
children. In June of 1871 she returned to <reg orig="Con-|cord">Concord</reg>, <lb/>
but the dampness of the climate tried her <lb/>
<pb n="256" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0309"/>
sorely aching limbs, and two months later she <lb/>
retired to quiet lodgings in Boston, where she was <lb/>
always able to work with more persistence and <lb/>
rapidity than at home.</p>
<p>The dream of twenty years was more than <reg orig="ful-|filled">fulfilled</reg>, <lb/>
and at forty she had secured the <reg orig="independ-|ence">independence</reg> <lb/>
of the family, paid every debt, and settled her <lb/>
mother in a pleasant home, "with no work, no care, <lb/>
no poverty to worry, but peace and comfort all <lb/>
about her."</p>
<p>But the resources of the "golden goose" were <lb/>
by no means exhausted, and Roberts, Low, and <lb/>
Scribner clamoured for her books, while <reg orig="lion-|hunters">lion-hunters</reg> <lb/>
dodged her footsteps and waylaid her in <lb/>
odd corners. She was too thoroughly human not to <lb/>
enjoy the success for which she had so longed and <lb/>
laboured, but she was often tired of it all, and the <lb/>
nerve-exhaustion which followed some of her most <lb/>
delightful experiences made even pleasure toilsome.</p>
<p>Tall and striking-looking, though not really <reg orig="hand-|some">handsome</reg>, <lb/>
full of ready wit and quick sympathy, it is <lb/>
not surprising that she was a general favourite with <lb/>
rich and poor, old and young. Her quick and <lb/>
observant intelligence assimilated the varied <reg orig="ele-|ments">elements</reg> <lb/>
that came into her life, and her best work <lb/>
is that in which she speaks with artistic simplicity <lb/>
of her own experiences. We are not surprised to <lb/>
hear that she had several good offers of marriage, <lb/>
but her inclinations never lay in that direction. <lb/>
<pb n="257" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0310"/>
Love of her family was all - sufficing, and to all <lb/>
intents and purposes she was the helpful son and <lb/>
brother which in the old childish days she had <lb/>
"made believe" to be.</p>
<p>'A Modern Mephistopheles,' published in 1877, <lb/>
is so absolutely unlike anything else that Miss <lb/>
Alcott has written &mdash; so self-evidently influenced <lb/>
by reading rather than by experience &mdash; that it <lb/>
stands apart from all her other books. Being <lb/>
published in the "No-name Series" which Roberts <lb/>
Bros. were bringing out at this time, it created <lb/>
considerable interest, and, among others, the son <lb/>
of Nathaniel Hawthorne was suspected of its <lb/>
authorship. It is a very singular book, of much <lb/>
power and originality of plot, but not "<reg orig="con-|vincing">convincing</reg>" <lb/>
enough to be considered as a thorough <lb/>
success.</p>
<p>It is written from outside only, and though she <lb/>
had much imagination, Louisa Alcott could not <lb/>
suddenly project her healthy mind into such <reg orig="un-|usual">unusual</reg> <lb/>
scenes and circumstances. She was now <lb/>
forty-five years of age, and the style which was <lb/>
most natural to her, and in which she achieved <lb/>
her greatest successes, was the result of long <lb/>
apprenticeship and much practice.</p>
<p>It is rather remarkable to notice how often <lb/>
writers who have succeeded in one branch of <lb/>
literature, long to use their talents in another. In <lb/>
February 1877 we find her writing in her Journal, <lb/>
<pb n="258" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0311"/>
"Tired of providing moral pap for the young: <lb/>
long to write a novel, but cannot get time <lb/>
enough"; and the words do but echo the <reg orig="aspira-|tion">aspiration</reg> <lb/>
of the late Mrs Emma Marshall, who on <lb/>
several occasions lamented to us that she was <lb/>
too busy to devote herself to serious fiction&mdash;if <lb/>
such a phrase be allowable. She, too, never varied <lb/>
her style; and though her prolific <reg orig="writings&mdash;num-|bering">writings&mdash;numbering</reg> <lb/>
over two hundred&mdash;found a ready sale and <lb/>
many admiring readers among the young, we can <lb/>
easily believe that she found it monotonous to <lb/>
cater solely for one class, and, if only as a matter <lb/>
of experiment, would gladly have written on more <lb/>
ambitious lines. But in both cases, though the <lb/>
relationships were different, it was "the family" of <lb/>
which both had to think, and money, honestly <lb/>
earned, being to both the end hoped for, there was <lb/>
no time for experiments when simpler work was so <lb/>
successful.</p>
<p>'Moods' and 'Mephistopheles' stand apart <lb/>
among Miss Alcott's works, and in strange <reg orig="con-|trast">contrast</reg> <lb/>
to the latter were 'My Girls' and 'Under <lb/>
the Lilacs'&mdash;written under the very shadow of <lb/>
death, and finished by the bedside of her dying <lb/>
mother.</p>
<p>Mrs Alcott slipped peacefully away on the 25th <lb/>
of November 1877, and even the devoted daughter <lb/>
was "glad when the last weary breath was drawn <lb/>
and silence came." But for the time all motive <lb/>
<pb n="259" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0312"/>
seemed to have gone out of her life, and it is from <lb/>
the depths of a very sad heart that we find her <lb/>
writing in her Journal, "My only comfort is that I <lb/>
could make her last years comfortable, and lift off <lb/>
the burdens she had carried so bravely all these <lb/>
years. I think I shall soon follow her, and am <lb/>
quite ready to go, now she no longer needs me." <lb/>
The poem In Memoriam, written by her at this <lb/>
time, is very beautiful, and worthy of a place in <lb/>
any anthology. Graceful fancy and devout faith <lb/>
are in it, but above all there is the tender and <lb/>
reverent affection which had made sweet every <lb/>
hardship which they had borne together.</p>
<p>In a sketch such as this, where we have <reg orig="en-|deavoured">endeavoured</reg> <lb/>
to show something of the character of <lb/>
Louisa Alcott in its varied developments, it may <lb/>
be interesting to quote it at length, and those <lb/>
who can "read between the lines" will see how <lb/>
characteristic the verses are, of all that is most <lb/>
conspicuous in her prose writings.</p>

<p>Two years later we find the following entry in <lb/>
her Journal, which in its touching descriptiveness <lb/>
is typical of Miss Alcott in one of her tenderest <lb/>
moods:&mdash;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"October</hi> 8, 1879. Dear Marmee's birthday. <lb/>
Never forgotten. Lovely day. Go to Sleepy <lb/>
Hollow with flowers. Her grave is green; <reg orig="black-|berry">blackberry</reg> <lb/>
vines with red leaves trail over it. A little <lb/>
white stone with her initials is at the head, and <lb/>
among the tall grass over her breast a little bird <lb/>
had made a nest; empty now, but a pretty symbol <lb/>
of the refuge that tender bosom always was for <lb/>
all feeble and sweet things. Her favourite asters <lb/>
bloomed all about, and the pines sang overhead. <lb/>
So she and dear Beth are quietly asleep in God's <lb/>
acre, and we remember them more tenderly with <lb/>
each year that brings us nearer them and home."</p>
<p>But even her mother's death was not such a <lb/>
mental shock to Louisa as that of her youngest <lb/>
sister. The sad news was broken to her by <lb/>
Emerson, "our best and tenderest friend," but <lb/>
such a blow to such a nature was wellnigh <reg orig="over-|whelming">overwhelming</reg> <lb/>
just then, when her heart was so lonely <lb/>
and sore.</p>
<p>Abba May, the youngest of the Alcotts, whom we <lb/>
<pb n="262" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0315"/>
all know so well as "Amy" in 'Little Women,' <lb/>
was the pet of the whole family. From her earliest <lb/>
years Louisa had educated her out of her own <lb/>
earnings, and it was she who sent her to the School <lb/>
of Design, to the Boston School of Anatomy, and <lb/>
for two years of art studying in Paris and London <lb/>
in 1873 and 1876 respectively. May Alcott's <lb/>
artistic gifts were considerable, and with the best <lb/>
opportunities for developing them, she improved <lb/>
rapidly. One of her pictures of "still life" was <lb/>
accepted by the Paris Salon&mdash;well hung and well <lb/>
praised. This event gave great happiness to all at <lb/>
home, but to no one was it such a source of pride <lb/>
and pleasure as to the devoted and unselfish sister <lb/>
whose chief joy lay in helping others. Her Journal <lb/>
says, "I am proud to have her show what she can <lb/>
do, and have her depend upon no one but me. <lb/>
Success to little Raphael! My dull winter is much <lb/>
cheered by her happiness and success."</p>
<p>This entry is dated December 1876, but "little <lb/>
Raphael" never came home again.</p>
<p>While in London she became acquainted with <lb/>
a Swiss gentleman of congenial temperament and <lb/>
tastes. His kindness and sympathy during the <lb/>
sad time of bereavement, caused by her mother's <lb/>
death in October 1877, soon ripened into a love <lb/>
which was warmly reciprocated. Their simple <lb/>
marriage took place in March 1878, and they <lb/>
started for Paris almost immediately. Her <reg orig="art-|less">artless</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="263" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0316"/>
pleasure in the new life is most <reg orig="ingenu-|ously">ingenuously</reg> <lb/>
told in her letters, in which she says that <lb/>
her sisters at home would not recognise her, <lb/>
she has "become so sweet in this atmosphere of <lb/>
happiness."</p>
<p>But the joy of her loving relatives in her <lb/>
"idyllic dream" was soon overshadowed by <reg orig="in-|tensest">intensest</reg> <lb/>
anxiety on her behalf, and two weeks <lb/>
after the birth of her baby girl she passed <lb/>
peacefully away&mdash;December 29, 1879.</p>
<p>"In all the troubles of my life," writes Louisa, <lb/>
"I never had one so hard to bear, for the <lb/>
sudden fall from such high happiness to such a <lb/>
depth of sorrow finds me unprepared to accept <lb/>
or bear it as I ought."</p>
<p>It was with a heart full of grief that she <lb/>
finished 'Jack and Jill'; but still she writes <lb/>
bravely, "I trust the misery did not get into <lb/>
the story, but I'm afraid it is not so gay as <lb/>
I meant most of it to be. A sweeter little <lb/>
romance has just ended in Paris than any I can <lb/>
ever make, and the sad facts of life leave me no <lb/>
heart for cheerful fiction."</p>
<p>During the next few years she devoted herself <lb/>
chiefly to the care of May's baby, the precious <lb/>
legacy left by the dying mother to the sister <lb/>
who had been her providence from babyhood, <lb/>
and by whom she knew that equal tenderness <lb/>
would be lavished upon her child.</p>
<pb n="264" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0317"/>
<p>The little niece was indeed an unspeakable <lb/>
comfort.</p>
<p>"The touch of the dear little hands seems to <lb/>
take away the bitterness of grief. The sight of <lb/>
the little head is like sunshine to me;" and the <lb/>
daily unfolding of the sweet nature was a constant <lb/>
interest and delight both to Mr and Miss Alcott.</p>
<p>'Jo's Boys,' 'Lulu's Library,' and many short <lb/>
stories, were subsequently published at intervals; <lb/>
but they were the results of intermittent work, <lb/>
for she was "too busy singing lullabies" to write <lb/>
much, and though the charm of her style never <lb/>
fails, there is not the same overflowing exuberance <lb/>
of spirits that is so conspicuous in her earlier <lb/>
writings.</p>
<p>The sudden death of R. W. Emerson in 1882 <lb/>
was the last keen sorrow that she was called <lb/>
upon to bear,&mdash;he who had helped her most of <lb/>
all, by his life, his books, his society, from the <lb/>
time when, as a child, she had "browsed" in his <lb/>
library and sung Mignon's song under his window. <lb/>
He had been her hero always, and a worthy one. <lb/>
In shadow and in sunshine his untiring friendship <lb/>
had never failed her.</p>
<p>"I can never tell all he has been to me," she <lb/>
exclaims, and probably many a one might say <lb/>
the same, who has been helped through weary <lb/>
hours of self-conflict by his manly outspokenness <lb/>
and large-hearted sympathetic charity.</p>
<pb n="265" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0318"/>
<p>Dr O. W. Holmes touchingly says of him: <lb/>
"Judged by his life, Emerson comes very near <lb/>
our best ideal of humanity; and if He who knew <lb/>
what was in man had wandered from door to <lb/>
door in New England as of old in Palestine, we <lb/>
can well believe that one of the thresholds which <lb/>
'those blessed feet' would have crossed, to hallow <lb/>
and receive its welcome, would have been that of <lb/>
the lovely and quiet home of Emerson."</p>
<p>A few months later Mr Alcott was stricken <lb/>
with paralysis; but for six years he lingered, <lb/>
slowly declining, "changed from a hale, handsome <lb/>
old man into this pathetic wreck."</p>
<p>Still the brave daughter worked on, though <lb/>
forbidden by the doctor to work at much length <lb/>
or at anything requiring thought or labour. It <lb/>
was second nature to her to love herself last, <lb/>
but the time came when the tired nerves could <lb/>
no longer bear the strain of family life and when <lb/>
she longed to be alone. "I don't want to live <lb/>
if I can't be of use," was her cry, and so on to <lb/>
the end she laboured with brain and hand.</p>
<p>In December 1886 she went to live at <reg orig="Rox-|bury">Roxbury</reg>, <lb/>
where, in the quiet home of her friend <lb/>
Dr Rhoda Lawrence, she found, during the last <lb/>
fifteen months of her life, the rest which had <lb/>
now become absolutely essential.</p>
<p>To be living apart from her family was terrible <lb/>
to her, but her nerves were so utterly prostrated <lb/>
<pb n="266" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0319"/>
by overwork that the companionship of even those <lb/>
whom she best loved had become an impossibility.</p>
<p>Every week she drove in to "kiss my people <lb/>
for fifteen minutes"; but her father's life on earth <lb/>
was wellnigh ended, and early in March 1888 she <lb/>
drove back from what she felt to be her last visit.</p>
<p>Full of the sadness of that parting, she forgot <lb/>
some necessary precautions for herself, and on the <lb/>
morning of the next day she awoke in great agony. <lb/>
Brain trouble rapidly set in, and in a few hours <lb/>
all was over on this side heaven. She never <lb/>
knew until she got there that her father had <lb/>
gone on before. By her express wish the funeral <lb/>
service was very simple. It was held in her <lb/>
father's room at Boston, and only a few of her <lb/>
immediate circle were allowed to attend.</p>
<p>From all the busy bustle of the city they carried <lb/>
her to Concord, that ideal little New England <lb/>
town where, in the beautiful cemetery of "Sleepy <lb/>
Hollow," so many of America's "good workmen" <lb/>
lie resting: past the meadows where she and her <lb/>
sisters had played out the "Pilgrim's Progress," <lb/>
where the river Musketaquid lounges its lazy way <lb/>
till it is lost in the waters of the Merrimac; past <lb/>
the ponds of Walden, which had been huge lakes <lb/>
to the childish eyes, and the green hills that had <lb/>
seemed so close against the sky.</p>
<p>Reverently they laid her body across the feet <lb/>
of her father, mother, and "little Beth," so that <lb/>
<pb n="267" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0320"/>
even in death she might seem to take care of <lb/>
those whom in life she had so lovingly cherished.</p>
<p>The sunshine of early spring touched the <lb/>
mountain-peaks into glory, and the clouds danced <lb/>
over the hill-tops just as in the old days when <lb/>
the little quartette of Alcott girls had "played <lb/>
pilgrims" among the pine groves. For three of <lb/>
them the gates of the Celestial City had opened, <lb/>
and within the presence of the Master they now <lb/>
stood in "clothes of immortality." Rejoicingly <lb/>
they gather together once more <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="hang">"In the broad blessed light and perfect air, with meadows, <lb/>

<p>It is a truism that personal testimony has a <lb/>
unique value in convincingness. It always has <lb/>
been considered so&mdash;the mythical Dives was only <lb/>
voicing this belief when with such thrilling <reg orig="human-|ness">humanness</reg> <lb/>
he prayed that it might be given to his <lb/>
brethren. It always will be considered so,&mdash;do <lb/>
not we in our daily doings contrive to link <reg orig="our-|selves">ourselves</reg>, <lb/>
sometimes almost unconsciously, with those <lb/>
persons and things the character of whom and <lb/>
the value of which have been vouched for by men <lb/>
who have respectively proved them?</p>
<p>The fact forced itself very pleasantly upon us <lb/>
on receipt of the following kind letter from Mr <lb/>
<pb n="268" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0321"/>
F. B. Sanborn, which accompanied a photograph <lb/>
of Louisa Alcott for special reproduction in this <lb/>
volume.</p>
<p>Mr Sanborn was one of the four privileged <lb/>
mourners who in 1858 carried little "Beth" from <lb/>
her old home, in the orchard - house at Concord, <lb/>
to the new one at Sleepy Hollow, chosen by <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg>. <lb/>
The other three bearers were Ralph Waldo <lb/>
Emerson, Henry Thoreau of Walden, and Mr <lb/>
John Pratt &lpar;"John Brooke" of 'Little Women'&rpar;, <lb/>
who afterwards married Anna Alcott. This is not <lb/>
the only time that Mr Sanborn's friendship is <lb/>
mentioned in Louisa Alcott's letters and diaries, <lb/>
and always in connection with men who have <lb/>
made Concord a name of quite special interest in <lb/>
the literary annals of America. In December <lb/>
1859 John Brown of Harper's Ferry &lpar;"St John <lb/>
the Just," as his friends affectionately styled him&rpar; <lb/>
was executed as a common malefactor, and when <lb/>
all Concord gathered at an indignation meeting, <lb/>
R. W. Emerson, H. D. Thoreau, Bronson Alcott, <lb/>
and F. B. Sanborn spoke,&mdash;"full of reverence and <lb/>
admiration for the martyr." If a man may be <lb/>
known by his companions, then F. B. Sanborn <lb/>
must possess a personality as delightful as those <lb/>
better-known Americans of whom he writes so <lb/>
eloquently, for the Hawthornes, Theodore Parker, <lb/>
Garrison, Channing, and Phillips also formed part <lb/>
of that brilliant circle which seemed centrifugally <lb/>
<pb n="269" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0322"/>
to draw into it all that was fresh, strong, and <lb/>
beautiful in those days.</p>
<p>Mr Sanborn tells us of the photograph that&mdash;</p>
<p>"It was given me by Louisa in the days nearly <lb/>
forty years since, when I used to join her in charades <lb/>
and private theatricals, and in the school <reg orig="celebra-|tions">celebrations</reg> <lb/>
under her father's direction as Superintendent <lb/>
of our Concord schools. The exact date I cannot <lb/>
fix, but it is either just before or just after her <lb/>
first great literary success in 'Little Women' <lb/>
&lpar;1868&rpar;, which she wrote in her father's <reg orig="orchard-|house">orchard-house</reg>, <lb/>
where a dozen years later we opened, <lb/>
under her father's direction, the Summer School <lb/>
of Philosophy and Literature. I also send you <lb/>
in another cover an article of mine in 'The New <lb/>
York Critic' of April last, which contains one <lb/>
priceless anecdote about the family in its extreme <lb/>
poverty&mdash;the letter of Miss Robie&mdash;never before <lb/>
published, which may be of service to you in your <lb/>
forthcoming chapter on Miss Alcott. It has been <lb/>
in my hands for at least thirty years, but I have <lb/>
found no reason for printing it before.</p>
<p>"Louisa was never thoroughly well after <reg orig="re-|covering">recovering</reg> <lb/>
from the almost fatal hospital fever. <lb/>
Naturally she was of abundant animal spirits, <lb/>
buoyant and resolute, and all through her youth, <lb/>
save in certain moods of depression, the gayest <lb/>
of girls and the life of the company of the young <lb/>
&mdash;essentially cheerful and just."</p>
<pb n="270" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0323"/>
<p>This personal testimony to the charm of "Jo" <lb/>
must surely warm the hearts of all those who <lb/>
have been cheered into laughter or softened into <lb/>
tears by the humour and pathos of 'Little Women' <lb/>
or 'Under the Lilacs.'</p>
<p>The "priceless anecdote" told by Miss Robie <lb/>
speaks for itself. Writing from the Alcott cottage, <lb/>
in December 1841, when the family were very poor <lb/>
but very generous, she says:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I did not dare to go to Concord without <lb/>
carrying tea and coffee and a small piece of <lb/>
cooked meat, in case my wayward stomach should <lb/>
crave it, which last article was a little piece of <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">&agrave; la mode</hi> beef. Thus provided, I arrived at the <lb/>
Alcott cottage just after dark of a Friday evening. <lb/>
I got into the house before they heard me, and <lb/>
found them seated around their bread and water. <lb/>
I had a most cordial welcome from Mrs Alcott <lb/>
and the children. She said to me: 'O you dear <lb/>
creature! you are the one I should have picked <lb/>
out of all the good people in Boston. How <lb/>
thankful I am to see you!' I had a <reg orig="comfort-|able">comfortable</reg> <lb/>
cup of tea in a few minutes, for I did not <lb/>
dare to go without. &lpar;They then opened a bundle, <lb/>
in which were clothes for the children, sent by <lb/>
Mrs J. S. of Boston.&rpar; Mr Alcott sat looking <lb/>
on like a philosopher. 'There,' said he, 'I told <lb/>
you that you need not be anxious about <reg orig="cloth-|ing">clothing</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="271" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0324"/>
for the children; you see it has come as I <lb/>
said.'</p>
<p>"Mrs Alcott wanted comfort and counsel; for, <lb/>
though cheerful and uncomplaining, things had <lb/>
got pretty low. Mr Alcott was evidently not <lb/>
well, and she was quite anxious about him, and <lb/>
expressed some fears that the little sympathy <lb/>
and encouragement he received in regard to his <lb/>
views would depress him beyond what he could <lb/>
bear. However, after a good talk and a good <lb/>
crying-spell, her spirits rallied, and all was bright <lb/>
again. She told me of a miserable poor woman <lb/>
in her neighbourhood, who had just lost a drunken <lb/>
husband and was in a poor hovel with four children, <lb/>
and she had been aiding her in a small way to <lb/>
a little meal, and encouraging her to have a good <lb/>
heart and keep out of the workhouse, and had <lb/>
interested other neighbours in her behalf. She <lb/>
said it seemed as if this poor family had been <lb/>
brought to her notice to show her how much better <lb/>
her own situation was, and to give a change to <lb/>
her feelings by looking about and doing what she <lb/>
could to assist her.</p>
<p>"I went with her one day to see the family. <lb/>
In the course of the visit the woman mentioned <lb/>
Mr Alcott. 'I did not know he had been to see <lb/>
you.' 'Oh, yes; he was here yesterday and the <lb/>
day before, and sawed up some wood that had <lb/>
been sent me. I had engaged Mr Somebody to <lb/>
<pb n="272" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0325"/>
saw it for me, and did some sewing for his wife <lb/>
to pay for it.' Said Mrs Alcott, 'Then Mr A.'s <lb/>
sawing it did not do you much good?' 'Oh, <lb/>
yes; they said they had as lief give me the <lb/>
money for it, so I had it to buy some meal.'</p>
<p>"Whilst I was at Mrs Alcott's, of course I saw <lb/>
no meat, nor butter, nor cheese, and only coarse <lb/>
brown sugar, bread, potatoes, apples, squash, and <lb/>
simple puddings: of these materials were the <lb/>
staples for food. I was obliged to have tea <reg orig="oc-|casionally">occasionally</reg>, <lb/>
but, except that, I lived as they did, <lb/>
for I could not have the heart or the stomach to <lb/>
take out my beef. Mr Alcott thought his wife <lb/>
did wrong to prepare the tea for me. The Alcotts <lb/>
had just begun to do with two meals a-day, that <lb/>
the children might have the pleasure of carrying <lb/>
once a - week a basket of something from their <lb/>
humble savings to the poor family. Now the <lb/>
saving must be made for themselves.</p>
<p>"Mr Alcott said he could not live with debt <lb/>
burdening them in this way&mdash;that they must live <lb/>
simpler still. He started up and said he would <lb/>
go into the woods and chop for his neighbours, <lb/>
and in that way get his fuel. He has since entered <lb/>
upon this work."</p>
<p>If people like these be the practical outcome of <lb/>
"Transcendental" principles, then would to God <lb/>
that we all were both almost and altogether such <lb/>
as they&mdash;except those "cranks."</p>

<ornament type="line"/>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Of</hi> all the woman - poets that England has yet <lb/>
produced&mdash;and they are neither feeble nor few&mdash; <lb/>
Christina Rossetti stands out pre - eminently as <lb/>
the most religious. Her thoughts instinctively <lb/>
ran in religious grooves. Now and again her <lb/>
intense love of symbolism carries her into quaint <lb/>
fancies and dainty turns of literary expression, <lb/>
while the restrained passion of "The Sonnet of <lb/>
Sonnets" makes us realise that she knew <reg orig="some-|thing">something</reg> <lb/>
of the breadth and depth and height of <lb/>
human love; but, in the main, she dwells chiefly <lb/>
upon the inner life of man: the life hidden in <lb/>
God is her favourite theme.</p>
<p>And we need be no rabid adherents to the <lb/>
doctrines of heredity and environment if we trace <lb/>
the source of her mystic piety to the influences <lb/>
which surrounded her.</p>
<p>Christina Georgina Rossetti was the youngest <lb/>
child of Gabriel Rossetti, the poet - patriot of <lb/>
Italy, and Frances Lavinia, the daughter of <lb/>
<pb n="276" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0331"/>
Gaetano Polidori. Her upbringing was strangely <lb/>
different to that of most children,&mdash;in a home <lb/>
permeated with art and poetry, and which also <lb/>
had about it a romantic atmosphere of mystery <lb/>
and patriotism. The proscription of Gabriel <lb/>
Rossetti by King Ferdinand rendered his further <lb/>
residence in Italy impossible; but he would have <lb/>
found great difficulty in leaving the country had <lb/>
it not been for the kindness of the admiral in <lb/>
charge of a portion of the British fleet then <lb/>
stationed in the Bay of Naples. This timely <lb/>
friend assisted his flight by lending him an <lb/>
English uniform, and himself escorting the <reg orig="pro-|scribed">proscribed</reg> <lb/>
patriot to the safety of a steamer bound <lb/>
for English shores. Educated as a Roman <lb/>
Catholic and yearning to believe, he was yet <lb/>
destitute of the capacity of yielding himself to <lb/>
the simplicity of the Gospel story. But the <lb/>
poetry of religion, its beauty and its symbolism, <lb/>
appealed strongly to a nature that was keenly <lb/>
alive to all beauty; and though for many years <lb/>
he was unable to rejoice in the Light, it was <lb/>
an unseen Influence that regulated his life and <lb/>
conduct unconsciously to himself, while the poems <lb/>
of his later years show that his passive attitude <lb/>
towards Christianity had entirely changed.</p>
<p>Mrs Rossetti possessed intellectual gifts of no <lb/>
mean order, and it is authoritatively stated that, <lb/>
had she not been content to subserve the still <lb/>
<pb n="277" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0332"/>
greater endowments of her clever family, she too <lb/>
would have made for herself an honoured place <lb/>
in the world of letters. There have been many <lb/>
mothers who have voluntarily allowed themselves <lb/>
to be eclipsed by their children, but few who <lb/>
have produced such a brilliant quartette as gathered <lb/>
round her while she told her delightful stories or <lb/>
read to them from the masterpieces of English <lb/>
and Italian literature. Domestic dulness must <lb/>
have been unknown to any of them, but the <lb/>
general atmosphere was not conducive to that <lb/>
"mirth and merriment which bars a thousand <lb/>
ills and lengthens life." As circumstantial <reg orig="evi-|dence">evidence</reg> <lb/>
of this, we notice that the sonnet entitled <lb/>
"Vanity of Vanities" was written before Christina <lb/>
was seventeen.</p>
<p>Maria Francesca, the eldest child, was scarcely <lb/>
less gifted than Christina, and "a born leader." <lb/>
Her 'Shadow of Dante' is a classic of its kind; <lb/>
and though the brothers considered Christina "the <lb/>
genius of the family," there is no doubt that the <lb/>
spontaneous reverence with which the latter <lb/>
regarded her sister was well deserved.</p>
<p>She subsequently merged her literary tastes and <lb/>
domestic cares in the interests of an Anglican <lb/>
sisterhood, and entering the community of All <lb/>
Saints, Margaret Street, in 1873, she died there <lb/>
three years later at the age of fifty-six.</p>
<p>Dante Gabriel was the second of this <reg orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="278" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0333"/>
family, each of whom inherited the artistic <lb/>
temperament which would be likely to accrue <lb/>
from a long pedigree of Italian progenitors. The <lb/>
pictures of the poet-painter will never be "popular," <lb/>
in the general acceptance of the word; but there <lb/>
is an under-sidedness to them all which will make <lb/>
them psychological studies to men and women <lb/>
who care nothing for their pictorial worth.</p>
<p>Of all the family, perhaps the only "practical" <lb/>
member was William Mitchell, who happily is <lb/>
still with us, and who unites a keen enthusiasm <lb/>
for the Arts with a carefully balanced judgment, <lb/>
and a good temper which nothing seems able to <lb/>
disturb.</p>
<p>In such a circle as this Christina grew up, and, <lb/>
as the junior of such a family, environed with <lb/>
such unusual influences, it is small wonder that <lb/>
she early developed unusual tendencies.</p>
<p>Given a father who was a poet patriot, a sister <lb/>
who was a religious mystic, and brothers who <lb/>
were respectively a poet painter and a poetic critic, <lb/>
the result is&mdash;Christina Rossetti; whose poems are <lb/>
equal in many respects to any that English <reg orig="litera-|ture">literature</reg> <lb/>
can show, whose prose writings teem with <lb/>
religious symbolism and the mystic beauty of <lb/>
medieval days, and who yet possessed a clear <lb/>
common - sense, a stern devotion to duty, and a <lb/>
fortitude under suffering which never failed.</p>
<p>Her first verses were written in 1842, and were <lb/>
<pb n="279" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0334"/>
printed in 1847 at her grandfather's private press, <lb/>
in conjunction with many others composed between <lb/>
the age of twelve and sixteen. They are full of <lb/>
poetic promise, and we cannot wonder at the <lb/>
pride and pleasure with which they were regarded <lb/>
by all the members of the family.</p>
<p>The publication of 'The Germ' in 1850 gave a <lb/>
further impetus, if indeed any were needed, to <lb/>
her poetic tendencies. This periodical, which only <lb/>
ran its brief course for four months, was the <reg orig="out-|come">outcome</reg> <lb/>
of the formation of "The Pre - Raphaelite <lb/>
Brotherhood,"&mdash;the "sacred seven" who were <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
to make the world ring with their names.<ref target="n7" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
<note id="n7" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>These were William Woolner, Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, <lb/>
James Collinson, Frederick George Stephens, and the two Rossetti <lb/>
brothers.</p></note>
 <lb/>
Although Christina, with many of the other writers <lb/>
for 'The Germ,' was debarred from actual <reg orig="member-|ship">membership</reg> <lb/>
in the brotherhood, she was one of the <reg orig="prin-|cipal">principal</reg> <lb/>
contributors to the newspaper. William <lb/>
Rossetti was unanimously chosen as its editor, <lb/>
and the whole scheme had its origin in the <lb/>
active and enthusiastic brain of Dante Gabriel.</p>
<p>At this time he was only twenty - one; and <lb/>
when we notice the names of its youthful <reg orig="con-|tributors">contributors</reg> <lb/>
&mdash; nearly <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of whom have attained to <lb/>
more than mere temporary fame&mdash;we cannot but <lb/>
regret its short-lived existence. To this paper, <lb/>
under the pseudonym of "Ellen Alleyn," Christina <lb/>
<pb n="280" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0335"/>
contributed no less than seven <reg orig='poems&mdash;"Dream-|land'>poems&mdash;"Dreamland</reg>" <lb/>
being perhaps the best known among them; <lb/>
and when we remember that she was then only <lb/>
nineteen years of age, their interest and value is <lb/>
accentuated. This exquisite little lyric is a <reg orig="mys-|tical">mystical</reg> <lb/>
allegory, having within it an absolute faith <lb/>
in the "perfect peace" which lies beyond the <lb/>
charmed sleep He gives to His beloved. Several <lb/>
of her poems subsequently appeared in other <lb/>
magazines, but it was not until the publication <lb/>
of 'Goblin Market and other Poems' that much <lb/>
public attention was directed to their gifted <lb/>
writer.</p>
<p>There had been much anxiety in the little <reg orig="house-|hold">household</reg> <lb/>
for many years, when in 1853 it was at last <lb/>
determined that Mr and Mrs Rossetti should try, <lb/>
with Christina's help, to set up a school at Frome <lb/>
in Somersetshire. The study of Italian had "gone <lb/>
out of fashion" in London, and the high-souled <lb/>
refugee was neither strong enough nor rich enough <lb/>
to bear the strain put upon his resources by the <lb/>
loss of pupils and the then recently developed <lb/>
craze for things "made in Germany." So for <lb/>
eleven months they tried school - keeping in the <lb/>
country, while the remaining members of the <lb/>
family taught and studied in London. But the <lb/>
experiment was a failure, and in March of the <reg orig="fol-|lowing">following</reg> <lb/>
year &lpar;1854&rpar; they returned to London, where, <lb/>
only a month later, the much - revered husband <lb/>
<pb n="281" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0336"/>
and father passed on to "where beyond these <lb/>
voices there is peace."</p>
<p>These eleven months, however, though sad and <lb/>
uncongenial enough, were probably months of <reg orig="con-|siderable">considerable</reg> <lb/>
benefit to Christina; for it was only <lb/>
during that time that she had any lengthened <lb/>
experience of country life, and it is probable that <lb/>
some of her beautiful similes are drawn from <lb/>
recollections of its sights and sounds.</p>
<p>In spite of the influence wielded by the other <lb/>
members of the family, it was her mother who <lb/>
was the great object of Christina's devotion, and <lb/>
to her all her works save two are dedicated. <lb/>
That mother's sweet influence dominated her own <lb/>
religious sentiments, but she knew nothing of <reg orig="in-|tolerance">intolerance</reg> <lb/>
in her outlook upon "other men and <lb/>
other minds"; only seeing, in the various forms of <lb/>
belief, their respective usefulness in bringing into <lb/>
special prominence important points of doctrine <lb/>
which would be unnoticed were all sects merged <lb/>
into one dead level of religiosity. It is to this <lb/>
dear mother that she inscribes her 'Poems,' in <lb/>
words full of graceful and grateful affection, the <lb/>
last of which are as follows:&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"So because you love me, and because</l>
<l rend="indent">I love you, Mother, I have woven a wreath</l>
<l>Of rhymes wherewith to crown your honoured name.</l>
<l rend="indent">In you not fourscore years can dim the flame</l>
<l rend="indent">Of love, whose blessed glow transcends the laws</l>
<l>Of time and change and mortal life and death."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<pb n="282" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0337"/>
<p>Her last prose work, 'The Face of the Deep,' <lb/>
published in 1892, which is a commentary upon the <lb/>
Apocalypse, in mingled prose and verse, still records <lb/>
that "honoured name" in the touching dedication&mdash; <lb/>
<q><hi rend="small-caps">to</hi> <lb/>
<hi rend="gothic">My Mother.</hi> <lb/>
<hi rend="small-caps">for the first time <lb/>
to her <lb/>
beloved, revered, cherished memory</hi>.</q>
It has been said that, by - and - by, "saints," by <lb/>
virtue of peculiar saintliness, will cease to exist, <lb/>
and that mankind will become uniformly good. <lb/>
Is this a consummation to be wished? Nay, verily <lb/>
&mdash;diversities of gifts there must always be, <reg orig="like-|wise">likewise</reg> <lb/>
the many and the few "stripes"&mdash;else were <lb/>
all that goes to make humanity interesting taken <lb/>
from it, and Progress would cease, and Aspiration <lb/>
become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Personally both mother and daughter were <lb/>
warmly attached to the Church of England, but <lb/>
the petty bigotry of narrow minds was impossible <lb/>
to them, and her views are firmly expressed in her <lb/>
latest work, where, after deploring schism, she says, <lb/>
"Nevertheless, inasmuch as multiplicity is allied to <lb/>
resource, let us, until better may be, make capital <lb/>
even of our guilty disadvantage. Let us be <reg orig="pro-|voked">provoked</reg> <lb/>
to good works by those with whom we <reg orig="can-|not">cannot</reg> <lb/>
altogether agree, yet who in many ways set us <lb/>
a pattern. I, at least, can learn much from the <lb/>
<pb n="283" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0338"/>
devotion of Catholic Rome, the immutability of <lb/>
Catholic Greece, the philanthropy and piety of <lb/>
Quakerism, the zeal of many a Protestant."</p>
<p>In her early life her mother and brothers united <lb/>
in calling her "really lovely," but it appears to us <lb/>
that in the "fascinating mystery and soft <reg orig="melan-|choly">melancholy</reg> <lb/>
of her eyes," the irresistible sweetness of her <lb/>
expression, and the bell-like timbre of her exquisite <lb/>
voice&mdash;which all the Rossettis inherited from their <lb/>
father&mdash;lay the great charm of her indescribable <lb/>
personality. She was the model for several of her <lb/>
brother's best-known pictures, and we are told that <lb/>
Holman Hunt has given "a look of her" to the <lb/>
yearning beauty of Christ as "The Light of the <lb/>
World."</p>
<p>It was in 1862 that Christina Rossetti's first <lb/>
volume of collected poems appeared, and much <reg orig="in-|terest">interest</reg> <lb/>
was at once aroused in those best fitted to <lb/>
judge of its merits. "Goblin Market" is a fairy <lb/>
fantasy, into which, however, much meaning can <lb/>
be read by those who care to trace the subtle <reg orig="link-|ing">linking</reg> <lb/>
of mysticism with the descriptiveness of <reg orig="appar-|ent">apparent</reg> <lb/>
realities.</p>
<p>The Hon. Mrs Norton&mdash;no mean critic&mdash;speaks <lb/>
with special appreciation of "Uphill," and there <lb/>
are probably many to-day who love the poem, with <lb/>
its directness of motive and simple faith in a better <lb/>
country, who do not know even the name of its <lb/>
author. It has found its way everywhere, and <lb/>
<pb n="284" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0339"/>
everywhere it is loved. The "young writer" of <lb/>
whom Mrs Norton speaks so appreciatively was <lb/>
then about thirty years of age, but she had known <lb/>
much of the shadowed side of life, and the keynote <lb/>
of her poems is a mystic melancholy, which, however, <lb/>
degenerates but seldom into morbid introspection.</p>
<p>Around her life, her own ill-health and the care <lb/>
of others had thrown an atmosphere of sadness, <lb/>
and, with her hereditary sombreness of <reg orig="tempera-|ment">temperament</reg>, <lb/>
we cannot wonder that only now and again <lb/>
was she able to rise above it into the ether of <lb/>
buoyant hopefulness. We need a certain energy <lb/>
to seize happiness even when it is near, and in her <lb/>
case neither the energy nor the happiness was <lb/>
readily accessible.</p>
<p>The marriage of Dante Gabriel Rossetti to Miss <lb/>
Seddall was no doubt a matter of keen interest to <lb/>
her, but the sudden death of her sister-in-law, after <lb/>
only two years of intensest happiness, was a serious <lb/>
shock to the sister who loved him so tenderly, and <lb/>
to whom his every thought was of interest. His <lb/>
own mental agony was acute, and in his impulsive <lb/>
fashion he gathered together all his manuscripts <lb/>
and placed them, as a last parting gift, upon the <lb/>
breast of his dead wife. Six years later they were <lb/>
exhumed, with his reluctant permission, from her <lb/>
grave in Highgate Cemetery, and he took a belated <lb/>
interest in their publication. But though he has <lb/>
left work behind him that cannot die, it is probable <lb/>
<pb n="285" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0340"/>
that he was never again as he had been before that <lb/>
crushing blow fell upon him, and the grief and <lb/>
anxiety which she subsequently endured on his <lb/>
behalf told heavily upon his sister. His artistic <lb/>
triumphs were shared by her, and over and over <lb/>
again in his pictures the sad beauty of her face is <lb/>
reproduced; but as Time's impressions were more <lb/>
deeply made, "as streams their channels deeper <lb/>
wear," she turned ever more to thoughts of <reg orig="Eter-|nity&mdash;its">Eternity&mdash;its</reg> <lb/>
mysterious infinity and the plenitude of <lb/>
its consolations.</p>
<p>Time after time she was called upon to suffer for <lb/>
and with others, ministering in turn, with tender <lb/>
devotion, to father, sister, brother, mother, and <lb/>
aunts, and often when her own health was such <lb/>
as to have rendered some rest and respite more <lb/>
than reasonable.</p>
<p>Her description of Birchington churchyard, where <lb/>
Dante Gabriel Rossetti lies buried, has a <reg orig="Tenny-|sonian">Tennysonian</reg> <lb/>
rhythm about it; but probably few poets <lb/>
owe less than does she to even the most <reg orig="uncon-|scious">unconscious</reg> <lb/>
imitation of style.</p>

</lg></q>
<p>Christina Rossetti was essentially religious. <lb/>
She lived in an atmosphere of her own &mdash; in the <lb/>
world, though not of it,&mdash;but a nature like hers, <lb/>
intense, loving, and faithful, was bound to suffer <lb/>
proportionately when, twice in her life, the gift <lb/>
of love was offered, and her deeply religious <reg orig="con-|victions">convictions</reg> <lb/>
led her to refuse its acceptance. We do <lb/>
not know, we cannot tell, how such experiences as <lb/>
these made her suffer, but many of her poems tell <lb/>
their own story, and pre-eminently the Sonnet of <lb/>
Sonnets&mdash;"Monna Innominata." There are few <lb/>
English sonnets <hi rend="italic">so</hi> beautiful as these. They seem <lb/>
so autobiographical as to be almost sacred. We <lb/>
feel while reading them, as probably many have <lb/>
felt while reading the "Browning Love Letters," <lb/>
as if they ought not to be in our possession,&mdash; <lb/>
that they are too private for the rude and prying <lb/>
eyes of the public.</p>
<p>And yet, is not all the truest poetry the <reg orig="out-|come">outcome</reg> <lb/>
of personal experience? Could any one but <lb/>
a mourner have written "In Memoriam"? Could <lb/>
any one but a Lord Byron have penned "Don <lb/>
Juan"? It is so with all the Arts &mdash; every <hi rend="italic">chef <lb/>
d'&oelig;uvre</hi>, could we but know it, is written, painted, <lb/>
sculptured, composed, from the innermost fibres of <lb/>
<pb n="287" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0342"/>
the poet's, the painter's, the sculptor's, the <reg orig="musici-|an's">musician's</reg> <lb/>
being. He who has not known sorrow can <lb/>
never appeal to a broken heart; he who realises <lb/>
nothing of the joys of life, its wealth of beauty <lb/>
and its vastness of possibility, can never quicken <lb/>
another soul into enthusiasm, or make our pulses <lb/>
thrill with the knowledge that it is good for us <lb/>
to be here.</p>
<p>If there was an infinite sadness in Christina <lb/>
Rossetti, there was also an infinite faith, and in <lb/>
every little passing incident&mdash;so little and so <reg orig="pass-|ing">passing</reg> <lb/>
that a careless eye would not have observed <lb/>
it at all&mdash;she recognised symbols which led her on <lb/>
to high thoughts and fair imaginings.</p>
<p>We have noticed, in our sketch of Jean Ingelow, <lb/>
the paucity of illustrations drawn by her from <lb/>
foreign sources. With Christina Rossetti it is far <lb/>
otherwise. Naturally, the child of the Italian <lb/>
patriot was saturated with the love of her father's <lb/>
land; but she was born in England, within hail of <lb/>
all that was best in English Art and Literature, <lb/>
and it is of England that she loved best to write. <lb/>
She was a confirmed Londoner, knowing, as she <lb/>
says, "as little of what is called Nature as a town <lb/>
sparrow or at most a pigeon, but in the place that <lb/>
best suits me."</p>
<p>As long, however, as Mrs Rossetti was able <lb/>
to enjoy travelling, or to spare her from her <lb/>
side, there were many pleasant visits made, of <lb/>
<pb n="288" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0343"/>
which we get glimpses both in her poetry and <lb/>
prose.</p>
<p>Pecuniary difficulties gradually dispersed as the <lb/>
British public slowly acknowledged the varied <lb/>
genius of this remarkable family. In 'The Face <lb/>
of the Deep' she thus speaks of one of her <reg orig="ex-|periences">experiences</reg> <lb/>
in Normandy in 1861; and as this work <lb/>
was not published until 1892, we incidentally note <lb/>
her retentiveness of memory and the gift which <lb/>
she possessed of linking the things of Time with <lb/>
those of Eternity.</p>
<p>"Once, years ago, in Normandy, after a day of <lb/>
flooding rain, I beheld the clouds roll up and <reg orig="de-|part">depart</reg> <lb/>
and the auspicious sky reappear. Those veils <lb/>
of heaven and earth removed, beauty came to <lb/>
light. What will it be to see the same visible <lb/>
heaven itself remove, and unimaginable beauty <lb/>
brought to light in glory and terror."</p>
<p>Her delight in Italy was instinctive, and some <lb/>
of her verses, written during her one and only visit <lb/>
to "the land of love," glow with the enthusiasm <lb/>
of a home-coming. As, for example, that exquisite <lb/>
sonnet xxi. of "Later Life":&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="stanza">
<l>"A host of things I take on trust: I take</l>
<l rend="indent">The nightingales on trust, for few and far</l>
<l rend="indent">Between those actual summer moments are</l>
<l>When I have heard what melody they make.</l>
<l>So chanced it once at Como on the Lake:</l>
<l rend="indent">But all things then waxed musical; each star</l>
<l rend="indent">Sang on its course, each breeze sang on its car,</l>
<l>All harmonies sang to senses wide awake.</l>
</lg>
<pb n="289" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0344"/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>All things in tune, myself not out of tune,</l>
<l rend="indent">Those nightingales were nightingales indeed:</l>
<l rend="indent">Yet truly an owl had satisfied my need,</l>
<l>And wrought a rapture underneath that moon</l>
<l rend="indent">Or simple sparrow chirping from a reed;</l>
<l>For June that night glowed like a doubled June."</l>
</lg></q></p>
<p>That her mother throve abroad was an unaffected <lb/>
joy to her, and had not the feebleness of age "<reg orig="con-|tracted">contracted</reg> <lb/>
her radius of travel," it is probable that <lb/>
their delightful expedition to the Continent might <lb/>
have been repeated. It was not in her nature to <lb/>
evade duty, and the care of her mother was a <lb/>
sacred thing to which all else was subservient. <lb/>
After Mrs Rossetti's death, in 1866, the charge of <lb/>
her aunts devolved entirely upon Christina, and <lb/>
their growing infirmities told sadly upon a nature <lb/>
that already knew so much of vicarious suffering.</p>
<p>When in their youthful days she and Maria had <lb/>
craved for martyrdom, their brother Dante had <lb/>
laughingly said that they were much nicer as they <lb/>
were, and that the sight of his eccentricities was <lb/>
sufficient martyrdom for their slight shoulders,&mdash; <lb/>
but far beyond the brief agony of dying was the <lb/>
daily ministration to aged feebleness and her long <lb/>
witnessing of the mysteries of pain.</p>
<p>"God alone has pity which does not wound," <lb/>
said Madame de Gasparin, and the realisation of <lb/>
this pitifulness was the truest comfort that <reg orig="Chris-|tina">Christina</reg> <lb/>
Rossetti can have felt during the last long <lb/>
years of her life on earth.</p>
<pb n="290" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0345"/>
<p>In 1872 was published the book for children <lb/>
entitled 'Sing-Song,' and, as contrasted with the <lb/>
sombre tone of her usual writing, it is doubly <lb/>
refreshing and delightful. Throughout the volume <lb/>
there is a breezy freshness that it full of charm <lb/>
for little ones, and yet an undescribable undertone <lb/>
which appeals to their elders, while the numerous <lb/>
illustrations of Mr Arthur Hughes are thoroughly <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">en rapport</hi> with the melodious rhymes. It is no <lb/>
easy thing to write for children. Little people are <lb/>
stern critics of the books offered for their <reg orig="delecta-|tion">delectation</reg>. <lb/>
They know what they want, and they claim <lb/>
it as a right. They will plunge headlong into a <lb/>
new book, but no sense of consideration for the <lb/>
writer or the giver will induce them to give <reg orig="any-|thing">anything</reg> <lb/>
but an unbiassed verdict. Candour is natural <lb/>
to childhood; and the greatest tribute that a book <lb/>
can receive, is for it to be dog-eared and torn with <lb/>
constant fingering. Every day is a little life to <lb/>
them, and that life is too short for any waste of <lb/>
it to be allowable. A book that is to be popular <lb/>
with children must take their fancy at once, or <lb/>
they will have none of it, and 'Sing-Song' is <lb/>
"just lovely" because it does that&mdash;and more.</p>
<p>But the "more" comes afterwards.</p>
<p>That Christina Rossetti should have had so little <lb/>
opportunity of developing her love for children <lb/>
adds a pathos to the winning words, which we <lb/>
elders can appreciate; but the book itself will be a <lb/>
<pb n="291" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0346"/>
favourite in every nursery, and this to her would <lb/>
be the sweetest praise.</p>
<p>Even in a first visit Mrs Gilchrist noticed this <lb/>
characteristic. After speaking of her sweetness, <lb/>
gentleness, and simplicity, she winds up with the <lb/>
climax which we may be sure was in her motherly <lb/>
mind all along&mdash;"so kind to the children."</p>
<p>It is in 'Sing-Song' that the words occur which <lb/>
she inscribed in the copy of Verses which was her <lb/>
last gift to her faithful biographer and friend, <lb/>
Mr Mackenzie Bell&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Faith is like a lily lifted high and white";</l>
</lg></q>
and in these words we find a touching and subtle <lb/>
connection with the beautiful lines of Dante Gabriel <lb/>
Rossetti in his sonnet for the picture of "The <reg orig="girl-|hood">girlhood</reg> <lb/>
of Mary the Virgin," for which Christina sat <lb/>
as his model in her youthful days&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"Thus held she through her girlhood: as it were</l>
<l>An angel watered lily, that near God</l>
<l>Grows and is quiet."</l>
</lg></q>
It was to this sublime faith that she owed all the <lb/>
fortitude and patience with which she endured the <lb/>
sufferings of her later life, and went down into the <lb/>
Valley of the Shadow of Death as one who was <lb/>
"glad of the opportunity to depart."</p>
<p>When invited to meet Tennyson, she was glad <lb/>
that "a previous engagement" enabled her to <lb/>
evade the ordeal, so retiring and diffident was her <lb/>
<pb n="292" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0347"/>
disposition; but in the home-circle she was adored, <lb/>
and her friendships, though few, were devoted and <lb/>
enduring.</p>
<p>Books do not seem to have made any great <reg orig="feat-|ure">feature</reg> <lb/>
in her life. She wrote her poems very much <lb/>
as did Emily Bront&euml;, out of her own inner vision, <lb/>
with a spontaneous insight into nature that would <lb/>
seem wellnigh miraculous, did we not remember <lb/>
the infinite capability of one human heart. She <lb/>
had no special "sanctum," but wrote most of her <lb/>
poems in a back-bedroom or in the drawing-room. <lb/>
We are told that she used to shut her eyes and <lb/>
"see" the things which she described so minutely. <lb/>
We are not aware of any one poem which is <reg orig="en-|tirely">entirely</reg> <lb/>
written under the influence of this literary <lb/>
clairvoyance; but it is remarkable that Lord Lytton, <lb/>
than whom there are few more imaginative writers, <lb/>
should state as a fact beyond dispute that "it is <lb/>
no rare phenomenon for a poet to see through other <lb/>
organs than his eyes. In no single instance could <lb/>
I ever find, after the most rigid scrutiny, that the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">clairvoyance of imagination</hi> had deceived me. I <lb/>
am not sure, indeed, that I could not describe the <lb/>
things I imagine more exactly than the things I <lb/>
habitually see."</p>
<p>We are told by a writer in the 'Contemporary <lb/>
Review,' in his interesting article on Mrs <reg orig="Brown-|ing">Browning</reg>, <lb/>
that rhymes can be divided into two classes <lb/>
&mdash;perfect and imperfect &lpar;or allowable&rpar; rhymes&mdash;and <lb/>
<pb n="293" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0348"/>
that the English poet who has most boldly and <lb/>
defiantly outraged the rules of the latter is Mrs <lb/>
Browning. This may be so,&mdash;far be it from us to <lb/>
impugn such an authority,&mdash;but we venture to <lb/>
think that at any rate Miss Rossetti runs her <lb/>
very close in this respect. Read her exquisite <lb/>
poems carefully and you will often find "rhymes" <lb/>
which can only be regarded as <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi>&mdash;poetic <lb/>
freedom in the use of word-sounds which exceeds <lb/>
even what is popularly known as poetic licence. <lb/>
Not only are some of the rhymes distinctly <lb/>
"imperfect" beyond all bounds of "<reg orig="allowable-|ness">allowableness</reg>," <lb/>
but many of the lines are absolutely <reg orig="un-|scannable">unscannable</reg>.</p>
<p>Yet <hi rend="italic">what matters it</hi>, when the result is so <lb/>
matchless? "Wood, hay, stubble" are pressed <lb/>
into her service with "gold, silver, and precious <lb/>
stones," and her genius has built for itself a <lb/>
"house beautiful" wherein thoughts are enshrined <lb/>
that are for the help and healing of us all. Her <lb/>
poems are like the bells of old, of which tradition <lb/>
tells us that they owe their sweetness to the <lb/>
variety of metals thrown into the crucible,&mdash;but <lb/>
who thinks of the amalgam, when "through the <lb/>
balmy air of night the bells ring out their <lb/>
delight from the molten-golden notes"?</p>
<p>The very ruggedness of some of her poetry has <lb/>
its peculiar charm, because it is so self-evident <lb/>
that the words came straight from her heart to <lb/>
<pb n="294" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0349"/>
her finger-tips. She set the "essence of poetry <lb/>
above the form," and knew but little of the <lb/>
labour of correcting and revising, such as, for <reg orig="in-|stance">instance</reg>, <lb/>
characterised Pope&mdash;though her brother <lb/>
William tells us that "she was quite conscious <lb/>
that a poem demands to be good in execution as <lb/>
well as genuine in impulse."</p>
<p>Of self-criticism she was singularly devoid, and <lb/>
it seems as if at times she were obsessed by <lb/>
other forces than her own&mdash;writing now, as Bunyan <lb/>
wrote centuries ago, "as if joy did make him <lb/>
write," and anon, as if the sorrows of life had <lb/>
tuned every heart-string to a minor key.</p>
<p>Her love for animals is apparent throughout her <lb/>
works. Here is a poetic comment upon the words, <lb/>
"These all wait upon Thee"&mdash; <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent2">"Innocent eyes not ours</l>
<l rend="indent2">Are made to look on flowers,</l>
<l rend="indent">Eyes of small birds and insects small.</l>
<l rend="indent2">Morn after summer morn</l>
<l rend="indent2">The sweet rose on her thorn</l>
<l rend="indent">Opens her bosom to them all.</l>
<l rend="indent2">The least and last of things</l>
<l rend="indent2">That soar on quivering wings,</l>
<l>Or craw! among the grass-blades out of sight,</l>
<l rend="indent2">Have just as clear a right</l>
<l>To their appointed portion of delight</l>
<l rend="indent3">As Queens or Kings."</l>
</lg></q>
Could dainty thought be more daintily expressed? <lb/>
And within it, too, is contained the germ of that <lb/>
humiliating truth which acknowledges the whole <lb/>
<pb n="295" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0350"/>
world to be, in the eyes of God, but as one ant <lb/>
in a universe.</p>
<p>The infinitely little, no less than the infinitely <lb/>
great, has possibilities which we mortals are but <lb/>
unfitted, perhaps unworthy, to estimate, and yet <lb/>
which, in our petty pride, we are apt <reg orig="deliber-|ately">deliberately</reg> <lb/>
both to overlook and to underrate.</p>
<p>In writing this paper our attention has been <lb/>
inevitably directed to Mr Watts Dunton's admirable <lb/>
essays upon her life and work. He writes, as such <lb/>
a man could not fail to write, with warm <reg orig="appreci-|ation">appreciation</reg> <lb/>
and keen insight, as well as with a delicate <lb/>
and careful analysis of her character that only a <lb/>
personal friend could rightfully express; but there <lb/>
is one statement in the 'Athen&aelig;um' of 1896 to <lb/>
which we would, very humbly, beg to take <reg orig="ex-|ception">exception</reg>.</p>
<p>He speaks of the Christian idea as "essentially <lb/>
feminine." What does he mean? Is self-sacrifice <lb/>
and devotion to an ideal "essentially feminine"? <lb/>
Are the men "of whom the world was not <lb/>
worthy" only abnormal specimens? If it be true <lb/>
that the greater includes the less, then the ideal <lb/>
must include the characteristics which go to make <lb/>
up that ideal, and the Christ must be greater <lb/>
than the Christian idea which He originated. <lb/>
Does Mr Watts Dunton leave it to be inferred <lb/>
that all the highest attributes of human nature&mdash; <lb/>
faith, mercy, purity, truth&mdash;belong exclusively to <lb/>
<pb n="296" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0351"/>
femininity? If it be so, then surely the meekest <lb/>
of her sex may take courage, for it must follow, <lb/>
as the night the day, that at some time or other <lb/>
woman will come into her kingdom. The only <lb/>
thing to wait for is the day when a sufficient <lb/>
number of the male creation can be brought to <lb/>
agree with his dogmatic but enigmatic assertion.</p>
<p>From the earliest times woman has always been <lb/>
more keenly alive than man to the beauty of <reg orig="holi-|ness">holiness</reg>, <lb/>
whether in the abstract or the concrete, but <lb/>
we deny that Christianity is "essentially feminine," <lb/>
for to do so would be to admit that it is unmanly; <lb/>
and the Christ of the Bible is a very manly Christ, <lb/>
as well as a Godlike man.</p>
<p>We have wondered often at the strange <reg orig="fatuous-|ness">fatuousness</reg> <lb/>
which seems to descend upon preachers the <lb/>
moment they take a sermon in hand. There is <lb/>
something almost humorous in the way that they <lb/>
have of gloating over certain passages, regardless, <lb/>
apparently, of ordinary common-sense; and of <reg orig="view-|ing">viewing</reg> <lb/>
a subject from a totally different standpoint <lb/>
from that in which they would look at it if quite <lb/>
uninfluenced by their own external surroundings.</p>
<p>"And He answered him to never a word," has <lb/>
over and over again formed a basis for a long <lb/>
dissertation upon humility and submission. It does <lb/>
not strike us in that way at all; we undertake <lb/>
to say that it did not strike Pilate or Herod in <lb/>
that way; and it will not strike you in that way <lb/>
<pb n="297" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0352"/>
either, if for one moment you consider the matter <lb/>
honestly.</p>
<p>Could <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> have been more disconcerting, <lb/>
not to say humiliating?</p>
<p>A prisoner given the opportunity of pleading <lb/>
in His own behalf, of even answering questions <lb/>
which of themselves were something of a <reg orig="con-|descension">condescension</reg> <lb/>
under the circumstances which <hi rend="italic"><reg orig="appar-|ently">apparently</reg></hi> <lb/>
existed&mdash;and yet "He answered to never a <lb/>
word."</p>
<p>It seems to us one of the most absolutely strong, <lb/>
masterful incidents that could have been recorded <lb/>
&mdash;indicative not of submission or humility, but of <lb/>
Kingly indifference to His sentence, and a sublime <lb/>
unspoken scorn of an unjust judge. Nothing but <lb/>
this subtle silence could have conveyed so much, <lb/>
but there is nothing "feminine" here.</p>
<p>It is very remarkable that the one doctrine in <lb/>
Romanism which most revolted Christina Rossetti <lb/>
was Mariolatry; whereas her brother Dante&mdash;whose <lb/>
love of symbolism exceeded her own, but who, <lb/>
even less than his sister, had no leanings <reg orig="what-|ever">whatever</reg> <lb/>
towards the adoption of the Roman Church <lb/>
&mdash;considered that the weak point of Anglicanism <lb/>
was its rejection of the womanly element from <lb/>
its creed, which this doctrine necessarily involves. <lb/>
What to her devout convictions was a "cardinal <lb/>
error," was to his merely "opining temperament" <lb/>
an attraction&mdash;a dogma the adoption of which, <lb/>
<pb n="298" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0353"/>
he considered, would be a distinct advantage to <lb/>
the Church of England.</p>
<p>Probably many a Protestant mother, at the risk <lb/>
of direst spiritual penalties hereafter, has bowed <lb/>
low before Mary as the incarnation of <reg orig="mother-|hood">motherhood</reg>, <lb/>
who knew so many things, and who seemed <lb/>
so much more accessible to the cry of a mother's <lb/>
heart than could Jesus the Son of God. It is not <lb/>
orthodox&mdash;but let us hope that adequate allowance <lb/>
will be made hereafter for the offences of mothers <lb/>
in this respect, when love alone has prompted the <lb/>
offence. By the wildest stretch of imagination He <lb/>
could no more put Himself into a mother's place <lb/>
than, in all reverence be it spoken, He could square <lb/>
a circle. There are some things that are impossible <lb/>
even to Omnipotence, and this is one of them.</p>
<p>It is the more remarkable that Dante Gabriel <lb/>
and his sister should have been at variance on <lb/>
this point, because we are told that in him alone <lb/>
was to be noticed any trace of the English blood <lb/>
which, from their mother's maternal ancestry, they <lb/>
alike inherited. Much had they both to suffer, <lb/>
much to do, before both, as we hope, "by different <lb/>
ways," reached Home at last.</p>
<p>Terrible indeed were the sufferings which she <lb/>
had to bear during the latter part of her life, <lb/>
but through them all, with but one brief interval, <lb/>
her faith in the goodness of God stood firm and <lb/>
steadfast.</p>
<pb n="299" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0354"/>
<p>"Put up one short prayer for me&mdash;I have to <lb/>
suffer so <hi rend="italic">very</hi> much," was her pathetic cry.</p>
<p>Cancer, heart-disease, and dropsy had wrought <lb/>
their worst upon a frame already enfeebled, when <lb/>
on the 29th of December 1894 she passed away&mdash; <lb/>
praying to the last&mdash;to the "city luminous," to <lb/>
the glorious realities of which she had but dreamed.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of January 1895 her tired body was <lb/>
laid to rest in Highgate Cemetery, amid the <reg orig="rev-|erent">reverent</reg> <lb/>
sorrow of her immediate circle; but the <reg orig="pre-|liminary">preliminary</reg> <lb/>
service was held at Christ Church, Woburn <lb/>
Square, where for nearly twenty years she had <lb/>
humbly worshipped the God whom she loved so <lb/>
well. After the reading of that magnificent passage <lb/>
in 1 Corinthians xv. by Prebendary Nash, the <reg orig="In-|cumbent">Incumbent</reg>, <lb/>
some stanzas were sung, to the tune <lb/>
of St Ann, from Miss Rossetti's poem entitled <lb/>
"Advent"; and subsequently her beautiful verses <lb/>
on the words, "And now, why tarriest thou?" <lb/>
were sung to music composed expressly for the <lb/>
occasion by Mr F. T. Lowden, the organist of <lb/>
Christ Church.</p>
<p>Her friend, the late Sir Edward Burne-Jones, <lb/>
designed and in part painted the beautiful reredos <lb/>
to her memory which now forms a conspicuous <lb/>
feature of that building. It consists of a series <lb/>
of paintings of our Lord and the four Evangelists, <lb/>
in a Gothic perpendicular setting of white stone.</p>
<p>The memorial was dedicated on All Saints' Day, <lb/>
<pb n="300" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0355"/>
1898, by the Right Rev. B. F. Westcott, D.D., <lb/>
D.C.L., Lord Bishop of Durham, in the presence <lb/>
of a large and sympathetic congregation, to whom <lb/>
he delivered a most eloquent and inspiring address.</p>
<p>A marble slab has been fixed in the pavement <lb/>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">That</hi> "History is the essence of innumerable <lb/>
biographies" is the dictum of no less a writer <lb/>
than "the Sage of Chelsea," but comparatively <lb/>
few historians have deliberately given themselves <lb/>
up to such distinctly biographical study as have <lb/>
Agnes Strickland and her scarcely less gifted sister, <lb/>
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>The works by which they are best known in the <lb/>
literary world are composed of separate units, each <lb/>
of which would be complete if published alone.</p>
<p>The 'Lives of the Queens of England' are <reg orig="prob-|ably">probably</reg> <lb/>
better known than any other of Agnes <reg orig="Strick-|land's">Strickland's</reg> <lb/>
works, and yet we must be guilty of an <lb/>
Irishism and say that the greater number of them <lb/>
were written by her sister.</p>
<p>Of these forty-one "Lives," no less than <reg orig="twenty-|two">twenty-two</reg> <lb/>
are the work of Elizabeth, who, however, would <lb/>
not allow her name to appear on the title-page; <lb/>
but it is no less true that of these the units which <lb/>
<pb n="306" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0363"/>
appeal most to our sympathies are written by Agnes <lb/>
&mdash;notably the lives of Anne Boleyn, Katherine <lb/>
Howard, Queen Elizabeth, and Mary of Modena. <lb/>
To our intellectual Queen, Victoria of immortal <lb/>
memory, the two styles were at once apparent, <lb/>
and it would appear that she was the first person <lb/>
to discover that two very different brains had been <lb/>
at work in the production of the "Queenly" <lb/>
volumes.</p>
<p>The temperaments of the two sisters were as <lb/>
different as the styles of their writing. It is <lb/>
true that in their studies they took an equal <reg orig="de-|light">delight</reg>, <lb/>
but while Elizabeth was the more <reg orig="thought-|ful">thoughtful</reg> <lb/>
student, it was Agnes whose vivid imagination <lb/>
enabled her to become the eloquent and pathetic <lb/>
writer who has redeemed alike Mary Stuart and <lb/>
Elizabeth from unmerited obloquy, and whose <lb/>
accounts of Anne Boleyn and Katherine Howard, <lb/>
while condoning neither their frailties nor their <lb/>
misdoings, touch upon them with such womanly <lb/>
compassion that few can study their lives without <lb/>
feeling some degree of pity and emotion.</p>
<p>Probably the highly-strung nature of Agnes <lb/>
was more capable of sympathy than was that of <lb/>
Elizabeth, whose physical strength was unusual, <lb/>
and whose mental grip included mathematics and <lb/>
cognate subjects which were a terror to her <lb/>
younger sister.</p>
<p>The Strickland family were entirely educated <lb/>
<pb n="307" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0364"/>
by their parents; and, though nowadays such a <lb/>
method of education is considered as undesirable <lb/>
as it often is impracticable, they had no reason <lb/>
to regret it.</p>
<p>Mr Strickland appears to have been somewhat <lb/>
of a "martinet," for, unlike so many literary <lb/>
aspirants who were able to browse at will in the <lb/>
libraries of their fathers and friends, these young <lb/>
people were only allowed books "of a superior <lb/>
order" under his own careful jurisdiction.</p>
<p>By accident, however, Shakespeare fell into their <lb/>
hands, and we may feel sure that never was the <lb/>
"immortal bard" more diligently read and more <lb/>
warmly appreciated than by these precocious <reg orig="child-|ren">children</reg>, <lb/>
who had been brought up upon such heavy <lb/>
diet as 'Rapin's History of England,' Harrison's <lb/>
'Survey of London,' and Plutarch's 'Lives.'</p>
<p>It seems surprising that mental indigestion, not <lb/>
to say nausea, did not result from such solid <reg orig="read-|ing">reading</reg>; <lb/>
but the powers that could assimilate and <lb/>
derive inspiration therefrom must surely have been <lb/>
abnormal.</p>
<p>Rapin lies before us now&mdash;two ponderous folio <lb/>
tomes&mdash;a book of reference to which no one refers; <lb/>
a mighty work, indeed, but the covers of which <lb/>
are better worn than its pages. Strange "milk <lb/>
for babes," one would think; but those were <reg orig="pre-|kindergarten">prekindergarten</reg> <lb/>
days, when the path of learning lay <lb/>
narrowly between walls and fences rather than <lb/>
<pb n="308" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0365"/>
amid flowery ways, where all that is beautiful in <lb/>
art or literature lies on either hand waiting to <lb/>
be gathered. The works of Milton, Gray, and <lb/>
Collins are not those which a modern parent <lb/>
would select as gift-books for a child of twelve, <lb/>
but the general result was satisfactory, so that <lb/>
we must not criticise too harshly a mental <reg orig="train-|ing">training</reg> <lb/>
which appears somewhat drastic.</p>
<p>Reading, with Agnes, was not only a pursuit <lb/>
but a passion, though fortunately she was also <lb/>
devoted to needlework and music and flowers, <lb/>
so that country life was never dull to her, and <lb/>
time never lay heavily on any of the group. <lb/>
Some such homes may still exist, but in these <lb/>
days they must be yearly decreasing, for outside <lb/>
influences are now so early brought to bear upon <lb/>
child-life, that few indeed are the parents who <lb/>
could find it <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> to bring up their children <lb/>
in the self-sufficing fashion of last century.</p>
<p>The spirit of change has permeated even the <lb/>
remotest villages. To "go with the times" is <lb/>
often only a euphemism for going to the devil; <lb/>
but it seems inevitable. Public opinion, public <lb/>
schools, public houses&mdash;<hi rend="italic">all</hi> is public now. Is this <lb/>
all for the better? It may be so; but when the <lb/>
unruly force of some unlooked-for "Movement" <lb/>
threatens to overthrow all our cherished <reg orig="tradi-|tions">traditions</reg>, <lb/>
we think with regret of the quieter days <lb/>
when life was not lived at such high pressure, <lb/>
<pb n="309" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0366"/>
and when boys and girls did not tire of it so <lb/>
quickly. It is the <hi rend="italic">pace</hi> that kills. Is it not a <lb/>
fact that in 1800 suicide was a rarer thing among <lb/>
young people than it is now, when time after <lb/>
time in the columns of our daily papers we read <lb/>
of mere children plunging into the "Great <reg orig="Per-|haps">Perhaps</reg>," <lb/>
either because of their inadequate <reg orig="prepar-|ation">preparation</reg> <lb/>
for the race which we call Living, or from <lb/>
a pathetic satiety of life as they have found it?</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"They know the grief of man, but not the wisdom;</l>
<l rend="indent">They sink in man's despair, without its calm&mdash;</l>
<l>Are slaves without the liberty in Christdom,</l>
<l rend="indent">Are martyrs by the pang without the palm."</l>
</lg></q>
<p>"Wonderful and horrible things are committed <lb/>
in the land," but the most wonderful thing of <lb/>
all, and the most horrible, is that the "people <lb/>
love to have it so."</p>
<p>Early in her teens Agnes went on a visit to <lb/>
a friend of her mother, who afforded her many <lb/>
hours of romantic excitement by the loan of such <lb/>
works as 'The Scottish Chiefs,' 'The Simple Story,' <lb/>
and 'The Moral Tales.' The Misses Porter, Mrs <lb/>
Inchbald, and Miss Edgeworth were "writers of <lb/>
merit" who could safely be trusted to provide <lb/>
healthy reading; but an ordinary High School <lb/>
girl of to-day scarcely knows their names, and <lb/>
would think their writings slow and dull, for the <lb/>
form and fashion of literature varies as much as <lb/>
does that of dress.</p>
<pb n="310" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0367"/>
<p>During this visit it is recorded that one <reg orig="morn-|ing">morning</reg> <lb/>
Agnes had carried out her hostess's baby for <lb/>
a walk, when a swarm of bees settled upon her, <lb/>
which, however, departed as suddenly as it had <lb/>
come. The old nurse, who saw the incident, <lb/>
warmly congratulated her, not upon her escape, <lb/>
but upon the good luck which the incident would <lb/>
bring to her in the future. This ancient Roman <lb/>
superstition is, we are told, naturalised in Suffolk, <lb/>
but it is interesting to notice that Emerson, in <lb/>
his masterly essay on Plato, alludes to it, so that <lb/>
it had evidently found its way across the ocean <lb/>
to New England with the Puritan fathers, who <lb/>
were mostly emigrants from our eastern counties.</p>
<p>Although Reydon was endeared to all the family <lb/>
by many associations, it is probable that it was no <lb/>
great hardship to the younger members when Mr <lb/>
Strickland found it necessary, owing to financial <lb/>
complications, to live in Norwich during a portion <lb/>
of every year. It was at this time that the future <lb/>
historian made her first appearance in print&mdash; <lb/>
albeit anonymously; and it is somewhat <reg orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
that this, her first effort, should have been <lb/>
a monody upon the death of the Princess Charlotte <lb/>
of Wales, the presumptive heiress of the English <lb/>
throne, which brought home to the nation in <lb/>
sternest guise the realisation that Death is no <lb/>
respecter of persons.</p>
<p>Romance in Royal circles is considered somewhat <lb/>
<pb n="311" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0368"/>
of an anomaly; but in the case of this "amiable <lb/>
and high-spirited" young princess it would appear <lb/>
to have been an integral part of her nature. <lb/>
Nothing would prevail upon her to encourage the <lb/>
suit of the hereditary Prince of Orange, although <lb/>
for a short time she consented to a betrothal <lb/>
which her father, the Prince Regent,&mdash;afterwards <lb/>
George IV.,&mdash;was most anxious to promote. Fate, <lb/>
in the shape of Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, <lb/>
had rendered the young lady impervious to any <lb/>
other attachment, and it is not to be wondered <lb/>
at that the Regent's wishes were disregarded by <lb/>
her, for his dislike of his daughter was a matter <lb/>
of notoriety, and his own matrimonial experiences <lb/>
had been singularly unfortunate.</p>
<p>Princess Charlotte evidently knew her own mind, <lb/>
and her father's consent having been given&mdash;albeit <lb/>
somewhat tardily &mdash; to her union with Leopold <lb/>
George Frederick, Prince of Coburg, the marriage <lb/>
was celebrated, within two months, on the 2nd of <lb/>
May 1816. After the wedding the bridegroom <lb/>
displayed himself to the admiring crowds "dressed <lb/>
in a blue coat and a star,"&mdash;a costume which strikes <lb/>
us as being scarcely more serviceable than that of <lb/>
the Samoan princess, of whom Dr George Kingsley <lb/>
says that "she was dressed solely in a most lovely <lb/>
mat"! There was a romantic flavour about the <lb/>
proceedings which speedily won for His Serene <lb/>
Highness the suffrages of Londoners generally; <lb/>
<pb n="312" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0369"/>
and, as a nation, we have every reason to be <lb/>
thankful for a relationship which afforded to our <lb/>
own late Queen a counsellor both wise and kind. <lb/>
The happiness of the young couple was destined, <lb/>
however, to be very short. Eighteen months later, <lb/>
on the 6th of November 1817, "the fair-haired <lb/>
daughter of the Isles" lay dead. Her still-born <lb/>
son was born on the previous day, and she was <lb/>
reported as doing well; but twelve hours <reg orig="after-|wards">afterwards</reg> <lb/>
all was over. With great pomp they buried <lb/>
her at Windsor, and the husband of a year was <lb/>
left disconsolate.</p>
<p>In the early part of 1831 the Congress of <lb/>
Belgium offered him the crown, and the <reg orig="friend-|liness">friendliness</reg> <lb/>
of England and Belgium was intensified by <lb/>
the courtesy and unostentatious kindliness which, <lb/>
when king of that country, he invariably showed <lb/>
to his young kinswoman Victoria.</p>
<p>Before us lies a quaint memorial card issued in <lb/>
1817. In the centre is a medallion of the hapless <lb/>
Princess Charlotte, while behind her in grimmest <lb/>
picturing stands a grinning spectre, lifting with <lb/>
skeleton fingers the crown from off her head. Old <lb/>
Time with his sickle sits on one side as if waiting, <lb/>
cynically, to see what next would happen, while on <lb/>
the other Britannia sits weeping. The old card is <lb/>
yellow with the passage of years, but underneath, <lb/>
in microscopic printing, we can still read the words <lb/>
which shadowed forth the sentiments of the hour.</p>
<pb n="313" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0370"/>
<p>A few lines from Miss Strickland's monody may <lb/>
be quoted at this point, as being interesting both <lb/>
from a historic and a biographic point of view.</p>

<p>Such an event aroused even the passionate pity <lb/>

"altogether disinterested" politician whom he had <lb/>

would not have sacrificed his brilliant niece to the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">blas&eacute;</hi> phlegmatic Prince, in exchange for a <reg orig="morgan-|atic">morganatic</reg> <lb/>
alliance as brief as it was miserable. It is true <lb/>
that Napoleon I. considered Leopold of Coburg to <lb/>
be the handsomest man in Paris in 1806, and <reg orig="prob-|ably">probably</reg> <lb/>
the "large dark melancholy eyes" and calm <lb/>
self-possessed manner of the Prince had all the <lb/>
charm of contrast for the vivacious women; while <lb/>
his almost childlike dependence upon, and <reg orig="con-|fidence">confidence</reg> <lb/>
in, Stockmar, would inevitably endear him <lb/>
to the man.</p>
<p>"Drizzling" &lpar;<hi rend="italic">parfilage</hi>&rpar; seems to have been the <lb/>
only pastime in which His Highness took any keen <lb/>
interest, and it is not wonderful that the sprightly <lb/>
court actress soon tired of a man whose devotion <lb/>
to the gold-thread-picking fashion&mdash;imported into <lb/>
England by French refugees in 1792 &mdash; was as <lb/>
extraordinary as it was monotonous.</p>
<pb n="315" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0372"/>
<p>We read that during the ill-starred year, 1829&ndash;30, <lb/>
which Karoline, Countess of Montgomery &lpar;<hi rend="italic">n&eacute;e</hi> <lb/>
Bauer&rpar;, spent in England, her husband, Prince <lb/>
Leopold, earned, by drizzling, enough money to <lb/>
purchase a handsome silver soup-tureen, which <lb/>
he solemnly presented to his niece, Victoria of <lb/>
Kent, on her eleventh birthday.</p>
<p>Nothing did the child princess know, and little <lb/>
could the woman queen guess, of the hours of <lb/>
torture which that gift had cost to the impulsive <lb/>
favourite of the Berlin Theatres, who had left the <lb/>
love of a populace for the short-lived, whimsical <lb/>
tenderness of Prince Leopold of Coburg.</p>
<p>For twenty-two years the life of the Stricklands <lb/>
was one of uneventful happiness. The quiet <reg orig="cathe-|dral">cathedral</reg> <lb/>
town of Norwich afforded much opportunity <lb/>
for culture and quiet pleasure, while at Reydon <lb/>
all the available excitements of the country lay <lb/>
within their grasp. But by the sudden death of <lb/>
the beloved husband and father in 1818 the family <lb/>
were plunged into "genteel" poverty,&mdash;possibly <lb/>
one of the most trying types which that relatively <lb/>
elastic incubus can assume. To be at the bottom <lb/>
of the ladder is hard enough, but surely it is harder <lb/>
still to begin to take a lower place&mdash;even though <lb/>
it be unnecessary to do so "with shame"&mdash;after <lb/>
having known the joys of social life, and the easy <lb/>
hospitalities of giving and taking which that life <lb/>
affords.</p>
<pb n="316" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0373"/>
<p>This was now, for a time, to be the added trial <lb/>
of the bereaved family. Rigid economy had to be <lb/>
practised, for the younger children had still to be <lb/>
educated, and all seemed to need and to miss the <lb/>
guiding hand of him who was gone.</p>
<p>Fortunately for all, Agnes had not only the <reg orig="capa-|bility">capability</reg> <lb/>
but the perseverance necessary for achieving <lb/>
success in the literary world. If genius be "the <lb/>
gift of taking infinite pains," she possessed it <lb/>
pre-eminently, and at once began her career as a <lb/>
prose-writer, in conjunction with her sister <reg orig="Eliza-|beth">Elizabeth</reg>, <lb/>
by writing a juvenile book called 'The Rival <lb/>
Crusoes,' which was followed shortly by 'Tales of <lb/>
Royal British Children' and 'Historical Tales,' all <lb/>
of which were very popular among the young <lb/>
readers of that day.</p>
<p>Elizabeth at this time was editing the 'Court <lb/>
Journal,' and having written for that paper some <lb/>
short biographies of female sovereigns which were <lb/>
much appreciated, Agnes suggested that a book <lb/>
devoted entirely to the lives of the English Queens <lb/>
would be a novel and welcome addition to the <lb/>
national history. This seemingly modest <reg orig="sugges-|tion">suggestion</reg> <lb/>
led to the production of that series of volumes <lb/>
which we know under the title of 'Lives of the <lb/>
Queens of England from the Norman Conquest,' and <lb/>
which, in its vast collection of data on the subject, <lb/>
is still matchlessly comprehensive.</p>
<p>An innate delicacy determined the sisters to <reg orig="con-|clude">conclude</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="317" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0374"/>
the memoirs with that of Queen Anne; and, <lb/>
much as we may regret their decision, we cannot <lb/>
but realise that it would have been impossible <lb/>
to enter upon a detailed history of the House of <lb/>
Brunswick, without trespassing upon their devout <lb/>
loyalty to our late revered Queen. Her gracious <lb/>
acceptance of the dedication, and of the volumes <lb/>
as they appeared, rendered anything like a <reg orig="dis-|sertation">dissertation</reg> <lb/>
upon her family history impossible, and <lb/>
they continued immovable on the subject, though <lb/>
their publisher, Mr Colburn, did his utmost to <reg orig="per-|suade">persuade</reg> <lb/>
them to the task. An ordinary biographer <lb/>
might have hesitated to refuse a request which <lb/>
meant money and increased notoriety, but to derive <lb/>
pecuniary advantage from such an unchivalrous <reg orig="pro-|ceeding">proceeding</reg> <lb/>
was out of the question with women who <lb/>
could proudly trace their ancestry to the ancient <lb/>
Norman family of Sir Adam de Strykelonde, who <lb/>
came over from France with William the Conqueror.</p>
<p>Elizabeth's aversion to publicity was on one <reg orig="occa-|sion">occasion</reg> <lb/>
a most fortunate factor in the fortunes of both <lb/>
sisters. After the publication of the first two volumes, <lb/>
which were brought out by Mr Colburn on an <reg orig="agree-|ment">agreement</reg> <lb/>
with Agnes of "a share account"&mdash;<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the <lb/>
author risking nothing and dividing the profits of <lb/>
the sales with him&mdash;she fell dangerously ill, as the <lb/>
result of intense labour and disappointment at the <lb/>
paltry sum which he handed over to her after a long <lb/>
delayed settlement. The rapid sales of the most <lb/>
<pb n="318" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0375"/>
popular work that he had ever published rendered <lb/>
Mr Colburn's conduct absolutely indefensible, and <lb/>
as fame was a secondary consideration to profit, we <lb/>
cannot wonder at the mental and physical <reg orig="prostra-|tion">prostration</reg> <lb/>
caused by receipts so different from those which <lb/>
the sisters had every right to expect.</p>
<p>Elizabeth's keenly perceptive mind saw a way <lb/>
out of the difficulty. When he insisted upon the <lb/>
continuation of the volumes, which in the case of <lb/>
Agnes was then absolutely impossible owing to the <lb/>
state of her health, Elizabeth, promptly realising <lb/>
that he had no legal claim whatever upon her own <lb/>
services, as her name had never been mentioned in <lb/>
the matter, first of all consulted an eminent barrister <lb/>
&mdash;Mr Archibald Stephens&mdash;and then, forewarned <lb/>
and forearmed, interviewed the importunate <reg orig="pub-|lisher">publisher</reg>. <lb/>
After stating her sister's precarious <reg orig="condi-|tion">condition</reg> <lb/>
and the joint authorship of the work, she <lb/>
quietly informed him, "I shall do nothing for you, <lb/>
having signed no document to that effect."</p>
<p>The puzzled publisher, thus baldly confronted <lb/>
with irrefragable facts, was much exasperated, but, <lb/>
knowing the value of the projected memoirs, he <lb/>
made her an offer of &pound;150 per volume, receiving <lb/>
as his reply, "If my sister upon her recovery is <lb/>
willing to accept your offer, I shall not refuse my <lb/>
assistance, but I will not allow my name to appear <lb/>
on the title-page."</p>
<p>Finally Mr Stephens drew up a formal agreement <lb/>
<pb n="319" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0376"/>
to that effect, and under the new deed no corrections <lb/>
or alterations were to be made by any one but the <lb/>
authors themselves, nor could the copyright be sold <lb/>
without their permission. When the enormous sums <lb/>
now given to writers of fiction is taken into account, <lb/>
we cannot but marvel at the modest remuneration <lb/>
of &pound;1800 which the sisters received for their "<reg orig="monu-|mental">monumental</reg> <lb/>
work." In this connection it may be <reg orig="men-|tioned">mentioned</reg> <lb/>
that Rudyard Kipling is reported to have <lb/>
received two shillings a word for a story of 10,000 <lb/>
words; while 'Sappho,' which it would have been <lb/>
better for the world had it never been written, <lb/>
brought to Alphonse Daudet the gigantic sum of <lb/>
&pound;40,000.</p>
<p>The labour and expense involved in the production <lb/>
of 'The Queens' was enormous, while the <reg orig="indus-|trious">industrious</reg> <lb/>
and painstaking research necessary was doubly <lb/>
arduous in the early days of the nineteenth century. <lb/>
No pains were spared by the sisters to make the <lb/>
memoirs as faithful and as full as possible&mdash;there is <lb/>
no scamping work; and as we read the entrancing <lb/>
volumes, we are filled with admiration alike at the <lb/>
pathos and the power of the writing and at the <lb/>
carefully marshalled array of interesting facts, culled <lb/>
from sources that varied from rare State papers to <lb/>
the private archives of old English families.</p>
<p>The influence of Mr Howard of Corby Castle and <lb/>
Sir George Strickland prevailed upon Lord <reg orig="Nor-|manby">Normanby</reg> <lb/>
to grant admission to the State Paper Office, <lb/>
<pb n="320" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0377"/>
which had previously been denied to them by Lord <lb/>
John Russell; and in this historical treasury they <lb/>
spent many toilful hours, with results which have <lb/>
enriched their pages and made clear many events <lb/>
which were previously veiled in obscurity.</p>
<p>Agnes Strickland's account of the coronation of <lb/>
our late beloved Queen is full of interest, and to the <lb/>
enthusiastic historians it must have been a time of <lb/>
vivid impressions, recalling many a bygone pageant, <lb/>
and fanning the flame of loyalty to our reigning <lb/>
house, which even their staunch Jacobite <reg orig="predilec-|tions">predilections</reg> <lb/>
had never been able to quench. Her <reg orig="descrip-|tion">description</reg> <lb/>
of the scene is doubly interesting now, and <lb/>
affords a specimen of the writer's easy and flowing <lb/>
style:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Her fair hair, in plaits, was simply folded and <lb/>
arranged at the back of her head in a Grecian knot. <lb/>
She wore the picturesque garland-shaped diadem of <lb/>
the Plantagenet sovereigns, only in a lighter form, <lb/>
composed of very fine brilliants set transparently, <lb/>
which, from their absence of colour and pellucid <lb/>
brightness, resembled a wreath of hawthorn <reg orig="blos-|soms">blossoms</reg> <lb/>
covered with tremulous dew-drops. Surely <lb/>
never did any British sovereign receive <reg orig="inaugura-|tion">inauguration</reg> <lb/>
under circumstances so auspicious and imposing. <lb/>
Yet she appeared serene and self-possessed when <lb/>
she arose from her private devotions and seated <reg orig="her-|self">herself</reg> <lb/>
calmly in her recognition chair, round which her <lb/>
lovely train-bearers were grouped in their perfect <lb/>
<pb n="321" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0378"/>
costumes of white satin and garlands of <reg orig="blush-|roses">blush-roses</reg>. <lb/>
There, too, were her maids of honour, in <lb/>
virgin white, in attendance on their Queen. The <lb/>
ladies of the bedchamber, in their matron dignity, <lb/>
were not less attractive in a uniform costume of <lb/>
white satin and blonde, with trains of watchet-blue,<ref target="n9" n="2"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
<note id="n9" place="foot" n="2"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>Sky-blue, from A.S. <hi rend="italic">woad</hi>.</p></note>
 <lb/>
white plumes, and splendid diamond tiaras.</p>
<p>"That pause between the recognition of the young <lb/>
Queen and her presentation to the people by the <lb/>
Archbishop of Canterbury was broken by the whole <lb/>
body of the Westminster scholars rising up and <lb/>
saluting their sovereign with the chorus, 'Victoria, <lb/>
Victoria, vivat Victoria Regina!' Of this, their <lb/>
prescriptive right, they certainly availed themselves <lb/>
in good earnest, proud to be the first in the Abbey <lb/>
to hail their liege lady.</p>
<p>"The tender paleness that had overspread her <lb/>
fair face on her entrance had yielded to a glow of <lb/>
'rosy celestial red,' and this brilliant flush added <lb/>
to the beauty of her countenance, and set off her <lb/>
jewels and regal splendour. In her right hand she <lb/>
bore the sceptre, in her left the orb, which, though <lb/>
large for the grasp of her fairy fingers, she carried <lb/>
with peculiar grace, moving with a firm majestic <lb/>
step, and acknowledging the rapturous applause of <lb/>
her people with gracious looks and smiles of <reg orig="satis-|faction">satisfaction</reg>."</p>
<p>Another scene which afforded much pleasure was <lb/>
<pb n="322" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0379"/>
the Opening of Parliament by the young maiden <lb/>
Queen, and we may notice in passing that Agnes <lb/>
Strickland, in common with many of her auditors, <lb/>
was struck by the silvery sweetness of that <reg orig="bell-|toned">bell-toned</reg> <lb/>
voice.</p>
<p>In 1840 she had the honourable pleasure of <lb/>
presentation to the Queen and the Prince <reg orig="Con-|sort">Consort</reg>, <lb/>
under the auspices of the venerable Lady <lb/>
Stourton; and the friendly look which the Queen <lb/>
gave on hearing her name was not a little <reg orig="gratify-|ing">gratifying</reg> <lb/>
to the essentially feminine nature of the <reg orig="daintily-|clad">daintily-clad</reg> <lb/>
historian.</p>
<p>We may feel sure that her Court costume on this <lb/>
occasion was carefully thought out, and can well <lb/>
believe that her tall and graceful figure, clear <reg orig="com-|plexion">complexion</reg> <lb/>
warmed into colour with excitement, black <lb/>
abundant hair and finely-moulded bust and arms, <lb/>
would all appear to the best advantage in the <lb/>
violet velvet draperies, lined with primrose silk <lb/>
and lightened with Brussels lace, which she had <lb/>
selected as a suitable garb in which to pay her <lb/>
devout homage to the Queen Regnant of Great <lb/>
Britain and Ireland.</p>
<p>Later she attended several Drawing-rooms, and <lb/>
was fortunate enough to be present at that in <lb/>
which the royal bride&mdash;the "Sea-king's daughter <lb/>
from over the sea"&mdash;presided.</p>
<p>"She is very pretty," writes Agnes to her sister, <lb/>
"graceful and intellectual in appearance, smaller <lb/>
<pb n="323" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0380"/>
than the Queen, but fairylike and exquisitely <reg orig="pro-|portioned">proportioned</reg>. <lb/>
She looked very royal and girlish too. <lb/>
She gave me a very gracious bow; so did the <lb/>
Prince of Wales, who is very handsome, though <lb/>
short in stature. He must have been proud of his <lb/>
beautiful wife."</p>
<p>Such is her description, and Tennyson's "<reg orig="Wel-|come">Welcome</reg>" <lb/>
is no less enthusiastic.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"The sea-king's daughter as happy as fair,</l>
<l>Blissful bride of a blissful heir,</l>
<l>Bride of the heir of the kings of the sea&mdash;</l>
<l>O joy to the people and joy to the throne,</l>
<l>Come to us, love us, and make us your own;</l>
<l>For Saxon or Dane or Norman we,</l>
<l>Teuton or Celt, or whatever we be,</l>
<l>We are each all Dane in our welcome of thee,</l>
<l rend="indent">Alexandra!"</l>
</lg></q>
<p>The two last volumes of 'The Queens' were <lb/>
finished in 1849, and, though there is always a <lb/>
great satisfaction in completion, it is probable that <lb/>
both sisters felt a tinge of regret at finishing a <lb/>
work which must have become part of their daily <lb/>
life, and which had taken them into many scenes <lb/>
and circumstances which would otherwise have been <lb/>
unknown and impossible to them.</p>
<p>For twelve years they had laboured indefatigably <lb/>
at their self-imposed task, and we can well believe <lb/>
that it had become a labour of love. Much that <lb/>
had hitherto been but little known had been <lb/>
written of and verified with judicious care, and <lb/>
<pb n="324" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0381"/>
Guizot, Lingard, and Alison united in praising the <lb/>
result.</p>
<p>Guizot's testimony was peculiarly gratifying, <lb/>
couched as it was in the graceful phraseology of <lb/>
France. "It is a charming work. You have <lb/>
studied from the source and presented your facts <lb/>
singularly exempt from dryness."</p>
<p>Lingard says frankly, "It afforded me great <lb/>
pleasure, bringing to my recollection many <reg orig="anec-|dotes">anecdotes</reg> <lb/>
which I had forgotten, and making me <reg orig="ac-|quainted">acquainted</reg> <lb/>
with many that I had never met with&mdash; <lb/>
at least, as far as I can recollect;" while Alison, <lb/>
who, as a historian, is perhaps more widely known <lb/>
than either, gives his opinion in these words: "I <lb/>
can safely say that I have acquired a much <lb/>
clearer idea of English history from your own <lb/>
than I ever did from general history&mdash;and so I <lb/>
never fail to say both at home and abroad. And <lb/>
the reason is, the history of each queen forms a <lb/>
separate cell in the memory in which to deposit <lb/>
the events of the past, and your genius has given <lb/>
an interest to the narrative which renders the <lb/>
storing no longer a labour, but a most agreeable <lb/>
occupation."</p>
<p>The 'Queens of England' finished, the sisters at <lb/>
once set to work upon the 'Queens of Scotland,' <lb/>
and in her life of the unfortunate Mary Stuart, <lb/>
Agnes found a ready vent for the pathos and <lb/>
enthusiasm of which her imaginative nature was <lb/>
<pb n="325" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0382"/>
so capable. Every good point is accentuated, every <lb/>
frailty compassionated, and we feel throughout that <lb/>
the beautiful victim was more sinned against than <lb/>
sinning.</p>
<p>The storm of Low Church indignation which <lb/>
had been called forth by the life of Mary Tudor <lb/>
broke forth anew upon the publication of the life <lb/>
of Mary Stuart. Those whose bigotry prevented <lb/>
them from seeing the many noble qualities which, <lb/>
beneath her unbending hatred of Protestantism, <lb/>
Mary Tudor really possessed, now called Agnes a <lb/>
"Jesuitess"; and one Ipswich Churchman even <lb/>
went so far as to advise parents to prohibit their <lb/>
children from reading these frankly written <reg orig="un-|sectarian">unsectarian</reg> <lb/>
Lives.</p>
<p>It is refreshing to find that Dr Stanley, Bishop <lb/>
of Norwich, praises them unstintingly, and that the <lb/>
'Edinburgh Review' had the perspicacity to <reg orig="dis-|cern">discern</reg> <lb/>
that the author was "a staunch upholder and <lb/>
adherent of the Church of England, a stickler for <lb/>
all its constitutions, and attached to monarchical <lb/>
government and the right divine of kings."</p>
<p>It is worth noticing that Arthur Penrhyn <reg orig="Stan-|ley">Stanley</reg>, <lb/>
Dean of Westminster, inherited from his father <lb/>
the same large-hearted views. We find the <reg orig="Arch-|bishop">Archbishop</reg> <lb/>
of Canterbury, Archibald Campbell Tate&mdash; <lb/>
no incapable critic&mdash;saying of him, in 1881, that <lb/>
"He became almost bigoted against bigotry and <lb/>
intolerant of intolerance. He threw himself with <lb/>
<pb n="326" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0383"/>
chivalrous disdain of consequences into the defence <lb/>
of the weak." All of him that is mortal now <lb/>
rests in "The Abbey," beneath a tomb bearing <lb/>
the inscription, which surely must have been <lb/>
chosen by himself, "I see that all things come <lb/>
to an end, but Thy commandment is exceeding <lb/>
broad."&mdash;Psalm cxix. 96.</p>
<p>As there seems, both during the life of the <reg orig="Strick-|lands">Stricklands</reg> <lb/>
and even now in these later days, to have <lb/>
been some doubt cast upon their allegiance to the <lb/>
Established Church, it may be well to state that <lb/>
never once did they swerve from the faith of that <lb/>
communion.</p>
<p>The Stricklands of Sizergh have always been <lb/>
Roman Catholics, and one of the cousins of Agnes, <lb/>
a Jesuit missionary, exclaimed on meeting her, "A <lb/>
Strickland and not a Catholic!" But the southern <lb/>
branch of the family, to which she belonged, <lb/>
were staunch Protestants, and the false charge <lb/>
of Romanism brought against them by ignorant <lb/>
bigots was a source of great annoyance to both <lb/>
sisters. They never hesitated, however, in their <lb/>
determination to write as honestly of the Queens <lb/>
belonging to the Roman religion as of those who <lb/>
were Protestants, and this deliberate impartiality <lb/>
was ignobly misunderstood by those in whom party <lb/>
spirit had degenerated into dogmatism. In religious <lb/>
matters it is rare indeed to find a man who can read <lb/>
or write unbiassedly. It takes a man like Bradford <lb/>
<pb n="327" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0384"/>
the martyr to say with noble magnanimity, almost <lb/>
within sight of the stake, "This woman" &lpar;"Bloody <lb/>
Mary"&rpar;, "but for her religion, would be an <reg orig="ex-|cellent">excellent</reg> <lb/>
ruler."</p>
<p>As the early life of Mary Queen of Scots was <lb/>
passed in France, it was necessary that they should <lb/>
prosecute their researches with regard to her in <lb/>
Paris, and thither accordingly the sisters repaired. <lb/>
Fragments of Agnes's journal at this time are <lb/>
given in her 'Life,' and are full of vigour and fun. <lb/>
She was fortunate enough to hear the Roman <reg orig="ser-|vice">service</reg> <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">for the first time</hi> in the glorious Cathedral of <lb/>
Rouen, where the beauty of the music gave her <lb/>
"more pleasure than any opera or oratorio had <lb/>
ever afforded."</p>
<p>They left that picturesque city with much regret, <lb/>
and were soon established at the old Jacobite hotel <lb/>
in Paris known as "Le Prince de Galles."</p>
<p>Through the kind courtesy of Guizot, the <reg orig="states-|man-historian">statesman-historian</reg>, <lb/>
they were given every opportunity <lb/>
for inspecting the "Archives de Royaume de <lb/>
France" and the "Archives des Affaires <reg orig="&Eacute;tran-|g&egrave;res">&Eacute;trang&egrave;res</reg>."</p>
<p>These archives were full of interesting and <reg orig="valu-|able">valuable</reg> <lb/>
information, in which the sisters revelled with <lb/>
exceeding joy. At the H&ocirc;tel Soubise they were <lb/>
introduced to Monsieur Michelet, who presented <lb/>
them with a considerable amount of MSS. for their <lb/>
inspection; and in one of these, containing the <lb/>
<pb n="328" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0385"/>
will of Mary of Modena, and an account of her <lb/>
escape from England, they were much interested <lb/>
in noticing the name of their own ancestress, Lady <lb/>
Strickland, who had accompanied her royal mistress <lb/>
into exile. In the "Scots College," moreover, to <lb/>
which so many of Mary Stuart's letters were <reg orig="ad-|dressed">addressed</reg>, <lb/>
they saw an original portrait of young <lb/>
James&mdash;the son of James II.&mdash;in which Roger <lb/>
Strickland of Sizergh also appears, carrying the <lb/>
helmet of his master, whose restoration to the <lb/>
throne of England at that date, 1703, seemed a <lb/>
not unlikely contingency.</p>
<p>In a letter to her mother, Agnes says of Guizot <lb/>
that "he is the most delightful and amiable person <lb/>
in the world, with beautiful eyes beaming with <lb/>
intelligence and kindness. He is about fifty-five, <lb/>
rather below the middle height, with a pale clear <lb/>
complexion, grand forehead, but decidedly <reg orig="hand-|some">handsome</reg>. <lb/>
He speaks English beautifully, and has the <lb/>
sweetest voice in the world."</p>
<p>On their return to England the Duke of <reg orig="Devon-|shire">Devonshire</reg> <lb/>
invited them to his villa at Chiswick to see <lb/>
some of his family archives, which he thought <lb/>
might be useful reading. He gave them a very <lb/>
dainty dinner, but it is rather quaint to hear that <lb/>
he abjured all waiting of servants, and only <reg orig="sum-|moned">summoned</reg> <lb/>
them when required by striking on a <lb/>
tumbler. They found him a most pleasant host, <lb/>
manly and unassuming; and in the following year <lb/>
<pb n="329" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0386"/>
Agnes gladly availed herself of his offer of <reg orig="admis-|sion">admission</reg> <lb/>
to the archives at Chatsworth and Hardwick, <lb/>
of which he said, "In regard to Mary Queen of <lb/>
Scots it may be useful in detail to see two places&mdash; <lb/>
one where she certainly did live, and the other <lb/>
long supposed to be her residence." The courtesy <lb/>
which she received from numerous members of the <lb/>
aristocracy, both in England and Scotland, was <lb/>
almost remarkable, until we consider that true <lb/>
aristocrats are accustomed to their position, and <lb/>
never try, by impressing other people with it, to <lb/>
confirm their own consciousness of importance.</p>
<p>In a true patrician the <hi rend="italic">graciousness</hi> of giving is <lb/>
seldom wanting, and those who have always <reg orig="en-|joyed">enjoyed</reg> <lb/>
the dignities of a goodly heritage can <reg orig="dis-|pense">dispense</reg> <lb/>
favours without any of the arrogance which <lb/>
generally mars the gift and the demeanour of <lb/>
those who have risen&mdash;albeit praiseworthily&mdash;to <lb/>
a position unto which they were not born.</p>
<p>Hospitality waited upon her footsteps throughout <lb/>
her journeyings in Scotland, and she was thus <lb/>
enabled, with much comfort and comparatively <lb/>
little expense, to visit every part where Mary <lb/>
Stuart had been.</p>
<p>Dr Norman Macleod, the Presbyterian minister <lb/>
of London, was invited to meet her during her <lb/>
visit to the Lowlands, and, to the great surprise <lb/>
and pleasure of Agnes, she found him to be a <lb/>
great admirer and friend of Mary Queen of Scots. <lb/>
<pb n="330" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0387"/>
After attending a service at his church he took <lb/>
her to see the graves of some Puritan martyrs, <lb/>
and with a frankness unusual in clerical <reg orig="conver-|sation">conversation</reg> <lb/>
he said, "These, though well-meaning, were <lb/>
troublesome men. Persecutors themselves, but <lb/>
ready to die for conscience' sake, they were <reg orig="bar-|barously">barbarously</reg> <lb/>
used; but they would have done the <lb/>
same to others&mdash;it was the spirit of the times."</p>
<p>Is that spirit dead yet? Is it not scotched, <lb/>
rather than killed?</p>
<p>The Epistles of John, the Apostle of Love, <lb/>
are known and read of all men to-day, but zeal <lb/>
is still intemperate and intolerant, and the <reg orig="per-|secutions">persecutions</reg> <lb/>
of tongue and pen are often as hard to <lb/>
bear patiently as those of the sword or the stake.</p>
<p>During this visit she was present at a Scotch <lb/>
wedding, which was celebrated in a manner <reg orig="be-|fitting">befitting</reg> <lb/>
the station of the bride, Miss Constance <lb/>
Crauford of Craufordland Castle, whose father was <lb/>
the hereditary cup-bearer of the kings of <reg orig="Scot-|land">Scotland</reg>. <lb/>
The ancient custom of washing the bride's <lb/>
feet by the bridesmaids on the night preceding <lb/>
the wedding was duly carried out, and the <reg orig="ex-|citement">excitement</reg> <lb/>
caused by the finding of a gold ring in <lb/>
the foot-bath occasioned much laughter, as the <lb/>
finder is traditionally supposed to be the first of <lb/>
the bride's attendants who will enter upon the <lb/>
holy estate of matrimony.</p>
<p>In 1850 the negotiations for the publication of <lb/>
<pb n="331" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0388"/>
the 'Queens of Scotland' were completed, Messrs <lb/>
Blackwood at once agreeing to the terms <reg orig="pro-|posed">proposed</reg> <lb/>
by the authors, which Mr Colburn had <lb/>
refused. This change of publishers was very <lb/>
beneficial to the Misses Strickland in every way.</p>
<p>The first volume sold rapidly, to the great <reg orig="satis-|faction">satisfaction</reg> <lb/>
of all concerned; and, as one followed <lb/>
another in quick succession, the celebrity of the <lb/>
authors increased. Agnes herself thought this <lb/>
work to be better written than the previous one, <lb/>
and though, as a rule, authors are not to be <lb/>
trusted in their estimate of their own works, it <lb/>
is generally acknowledged that the Scottish queens <lb/>
have been described with even more elegance and <lb/>
brightness than their English sisters.</p>
<p>Some one says that "Tradition is the memory <lb/>
of the people," and Agnes Strickland fully believed <lb/>
that in most cases it had a distinct foundation, <lb/>
slight perhaps but reliable, which time and trouble <lb/>
were capable of finding out, verifying and <reg orig="estab-|lishing">establishing</reg>. <lb/>
It has been so in innumerable cases, and <lb/>
much of our best literature is due to the <reg orig="influ-|ence">influence</reg> <lb/>
of those memories which have crystallised <lb/>
themselves into forms of fairest beauty during the <lb/>
course of years.</p>
<p>The history of Scotland specially abounds in <reg orig="in-|teresting">interesting</reg> <lb/>
traditions involving much research as to <lb/>
their origin, and it is certain that to Elizabeth <lb/>
much credit belongs for the careful labour <reg orig="be-|stowed">bestowed</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="332" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0389"/>
upon obscure records and far-away facts <lb/>
thus orally transmitted. Special pains were taken <lb/>
by Agnes to prove the innocence of Mary Stuart <lb/>
as to the murder of her husband, and this she <lb/>
appears to have done at any rate to her own <lb/>
satisfaction, though it still remains possible that <lb/>
the fair <hi rend="italic">intrigante</hi> may have been an accessory <lb/>
after the fact.</p>
<p>Froude's estimate was very different, and his <lb/>
flippancy with respect to the last tragic scene at <lb/>
Fotheringay excited in her an excusable <reg orig="indigna-|tion">indignation</reg>, <lb/>
mingled perhaps with the feeling that he <lb/>
was unjust to Mary, not only as a queen but as <lb/>
a woman.</p>
<p>In a letter to Elizabeth on the subject she says: <lb/>
"Have you seen my letter in 'The Times' of <lb/>
December the 2nd? I could not allow Froude's <lb/>
monstrous untruth to pass uncontradicted, or it <lb/>
would have been considered an established fact. <lb/>
Who does not admire those who die with dignity? <lb/>
They all play a part&mdash;a debt due to themselves <lb/>
and to public decorum. All women from the <lb/>
earliest period of their recollection do endeavour <lb/>
to set themselves off to the best advantage; it is <lb/>
a natural propensity and no crime. Mary came <lb/>
forth to die, arrayed like a queen, not in her <lb/>
shroud, and acted according to her high birth <lb/>
and station, with fortitude and resignation."</p>
<p>Mr Froude, however, forgave her public <reg orig="vituper-|ations">vituperations</reg> <lb/>
<pb n="333" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0390"/>
so frankly that she in her turn forgave <lb/>
him for denouncing her heroine, and the two <reg orig="sub-|sequently">subsequently</reg> <lb/>
met, or at any rate parted, on terms <lb/>
of mutual friendliness.</p>
<p>It is to be regretted, in general terms, that the <lb/>
"extenuating circumstances" which he so freely <lb/>
granted to Henry VIII. were not more evenly <lb/>
distributed among those of whose lives he has <lb/>
written.</p>
<p>On returning to London, to work up the facts <lb/>
collected during her travels, Agnes once more <lb/>
found herself surrounded by friends both <reg orig="fashion-|able">fashionable</reg> <lb/>
and literary; and, her tastes being very <lb/>
gregarious, she found much pleasure and recreation <lb/>
in the social functions which her position and <lb/>
talents secured for her.</p>
<p>On one occasion she met Thomas Babington, <lb/>
afterwards Lord, Macaulay, who, curiously enough, <lb/>
struck her as being "ugly, vulgar, and pompous." <lb/>
This impression may have been accentuated by the <lb/>
presence of the aristocratic company who were <lb/>
gathered together at Lord Somerset's dinner-table, <lb/>
for other authorities unite in saying that "his face <lb/>
was so constantly lit up by every joyful and <lb/>
ennobling emotion that it mattered little if, when <lb/>
absolutely quiescent, it was rather homely than <lb/>
handsome"&mdash;"a man of rare intelligence, deep <lb/>
research, and untiring energy: also a kind, <reg orig="court-|eous">courteous</reg>, <lb/>
and unaffected gentleman."</p>
<pb n="334" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0391"/>
<p>'The Bachelor Kings of England' was her next <lb/>
big undertaking; and in 1861 a volume bearing <lb/>
that title appeared in elegant binding from the <lb/>
press of Mr Burton of Ipswich, who had published <lb/>
'Old Friends and New Acquaintances' in the <lb/>
previous year. It is probable that had it been <lb/>
published in London it would be as well known as <lb/>
it deserves to be, for the subject is an interesting <lb/>
one; but a provincial publisher is always at a <lb/>
disadvantage, and the book has certainly not had <lb/>
as large a sale as 'The Queens.' The presentation <lb/>
of a copy to the Prince of Wales resulted in a <lb/>
most gracious acknowledgment from the royal <lb/>
bachelor; and in the autumn of that year Agnes <lb/>
received an invitation from the Mayor of Dublin <lb/>
to meet H.R.H. at a ball to be given there in <lb/>
honour of his visit.</p>
<p>Such an exceptional opportunity of visiting <lb/>
Ireland was not to be refused, and her impressions <lb/>
of that "beautiful and glorious country" were <lb/>
altogether pleasant. The ball itself was a great <lb/>
success, and Agnes writes as follows to her <lb/>
mother: "I was presented last night to the <lb/>
Prince of Wales by General Bruce, though it <lb/>
seems this was not according to etiquette, only <lb/>
his Royal Highness wished for the introduction. <lb/>
He was very gracious, thanked me for having sent <lb/>
him my books, 'which,' he said, 'had afforded him <lb/>
much pleasure,' though, speaking of the 'Bachelor <lb/>
<pb n="335" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0392"/>
Kings,' he assured me 'he did not mean to be <lb/>
one.' In person he is really a very pretty fellow, <lb/>
small in stature, but very well-shaped and dignified <lb/>
in appearance, though timid in manner. His eyes, <lb/>
eyebrows, and hair are really beautiful; he has a <lb/>
handsome, well-cut, aquiline nose, full lips, beautiful <lb/>
teeth, and an agreeable smile. He blushed, and <lb/>
was a little agitated while speaking with me. He <lb/>
danced unweariedly and very elegantly, though the <lb/>
height and fulness of some of his partners nearly <lb/>
eclipsed him." This na&iuml;ve description of H.R.H. <lb/>
in 1861 is very interesting reading in 1906. <reg orig="Forty-|five">Forty-five</reg> <lb/>
years have passed since then, his eyes have <lb/>
lost their youthful lustre, and his hair is grey and <lb/>
scanty, but the smile is still there that has won <lb/>
him friends over all the world. Our "godly <lb/>
prince," Edward VII., King of Great Britain and <lb/>
Ireland and Emperor of India, has now come into <lb/>
his inheritance, and "the sea - king's daughter" <lb/>
is now the beautiful Queen whom the nation <lb/>
delighteth to honour.</p>
<p>Not since the time of George III. and Charlotte <lb/>
of Mecklenburg, in 1760, had a dual Coronation <lb/>
taken place in full State, and the ceremonial <lb/>
pageantry with which our present King was <lb/>
installed to his high office probably exceeded in <lb/>
historic gorgeousness anything that had ever <lb/>
before been witnessed.</p>
<p>The circumstances ante - dating the original <lb/>
<pb n="336" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0393"/>
Coronation Day&mdash;June 26&mdash;will be fresh in the <lb/>
mind of every Englishman, but there is no need <lb/>
to apologise for a few words on such a subject. <lb/>
The whole world was thrilled at the news which, <lb/>
on the morning of June 24, 1903, engirdled it <lb/>
in "forty minutes."</p>
<p>That he who for so long had done the nation's <lb/>
work should at the last be debarred from the <lb/>
possession of the chiefest honour which that <lb/>
nation could bestow, seemed a possible irony of <lb/>
fate, cruel beyond believing.</p>
<p>Intensified a thousand-fold in 1903 were the <lb/>
patriotic feelings of 1872, when of the then Prince <lb/>
of Wales the world waited breathlessly for tidings <lb/>
from Sandringham, and a whole nation was seen <lb/>
kneeling in agonised petition to the Almighty for <lb/>
the life of their future Sovereign.</p>
<p>On each occasion all that is best in Englishmen <lb/>
awoke to a realisation of loyalty and religion, <lb/>
and a unanimity of interest and sympathy gave <lb/>
renewed strength to imperial claims which had <lb/>
seemed but just before to be threatened. This <lb/>
distressed anxiety thus twice displayed in his <lb/>
welfare cannot fail to have deepened an honourable <lb/>
sense of responsibility, and a personal longing in <lb/>
our King to deserve and to retain the love of his <lb/>
subjects.</p>
<p>"Will my people ever forgive me?" were his first <lb/>
words on recovering consciousness, and in them <lb/>
<pb n="337" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0394"/>
we can see the almost pathetic unselfishness and <lb/>
insight of the man's nature. Realising to the <lb/>
full their disappointment, they were still "my <lb/>
people"&mdash;the nation for which he had been <reg orig="con-|tent">content</reg>, <lb/>
during many weary days before that terrible <lb/>
June 24, to suffer uncomplainingly,&mdash;for the sake <lb/>
of whose pleasure he would willingly have <reg orig="post-|poned">postponed</reg>, <lb/>
had it been possible, the operation upon <lb/>
which his life depended. <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l rend="indent">"Methinks</l>
<l>There's something lonely in the state of Kings,"</l>
</lg></q>
says Barry Cornwall, and Tennyson spoke even to <lb/>
Queen Victoria as being "so alone on that terrible <lb/>
height"; but if ever any ruler enjoyed immunity <lb/>
from "royal loneliness," it is assuredly our Edward <lb/>
VII.</p>
<p>As Harold Begbie says, "It is the personality <lb/>
and the simplicity of the King's mind which have <lb/>
proved mightier than all the more notable weapons <lb/>
in the armoury of governmental diplomacy. Tact <lb/>
may have won him this victory, but only the tact <lb/>
of an intensely human soul, genuine in its love of <lb/>
peace and fellowship, could have made that victory <lb/>
so complete and so enduring."</p>
<p>The 'Lives of the Seven Bishops' next engaged <lb/>
the attention of the sisters, and of these Agnes <lb/>
wrote the five dealing with Sancroft the Primate, <lb/>
Turner of Ely, Lake of Chichester, Ken of Bath <lb/>
<pb n="338" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0395"/>
and Wells, and White of Peterborough; while <lb/>
Elizabeth only contributed the lives of Lloyd of <lb/>
S. Asaph and Trelawney of Bristol.</p>
<p>On the 8th of June 1688 these holy men of old <lb/>
were committed to the Tower on the charge of <lb/>
having written and published a seditious libel, but <lb/>
on the 30th day of the same month they were set <lb/>
at liberty, to the great mortification of James II. <lb/>
and the exceeding great joy of the English people, <lb/>
who were getting tired of Jacobite squabbles and <lb/>
the despotism of Rome.</p>
<p>Paradoxical as it may appear, the Stricklands, <lb/>
although staunch Jacobites, were equally staunch <lb/>
Anglicans, and Sancroft was an object of especial <lb/>
hero-worship to Agnes. The writing of this book, <lb/>
therefore, was a real pleasure; but literary work <lb/>
had at last to give way before the dominating <lb/>
presence of death. Her aged mother, now in her <lb/>
ninety-second year, was drawing to the end of her <lb/>
long life, and in September 1864 she passed away, <lb/>
with the hands of her daughters, Agnes and Jane, <lb/>
still clasped in hers. This event broke up for ever <lb/>
the old home at Reydon, and these two younger <lb/>
sisters lived henceforth in houses adjoining each <lb/>
other in the pretty little seaside village of <reg orig="South-|wold">Southwold</reg> <lb/>
in Suffolk, while Elizabeth had an altogether <lb/>
separate establishment at Bayswater and <reg orig="subse-|quently">subsequently</reg> <lb/>
at Tilford.</p>
<p>At this time Agnes Strickland was sixty-eight <lb/>
<pb n="339" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0396"/>
years of age, and might very reasonably have <lb/>
shrunk from any fresh undertaking. But no <reg orig="con-|sideration">consideration</reg> <lb/>
of that kind affected her, and in 1869 we <lb/>
find her starting off for Holland, on literary <reg orig="busi-|ness">business</reg> <lb/>
bound. 'The Lives of the Stuart Princesses' <lb/>
was to be the top-stone of the historic cairn which <lb/>
it had been her life-work to erect. Without this <lb/>
she did not feel that it would be properly <reg orig="com-|pleted">completed</reg>, <lb/>
and as the documentary information <reg orig="requis-|ite">requisite</reg> <lb/>
for her life of Mary, Princess of Orange, the <lb/>
eldest daughter of Charles I., was not obtainable <lb/>
in England, she determined to visit The Hague. <lb/>
Here she was treated with every courtesy, and <lb/>
gained much valuable knowledge. She had the <lb/>
honour of presentation to the Queen of the <reg orig="Nether-|lands">Netherlands</reg>, <lb/>
who showed her much kindness, and advised <lb/>
her to examine the 'Annals of the House of <lb/>
Orange.' She was agreeably surprised with the <lb/>
characteristics of the Dutch, but the "flatness" of <lb/>
the language and of the country cannot have failed <lb/>
to strike her unpleasantly. The language is indeed <lb/>
a mixture of various tongues, but, unlike English, <lb/>
of which the same might, not unjustly, be said, they <lb/>
are each spoiled in the mixing, and the result is <lb/>
unspeakably hideous.</p>
<p>The learned librarian at Lambeth&mdash;Mr Weyland <lb/>
Kirshaw&mdash;gave her much help with the life of <lb/>
Henrietta, the youngest daughter of Charles I., by <lb/>
deciphering the badly written letters of that <reg orig="Prin-|cess">Princess</reg>, <lb/>
<pb n="340" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0397"/>
whose education was more neglected than is <lb/>
that of the poorest child in England to-day. This <lb/>
assistance was a great boon, for, as Elizabeth <lb/>
strongly disapproved of the whole scheme, and <lb/>
would have nothing whatever to do with either <lb/>
the preparation or correction of the book, Agnes, <lb/>
for the first time in her life, had to rely entirely <lb/>
upon her own discretion and research.</p>
<p>Much, however, as she missed Elizabeth's help, <lb/>
she was able to carry out her plans with great <lb/>
satisfaction to herself and her publishers&mdash;Messrs <lb/>
Bell &amp; Daldy. Of 'The Stuart Princesses' <reg orig="com-|paratively">comparatively</reg> <lb/>
little is known by the general public, <lb/>
but that their lives are delineated with her wonted <lb/>
vigour and skill is shown by the warm greeting <lb/>
which the book received from all those interested <lb/>
in its subject.</p>
<p>In 1870 she was much cheered by the Queen's <lb/>
acknowledgment of her labours in granting her a <lb/>
pension of &pound;100 per annum on the civil list, which <lb/>
was specially welcome as the years rolled on.</p>
<p>Her last visit to Scotland was on the occasion of <lb/>
the Scott Centenary, for which she received a <lb/>
special invitation from the Committee. The long <lb/>
journey was accomplished with comparative ease, <lb/>
and in meeting many old and valued friends the <lb/>
fatigues of travel were soon forgotten.</p>
<p>On her return to Southwold she completed the <lb/>
abridgment of Mary Stuart's life, a work involving <lb/>
<pb n="341" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0398"/>
much time and labour; and, after leaving the MS. <lb/>
with Messrs Bell &amp; Daldy, she went for a few <lb/>
days of rest and refreshment to Crouch End <lb/>
Vicarage.</p>
<p>In the quiet home of Mr and Mrs Fleming she <lb/>
greatly enjoyed her much-needed holiday, and had <lb/>
made all her plans for returning home on the <reg orig="fol-|lowing">following</reg> <lb/>
day, when on the Sunday morning she fell <lb/>
upon the stairs as she was coming down dressed <lb/>
for church, and, falling with her leg under her, she <lb/>
broke the large and small bones just above the <lb/>
ankle. Such an accident could not fail to be very <lb/>
serious; and for six weeks the brave patient was <lb/>
laid up at the hospitable vicarage. Her patience <lb/>
was remarkable, and her chief regret seemed to be <lb/>
for the trouble that she was involuntarily causing <lb/>
to her kind hosts, rather than for the suffering <lb/>
and confinement which she herself had to endure.</p>
<p>As soon as she was able to be moved with safety <lb/>
she returned to her own home, and bore the journey <lb/>
better than had been expected, looking bright and <lb/>
happy as she once more felt herself within its <lb/>
welcoming portals.</p>
<p>But, alas! it was but the beginning of the end. <lb/>
The shock to the system at her advanced age was <lb/>
more severe than had at first been supposed; and, <lb/>
one morning soon after her return, her sister Jane <lb/>
was much alarmed to find her inquiries answered <lb/>
either at random or not at all. The surgeon, who <lb/>
<pb n="342" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0399"/>
was immediately sent for, pronounced her to be <lb/>
suffering from a paralytic seizure, and for many <lb/>
days her condition caused acute anxiety. One side <lb/>
of her body was permanently affected, and she, who <lb/>
had always been accustomed to so much exercise <lb/>
and independence, was now only able to walk with <lb/>
a stick, supported also by her faithful servant.</p>
<p>But though the shadow of physical and mental <lb/>
weakness hung over her, Agnes Strickland never <lb/>
once lost the bright hopefulness which had always <lb/>
been one of her most conspicuous characteristics. <lb/>
Her letters, though difficult to decipher, were full <lb/>
of loving cheerfulness, and, though shorter, there is <lb/>
in them no sign of intellectual decay.</p>
<p>The books, however, which had formerly given <lb/>
her so much pleasure were now an occasion of <lb/>
stumbling. They fatigued more than they profited, <lb/>
and ever more and more she turned to the "Old <lb/>
Book." This, however, was only a development of <lb/>
the habit of a lifetime. Even in her busiest days <lb/>
the Bible had been a source of real and <reg orig="never-|failing">never-failing</reg> <lb/>
pleasure; and now, as the burdens of life <lb/>
were gently slipping from her shoulders, her <reg orig="inter-|est">interest</reg>, <lb/>
which was fast fading in the things of earth, <lb/>
never failed to be aroused by the infinite variety of <lb/>
the one volume that is in itself a Literature. The <lb/>
quaint humour of the Proverbs, the lyrical beauty <lb/>
of the Psalms, the dramatic poetry of Job's thrilling <lb/>
experiences, and the many-sidedness of human life <lb/>
<pb n="343" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0400"/>
and nature, as described by the sacred writers, <lb/>
could still fix her attention when all else palled <lb/>
upon her; and above all she doubtless felt, as did <lb/>
her friend Guizot, "an extraordinary impression <lb/>
quite different from either curiosity or admiration <lb/>
&mdash;the listener of a language other than that of the <lb/>
chronicler or the poet, and under the influence of a <lb/>
breath issuing from other sources than human."</p>
<p>With the spring of the year &lpar;1874&rpar; she seemed to <lb/>
revive wonderfully, and we read of her driving out <lb/>
frequently, and even being able to take short walks. <lb/>
But the once brilliant intellect was now clouded, <lb/>
and the vivacious conversations were ended for <lb/>
ever. To write coherently was still possible to her, <lb/>
though difficult on account of failing eyesight, but <lb/>
she never recovered the full use of her speech.</p>
<p>The final revision and correction of Mary Stuart's <lb/>
life in its abridged form had to be delegated to her <lb/>
sisters, and this was perhaps the greatest trial that <lb/>
could have befallen her, but her cheery <reg orig="hopeful-|ness">hopefulness</reg> <lb/>
never failed; and when, with the sunshine all <lb/>
about her, she spoke of "complete restoration," <lb/>
even her friends took courage and began to talk <lb/>
of the future.</p>
<p>But this improvement was only as the last <lb/>
flickering gleams of the sun ere it sinks below the <lb/>
horizon.</p>
<p>One morning in July she felt stronger and better <lb/>
than she had done since her accident, and went in <lb/>
<pb n="344" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0401"/>
high spirits to see her sister Jane in the house <lb/>
adjoining. She then seemed full of renewed energy <lb/>
and hope, but at midnight Jane was hurriedly <lb/>
summoned, as Agnes was "seriously ill." That <lb/>
attack passed, and the patient for a time rallied, <lb/>
but a few days later, in the dead of night, her sister <lb/>
was again sent for. The end was then very near, <lb/>
and at six o'clock in the morning of July the 13th, <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"When the sun was bright and strong,</l>
<l>And the dew was glittering sharply</l>
<l rend="indent">Over the little lawn;</l>
<l>When the waves were laughing loudly</l>
<l rend="indent2">Along the shore,</l>
<l>And the little birds were singing sweetly</l>
<l rend="indent2">About the door,"</l>
</lg></q>
the summons came.</p>
<p>The terrible suffering of those last few hours had <lb/>
for the time marred the beauty of her face; but <lb/>
when, three hours later, her sister Jane went into <lb/>
the death - chamber the pained expression had <lb/>
vanished, and apparently years younger, more <lb/>
beautiful than ever, Agnes Strickland lay in the <lb/>
calm restfulness of a dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>Long and happy had the days of the years of her <lb/>
pilgrimage been. By temperament and disposition <lb/>
she was born to be loved, and few writers have <lb/>
made&mdash;and kept&mdash;so many true friends.</p>
<p>But she was unspoiled by praise even in the <lb/>
zenith of her fame, and as Ruskin says&mdash;</p>
<p>"To be heroic in happiness, to bear yourself <lb/>
<pb n="345" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0402"/>
gravely and righteously in the dazzling of the <lb/>
sunshine of morning, not to forget the God in <lb/>
whom you trust when He gives you most, not to <lb/>
fail those who trust you when they seem to need <lb/>
you least, this is the difficult fortitude."</p>
<p>They buried her in the parish churchyard at <lb/>
Southwold, and a simple marble monument marks <lb/>
the spot where Agnes Strickland lies. Her sister, <lb/>
Elizabeth, who only survived her for nine months, <lb/>
died and was buried at Tilford, in Surrey.</p>
<p>The lives of the two sisters were so closely <lb/>
entwined that much that has been written of <lb/>
Agnes might as truthfully have been written of <lb/>
Elizabeth, though her more masculine character <lb/>
and irritable temper did not secure for her as many <lb/>
loving and sympathetic friends as fell to the lot of <lb/>
Agnes.</p>
<p>Being the two seniors of the family, the other <lb/>
sisters were naturally much influenced by their <lb/>
examples, and Jane's unselfish help was often <lb/>
enlisted when their literary labours were especially <lb/>
arduous.</p>
<p>Sarah and Susanna both married happily; but, <lb/>
as her biographer says, "Agnes was fully aware <lb/>
that the pursuit of literature was unfavourable to a <lb/>
purely domestic life, and that, if she had married, <lb/>
that pursuit must of necessity be given up. The <lb/>
infelicity of celebrated literary women in the <lb/>
married state forms a heavy list. That some <lb/>
<pb n="346" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0403"/>
exceptions may be found is certain; but, indeed, <lb/>
it cannot add to the comfort of a husband if his <lb/>
wife's time is so occupied. A female author is <lb/>
wiser to remain unmarried." Jane, who in 1865 <lb/>
was supposed to be dying of bronchitis and asthma, <lb/>
survived her more brilliant relatives for several <lb/>
years, and her 'Life of Agnes Strickland,' written <lb/>
with such evident pride and pleasure, shows that, <lb/>
even in their father's house, the clever women of <lb/>
the family were appreciated as heartily as in the <lb/>
large outside world which for so many years they <lb/>
benefited and adorned.</p>

"than most persons would at first suppose. They <lb/>
"are extraordinarily numerous, and for their size <lb/>
"possess great muscular power. Worms prepare <lb/>
"the ground in an excellent manner for the growth <lb/>
"of fibrous-rooted plants and for seedlings of all <lb/>
"kinds." Does not this exactly describe a certain <lb/>
class of old maids? What would the world be <lb/>
<pb n="350" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0409"/>
without them? Can too much be said of their <lb/>
work, the result of which is so beneficial&mdash;their <lb/>
numerical value and the energising power to which <lb/>
their apparent strength is so disproportionate&mdash; <lb/>
their patience, perseverance, and adaptable habits <lb/>
&mdash;their ability to prepare and make ready for <lb/>
subsequent effort and more ostentatious labour.</p>
<p>Looked at abstractly, what a "glorious phalanx" <lb/>
they are; looked at concretely, what an infinitude <lb/>
of quiet work they have accomplished. Leave <lb/>
them out of the world's history, and how much <lb/>
would have been either left undone or done far <lb/>
less efficiently. The old maids of Bethany have <lb/>
pointed more morals than could be imagined since <lb/>
Anno Domini began,&mdash;the memory of the Maid <lb/>
of Orleans and Charlotte of Corday will live as <lb/>
long as heroism itself,&mdash;and in all countries there <lb/>
always have been, and will be, those who in single <lb/>
blessedness have found a better thing than mere <lb/>
happiness.</p>
<p>Not always, however, is their celibacy <reg orig="self-|sought">self-sought</reg>. <lb/>
By an inexorable law there are millions <lb/>
of women who can never marry, simply because <lb/>
the supply is greater than the demand; and the <lb/>
world has reason to be thankful for the fact, <lb/>
inasmuch as so much more easily pleased are men <lb/>
than women, that they ask far less in marriage <lb/>
than does a woman in the way of sterling, <reg orig="hard-|wearing">hard-wearing</reg> <lb/>
qualities. Physical comeliness goes farther <lb/>
<pb n="351" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0410"/>
with most men than moral or intellectual worth, <lb/>
and as a natural consequence the best and most <lb/>
useful of the female sex are frequently found <lb/>
among the ranks of the unmarried.</p>
<p>There is one class of Old Maid&mdash;possibly a larger <lb/>
one than would appear at first sight&mdash;upon which <lb/>
we have not hitherto touched; the saddened souls, <lb/>
predestined as it seems to solitariness, who from <lb/>
hereditary taint of insanity or disease are debarred <lb/>
from matrimony.</p>
<p>The world holds its peace too often with regard <lb/>
to mental and physical disabilities, but they exist <lb/>
in every community. There are thousands of <lb/>
"dream children" peopling the world, and medical <lb/>
men know many sad tales in which the sweet <lb/>
joys of possible parenthood have been surrendered <lb/>
from an overwhelming sense of duty to <reg orig="genera-|tions">generations</reg> <lb/>
yet unborn. In this connection the name of <lb/>
Mary Lamb rises irresistibly to our thoughts.</p>
<p>It is improbable that one of whom we read <lb/>
that she was for long intervals regarded as the <lb/>
"guardian angel" of every dwelling where she <lb/>
and her faithful brother took up their abode, <lb/>
should have passed her life untouched by the <lb/>
solicitudes of love. The recuperative powers of <lb/>
her brain were so great that his heroic <reg orig="self-|sacrifice">self-sacrifice</reg> <lb/>
seemed as nothing to him compared with <lb/>
the pleasures which her society afforded in her <lb/>
healthful days; and the fascination which she <lb/>
<pb n="352" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0411"/>
exerted over him was in all likelihood felt by <lb/>
one or other of his friends. It adds but little, <lb/>
however, to the pathos of her story if we imagine <lb/>
this to have been the case.</p>
<p>"Nobly planned" was Mary Lamb&mdash;a friend <lb/>
whose faithfulness knew no shadow of turning, a <lb/>
woman with whom Coleridge and Wordsworth, <lb/>
Landor and Hazlitt, delighted to converse, but in <lb/>
whose veins ran the fatal strain of an inherited <lb/>
insanity, and whose most sunshiny days were <lb/>
dimmed with the possibility of a premature <lb/>
darkness.</p>
<p>Of what she did in literature we are still in <lb/>
possession. The 'Tales from Shakespeare' have <lb/>
lived for nearly a hundred years, are still classics, <lb/>
and will doubtless remain so. As an introduction <lb/>
to Shakespeare for the young they are <reg orig="inimit-|ably">inimitably</reg> <lb/>
valuable, though in her simple Preface she <lb/>
modestly speaks of them as "faint and imperfect <lb/>
images," giving but a "few hints and little <reg orig="fore-|tastes">foretastes</reg> <lb/>
of the great pleasure which awaits them <lb/>
in their elder years."</p>
<p>Their success at the time of publication was <lb/>
decisive and immediate, and up to the present <lb/>
day new editions have been repeatedly called for. <lb/>
It remains to be seen whether the twentieth <lb/>
century will produce anything which in directness <lb/>
and fulfilment of purpose shall supersede these <lb/>
paraphrases of Shakespeare's immortal tragedies.</p>
<pb n="353" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0412"/>
<p>'Mrs Leicester's School' was the next literary <lb/>
work upon which Mary Lamb engaged herself; <lb/>
and though never so popular as the 'Tales,' it <lb/>
was considered by Coleridge to be "a rich jewel <lb/>
in the treasury of our permanent English <reg orig="liter-|ature">literature</reg>."</p>
<p>The "tenderness of feeling and delicacy of <lb/>
taste" of which he speaks were distinguishing <lb/>
traits in her character; and Landor is no less <lb/>
enthusiastic in praising the charming naturalness <lb/>
which marked the style of the woman whom he <lb/>
described as the "finest genius" of her sex.</p>
<p>Writing to Charles of the sudden frenzy which <lb/>
resulted in the fatal attack of Mary Lamb upon <lb/>
her mother, Coleridge ends his letter thus,&mdash;and <lb/>
perhaps nothing in literature is more touching <lb/>
than the words with which he strove to mitigate <lb/>
to his friend the bitterness of the awful tragedy <lb/>
enacted in the room at Little Queen Street:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is sweet to be aroused from a frightful <lb/>
dream by the songs of birds and the gladsome <lb/>
rays of the morning. Oh, how infinitely more <lb/>
sweet to be awakened from the blackness and <lb/>
amazement of a sudden horror by the glories of <lb/>
God manifest and the hallelujahs of angels."</p>
<p>Scarred past all reparation was that brother's <lb/>
sensitive heart, as is a fair landscape by some <lb/>
grim earthquake; but as in the chasm-clefts birds <lb/>
and beasts find refuge, and flowers wave lovingly <lb/>
<pb n="354" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0413"/>
in the waste places, so new beauties &mdash; dearly <lb/>
bought indeed &mdash; developed in his nature, which <lb/>
might have lain dormant had all gone well in <lb/>
the modest household. "A deep distress had <lb/>
humanised his soul."</p>
<p>Rough and thorny was the path which he <lb/>
followed. Beset with troubles from without and <lb/>
from within was his life - work, but he never <lb/>
flinched or faltered in his self-imposed duty until <lb/>
his brave whimsical soul went up to God.</p>
<p>Never parted save during the sad periods when <lb/>
the asylum sheltered her irresponsible body, their <lb/>
mutual love sanctified their humble surroundings <lb/>
through every phase of sunshine and shadow; <lb/>
and there is an unutterable sadness in his simple <lb/>
words, "'Tis a tedious cut out of a life of <reg orig="fifty-|four">fifty-four</reg> <lb/>
to lose twelve or thirteen weeks every year <lb/>
or two."</p>
<p>So much has been said upon the subject of <lb/>
hereditary insanity that it would be worse than <lb/>
useless to recapitulate the various theories that <lb/>
have been put forward; but there can be no <lb/>
reasonable doubt that the early associations and <lb/>
stoical indifference which surrounded the early <lb/>
childhood of Mary Lamb were all against her. <lb/>
It is frightful to think of a child being <reg orig="practi-|cally">practically</reg> <lb/>
taunted with such words as, "Polly, what <lb/>
are those poor crazy moythered brains of yours <lb/>
thinking of always?"&mdash;almost an incentive, one <lb/>
<pb n="355" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0414"/>
might imagine, to vague inconsequent thinkings <lb/>
and doings.</p>
<p>The wonder is that the intellectual force and <lb/>
vitality of that mysteriously poised brain were <lb/>
sufficient to reassert themselves for long intervals <lb/>
over the ghastly heritage of an enfeebled <reg orig="de-|velopment">development</reg>.</p>
<p>Everything was against her, and yet she was <lb/>
not only the charge but the guardian of her <lb/>
better known and well beloved brother. After <lb/>
his death, in 1834, she lingered in a dreamy <lb/>
twilight of mental and physical weakness for <lb/>
thirteen years, blessedly oblivious of the loss <lb/>
which she had sustained, and only woke to the <lb/>
full consciousness of living when she entered that <lb/>
heaven which, as "A Country Parson" so sweetly <lb/>
surmises, "may be a place for those who have <lb/>
failed on earth."</p>
<p>The whole story of the Lambs is matchless in <lb/>
pathos, and the alternate brilliancy and eclipsing <lb/>
of her mental faculties is one of those mysteries <lb/>
which we rejoice to think will be unriddled <lb/>
by-and-by.</p>
<p>No novelist, probably, has a keener insight into <lb/>
human nature than George Eliot, and her words <lb/>
about Mr Gilfil are no less true as regards many <lb/>
an old maid: "It is with men as with trees; if <lb/>
you lop off their finest branches into which they <lb/>
were pouring their young life juice, the wounds <lb/>
<pb n="356" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0415"/>
will be healed over with some rough boss, some <lb/>
odd excrescence, and what might have been a <lb/>
grand tree, expanding into liberal shade, is but <lb/>
a whimsical misshapen trunk. Many an irritating <lb/>
fault, many an unlovely oddity, has come of a <lb/>
hard sorrow which has crushed and maimed the <lb/>
nature just when it was expanding into plenteous <lb/>
beauty."</p>
<p>There is many a tear shed in secret over letters <lb/>
discoloured by age; many a nook consecrated by <lb/>
old memories and hopes destined to disappointment; <lb/>
many a lonely, loveless life because one is not, <lb/>
whose coming "made summer in the house," and <lb/>
whose defection or departure has made the days <lb/>
drag heavily for evermore. These things will <lb/>
always be as long as the sun and moon <reg orig="en-|dureth">endureth</reg>, <lb/>
as long as men and women live out their <lb/>
little earthly life, as long as human nature and <lb/>
human frailty coexist.</p>
<p>Constitutionally women are more susceptible to <lb/>
their surroundings than men, and, therefore, are <lb/>
the more worthy of honour when, in spite of the <lb/>
hampering restrictions of sex, they have proved <lb/>
themselves capable not only of lightening the pain <lb/>
and anguish of humanity, but of <hi rend="italic">en</hi>lightening the <lb/>
complex problems of this complex world.</p>
<p>The phrase <hi rend="italic">cherchez la femme</hi> has a wider <reg orig="sig-|nificance">significance</reg> <lb/>
than is generally given to it. There is <lb/>
much that only a woman could do&mdash;still more <lb/>
<pb n="357" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0416"/>
that only a single woman could do. They have <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">time</hi>, these worthy women, which is not at the <reg orig="com-|mand">command</reg> <lb/>
of those whose more encircled lives include <lb/>
the care of husband and children and home&mdash; <lb/>
time to contemplate, to organise, and to devote.</p>
<p>Their duties are less definite than those of a <lb/>
matron, their ties less binding; but the lives of <lb/>
many are sublime with self-surrender, and it will <lb/>
take Eternity to show the wonders they have <lb/>
wrought.</p>
<p>No one would adopt the absurdity of crediting <lb/>
all the good work of the world to any special <lb/>
class or condition; but looked at with <reg orig="dispassion-|ate">dispassionate</reg> <lb/>
eyes, it is almost a truism that some of the <lb/>
world's best work has been done by those who, <lb/>
with singleness of heart and aim, have been able <lb/>
to devote themselves to it.</p>
<p>Very rerely does a woman pose as an <reg orig="obstruc-|tionist&mdash;her">obstructionist&mdash;her</reg> <lb/>
failing is rather on the side of <reg orig="aggress-|ive">aggressive</reg> <lb/>
progression; and the "perpetual motion" <reg orig="inev-|itably">inevitably</reg> <lb/>
connected with her prevents anything like <lb/>
stagnation, and makes life a better, sweeter, and <lb/>
grander thing.</p>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"For the holiest deeds that are ever done</l>
<l rend="indent">Are in the form of surprises,</l>
<l>And the heart that is ready for angel tasks</l>

</lg></q>
<p>Now and for ever is the stigma removed from <lb/>
the "Old Maid." It is no longer an epithet of <lb/>
<pb n="358" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0417"/>
reproach; and the temple not made with hands, <lb/>
the dome of which is world-wide and eternal, has <lb/>
in it no more honoured niches than those which <lb/>
are filled and glorified by such women as those <lb/>
whose life and work we have endeavoured to <lb/>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">Hannah More</hi>, 1825.</head>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> is Lord Beaconsfield who has italicised, so to speak, the <lb/>
fondness of the world for personal details respecting those <lb/>
who have been celebrated, and perhaps nothing so conveys <lb/>
the idea of a personality as a good portrait.</p>
<p>This I may in every case claim to have secured, through <lb/>
the quite extraordinary kindness of people upon whom I <lb/>
have no claim, save that of lowly fellowship in admiration <lb/>
of the subjects depicted.</p>
<p>In view of the special interest attaching to many of <lb/>
the portraits, a few words about each of them cannot <lb/>
be out of place.</p>
<p>The miniature of Hannah More, so kindly lent for <reg orig="re-|production">reproduction</reg> <lb/>
by the Bristol Museum Committee, was <reg orig="pre-|sented">presented</reg> <lb/>
to that Institution, in 1902, by a mysterious donor <lb/>
&mdash;E. P. B.&mdash;who expressed his emphatic desire to remain <lb/>
anonymous. Such reticence is rare nowadays; and I regret <lb/>
in practice what I respect in theory, as I am thereby <lb/>
prevented from tracing the history of this exquisite bit of <lb/>
ivory painting.</p>
<pb n="362" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0421"/>
<p>The date of it, however, is fairly well established as <lb/>
being between 1820 and 1825; for, in her 'Memoirs,'<ref target="n10" n="1"><hi rend="super">1</hi></ref>
<note id="n10" place="foot" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol"><hi rend="super">1</hi></seg><p>'Memoirs of the Life of Mrs Hannah More,' by William Roberts, 1836.</p></note>
 <lb/>
we read of the "yellow, richly embroidered shawl which <lb/>
enveloped her shoulders, and the pretty net cap tied <lb/>
under her chin with white satin ribbon." It is in this <lb/>
costume that she is painted in the miniature; and the <lb/>
fact that she never wore a jewel or trinket or any <lb/>
adjunct to her dress of the merely ornamental kind, <lb/>
which is also therein alluded to, finds corroboration in <lb/>
the picture, though the daintiness of the whole is <reg orig="in-|disputable">indisputable</reg>. <lb/>
We are further told that "her figure is <lb/>
singularly <hi rend="italic">petite;</hi> but to have any idea of the expression <lb/>
of her countenance, you must imagine the small withered <lb/>
face of a woman in her seventy-seventh year, and imagine <lb/>
also &lpar;shaded but not obscured by long and perfectly white <lb/>
eyelashes&rpar; eyes dark, brilliant, flashing and penetrating, <lb/>
sparkling from object to object, with all the fire and <lb/>
energy of youth, and smiling welcome on all around."</p>
<p>The eyes which her sisters called "diamond," and which <lb/>
the painters complained that they could not put upon <lb/>
canvas, are described by Mr S. C. Hall in his 'Memories' <lb/>
as being, when she was eighty, the "clearest, brightest, and <lb/>
most searching that I have ever seen: they were singularly <lb/>
dark,&mdash;positively black they seemed as they looked forth <lb/>
among carefully trained tresses of her own white hair,&mdash;and <lb/>
absolutely sparkled while she spoke of those of whom she <lb/>
was the venerated link between the present and the long <lb/>
past." To all these characteristics the portrait itself is <lb/>
a silent testimony.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">Mary Carpenter</hi>, 1877.</head>
<p>Out of his busy and useful life at Oxford, Professor <lb/>
J. Eslin Carpenter was good enough to find time to <lb/>
send me a photograph of his aunt, which bears upon <lb/>
it the stamp of verisimilitude. Although "taken in the <lb/>
last year of her life &lpar;1877&rpar;, after the return from her <lb/>
last Indian journey," the "great grey eyes so slow and <lb/>
wise" have not lost their brightness with the passage of <lb/>
time. Seventy years had come and gone, but the shrewd <lb/>
humorous expression had not faded out of them, and <lb/>
the strong, helpful look is still there. Professor Carpenter <lb/>
says that "she rarely sat, and the results were not <lb/>
generally good, as her face acquired a set expression <lb/>
in repose which never seemed natural to those who <lb/>
knew her"; but even any one who has hitherto read <lb/>
only the foregoing brief sketch of her noble life will, I <lb/>
think, agree with me that it is just the sort of face <lb/>
that one would have expected.</p>
</div4>
<div4 type="subsection" id="d50">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">Caroline Lucretia Herschel</hi>, 1829.</head>
<p>It is to the kindness of Sir William Herschel of Oxford <lb/>
and Miss Herschel of Slough that I am indebted for the <lb/>
excellent photograph of their great-aunt which adorns <lb/>
these pages, and it cannot but be interesting to know <lb/>
something as to the circumstances under which the <lb/>
original was painted.</p>
<p>It was in January 1829 that her beloved nephew, <lb/>
John F. W. Herschel, wrote to her thus from London: <lb/>
"If you want to give me what I shall really prize <lb/>
highly, let it be your portrait, in oils, of the size of <lb/>
<pb n="364" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0423"/>
my father's. Let me send back the money, and employ <lb/>
part of it in engaging a good Hanoverian artist to <lb/>
paint it. You often tell me your time hangs heavy, so <lb/>
here I am furnishing you with a refuge from <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi>; <lb/>
and when you know how much pleasure it will give <lb/>
me to see your likeness hanging by my father's, and <lb/>
that you can without inconvenience or difficulty &lpar;and <lb/>
now without expense&rpar; do it, I entreat you not to refuse. <lb/>
I know what you will urge against it; but you <reg orig="under-|value">undervalue</reg> <lb/>
yourself and your own merits so much that I <lb/>
will not allow it any weight."</p>
<p>It is clear that the "unconquerable industry," capability, <lb/>
and grand humility of his illustrious father's sister were <lb/>
heartily appreciated by the brilliant scholar and astronomer <lb/>
Sir John F. W. Herschel&mdash;as well as by her "dearest <lb/>
and best of brothers"&mdash;and I can well believe that it <lb/>
was with a pathetic mingling of pleasure and pain that, <lb/>
two months later, she consented to sit for her portrait to <lb/>
the well-known painter, Professor M. G. Tielemann. At <lb/>
this time she was seventy - nine years of age, and the <lb/>
sittings were necessarily somewhat wearying; but the <reg orig="un-|selfish">unselfish</reg> <lb/>
fellowship of joy which she felt in the <reg orig="announce-|ment">announcement</reg> <lb/>
of her nephew's engagement to Miss Stewart, is <lb/>
shown in the following extracts from her own letters at <lb/>
this time: "I feel much fatigued by sitting eight times <lb/>
within the last ten days to Professor Tielemann for my <lb/>
portrait, and now he has taken it home to finish. You <lb/>
will receive it with the Easter messenger. &hellip; Whatever <lb/>
you may think about my looking so young. I cannot <lb/>
help; for two of the days when I was sitting to him <lb/>
I received agreeable news from England: one day Lady <lb/>
Herschel's"&mdash;her sister-in-law's&mdash;"likeness was thrown in <lb/>
my lap &lpar;Mr Tielemann taking it out of the box&rpar;, and, <lb/>
<pb n="365" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0424"/>
four days after, the account of your approaching happiness <lb/>
arrived. No wonder I became a dozen years younger <lb/>
all at once. I was sitting about seven hours in as many <lb/>
days in my own apartments; but there is but one <lb/>
voice&mdash;that the picture looks life itself."</p>
<p>Self-sacrificing always, and gifted far beyond all ordinary <lb/>
standards of attainment, her great-niece only expresses <lb/>
the unanimous verdict of a world, when she speaks of <lb/>
her, in her letter to me, as "one whose <hi rend="italic">conscientious <lb/>
devotion to work</hi> is truly most <hi rend="italic">worthy of honour</hi>."</p>
</div4>
<div4 type="subsection" id="d51">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">Sister Dora</hi>, 1870.</head>
<p>"Our Pandora" one of the committee of the Walsall <lb/>
Hospital used to call sweet Dorothy Pattison&mdash;whose <lb/>
family name is often forgotten and unknown by many <lb/>
to whom her achievements have served as an example <lb/>
and an inspiration.</p>
<p>I have spoken elsewhere of the <hi rend="italic">inward</hi>&mdash;introspective&mdash; <lb/>
look of Christina Rossetti and the <hi rend="italic">outward</hi> look of Mary <lb/>
Kingsley; on the face of Sister Dora it is the <hi rend="italic">upward</hi> <lb/>
look that predominates. "Her great hopefulness was," we <lb/>
are told, "the first element in her character&mdash;the firm, <lb/>
clear ring of her voice made doubt or despondency <reg orig="im-|possible">impossible</reg>." <lb/>
Though we know her to have been self-reliant, <lb/>
prompt, and resolute, there is a wealth of sympathy in <lb/>
the dark-brown eyes and a subtle radiancy of expression, <lb/>
which, to my mind, is always part, and the larger part, <lb/>
of the "beauty of holiness."</p>
<p>We are told that her features were nearly perfect in <lb/>
their regularity; the forehead singularly wide and high; <lb/>
but the mobile mouth, the perfect teeth, the sunny <lb/>
smile, the tightly curling brown hair waving all over her <lb/>
<pb n="366" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0425"/>
head, which no amount of cutting off or covering with <lb/>
caps could ever smooth,&mdash;these are details which only <lb/>
a "word-portrait" can supply.</p>
<p>I had a dream. There was a narrow pathway <reg orig="lead-|ing">leading</reg>, <lb/>
as it seemed, to some mysterious country on the <lb/>
other side of a bracken-covered hill. At the entrance <lb/>
to this pathway stood Sister Dora; and as, one by one, <lb/>
a crowd of tired travellers came up to the gate, I heard <lb/>
her say gently, "What have you been doing?" "<reg orig="Starv-|ing">Starving</reg>, <lb/>
Sister."&mdash;"And you?" "Drinking."&mdash;"And you?" <lb/>
"Suffering." The click of our garden-gate or the rush <lb/>
and tumble of the incoming tide awoke me; but, <reg orig="sleep-|ing">sleeping</reg> <lb/>
or waking, I know that it was for such as these&mdash; <lb/>
the sick, the sinful, and the sad&mdash;that Sister Dora <lb/>
lived and laboured and died.</p>
<p>With fine intuitive skill she could detect the one spot <lb/>
of God-likeness even in the vilest of those whom He <lb/>
originally made in His image; and her great longing, <lb/>
always, was not only to heal their bodies, but to make <lb/>
manifest that <lb/>
<q><lg type="group">
<l>"There lives and works</l>
<l>A soul in all things, and that soul is God."</l>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">Mary Kingsley</hi>, 1896.</head>
<p>The photograph of Mary Kingsley, kindly sent to <lb/>
me by Mr Charles Kingsley, is, he considers, "the best <lb/>
portrait of my sister" to be had. In its attitude and <lb/>
expression every characteristic that we realise so keenly <lb/>
in her writings is clearly distinguishable. The alertness <lb/>
of the figure, the grasp of the capable hands, the <reg orig="outward-|looking">outward-looking</reg> <lb/>
eyes, with their kindly and humorous candour, the <lb/>
<pb n="367" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0426"/>
whole attitude of the picture, brings before us the slight <lb/>
fair woman&mdash;not very robust-looking, but showing in <lb/>
every movement energy and determination&mdash;who amazed <lb/>
the world with her witty descriptions of West African <lb/>
Life in 1896. But under all the sprightliness of her <lb/>
"Mark Tapley temperament" there was the strong, serious <lb/>
purpose which one sees in the honest eyes, and a tireless <lb/>
buoyancy of mind that enjoyed the surmounting of <lb/>
difficulties.</p>
<p>To her big courageous nature "perils by day and by <lb/>
night" were not things to be instinctively avoided, but <lb/>
mere incidents in desirable journeyings&mdash;for <reg orig="safeguard-|ing">safeguarding</reg> <lb/>
in which she would put herself trustfully into the <lb/>
care of "the Lord of the Daybreak." In this aspect <lb/>
the Arabic inscription on the black marble border of <lb/>
the brass memorial erected to her "beloved memory" in <lb/>
Eversley Parish Church has a deep significance. There <lb/>
is something definitely thorough and sunshiny about the <lb/>
personality of Mary Kingsley. She never could have <lb/>
done anything half-heartedly, and no more suitable words <lb/>
could have been chosen for her epitaph than those <lb/>
which are inscribed upon the tablet&mdash; <lb/>

one is struck at once with the fragility of her <reg orig="appear-|ance">appearance</reg>; <lb/>
and, as we are told that her health failed in 1862, <lb/>
it is not unlikely, from the dress,&mdash;which points to that <lb/>
period,&mdash;that this was the last time that she sat for a <lb/>
photograph. Her great friend Madame Belloc, whose <lb/>
<pb n="368" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0427"/>
kindness I specially wish to recognise, tells me, in one <lb/>
of her delightful letters, that "Adelaide was not <reg orig="hand-|some">handsome</reg>, <lb/>
in a pictorial sense, at any time: her face had <lb/>
often the severity of a miniature Dante, and at other <lb/>
times the aspect of the traditional Shelley."</p>
<p>The photograph, of course, only hints at the severity <lb/>
or the sweetness; but we hold the clue to the character <lb/>
of the original in the knowledge that she was the daughter <lb/>
of the gentle, "curiously dreamy" poet, Barry Cornwall, <lb/>
and of Anne, his wife, who, like her wonderful mother, <lb/>
Mrs Montagu, preserved her dignity at all costs, and <lb/>
whose composure never failed, even in times of <reg orig="heart-|breaking">heartbreaking</reg> <lb/>
sorrow.</p>
<p>There is something very charming about the fragile <lb/>
figure; and in the face I see&mdash;or is it fancy?&mdash;that <lb/>
wistful, far-seeing look that one so often notices on the <lb/>
faces of those to whom it is appointed that they should <lb/>
die before their prime. The hollow cheeks tell their <lb/>
own story; but about the mouth there are indications <lb/>
of the ironical humour with which her conversation <lb/>
abounded, though it in no way affected her kind and <lb/>
good warm-heartedness and the spirituality of her inner <lb/>
nature. It must have been the gentle and lambent <reg orig="ex-|pression">expression</reg> <lb/>
of the blue eyes and the soft wavy hair that <lb/>
reminded Madame Belloc of Shelley; to whom also full <lb/>
maturity was denied.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">Marianne North</hi>, 1876.</head>
<p>In 'Recollections of a Happy Life' we have a vivid <lb/>
description&mdash;in Marianne North's own racy words&mdash;of her <lb/>
visit to Ceylon in 1876, and of the circumstances under <lb/>
<pb n="369" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0428"/>
which this photograph was taken. Mrs Julia Cameron's <lb/>
artistic skill is well known, but she seems to have shown <lb/>
unusual enthusiasm in posing her new subject&mdash;an <reg orig="en-|thusiasm">enthusiasm</reg> <lb/>
which possibly defeated itself. "She made up <lb/>
her mind to photograph me," says Miss North, "and for <lb/>
three days kept herself in a fever of excitement about <lb/>
it. She dressed me up in flowing draperies of cashmere <lb/>
wool, let down my hair and made me stand with spiky <lb/>
cocoa-nut branches running into my head, the noon-day <lb/>
sun's rays dodging my eyes between the leaves as the <lb/>
slight breeze moved them, and told me to look perfectly <lb/>
natural &lpar;with the thermometer standing at 96&deg;!&rpar;.</p>
<p>"Then she tried me with a background of bread-fruit <lb/>
leaves and fruit, nailed flat against a window-shutter, and <lb/>
told <hi rend="italic">them</hi> to look natural; but both failed. It was all <lb/>
in vain; she could only get a perfectly uninteresting and <lb/>
commonplace person on her glasses, which refused to <lb/>
flatter."</p>
<p>You can easily imagine that morning&mdash;"high noon, and <lb/>
not a cloud in the sky to break the blinding sun"; the <lb/>
eager artist; the lazy breathing of the big trees, among <lb/>
which the rabbits and squirrels bustle about with busy <lb/>
pattering feet, and in which the monkeys gibber and <lb/>
bright-hued birds "deliver their small souls" of news in <lb/>
bird-land. I venture to deny that the photograph is <lb/>
either uninteresting or commonplace. Fortitude and <reg orig="de-|termination">determination</reg> <lb/>
are embodied in the strong simple lines of <lb/>
the face, and there is a look of latent power about <lb/>
the whole aspect of the figure which denotes a rare <lb/>
personality.</p>
<p>It is not surprising to read that Mrs Symonds "often <lb/>
wondered whether, if her sister's strength had lasted <lb/>
<pb n="370" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0429"/>
another ten years after she settled in Alderley, she <lb/>
could really have been content to wait on old age in the <lb/>
lovely green nest that she had prepared for herself."</p>
<p>This picture of her suggests the same thought.</p>
</div4>
<div4 type="subsection" id="d55">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">Jean Ingelow</hi>, 1891.</head>
<p>After some little difficulty &mdash; strange, considering the <lb/>
recent date of Jean Ingelow's death &mdash; I succeeded in <lb/>
getting a good portrait of her. Mrs Annie Ritchie <lb/>
&lpar;the gifted author of 'Old Kensington' and of many <lb/>
other fascinating books&rpar; tells me that "Jean Ingelow <lb/>
had a look of great intelligence, but it was not a face <lb/>
to photograph." Specially, therefore, should I like to <lb/>
have been present at the little dinner in 1863, of <lb/>
which she writes, when her father, W. M. Thackeray <lb/>
&lpar;just before his death&rpar;, the demure maiden lady with <lb/>
the big musical brain but somewhat limited outlook, and <lb/>
herself were of the party,&mdash;a remarkably contrasting <lb/>
literary trio this, even at a London dinner-table.</p>
<p>Here we have a face that is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> what we should have <lb/>
expected. Kindliness and intelligence are writ large upon <lb/>
it, and there is a thoughtful, contented aspect about the <lb/>
whole picture which does not belie what we know of its <lb/>
original; but there is none of the dreaminess which <lb/>
marks her poetry&mdash;no hint, even, of poetic fire&mdash;in the <lb/>
sedate, prosperous-looking figure.</p>
<p>Self-evidently hers is not a head to photograph, though, <lb/>
to paraphrase the words of Carlyle's 'bus-driver critic, one <lb/>
would gladly possess its contents.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">Louisa Alcott</hi>, 1868.</head>
<p>Mr Sanborn's kind letter tells me that Louisa Alcott's <lb/>
photograph was taken in, or about, 1868&mdash;a date that is <lb/>
specially interesting as being that of the publication of <lb/>
'Little Women.' As a rule, women are supposed to be <lb/>
devoid of humour, but surely it is the dominating <reg orig="charac-|teristic">characteristic</reg> <lb/>
of Miss Alcott's face&mdash;the humour that makes <lb/>
"life's little ironies" bearable and lets glints of sunshine <lb/>
into its cobwebby corners.</p>
<p>A woman who can always see the bright side of things, <lb/>
and who will turn every cloud inside out in order to get <lb/>
quickly at its silver lining, has a faculty as rare as it is <lb/>
enviable. This gift Louisa Alcott possessed in an <reg orig="un-|common">uncommon</reg> <lb/>
degree: you can see it in every line of her <lb/>
expressive, humorous face. Her biographer, Mrs Ednah <lb/>
Cheney, says that "her appearance was striking rather <lb/>
than beautiful&mdash;figure tall and well-proportioned, head <lb/>
large, and adorned with rich brown hair, long and <lb/>
luxuriant." Thoroughly unconventional she was bound <lb/>
to be with a personality such as hers; but it was an <lb/>
unconventionality that rejoiced in itself unconsciously,&mdash; <lb/>
not the defiant violation of all ordinary rules of conduct <lb/>
and courtesy which so often poses as, and passes for, <lb/>
originality nowadays. Her simplest pleasures were lifted <lb/>
into keen delights by sheer healthy mindedness and <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">capacity</hi> for enjoyment, while her sorrows were purified <lb/>
and helped by an unselfish fellowship with, and care <lb/>
for, others, which was its own reward.</p>
<p>"Wayward and stormy" were her moods we may be <lb/>
sure &lpar;even into middle life, when the photograph was <lb/>
taken&rpar;, but tempered always by that quick regret and <lb/>
<pb n="372" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0431"/>
ready reparation which made her so lovable and so <lb/>
loved. From 1868 she seems to have been the chief <lb/>
bread-winner of the household&mdash;"the hub of the family <lb/>
wheel," as she says of herself. "Love thyself last" was <lb/>
her motto on all occasions; and, right on to the end, <lb/>
the story of her earnest chivalrous life corroborates the <lb/>
silent testimony of her strong, almost masterful, face.</p>

<head><hi rend="small-caps">Christina Rossetti</hi>, 1861.</head>
<p>When I wrote to Mr W. M. Rossetti asking for the loan <lb/>
of an unpublished likeness of his sister Christina, I honestly <lb/>
confess that in troubling a man&mdash;and an old man&mdash;of such <lb/>
eminence I felt some degree of trepidation, and was <reg orig="pro-|portionately">proportionately</reg> <lb/>
gratified at the kind interest with which he <lb/>
entered into my scheme of work. From a list of nine <lb/>
which he suggested, the picture which is here reproduced <lb/>
was recommended by him as the one &lpar;of the unpublished <lb/>
ones&rpar; best representing his beloved sister with some of <lb/>
"the attraction of youth." The old-world setting detracts <lb/>
somewhat from the effect; and her "soul's beauty" that <lb/>
Mr Mackenzie Bell speaks of, that is so clearly seen in <lb/>
some of the sketches of her brother Dante Gabriel and <lb/>
in the beautiful photograph by Lewis Caroll &lpar;Rev. C. L. <lb/>
Dodgson&rpar;, is altogether lacking. But the introspective <lb/>
look of the expressive eyes is there, beneath the "<reg orig="com-|manding">commanding</reg> <lb/>
breadth of brow," and in her mien something <lb/>
of that "serene passivity" which Mr Sharp notices in <lb/>
his able article describing his first meeting with her.</p>
<p>Her voice was extremely musical, and, in conjunction <lb/>
with a smile that was "always delightful and sometimes <lb/>
irresistibly sweet," it is not difficult to understand the <lb/>
<pb n="373" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0432"/>
charm which she possessed both for her family and for <lb/>
those who were fortunate enough to possess her <reg orig="friend-|ship">friendship</reg>. <lb/>
The following extract from an article by Miss <lb/>
Grace Gilchrist is interesting, because it describes Christina <lb/>
Rossetti's appearance only a little later than in the year <lb/>
when the photograph in this volume was originally taken. <lb/>
She says: "It was in the June of 1863 that Miss <lb/>
Christina Rossetti came upon her first memorable visit <lb/>
to my home among the Surrey hills. She was then a <lb/>
dark-eyed slender lady in the plenitude of her poetic <lb/>
powers, having already written some of her most perfect <lb/>
poems&mdash;'The Goblin Market' and 'Dreamland.' I have <lb/>
a vivid impression of playing a game of ball with her <lb/>
under the branches of an old apple-tree in the garden, <lb/>
and to my childish eyes she appeared like some fairy <lb/>
princess who had come from the sunny South to play with <lb/>
me. In appearance she was Italian, with olive complexion <lb/>
and deep hazel eyes, and she possessed, too, the beautiful <lb/>
Italian voice that all the Rossettis were gifted with."</p>

<div4 type="subsection" id="d58">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">Agnes Strickland</hi>.</head>
<p>It is to the kindness of Mr W. G. Strickland of Dublin <lb/>
that I am indebted for a copy of the engraving in his <lb/>
possession, of which he says: "I remember meeting Agnes <lb/>
Strickland two or three times, when I was a boy, at my <lb/>
aunt's house in London, and my recollection is that this <lb/>
portrait is very like her." Mr Blackwood, sen. &lpar;who <lb/>
knew her well&rpar;, confirms this statement; so I am glad <lb/>
to think that the best available likeness of this <reg orig="remark-|able">remarkable</reg> <lb/>
woman has been secured. In her early years <lb/>
Thomas Campbell described her as "a lovely, interesting <lb/>
<pb n="374" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0433"/>
creature, full of genius and sensibility"; and when we <lb/>
read her sister's account of her charms, the poet's <reg orig="en-|thusiasm">enthusiasm</reg> <lb/>
is not to be wondered at. Jane Strickland <lb/>
describes her as "tall and upright, with fine bust and <lb/>
arms, magnificent hair &lpar;black as ebony&rpar;, both silky and <lb/>
abundant, somewhat pale complexion, unless brightened <lb/>
by exercise or excitement, and a graceful, attractive <lb/>
figure." Sisters are, as a rule, very candid critics with <lb/>
regard to the physical characteristics of one another, <reg orig="how-|ever">however</reg> <lb/>
magnanimous they may be with regard to their <lb/>
intellectual endowments; and the original justified the <lb/>
description, we may be sure, for the portrait is that of <lb/>
a singularly handsome woman. There is a successful <lb/>
self-satisfied air about it, which is not at all surprising <lb/>
when we remember that for many years she was "<reg orig="over-|whelmed">overwhelmed</reg> <lb/>
with adulation and praise in whatever circles <lb/>
she appeared."</p>
<p>This impression, however, is evidently only superficial; <lb/>
for when to her outward attractions are added the <reg orig="im-|portant">important</reg> <lb/>
traits of cheerful endurance, kindliness, reverence, <lb/>
womanliness, and brilliant conversational powers, it is not <lb/>
astonishing to read that "she made many friends and <lb/>
lost none."</p>
</div4>
<div4 type="subsection" id="d59">
<head><hi rend="small-caps">Mary Lamb</hi>.</head>
<p>The last illustration of our series is the reputed portrait <lb/>
of Mary Lamb. It has quite a unique interest, as having <lb/>
been painted by William Hazlitt before the days when <lb/>
that "literary eccentric" had merged in literature the <lb/>
undoubted gift for art that he possessed. It is probable <lb/>
that before painting the somewhat ambitious picture of <lb/>
Charles Lamb as a Roman senator &lpar;which, his grandson <lb/>
<pb n="375" entity="Armytage_MaidsOfHonor_0434"/>
tells us, was the last time that he took a brush in <lb/>
hand&rpar;, Hazlitt persuaded the "only thoroughly <reg orig="reason-|able">reasonable</reg> <lb/>
woman" to sit to him. The time, therefore, would <lb/>
be either in, or before, the year 1805, when she was <lb/>
about forty years of age.</p>
<p>The original oil-painting is in the possession of Mr <lb/>
C. Elkin Mathews,&mdash;an expert in such matters,&mdash;and <lb/>
was purchased by him from a Tottenham dealer, to whom <lb/>
it had come from another dealer who had acquired it from <lb/>
some family friends of the Lambs, on their leaving <lb/>
Edmundton. It was known by them as the portrait <lb/>
of Mrs Mary Lamb, so that its "pedigree" may fairly <lb/>
be considered to be established.</p>
<p>The kindness of Mr Elkin Mathews deserves more <lb/>
than ordinary recognition&mdash;he having specially carried <lb/>
up the painting, from his country house at Chorley <lb/>
Wood, to London for reproduction in this volume.</p>

reached us from Mr Walter G. Strickland&mdash;of <lb/>

Strickland could not be rightly described as belonging <lb/>

"could not fasten her family on to that of Sizergh."</p>
<p>He informs us that, from his careful investigations, <lb/>
her progenitors came from the Furness district of North <lb/>
Lancashire, where they were settled as yeomen, and where <lb/>
they can be traced up to the time of Henry VIII., when <lb/>
they were tenants of the great Abbey of Furness, and <lb/>
shared in its spoils after its dissolution. No connection <lb/>
