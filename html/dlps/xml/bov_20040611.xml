                <p>The President listed a number of honors won by University faculty and
                    organizations: <name>Ms. Ann Beattie</name>, Edgar Allan Poe Professor of
                    Creative Writing, has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
                        <name>Vice President Lampkin</name> has received the award, “Outstanding
                    Mentor to Graduate Students,” presented by the American College Personnel
                    Association. <name>Dr. John Jane</name>, Chair of the Department of Neurological
                    Surgery, has been awarded the 2004 Harvey Cushing Medal of the American
                    Association of Neurological Surgeons. <name>Major Fritz Pfeiffer</name> of the

                <p>The President reported on his trip earlier in the week to Reykjavik for a meeting
                    of the Leifur Eiriksson Foundation. The Foundation is to provide scholarships
                    for University of Virginia students to study in Iceland and for Icelandic
                    students to study at the University. Next week, he said, he will lead a group of
                    alumni on a walking tour in Dorset. </p>

                <p>Private giving to the University and its related foundations is $150.3million for
                    the current fiscal year, through April 30th; this is a decrease of $68.9million
                    from the same period last year. He went on to say, however, that last year’s
                    figures reflect the extraordinary gift of more than $111million from the estate
                    of the late <name>David Harrison</name> of Prince George County. If the Harrison
                    bequest is subtracted from last year’s total, the base rate of fundraising has
                    increased some 39% over the same period last year. </p>
                <p>Some gifts received since the President’s report at the April Board meeting
                    include a residual bequest of $4,725,000 from the Harrison Estate to the
                    Athletics Department, the Law School Foundation and the Medical School. The
                    Middendorf Foundation has given $1million to the Jefferson Scholars Foundation
                    in memory of <name>Mr. E. Phillips Hathaway</name>, ’42. <name>Mr. John L. Nau,
                        III and Mrs. Barbara E. Nau</name> of Houston have made a $1million pledge
                    payment to the College Foundation. <name>Mr. Edward J. Kelly, III</name>, has
                    pledged $3million to the Law School Foundation for the endowed professorship
                    which bears his name. <name>Mr. Carl H. Lindner, III, and Mrs. Martha S.
                        Lindner</name> of Cincinatti have pledged $2.8million to the College for the
