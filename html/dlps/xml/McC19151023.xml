            <p>
            I have just received a letter from
            Paul in which he writes as follows, after
            mentioning you:  “She looks like the
            shadow of death, seems on the verge of
            a breakdown.  She has worked too hard”
            </p><p>
            My dear little girl is it true that 
            you’re feeling so badly?  You see,
            you’ve overdone it.  You’re too loyal
            and selfsacrificing [sic] and you’ve hurt yourself.
            Its all wrong to try and keep up when
            its a strain to do so, on your
            own account and for the sake of the
            wounded who need your care.  If you
            broke down what then?  It may take
            you months to recover and all
            that time will be wasted.  If you
            took things easier you could go
            right on.  Isn’t that so?  I’m terribly
            distressed to hear you aren’t your
            usual vigorous self.  If you feel well
            enough and have the time won’t you
            please write me and let me know
            how you are?  Just a postal, if
            nothing else.  Its been a month since
            you’ve written and I’ve been worrying
            about you.  
            </p><p>
            Johnson, a friend of mine at Pau writes
                        
            <pb entity="DSSR_000001107_0196" n="[p.2]"/>
            
            that he is discouraged.  Two hundred
            and fifty men are ahead of him
            and it looks as if he would
            be tied up for months.  In the
            meanwhile my friend Thierry-Delaware
            is working for me and I may be 
            able to pull the trick and go
            to Avord.  Lord I hope so.  The
            Pau business sounds very dismal.
            </p><p>
            Went under the Boches today in a 
            sap.  Awfully hot down there.  They
            took a crack at me in a shallow
            <unclear>boyou [sp?]</unclear> going up.  The winter
            shelters are quite amazing.
            </p><p>
            Lovel send his best.
            Must close now as the orderly
            is getting ready to make the table
            and I’ve got to remove my pad.
            </p>
        		
        		<closer>
            <salute>More anon.
            
            My best, Marcelle, and please 
            don’t overdo things.</salute>
