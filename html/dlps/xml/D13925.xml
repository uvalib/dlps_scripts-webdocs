                        <p>I have concluded to commence the New Year, by introducing a new feature
                            in my line of operations. As time and oppor- tunity will permit, I will
                            try to beguile away a spare moment by recording such things as may prove
                            a source of satisfaction and interest not only to myself, but to friends
                            in the future. A word explanatory may not be amiss. Be it known, then,
                            that the writer has been, and now is, at the opening of these pages, a
                            soldier in the United States Volunteer Army, 23<hi rend="super">d.</hi>
                            Ohio Reg't. Our Reg't was organized about the 1<hi rend="super">st.</hi>
                            of last June, but I did not become a member until July 24<hi
                                rend="super">th</hi>, when I joined Capt. Drake's Company (H.). The
                            Reg't left the place of rendezvous <add hand="author" place="top">Camp
                                Chase, O.</add> July 25<hi rend="super">th.</hi>, and next day
                            entered Western Va. at Benwood, 4 miles below Wheeling, and have ever
                            since been in the State, being now South of the Central part, and not
                            far from the Kentucky line; the result of numerous and hard marches. We
                            came here Nov'v 14<hi rend="super">th.</hi>
                            <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0013" n="2"/> The town was almost entirely
                            deserted at the time of our arrival, consequently, we got good quarters,
                            which we still retain, our Company occupying the lower floor of the
                            Court-House, a good, substantial brick building. Since coming here we
                            have done no marching.</p>
                        <p>This is a tolerably handsome little village, and, I suppose, in times
                            gone by, the people enjoyed the comforts of good homes, and the pleasant
                            society of friends, but, alas, how changed. War produces ravages, such
                            as I need not particularize because too generally known.</p>
                        <p>The disruption of society, however is one of the worst results, when
                            neighbor is arrayed against neighbor, and brother against brother. ~~~
                            Nothing exists here of society except the name, however social or
                            peaceful a community it may once have been.</p>
                        <p>The country in the vicinity is tolerably rough, but much less than most
                            parts of Western Va., that I have yet seen, viz: the most of the Country
                            between this and Clarksburg in Harrison County. As far as fertility is
                            concerned, I do not consider it the best, probably medium. The water is
                            poor, providing considerable Diarrhoea, that curse of the Camp. My
                            health has been excellent all summer <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0014"
                                n="3"/> but, at last, I am attacked with Diarrhoea, and am, at this
                            writing, quite ill, and feel very weak, and much reduced. Should I
                            succeed in getting a furlough, I won't be long in making tracks for
                            home.</p>

                        <p>Started home this morning. Came from Fayetteville to Loop Creek in a
                            wagon, distance, 17 miles; over a bad road, and, during the afternoon, a
                            drizzling rain set in. Got on the "Silver Lake" about 4 P.M. she came on
                            down the river a few miles, and has "tied up" for the night. She is a
                            small Government steamer, plying on the Headwaters of the Kanawha.~~
                            Health no better. Lost my cap in the Kanawha River.</p>

                            scenery. Feel somewhat better than yesterday. Passed Gallipolis just

                            weather was disagreeably cold. They stopped at New Richmond, O., being
                            on a furlough of 15 days. Just before arriving at Cincinnati, a sleety
                            snow set in, which was in no wise agreeable, and which afterwards turned
                            to a regular snow storm. I <add hand="author" place="top">have</add> had

                        <p>Arrived at the "Capital City," this morning at 3 &frac12; O'clock, having left
                            Cincinnati last night at 10 O'clock. The snow is some 3 or 4 inches
                            deep, and many are availing themselves of the opportunity offered to
                            take a sleigh ride, and all day the streets have been full of sleighs of
                            various styles, and going at various gaits. The State Legislature met at
                            10 A.M., and quite a bustle was going on among the "big boys" about the
                            Capital. I did not go in either Hall, not feeling enough interested.</p>

                        <p>Nothing of particular note has transpired for the past few days, at
                            least, nothing that I have thought worthy of record. ~~ This morning I
                            was apprised of two deaths in our company, Wm T. Chambers, and Francis
                            M. Scott. Their bodies were brought home for interment by I.N.R.
                            Crawford. I attended the burial of young Chambers to-day at Morehead's
                            meeting-house. Scott is to be buried tomorrow at Hopewell. These two
                            were young men of good moral character, and had made a profession of
                            religion, and I have no reason to disbelieve their devoutness or
                            sincerity. But three months ago they entered the service, arriving in
                            Camp on the 21<hi rend="super">st</hi> of October. Out of six who then
                            entlisted, but 3 are living. Jacob O. Sponogle who died Dec'r. 21<hi
                                rend="super">st</hi>, 1861 making three who have died. This
                            mortality I am unable to account for, unless it might be the season of
                            the year when they entered the service, and the sudden change of
                            climate, diet, manner of living, &amp;c. They all died of typhoid
                            fever. Scott died Jan. 7<hi rend="super">th.</hi>, and Chambers Jan
                                11<hi rend="super">th.</hi>. All at Fayetteville, Va., in the

                        <p>Attended an oyster-supper at "Griffin's Hotel" in Holmesville last night,
                            which was given for the benefit of the "Soldier's Aid Society," a branch
                            of which exists here. I could not fail to observe that there is not that
                            interested manifested towards us by <add hand="author" place="top">some
                                of</add> the young men at home who have been either unable or
                            unwilling to serve in the ranks, that I have been led to suppose would
                            animate every one to the performance of acts of kindness and
                            encouragement to the soldiers who are absent from home and friends
                            battling for their country's defense. I repeat what I have often said,
                            that a man can serve his country at home as well as away from home, if
                            he has the will &amp; disposition. A man can be a patriot at home as
                            well as elsewhere, but I would rather see him give some evidence of his
                            patriotism, other than mere words. These are very good, provided they
                            are accompanied by something more substantial, and given with a desire
                            to do good. "But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what
                            thy right hand doeth." ~ We have too many patriots whose patriotism
                            consists of nothing more than "words of <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0019"
                                n="8"/> learned length and thundering sound, "and who think they
                            shall be heard for their much speaking." There are many honorable
                            exceptions, however, and we are happy to record it, and through the
                            instrumentality of such, much good has been effected. The ladies, God
                            bless them, although generally denominated the "weaker vessel," can, if
                            they put their heads together, perform tasks of benevolence, and exert
                            an influence most potent and salutary, sufficient to stimulate the
                            "sterner sex" to the performance of acts which otherwise would never be
                            undertaken. To the loyal ladies of the United States the soldier, aye,
                            the whole country owe a lasting debt of gratitude, and History will <add

                            self=sacrifing labors in behalf of the sick &amp; wounded soldiers
                            of our Army. We doubt not, that the foun- dation and perpetuation of the
                            "Ladies Soldiers Aid Society," will occupy one of the brightest pages in
                            the annals of our country.</p>

                        <p> Left home this evening, and shall take the cars in the morning at this
                            place for Western Virginia, via. Orrville, Alliance, &amp;
                            Wellsville. Attended the Disciple church during the evening. It is
                            difficult for us to determine when I shall again have the pleasure of
                            communings and associating with friends, and enjoying the comforts and
                            pleasures which home &amp; the association of friends will bring.
                            But I shall not repine at my lot, however hard it may be; for I know it
                            is not the worst that has been endured. "There is no place like home," I
                            know, but I am willing to forsake home &amp; friends when our
                            country is endangered by foe without or within, if, by so doing, I can
                            assist her in her peril, and to establish her on that firm basis "The
                            Constitution as our Fathers made it." What they fought for and labored
                            to establish, their children should with the same courage, ardor and
                            unanimity try to protect. Our Country is the best the world has ever
                            seen, and Our Constitution has been denominated "a grand chart of human
                            freedom;" for these our fathers "fought, bled &amp; died," and have
                            left them an inheritance to us to <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0021"
                                n="10"/> preserve, protect, and improve, and we shall strive
                            zealously with "might and main" to defend them from foes without or
                            traitors within, so that, when through the "fiery ordeal," they may be
                            brighter than before.</p>
                        <p>Should we fail, should we allow our country to fall, and be swallowed up
                            in the vortex of disunion and treason, it will be a burlesque on a
                            Republican form of Government, and an everlasting shame to the American
                            people. ~~ I'm off for Western Virginia tomorrow morning, if I have no
                            ill luck, but I must say, that, during my short stay amongst my friends,
                            and acquaintances, that I have enjoyed myself hugely, and for the
                            kindness and friendly feeling manifested by my friends, I am under
                            everlasting obligations, and the "good times" I have had will be classed
                            with my pleasant remembrance, and the thought of these will tend to <add

                        <p>I got on board the cars yesterday morning at 6 o'clock at Holmesville,
                            Ohio, and fully expected to be in Wheeling, Va., in 12 hours thereafter,
                            and in all probability would have been, had it not been that on my
                            arrival at Wellsville, Ohio, I suddenly changed my notion, at the same
                            time changing my course of travel, going <hi rend="underline">from</hi>
                            Wheeling, instead of <hi rend="underline">towards</hi> it. About the
                            time I expected in the morning to be in Wheeling, I found myself at my
                            uncle's some five miles west of New Brighton, after a railroad ride of
                            138 miles, and a hard walk of 8 more. Having never been here before, the
                            family were total strangers to me, and I was obliged to introduce
                            myself. I found them all well and hearty. ~~ I went to a spelling about
                            a mile off last night, and saw some specimens of Pennsylvanians,
                            &amp; their conduct, which I hope will not admit of a general
                            application. The country here is quite rough and broken, but if I
                            mistake not, it is a healthy locality. ~~ The weather is just cold
                            enough today to be pleasant, and the bit of snow which fell a night or
                            so ago, is fast disappearing beneath the mild rays of the sun.</p>

                        <p> Today, leaving the hills of the "Keystone State", and coursing swiftly
                            down the <add hand="author" place="top">banks of the</add> Ohio, through
                            the border of the "Buckeye State", I, tonight, find myself in the "Old
                            Dominion," in the principal city of the Western portion. ~~ I left my
                            uncle's at 8 &frac12; o'clock this morning in company with my cousin, Miss
                            Lydia T. to go to New Brighton. By dint of running about half a mile, we
                            just succeeded in getting on the cars in time, by missing which, we
                            would have had four miles more to walk.</p>
                        <p> Having staid here about 3 hours, and become dissatisfied with the people
                            of the place; who are too aristocratic to suit my plain notions, I came
                            on to Rochester, 3 miles from New Brighton, and on the Ohio River. New
                            Brighton is a pretty village, and has good buildings, and does a
                            considerable business, being situated on the line of the P. Fr. W. V. C.
                            R. R, and but 3 miles from the Ohio River.</p>
                        <p> Rochester is also on the same road, at the junction of it and the
                            Cleveland &amp; Pittsburg R.R., but is a place of no consequence,
                            and but little business, as I could see, is transacted . ~ At 3 P.M. I
                                <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0024" n="13"/> left Rochester for
                            Wheeling, distant, 65 miles. A 3 hours ride brought me to Bridgeport
                            (opposite Wheeling) and in another half hour, by means of the omnibus, I
                            cross the River, and here I am. The first thing I did was to visit the
                            Post Hospital at this place, to find an acquaintance who is an assistant
                            there, having entered the Hospital as a patient last Fall, but has now
                            recovered. By his aid, I succeed in getting a suitable place to stay, in
                            the shape of the "Swan House," which, though not first class, is very
                            good, both as to accommodations and charges. But I feel fatigued and
                            sleepy, consequently, I will "drop off" here, and "turn in" for the
                            night.</p>
                        <p> I might add, by way of postscript, that my today's trip was a pleasant
                            one. The favorable weather and beautiful scenery combined to <add
                                hand="author" place="top">make a</add> few dull hours pass rapidly
                            and pleasantly by. The placid waters of the Ohio, occasionally ruffled
                            by a passing steamboat, the steep, rocky hills, of either side,
                            approaching in most places close to the shore, an occasional island, the
                            numerous oil-derricks, the pretty villages, &amp;c. &amp;c,
                            together with the clear, bright day, unusual for February, tended to
                            beguile away a short time that might have hung heavily on my hands.</p>

                        <p>Took a peep at the city this morning, and don't think much of it.
                            although a place of considerable celebrity and importance, yet, I must
                            say that I am not prepossessed in its favor, and decidedly dislike its
                            looks. What I have seen is nothing more than dirty, black-looking
                            houses, and these of a very plain order of architecture. Streets are
                            narrow, and I see nothing attractive anywhere except the wire Suspension
                            bridge, which spans the river from Wheeling to Wheeling Island, which
                            lies opposite Wheeling. This is <add hand="author" place="top">a</add>
                            splendid piece of mechanism, and is truly one of the wonders of Art. The
                            space here spanned must be some 1200 feet without a single pier, and is
                            probably 80 or 100 feet above low water mark.</p>
                        <p> Visited the Hospital, and took a look at things there; and found
                            everything looking trim &amp; tidy, giving evidence of the existence
                            of a good managing head. Most of the seriously sick of our army in
                            Western Virginia have been sent here, and have been greatly benefited
                            thereby.</p>

                        <p>I have been looking anxiously for a down river boat all day, but have
                            seen none, and no regular packet for farther down than Parkersburg is
                            due until Tuesday evening. ~~ This is Sunday, and a dull day to me,
                            which possibly may have some influence in my giving such an opinion of

                        <p>No boat today. A slight sprinkle of snow fell last night,
                            rob<!--[e]-->ing the earth in fleecy whiteness. I havn't a much better
                            opinion of the city than yesterday. A little more activity today is
                            about the only perceptible difference. I notice considerable of <add

                            streets, and as sport shoulder straps, whether they deserve them or not,
                            and get all the glory, while the common soldier who does the fighting,
                            and endures the hardships, is passed by, unheeded and unmentioned. But
                            for him, and where would the reputation &amp; glory of such
                            self-conceited puppies be? These remarks, be it understood, apply only
                            to those weak-headed individuals whom a position will make a bigger fool

                            Wheeling. It has length, but no breadth. It is stretched along the river
                            bank for two, three, or four miles, but extends back but a short
                            distance on account of abruptly steep hills. ~ My furlough expiring
                            today, I reported myself at Gen: Rosecrans' Head Quarters, and, stating
                            the cause of my delay, the matter was made "all right."</p>

                        <p> Last night the "Sally List'" arrived at Wheeling. She is a regular
                            packet, plying between Wheeling and Cincinnati. I engaged passage on her
                            for Gallipolis. At 5 this evening she left the wharf, and I confess I
                            was not regretful, but experienced a thrill of joy at bidding "good-by"
                            to Wheeling. The shades of night are gathering around us, depriving us
                            of view of the country and scenery; but I shall retire to the cabin,
                            there to meditate, and, in the meantime to replenish the "inner man with

                        <p> Awaking about 2 this morning, I found that our boat had stopped at
                            Mariotta, and, as her time for leaving was 5 A.M. she would be obliged
                            to remain some time, consequently, your humble servant turned over and
                            prepared to take another snooze. At 6 o'clock we were at Parkersburg,
                            Va., an inconsiderable place at the mouth of the Little Kanawha, but it
                            has obtained some notoriety in consequence of being the terminus of the
                            North-Western Branch of the Balt. and Ohio R.R. which intersects the
                            main road at Grafton, about 100 miles north-east of this, (Parkersb'g)</p>
                        <p> About 7 A.M. we left Parkersburg, and but a short time after we were
                            passing the famous "Blen= =nerhassett's Island," which has obtained such
                            a celebrity in consequence of the incidents connected with it, and its
                            former occupant and proprietor.</p>
                        <p> Not withstanding the morning air is quite sharp &amp; cold, yet
                            bracing and invigorating. I consider this place worthy of a view, and a
                            sight of it remunerative enough to forego the comforts of a cosy
                            steamboat cabin and warm stove for a few moments, and I ascend to
                            hurricane deck, to see what I can see. <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0029"
                                n="18"/> It is a portion of land some two or three miles in length I
                            should estimate, a bit narrow and laying near the middle of the river.
                            The soil appears quite fertile, and well adapted to the growth of Indian
                            corn. I noticed two or three apple orchards, and some common=looking
                            dwelling=houses. Nothing of interest is noticeable, and the traveler
                            might pass it fifty times, and be hardly conscious of its existence,
                            were it not for the incidents connected with it, and the associations
                            clustering around it, and which have given it an almost world-wide
                            celebrity. A trifle over half a century ago, a gifted foreigner resided
                            here in the enjoyment of health, wealth, contentment of mind, and the
                            pleasant society of friends. He left his home in a foreign land, and
                            came to America; the fame of which had begun to spread abroad, and here,
                            on this beautiful isle, he selected and prepared a place for his future
                            home. <hi rend="underline">But the wily</hi> Here he lived, and here he
                            labored, content and happy. But the wily destroyer came, at length, and
                            what was before an Eden, compared to the tumultuous and diversified
                            world all around, as <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0030" n="19"/> suddenly
                            transformed into an abode of wretchedness and despair. Alas! what a
                            change. The once happy occupant is, in a few short months, arraigned
                            before the country as a traitor and felon. The family, sharing his
                            guilt, suffer with mental agony sad to contemplate.</p>
                        <p>Whether, indeed, Blennerhasset was guilty of the grave charge of treason,
                            or whether seduced unwittingly by the artful misrepresentations of the
                            gifted Burr to countenance such a conspiracy for which he was indicted,
                            is hard to determine, but, certain it is, that History would fain erase
                            the foul blot which this has associated with the name of Blennerhasset;
                            and heap the ignominy and disgrace upon Aaron Burr, who, though gifted
                            and talented, and who occupied prominent positions in our government, at
                            last, steeped his hands in the blood of a former friend, and one of
                            America's best men, and attempted to overthrow the government that had
                            nurtured him, at the same time attempting to drag others into the
                            conspiracy, only eventually rendering himself an "outcast and vagabond
                            upon the face of the earth," his kindred a reproach, and <add
                                hand="author" place="top">causing</add> his name to find a place
                            beside that of Benedict Arnold, that most heinous of traitors.~~ But we
                                <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0031" n="20"/> will drop this subject,
                            and, as the day is really pleasant and pretty, and our time unemployed,
                            we can look around us, and speculate upon things past and present. Most
                            naturally, our thoughts turn to ourselves and our immediate
                            surroundings, which are constantly changing, but, as a whole, is one
                            &amp; the same. Within the present century, a most wonderful rev=
                            =olution has taken place in the affairs of the world, but in nothing has
                            there such a change or improvement taken place as in modes of travel and
                            communication. When Fulton first applied the power of steam to its
                            present use, he inaugurated a new and wonderful era in the affairs of
                            nations, little thought of by him, I conjecture, and, though less than a
                            single lifetime has elapsed since the great inventor first launched the
                            first steamboat on the Hudson at New York, now can be seen hundreds and
                            thousands of the same, dotting our rivers, lakes and oceans, being the
                            fruits of the clumsy little foundling that in 1807 made its first trip,
                            amidst the skepticism and disbelief which existed, at that time, as to
                            the probability or feasibility of such an undertaking. The slow=going
                            flatboat, has long ago, <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0032" n="21"/> been
                            superseded by the elegant and graceful steamer, navigation, travel, and
                            intercourse have been greatly facilitated, the productions of foreign
                            countries have been easily brought us, and in return, we have exported
                            the fruits of our own industry. And the simple application of that
                            apparently vapory element, steam, has accomplished all this. Not only
                            has navigation been benefited, but, if we look at our railroads, almost
                            literally making a checker= =board of the country, we see distant points
                            made nearer, apparently; and time almost annihilated.</p>
                        <p>The country I see around me, was, at the beginning of the present
                            century, a wild, unsettled forest, inhabited only by the wild Indian,
                            who hunted the still wilder animals of the forest. The only habitations
                            were the wigwarms of the savage, who lived here savage and undisturbed.
                            Now what a change. The forest has been cleared away, and we see pretty
                            villages, neat farm=houses, well=tilled farms, domestic animals,
                            evidences of civilization, and, about all, we greet, instead of the
                            dusty red man, the enlightened white man, who, by a proper application
                            of his intelligence, has transformed the wilderness, so as "to bloom and
                            blossom as the rose."</p>

                            "not to be seen of men'" he is as sure of a reward from his Heavenly

                            <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0034" n="23"/> I judge a man's sincerity, his
                            religion and Christianity by the acts he does, and the motives which
                            impel him to their performance. The thousand and one different plans
                            submitted by as many different individuals, to guide you to the world
                            beyond, seem to me to be designed to lead you away, and in your debate
                            about the different theories you get to wrangling, and lose sight
                            altogether of the object you have in view. I don't believe Christianity
                            is a theory, but consists in practice, and if one really desires to be a
                            Christian, let him cast aside all theories, and observe the Golden Rule:

                            ~~ To go through the forms of religion as many do, and then become so
                            vain=glorious as the self=conceited Pharisee, who, when he went up into
                            the temple, and publicly prayed, thanking God that "he was not as other
                            are;" or to bellow vociferously with an auctioneer=like voice, at every
                            meeting, indicated to me, a rather spurious kind of religion, and it
                            seems as though they are conscious of receding farther from that God
                            whom they pretend to worship, and must clamor thus, to obtain audience

                        <p> At 8 this morning precisely we left Gallipolis. A late breakfast very
                            near detained me, for I was obliged <add hand="author" place="top"
                            >to</add> run at "double quick" some 20 or 30 rods for fear of being
                            left, and this I done, regardless of the mud, of which there was plenty,
                            floundering through and succeeding in smearing my clothes most
                            beautifully; but never mind, it's Ohio soil, and God knows when I will
                            again see or tread it again. ~~ Having to "stem the current," we make
                            rather slow progress, insomuch that at this time, 7 P.M. we are no
                            farther than Charleston, 64 miles from Gallipolis. ~~ The difference
                            between Ohio and Western Virginia is so wide that it is not hard to
                            institute a contrast. Instead of pretty farms, well cultivated, we see a
                            rough, broken, almost uncultivated country, log hovels, instead of
                            pretty, comfortable dwellings, &amp;c.&amp;c. and so we might
                            enumerate, the difference being as wide throughout.</p>
                        <p> Our boat stops 10 miles further up, at Camp Piatt, and as I have a good
                            long walk before me tomorrow, I shall "turn in" for the night, and
                            prepare for it accordingly.</p>

                        <p> Yesterday morning at 6 o'clock I left the "Glenwood", and embarked on
                            the small Government steamer "Gen'l Meigs" for the rest of my journey up
                            the Kanawha. She is a small affair, used for the transportation of
                            Government supplies, and running on the head-waters of the Kanawha. As
                            we proceed up the river, the hills, become more lofty and rough=
                            =looking, and rise precipitously almost from the very banks of the
                            river. Rough and forbidding as the exterior appears, there is, without
                            doubt, a rich mine of mineral wealth beneath, that would amply repay the
                            industry of the enterprising laborer. ~~ So very rapid does the current
                            of the river become as we approach nearer the head that our progress is
                            discouragingly slow, insomuch that we do not reach Loop Creek landing
                            until 11 &frac12; o'clock, a distance of but 28 miles from Camp Piatt. A
                            journey of 17 miles more must be accomplished before we reach
                            Fayetteville. Leaving the boat, we ascend the bank to the road, which we
                            find at this place to be a perfect ocean of mud. Proceeding, we find it
                            no better, there being <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0037" n="26"/>
                            scarcely a by=path, and even this is sometimes barricaded by a seemingly
                            impassable barrier of - mud. Mud to the right., mud to the left, mud
                            behind, mud before, mud beneath, and I had almost said mud above us; and
                            mud of the muddiest kind, not <del hand="author">

                            </del> mud in its simplest state but mud in the superlative degree. The
                            almost fabulous stories of the traveler "out West" who lost his horses
                            and wagons, and was obliged to stick up a stake to mark the spot of the
                            disaster, or others of a like character, I have always received <add
                                hand="author" place="top">with</add> a due amount of allowances, but
                            now I can exercise more credulity concerning them, and sympathize, at
                            the same time, with the truly unfortunate individual who could be so
                            unlucky. How, in the name of wonder, army supplies in heavy, lumbering
                            army wagons can be transported over such roads (it is almost mockery to
                            call then such) is a matter of wonder to me. The dead mules and horses
                            laying scattered along will attest to how hard the lot is of the poor
                            brute, whose, unlucky stars doom him to toil and labor in this miserably
                            muddy country. ~~ Well, truly, it is discouraging to <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000004402_0038" n="27"/> the traveler with conveyance
                            to Journey here, but to the pedestrian it is infinitely more so,
                            especially if he has no boots, as was the case with the unfortunate
                            individual who relates this . ~ However, regardless of consequences, I
                            traveled the entire distance by 8 last night, not without becoming
                            fatigued, and very near "played out." And here I found that Capt.
                            Drake's Company were in Raleigh, 25 miles south of here, whither they
                            had gone a couple of days previous, but being acquainted at the
                            Hospital, I resorted thither. Eating some supper, I retired to bed, and
                            this morning felt somewhat refreshed, but hardly able to undertake the
                            Journey before me. As it is a wet and dismal=looking day, I have been
                            out but little, consequently I shall finish my present observations
                            here; only remarking that if everything is favorable I shall leave for
                            Raleigh tomorrow morning.</p>
                        <p>The Doctor informs me that there are but 10 patients in the Hospital, and

                        <p> Yesterday morning, I, with a companion, started from Fayetteville for
                            this place. It was a pleasantly cool morning, the mud was frozen up so
                            as to make the roads easily possible, and we had hoped that it would so
                            continue, but towards noon, the air became balmier, and the genial and
                            familiar face of "Old Sol" stole from behind a cloud. Presently the
                            roads gave indication of a "thaw", which we were not long in
                            discovering. The mud of which there was no scarcity effectually retarded
                            our progress, so that we accomplished but 15 miles of our journey by
                            sundown, and were quite tired at that. We staid at the <add
                                hand="author" place="top">log</add> house of a native Virginian last
                            night= and as the place was a pretty fair specimen of Virginia <add
                                hand="author" place="top">residences</add> at least what I have
                            seen, I give a short description. The exterior of the house (?) was by
                            no means inviting, inasmuch as there was but part of a chimney, about
                            one=third the h<!--[e]-->ight of the house, and not a window=glass was
                            anywhere visible, although a place had been left for such purpose.
                            Numerous cracks and holes, signifying the absence of chunk and daubing,
                            do not appear to <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0040" n="29"/> indicate a
                            very great degree of comfort. The interior of this "air=castle" was
                            equally as forbidding as the outside. The walls were low, and the
                            furniture scarce and extremely rough and uncouth. A bedstead, a trundle
                            bed, 3 or 4 old chairs, an old chest, an old table, 2 or 3 barrels, a
                            few bed=clothes, cooking utensils, cups and saucers, which latter
                            adorned the board, <add hand="author" place="top">which</add> by way of
                            courtesy, was called the mantel, and you have the entire inventory of
                            their household goods.</p>
                        <p>Supper consisted of some poorly=baked biscuit, poorly= cooked pumpkin,
                            tolerable good meat, and some very good coffee, this, and nothing more,
                            comprised our evening repast. Breakfast consisted of the same, except
                            the "pumpkin' was removed, and in its stead we find dried apples and
                            butter. I must do the family the <del hand="author">

                            cordiality.</p>
                        <p>We traveled the remaining 10 miles by noon today, but found upon our
                            arrival that nearly all of the company had gone on a scout the Saturday
                            previous, but were expected back every hour. I felt somewhat tired after
                            the trip. The first 10 miles from Fayetteville is tolerably level, then
                            commences a series of ascents and <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0041"
                                n="30"/> descents which continue with but little variation the
                            remainder of the way to Raleigh.</p>
                        <p> The boys returned <del hand="author">

                            </del> near dusk this evening, very tired and footsore, for they had had
                            a sorry time and hard marching. After a separation of over five weeks, I
                            was glad to see the company again, and see all looking so well. A brief
                            account of their expedition, I subjoin as furnished me: Accounts had
                            been received at times of the existence of a body of the enemy at a
                            village called Jumping Branch, some 20 miles south=west of this place,
                            but the number was not supposed to be near so great as it after= wasds
                            turned out to be. Major <unclear>Cornly</unclear> of the 23<hi

                            attack them, and with that end in view, he left Raleigh on Saturday <add
                                hand="author" place="top">2 P.M.</add> at the head of 221 men, all
                            told, consisting of detachments of Cos. B.D. F. G. &amp; H. of the
                                23<hi rend="super">rd</hi>, 32 of the 1<hi rend="super">st</hi> Va.
                            Cavalry, and one of McMullin's howitzers manned by 9 members of the
                            Artillery. During the night they arrived within half a mile of the
                            enemy, then halting, laid down to sleep without fires, but under the
                            circumstances <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0042" n="31"/> it was not
                            possible. Day dawned, when they advanced upon the enemy, who, without
                            showing fight, fled in precipitate haste; and in the most utter
                            confusion. Our men killed 2 and took 3 prisoners, some horses, arms,
                            &amp;c., without any loss.<ref n="4" target="n4">{4}</ref> Part of our
                            men pursued them some 4 or 5 miles, but being fatigued they were obliged
                            to give up the chase. Returning, they staid all night at Jumping Branch,
                            and then, in the morning, set fire to the town, an insignificant little
                            place of some dozen log houses, which had served as a rendezvous for the
                            rebels. Only two or three houses were spared, they being occupied by
                            families. Many of the men had their feet frozen on account of the first
                            nights exposure. Had the rebels had courage, and but stood their ground
                            they might have proved a formidable adversary for our little band to
                            encounter, or had they shown tact, they might have completely cut them
                            off and hemmed them in easily, with the overwhelming force which, we
                            have the best of evidence, was near at hand.</p>

                        <p> Took a peep at our town today and like its looks very well. The houses,
                            generally speaking, are commodious and comfortable buildings, but are
                            mostly deserted, but the absence of the inhabitants we do not regret, as
                            their vacant dwellings furnish us a good protection from the pitiless
                            storms, and the inclemencies of the weather, which many of our
                            volunteers will have to endure and shiver through beneath the thin
                            covering of a canvas tent. The locality is a healthy one, and a change
                            for the better in the health of the troops is easily noticeable, since
                            leaving Fayetteville, which place, from some cause or other, produced
                            Diarrhoea that curse of the camps, to an alarming extent. But few

                            fraternity having "left their country for their country's good." The
                            word <hi rend="underline">bushwhacker</hi> is one of recent origin, and
                            is in common use among the soldiers to designate a certain class of men
                            who fire upon our men from some concealed point, where they cannot be
                            reached, carrying on their <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0044" n="33"/>
                            operation somewhat similar to the guerillas of Mexico, alone or in small
                            squads, prowling the country where they are acquainted, and when
                            opportunity offers, deliberately murder men who are as good as
                            defenseless. If ever men deserved hanging, they are these <hi
                                rend="underline">bushwhackers.</hi> So odious have most Western
                            Virginians become in the sight of the Union soldier, that the term <hi
                                rend="underline">bushwhacker</hi> is commonly applied to all
                            citizens. Some honorable exceptions I will admit there are, but the term
                            I am quite sure is properly applicable to a majority, who have by divers
                            acts helped the secession cause, and impaired the Old Government, and so
                            soon as our troops enter their neighborhood and obtain predominance,
                            they flock to Head= Quarters to "take the oath" which, in nine cases out
                            of ten is a waste of words, and mere child's play, for I consider that a
                            man who once deliberately raises his hand against the Government which
                                <add hand="author" place="top">has</add> protected him, and under
                            which he <add hand="author" place="top">has</add> prospered, will not be
                            anymore likely to bear allegiance by "taking an oath" so to do; although
                            an oath is <add hand="author" place="top">usually</add> binding on a man
                            who possesses a conscience, but of such a traitor is devoid.</p>

                        <p>Today is one of the prettiest days I have seen this winter. The sky is
                            clear, the sun shines brightly, the air is warm and balmy and altogether

                            newspaper reports are so unreliable, being numerous and contradictory
                            that they must be, and of late are taken at a considerable discount;
                            therefore I will withhold any manifestation of joy until reports are

                        <p>A change in the weather took place last night, as great as it was
                            unexpected. About bedtime, there were strong indications of a rain,
                            which we fully expected, but on looking out of doors this morning, was
                            surprised to see the gound covered with snow to the depth of some two
                            inches; and indications of more.</p>

                        <p>This is St. Valentine's day; generally employed by many, in the
                            transmissal of missives supposed to express their sentiments towards the
                            opposite sex, from the sentimental to the burlesque and ridiculous. I am
                            thinking that it will hardly be observed in this fashion by the
                            soldiers, matters less trivial occupying their time, thoughts, and

                        <p> Snow continued to fall gradually until after noon today, so that there
                            is now fully six inches of snow laying on the ground. Everything
                            presents a decidedly wintry aspect, the snow covered earth, the dark,
                            heavy clouds, the naked forests, and the cold, cutting air, are
                            sufficient evidences. People at home are enjoying themselves, no doubt,
                            or at least they do whenever there is snow; but this winter the soldiers
                            look with gloomy aspect at any indications of cold or unfavorable
                            weather, although but a year ago they hailed with delight any appearance

                        <p>This is so much like other days, because our duties are not materially
                            different from other days; that soldiers are often unable to tell the
                            day of the week, and quite frequently a Sunday has passed without our
                            being aware of the fact. Many of last summer's marches were performed on
                            Sunday, and though I believe proper respect should be paid to the
                            Sabbath, yet it is almost impossible to do so in the army. For instance,
                            we are as much exposed on Sundays as well as other days, consequently
                            the same strict watch must be kept, and guards must be detailed for that
                            purpose. The same caution must be exercised, the same preparations made,
                            and in nearly every respect the same routine of duties must be performed
                            on all days nearly alike, so that a distinction is hard to make. Today
                            some of our men are employed in hauling wood for the company, and very
                            likely this labor could not be avoided at this time, or postponed until
                            the next day, for reasons unnecessary to mention. <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000004402_0048" n="37"/> And while I am speaking of
                            Sunday, I will say something of Chaplains. I do not wish to be
                            considered personal, but, so far as my observation and information has
                            extended, I have formed the opinion that Chaplains, like sutlers, are
                            perfect nuisances, particularly in a Volunteer army, actively engaged in
                            the field, and that the sooner the institution is totally abolished, so
                            much better will it be for the people and the Government.</p>
                        <p> The pay <add hand="author" place="top">&amp; emoluments</add> of a
                            Chaplain is that of a Captain of cavalry, amounting to over $140 per
                            month, a snug little sum, and more than our Government is able to lavish
                            on any one, at the time of financial embarrassments like the present.
                            This amount is sufficient to awaken the avarice of many, consequently,
                            there will be considerable strife to obtain so easy and lucrative <add
                                hand="author" place="top">a</add> position, and most likely some
                            incompetent, and, possibly, not over=pious Candidate is the lucky one,
                            but little attention being paid to qualifications or fitness; a smooth
                            address and a white neck=cloth being powerful influences, where the
                            appointing power "fills the letter," caring little for "the spirit of
                            the law". <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0049" n="38"/> I have mentioned
                            sutlers, and have con= =sidered them in no enviable light, and I think
                            reasons sufficient can be adduced to substantiate the assertion that
                            they are, as a general thing, contemptible nuisances and cheats, who,
                            taking advantage of the necessities and wants of soldiers, dispose of
                            articles to them for three times their real value, and seldom, if ever,
                            do these blood=thirsty leeches offer or keep for sale a simply common
                            article, but a condemned and inferior one. They could easily be
                            dispensed with, for they are of very little benefit, and, on the whole,
                            are of more injury than good. The <hi rend="underline">thing</hi> who
                            keeps on hand for sale articles of a very inferior quality and for which
                            an exhorbitant price is demanded, and if the buyer demurs, the seller,
                            fearing no competition, is insolent and unaccommodating, is nothing more
                            than a common swindler &amp; robber, who will not compare favorably
                            with Floyd and Cameron, of War Department notoriety.</p>

                            extensively amongst the troops encamped here this winter, afflicting
                            nearly all, not even sparing your humble servant, whom it severely dealt
                            with, so that, if the climate, water, &amp;c, or any= thing else
                            connected with the place was instrumental in producing it, no very
                            pleasant recollections can be cited, or if any, they are counterbalanced
                            by correspondingly miserable ones. As the Doctor had requested <add

                            previous to going home. ~~ I started from Raleigh yesterday morning
                            about 8 o'clock. A slight mist was falling at the time, and, before
                            proceeding far, strong indications of a rain were visible, but, happily,
                            my suppositions were not realized. The day becoming quite pleasant, and
                            the sun being unobscured, naturally enough, a 'thaw' took place,
                            consequence was, plenty of mud, and the discomfiture of the pedestrian

                            sound somewhat fabulous, but the report is from such sources as to

                            our present difficulties and deplorable condition as a nation, are not
                            hard to explain, having their origin in the manner in which "The Father
                            of his country" advised us to guard against, and which can be traced to
                            prominent individuals, and others less prominent, in the North, as well
                            as the South. These abolitionists, who have not openly declared their
                            enmity to the Union, but who would be glad to see our once happy nation
                            torn into fragments, and inwardly chuckle at the prospect of such a
                            consummation, are villains and traitors, as bad as the openly avowed

                            to their own condition. Most heinous in my sight are all abolitionists

                        <p>Times are very dull. Were it not for the cheering news that reaches us
                            once in a while, it would be an almost unbearable kind of life to lounge
                            around this dull town and country, all the little interest of which has
                            long ago been exhausted. Scarcely anything occurs to break the monotony.</p>
                        <p>Today I visited a romantic spot on New river, w<add hand="author"
                                place="top">h</add>ere a stream called Wolf Creek flows into it,
                            some two miles from town. The <add hand="author" place="top"
                            >relative</add> position of the two streams form an acute angle of the
                            point of land between, and which rises by successive steps no less

                            the river, until a height of, I should judge, 400 feet is attained.
                            Standing on the summit, which is but a narrow ridge, from which you can
                            gaze beneath on either side, you can see far up and down New River,
                            which here flows through a gorge only wide enough to admit the stream,
                            and which is away beneath. Wolf Creek before flowing into New River,
                            descends rapidly over the rocks some hundreds of feet. This, <pb

                            reflected in the rays of the sun, and a beautiful little cascade, nearly
                            opposite, across New River, and which falls a hundred feet in 2 or 3
                            successive leaps, these, alto- =gether, form a grand sight, and well
                            worth a visit. The almost perpendicular hills on either side of the
                            river are covered with forests, now mostly leafless, and protruding from
                            the sides, may be seen <add hand="author" place="top">the edge of</add>

                            Cavalry, 7 miles from town. I must modify my language a little. Instead

                            was the custom of the com'd'g officer to each day send a patrol of
                            Cavalry on the <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0060" n="49"/> road to the
                            South, (that being the direction towards the enemy) in order to keep
                            accurately posted on affairs in that section. They had never been
                            molested before this time, when a party of concealed "bushwhackers" from
                            a hill commanding the road, fired a volley upon the little party, (8
                            men) instantly killing two, &amp; wounding one. One was captured.
                            The others narrowly escaped with their lives. I have dilated some on
                            'bushwhackers' &amp; 'bushwhacking' in another place, so that my

                            after a successful descent upon the "bushwhacking ", fraternity early
                            Sunday morning. For our deluded Southern brethren to wake up on a fine

                            'posse' of 'Yankees,' the effect would be easily imagined. In the course
                            of the morning, we picked up about a dozen prisoners, and 12 horses. We
                            then recrossed the river, here some 200 yards wide, having to swim our
                            horses, and ourselves cross in common "dugouts." We staid at the house
                            of a Mr. Richmond all night, and reached camp next day. Having been
                            fortunate enough to capture a horse the day previous, he came most <pb

                            reason, Mr. Richmond requested our aid in "wiping them out" a little.
                            How effectually it has been done, remains to be seen.</p>

                            none the less so than their appearances would seem to indicate. This is
                            the usual proportion, so far, at least, as my observation &amp;
                            inquiry extends, or probably, the class of ignorance is even greater.

                            next akin to the vacant stare of the idiot, &amp; we have the
                            principal ingredients of a genuine Western Virginian. To him, books are
                            a trouble, newspapers a toy, works of art works of folly, the arts,
                            sciences, &amp; education a cheat. And the effect can plainly be
                            seen.</p>
                        <p> And these are Virginians, &amp; this is Virginia. The land of the
                            F.F.V's, the "Mother of Presidents," the "Old Dominion". It seemeth to
                            me that "her glory hath departed" somewhat. Now that she is the scene of
                            a great struggle, it is hoped it may be the means of renovating and
                            purifying her of the disloyalty and corruption with which she has long
                            been infested. Certain it is that the broad fields &amp; wide
                            domains of more than one active conspirator will become desolate from
                            the scourge <add hand="author" place="top">of men</add>, &amp; they
                            will have cause to regret having instituted a rebellion, which

                        <p>This is what is commonly known as "All Fool's Day," and, as usual, is
                            turned to account by those who like joking. Of course, many are duped,
                            and many enjoy hearty laughs at others' expense, only eventually to have
                            the laughed turned in many cases. But we all feel in excellent spirits
                            &amp; good humor on the present occasion, and can afford to take a

                        <p> Yesterday morning at daylight, the troops were on the move from Flat Top
                            southward. A heavy fog, that the vision could penetrate but a few rods,
                            hung like a curtain around us, &amp; on the mountain sides. Our
                            march commenced with the descent of the mountain upon which we had
                            encamped the night previous. We had traveled probably four miles, when
                            the Cavalry &amp; some Infantry were suddenly ordered into position,
                            &amp; the remainder sent scouring the adjacent hills, an undesirable
                            job, truly. Away we went tearing through underbrush, &amp; over logs
                            &amp; stones, keeping both eyes wide open, as was necessary in order
                            for us to make progress, &amp; examine the country.</p>
                        <p> Our hunt proved to be a "wild goose chase," &amp; we returned to
                            where the others were in the road, &amp; learned the cause of all
                            the warlike movements. <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0070" n="59"/> A small
                            body of the enemy, numbering about 300, had decamped from this place but
                            a short time previous, after having a severe fight with Co. 'C.' of our
                            Reg't.</p>
                        <p> The circumstance is as follows. This Company had been sent out the day
                            previous to scout and reconnoitre in advance. After scouring the country
                            considerably, &amp; burning up a "bushwhackers" camp, they started
                            to rejoin the Regiment, &amp; should have reported to Camp that
                            evening. All were so tired, however, that they concluded to stay in a
                            house about four miles from Camp. Intelligence of their doings &amp;
                            whereabouts was forth with made known at Princeton, &amp; the rebel
                            forces started out in pursuit. Just as Co. 'C'. was <del hand="author">

                            </del> ready to start in the morning, they were found themselves
                            surrounded by a greatly superior force, fully four times as great as
                            theirs. The position our boys occupied was a poor one, but the enemy,
                            posted as they were on surrounding hills, unquestionably had the
                            advantage in every respect.</p>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0071" n="60"/>
                        <p>The fight continued about an hour, when the enemy suddenly withdrew,
                            probably hearing of our proximity. The damage on both sides was severe.
                            What the exact loss of the rebels was, is unknown, but enough is known
                            to make it certain that they were worsted. Co. "C's' loss was one killed
                            &amp; 23 wounded, one of whom has since died. It was a fearful

                            before allowing themselves to be taken. All honor to the heroes, say I,
                            &amp; say all of us. - The wounded were sent to Flat Top Mountain,
                            &amp; will remain there, under charge of Ass't Surg. Mc Curdy, until

                        <p> The regiment proceeded forward without further delay, and, although an
                            unpleasant day, and the roads slippery, they reached Princeton before
                            sundown, 23 miles from Flat Top. Having tarried considerably, I did not
                            reach here until today.</p>

                        <p>Our boys were a trifle too late however, as the enemy, being made aware
                            of their approach, had fired the town, really a pretty one,
                            subtstantially built, and were just "skedaddling" over the hills in
                            sight of town. All was destroyed but 3 or 4 houses. Public buildings,
                            which had cost the people thousands of dollars, shared the common fate.
                            What possible benefit to them, or harm to us can accrue from this piece
                            of <hi rend="underline">vandalism</hi> I am unable to see. Let rebels

                        <p>On the 5<hi rend="super">th.</hi>, Cos. H, I: &amp; K, &amp;
                            Gilmore's Cavalry, all under command of Major Courly, started on the
                            road to Giles, 28 miles distant. Other duties pre- vented my
                            accompanying, &amp; I am still here. Yesterday, the remainder of the
                            Reg't pushed forward. The trip was made in one day, a hard day's march.
                            From "contrabands" arrived, we learn that our forces captured a large
                            amount of stores, (Principally flour, bacon, and whisky;) &amp; some
                            prisoners, and that their descent upon the place was as sudden as <add
                                hand="author" place="top">it was</add> unexpected.</p>
                        <p>'Contrabnads' are quite numerous, &amp; are availing themselves of
                            the advantages presented to get away from their masters. A foraging
                            party, having imprudently ventured too far from camp, some ten miles,
                            were pounced upon by a cavalry company, and four of the party, &amp;
                            some horses captured.</p>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0074" n="63"/>
                        <p>The office of the Provost Marshall is literally besieged with applicants
                            for passes, &amp; persons desiring of "taking the oath." Since our
                            advent here, hundreds have sworn loy= =alty. Of the entire citizen
                            fraternity, not one can be found that does <add hand="author"
                                place="top">not</add> declare he was forced to act with the rebels
                            against his own convictions, or that he kept quiet, while all the time a
                            latent feeling of patri= =otism burned warmly within his breast. None of
                            them ever "bushwhacked", or ever knew a "bushwhacker;" oh, no. The
                            sincerity of a great majority I doubt, nor can I have a very elevated
                            opinion of Mercer Co. patriotism, until I see something more of her. "By
                            their fruits' ye shall know them." I do not doubt that she can do "her
                            duty, if she but fully awake's to her true interests, and will take hold
                            of the work earnestly. If this part of Western Va. would but take a more
                            decided stand, beneficial results to her would be the result. I yet have
                            faith in her, nor can I doubtingly ask, "What good can come out of
                            Nazareth?"</p>

                        <p>Have just arrived here, after a weary horseback ride of 28 miles. Was
                            furnished a horse this morning at Princeton, &amp; jogged through
                            today, thermometer pretty well up. In this trip, I found myself in a
                            much better country, &amp; better cultivated than I have yet seen in
                            Virginia. After striking New River, some 12 miles below here, we find
                            rich bottomd <!--[land]-->, well adapted for raising corn. Farmers were
                            at work planting corn, as though their neighborhood was not the theatre
                            of active warfare. Find the town in a state of feverish anxiety,
                            consequent upon one small force, no reinforcements at hand, &amp;
                            the enemy in large force, but a few miles out, making anything like
                            friendly demonstrations. The truth is, we are in an unpleasant locality,
                            only 21 miles from the Rail Road having direct communi= =cation with
                            Richmond, from which <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0076" n="65"/> they
                            could bring a large force in a short time against us, &amp; which
                            they have undoubtedly done. As I compose myself to sleep tonight, it is
                            with the conviction fully impressed upon my mind, that if an attack is
                            not made tonight, it will not be deferred 24 hours. All I ask is, that
                            in my present wearied condition, I may be allowed a full night's rest,
                            &amp; my breakfast in the morning, &amp; then, if fighting must
                            be done, I can <hi rend="underline">relish</hi> it better.</p>
                        <p> From what little I have seen of Giles, I can say it is really a pretty
                            town, and substantially built. The style of architecture is better than
                            we usually find in this country. The people are wealthier, much more
                            intelligent, and not given to the use of such idioms as 'thar', 'whar',
                            somewhar', 'right smart sprinkle', &amp;c, so peculiar to most of
                            these Western Virginians. But most are unquestionably 'secesh' all
                        over.</p>

                        <p> The apprehensions felt for the peace and quietude of our little
                            community, were fully realized this morning about daybreak, when we <add
                                hand="author" place="top">were</add> hurriedly ordered into line,
                            without breakfast, &amp; hardly awake, and two companies, H.
                            &amp; B, were marched near half a mile beyond town to retard the
                            progress of the enemy, who had made his appearance in considerable force
                            in front, and were actively endeavoring to flank our position, and
                            capture us. While we were engaged in front of the enemy, and thus
                            covering the rear of our forces, the remainder of the troops, with the
                            wagon train <add hand="author" place="top">were</add> falling back in
                            good order. The two Infantry companies in the rear were assisted by
                            Gilmore's Cavalry, &amp; one company of the 2<hi rend="super"
                            >nd</hi> Va. Cavalry. The latter behaved well at first, but after a time
                            broke &amp; fled in disorder; to their disgrace, be it recorded.</p>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0078" n="67"/>
                        <p> From the position we first occupied, we could get a fine view of the
                            foe, whom, I should estimate at at least 2000, supported by 5 pieces of
                            artillery. This was a decided advantage for them, as we had no
                            artillery. A full Regiment was drawn up in line in front of us in solid
                            col= =umn, while to the right &amp; left, their flankers were moving
                            to gradually enclose us within their lines. Our distance apart, was less
                            that half a mile. We stood and looked at each other coolly some minutes,
                            but this quietness could not long continue. Fire was opened by our boys,
                            and the enemy soon had his artillery in position to shell us, but with
                            this they effected nothing. We were compelled to gradually fall back,
                            but not without contesting the ground hotly. Our loss was less than
                            would have been expected; one killed and six or seven wounded. We have
                            retreated some 10 miles. At this place, we were reinforced by the 30<hi

                            pickets came to view. A shell from a Mountain Howitzer drove them in in
                            a hurry. We followed as far as prudent. The result of our
                            reconnaissance, went to show that the enemy were in force at the
                            "Narrows," a strong natural position, and that our present force was
                            insufficient to dislodge them. After an exchange of artillery shots,
                            without damage to us, we returned to camp, and this after= =noon moved
                            back to the mouth of East River, where it flows into New River, and took
                            up a strong position on a ridge or "backbone" of a hill. New River, at
                            this place is about 200 yards wide, water pure and clear, and quite
                            rapid. We are now 12 miles from Giles. </p>

                        <p>Yesterday morning early, peremptory orders were given to get ready to
                            leave at once. We were in very poor condition for marching, considering
                            our almost starving condition for the past 7 days. Nevertheless, orders
                            must be obeyed, &amp; besides, our safety appeared to depend upon a
                            retrograde movement. From reports in camp, we learned that Humphrey
                                Marshall<ref n="9" target="n9">{9}</ref> with 3000 men had taken
                            Princeton on the 16<hi rend="super">th</hi>, three companies of the
                                34<hi rend="super">th</hi> having fought &amp; kept him back for
                            several hours, not without severe loss. A provision train, well laden,
                            &amp; our only hope of replenishing our haversacks &amp;
                            stomachs for several days, narrowly escaped capture. Gen. Cox with the
                                2<hi rend="super">nd</hi> Brigade preceded us last night, and today
                            cleared the enemy out of town after severe fighting. We arrived at
                            Princeton about dark last evening. Here full rations were issued for
                            supper, and we fully appeased our appetites, the first time in 8 days.
                                <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0082" n="71"/> Our hard crackers and
                            salty bacon were duly appreciated, after we had so long been estranged,
                            and were devoured with a keen relish.</p>
                        <p>In consequence of a lack of transportation, our tents were all left
                            behind &amp; destroyed, so that we were obliged to sleep in the open
                            air. All lay down, fully convinced that our next employment would
                            embrace some of the "stern realities of warfare," vis: fighting, as the
                            enemy was in force but a little outside of town. - After a few hours'
                            repose, the troops were again on the alert. From the movements, we all
                            appeared to think it certain that fighting was the order of the day. The
                            wagon train was moving out upon the road, apparently seeking a position
                            of safety in a case of emergency, nor did we think otherwise or dream of
                            further retreat until Princeton had been left far behind. It is seldom
                            you see so many indignant men as were to be bound today, the state of
                            their feelings being caused by what is considered by most, a most
                            inglorious and, unnecessary retreat.</p>

                        <p>We marched 14 miles today, and arrived here about 2 P.M. The heat of the
                            day rendered it quite unpleasant marching, &amp; the road being
                            quite hilly, made it more disagreeable. Whether we remain here, or
                            continue our retreat, remains to be seen. Certain it is, that whether we
                            go farther or not, we cannot help feeling as though we could have thor=

                        <p> It has been decided that we remain here for a while. Having lost our
                            tents, we must wait until we can be re=furnished from Wheeling.
                            Expedients must be resorted to, to protect us from the weather. Rail and
                            bark 'shanties,' covered with oil - cloths, and built and arranged
                            without any regard to regularity or precision, serve us at present in
                            lieu of tents. Disaster is a great leveler, as officers and men in the
                            present case, share alike, and are made subject to the same
                            inconveniences and hardships.</p>

                            indicates a level summit, upon which are numerous farms and residences.
                            It is a branch of the Alleghanies, and not distant from the line

                        <p> In my comments upon our retreat from East River and Princeton, I
                            incidentally mentioned that in our precipitancy, and the
                            short=sightedness of our commanders, we left behind at Princeton to the
                            tender mercies of our enemies, a number of sick and wounded. Not
                            entirely to the care of the rebels, as some volunteered to remain in the
                            capacities of nurses, &amp;c., to take care of their disabled
                            companions, not choosing to forsake them in adversity. These invalids
                            were principally from the 34<hi rend="super">th</hi> Reg't, which bore
                            the brunt of the first day's fight at Princeton. There were some from
                            the 28<hi rend="super">th</hi> and 37<hi rend="super">th</hi> Reg'ts,
                            and Gen. Cox's body=guard, (Cavalry.)</p>
                        <p> As our authorities here, received intimations a couple of days ago from
                            the enemy, that our wounded would be delivered up whenever sent after,,
                            Lt. Col. Hines <add hand="author" place="top">of 12<hi rend="super"
                                >th</hi> Reg't</add> was deputized to go on this mission, and
                            yesterday collected all the ambulances in camp, and with the "white
                            flag" for his banner, proceeded on his journey. <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000004402_0086" n="75"/> The expedition returned to
                            day, having with them some 60 or 70 sick and wounded. They say they were
                            well-treated during their captivity.</p>
                        <p> They will be forwarded to Raleigh tomorrow. The scarcity of quinine in
                            the Confederacy may have something to do with the delivery of these
                            soldiers, as we cannot reasonably look for a very extensive exercise of
                            generosity amongst such as are our enemies; for, although they may be
                            chivalry and chivalrous, we have too many precedents before our "mind's
                            eye" not to know what is meant by chivalry as used by the "Southern
                            Confederacy", without reference to Webster, whose <add hand="author"
                                place="top">authority</add> we will have to ignore, in the present
                            instance.</p>
                        <p> The 1<hi rend="super">st</hi> Brigade is encamped upon the premises of a
                            Col. Chambers, who is a Union man, and has been all the time, although
                            surrounded by Southern Armies for more than a year. I find that here in
                            Virginia, it is much more common to find persons with military titles
                            than in Ohio, owning to the fact that here militia laws have always been
                            kept in force, <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0087" n="76"/> while in Ohio
                            they have <add hand="author" place="top">been</add> practically dead for
                            years. These titled individuals, as a matter of course, are some of the
                            prominent men of the country, although, as is the case with all public
                            men, there are some whose talents are not of the highest order, and who
                            would not shine in society. But Col. Chambers is not of this class. - He
                            is a man of some education, good common sense, a determined spirit, has
                            traveled some and mixed with society, is probably sixty, and having
                            naturally a somewhat commanding appearance, will gain the respect of
                            community without great effort. Situated as he has been for more than a
                            year past with an armed enemy all around, he has maintained his honor,
                            and has all along, and still clings to the old Union.</p>
                        <p> Col. Little of this county is another, who, despite the almost universal
                            Secession sentiment which pervaded his neighborhood &amp; county,
                            never for once forgot his obligations, nor violated his pledges to his
                            country, but through <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0088" n="77"/> all,
                            "held fast to his integrity, and did not let it go." </p>
                        <p> I can truly say of Col. Little that he is a patriot and a "lover of
                            country," who. although his State, his county, and almost all his
                            friends are swept by fanaticism into the whirlpool of Secession, he
                            remains devoted to the cause of the Union and the Constitution.</p>
                        <p> Such instances are indeed rare, but as I have heretofore given some
                            opinions upon the disloyalty of Virginia, it is proper to record
                            exceptional cases, as bright spots on a dark record.</p>
                        <p> But Col Burgess of Raleigh Co., is a different individual from the two
                            mentioned. He is an ignorant bombast, conceited, deceptive, and
                            treacherous, but he so far succeeded in ingratiating himself into the
                            good opinions of our officers, as to induce them to confide in him as a
                            Unionist, while at heart a traitor. His true char= =acter came to light
                            a short time ago, when the scamp was forthwith sent to a milder
                            locality, where fire-eating is less in vogue than here.</p>

                        <p> Three weeks ago, I mentioned in my diary that I felt indisposed,
                            &amp;c. The culmination of that indisposition was in a serious
                            illness, an attack of Erysipelas, which prostrated me, and brought me
                            "nigh unto death." I am slowly recovering, and am only able to walk
                            about a little , at present.</p>
                        <p> Through the instrumentality of kind nurses, and good medical aid, I am
                            again on the safe road to health, and enjoyment.</p>
                        <p> During the interval that has elapsed since the 1st of the month, there
                            has little of any consequence transpired.</p>
                        <p> The 23<hi rend="super">rd</hi> Reg't has again been supplied with tents,
                            better than the former ones. Our camp is now about a mile from the old
                            camp, from which we moved on the 15<hi rend="super">th.</hi></p>
                        <p> Four "companies of the 23<hi rend="super">rd</hi> (B, D, H, G,) are
                            stationed at Pack's Ferry on New River, about 20 miles from here, as a
                            guard.</p>
                        <p> No movement of consequence has taken place amongst any of Gen. Cox's
                            forces.</p>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0092" n="81"/>
                        <p> Since we have been in Camp Jones, the weather has been deliciously cool
                            for this season of the year, insomuch that, at times, to an invalid like
                            myself, an overcoat does not feel or seem superfluous or uncomfortable.
                            The word cool is too mild an adjective to apply to the nights, for they
                            are really cold. A cool, pleasant, and almost constant breeze from the
                            South fans our camp day after day.</p>
                        <p> It would seem singular that anything so conciliatory and agreeable to us
                            should emanate from the direction named, where it is supposed that
                            nothing but that which is of a fiery nature generates or is cultivated.
                            Whether, indeed, the Southern Confederacy properly belongs to the North
                            Temperate Zone is a question in my mind which would be better be
                            submitted to the decision of Greely, Phillips, &amp;c. With due
                            deference to the opinions of those men, I express my own in advance,
                            although not intending to form a public sentiment or prejudice; <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000004402_0093" n="82"/> (rather egotistical this
                            latter, but I trust that under the circumstances it is pardonable, as I
                            contend that one <hi rend="underline">must</hi> be indulged in a little
                            playful pleasantry sometimes, for "A little nonsense now and then, Is
                            relished by the best of men;") that, according to my notion of "the
                            eternal fitness of things," the proper location of the Southern
                            Confederacy would be in the Torrid Zone, somewhere near the equator, and
                            to be a dependent colony on the coast of Africa, or, if the warmth is
                            too mild there, another place can be found for it much hotter, whose
                            proprietor, unless I err greatly, has a heavy mortgage on the rotten
                            concern, which will be foreclosed before long. The imagination of the
                            least astute can conjecture what I who I mean, without my saying so in
                            so many plain words.</p>
                        <p> But I was speaking of our camp. Without becoming enthusiastic, I can say
                            it is a splendid location, the only <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0094"
                                n="83"/> drawback to a full enjoyment of camp life, or a realization
                            of its pleasures, being, a scarcity of good water. A draught of that
                            pure element whose name is synonymous with the term health, is far
                            better than sparkling Champagne or Catawba, or delusive Cogniac.</p>
                        <p> From the 'ridge' upon which we are camped, we can look away to the South
                            and view the most sp<!--[l]-->endid scenery, of hills and dales, of
                            mountains and forests, enough to enliven the heart of the most
                            sorrow-stricken and misanthropic, and awaken in all a feeling of awe and
                            veneration of Him who "said, and it was done." The disbeliever to view
                            all these wonderful works of Nature, and then not acknowledge the
                            Author, is indeed self-willed. To the farthest extreme, a range of
                            mountains can be seen, almost cloud-capped, over which is ever hovering
                            a sky-blue haze, seemingly like an eagle in his eyrie; a most
                            picturesque &amp; enchanting scene.</p>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0095" n="84"/>
                        <p> The 'lover of Nature' could here feast him= =self on its beauties, and
                            find a prolific source for reflection, and this would also be an almost
                            unexceptional place for one to rusticate during the "heated term", as we
                            have evidence; from the fact that "Army Correspondents" almost
                            everywhere complain of the intolerably warm weather, and particularly
                            those writing from the "Army of the Potomac." Surely, many men will
                            suffer before Richmond is reached, from warm weather and the still <hi
                                rend="underline">warmer unwelcomes</hi> of the enemy. Much human
                            misery has already been caused by the series of battles beginning with
                            the siege of Yorktown, and much more will ensue from the battle that
                            inevitably will occur yet before Richmond.</p>
                        <p> If we but descend the mountain from our present elevated position, a
                            great difference is felt in the temperature, enough to sensibly affect
                            one unused to <add hand="author" place="top">the heat</add> it this
                            summer. The health of the troops is generally good, no cases of an

                        <p> An alarm was raised in camp today by some teamsters coming into camp
                            with the report that the enemy was coming. For some time, it has been
                            the custom of the Quartermaster to send the horses out of camp in charge
                            of the teamsters to pasture. Today they were about four miles from camp,
                            when a woman came to them apparently in great alarm, and informed them
                            that the Secesh Cavalry was coming upon them. The teamsters being
                            warned, and otherwise unprepared to encounter a foe, fled precipitately
                            towards camp with the intelligence the woman had communicated, and hence
                            the alarm. Two companies of the 23<hi rend="super">rd.</hi> Reg't, O
                            &amp; H, were immediately sent out, although the report obtained
                            little credence, nevertheless, it was deemed best to be on the alert,
                            for such a thing as reported was possible, and, it might be, probable.
                            The Companies returned about dusk, having ascertained that the whole
                            thing was a hoax. originating with the woman, motive unknown. </p>

                        <p>For a few days past, I have been taking horse= =back rides into the
                            country, which tends to invigorating my debilitated powers. Have mixed
                            with the inhabitants a little, and have been kindly used by them. There
                            are a few excellent people in Virginia, kind, hospitable, courteous, and
                            affable. I have always supposed, from representations made by others
                            before my <hi rend="underline">residence</hi> here, that hospitality was
                            a cardinal virtue amongst, and so regarded by all Virginians, but, from
                            past experience, I am led to believe that it exists, at present, only
                            amongst a few. Whether the generality of them are impelled to this
                            course by poverty or not, I cannot say, but either such is the fact, or
                            else they are naturally inhospitable.</p>
                        <p> Although late in the season for other localities, vegetables have been
                            introduced here but recently, as fit for use. Wild strawberries are
                            plentiful, and are quite palatable.</p>
                        <p> The weather still continues pleasant and mild. Here on Flat Top it is

                        <p> The month closes today, and with it half the year of our Lord, 1862. Six
                            months of time fraught with great events in our distracted country,
                            hopeful ones, at first, seemingly; but now, not so well. This period of
                            time was predicted to witness the close of this accursed rebellion, but
                            that period of peace appears as far distant as it did six months ago.
                            The slow and cautious advance of McClellan toward Richmond is looked
                            upon with almost breathless interest by the whole country as though the
                            downfall of Richmond, that nest of treason, betokened the redemption of
                            our country. If McClellan is successful, the effect will unquestionably
                            be great. But there are many almost insurmountable obstacles in the way,
                            and it is a matter of regret that the young chieftain has many opponents
                            to his system, amongst those who should be his warm advocates, but who
                            suppose their <add hand="author" place="top">military</add> knowledge
                            obtained in a year, to be greater than that of one who has made it a

                        <p> The glorious 4<hi rend="super">th</hi> has made its annual return; but
                            less glorious than it was in its pristine purity. How oft in bygone
                            years we hailed with rejoicings this anniversary of American
                            Independence; with what unalloyed gladness we celebrated it in a
                            thousand and one places all over our glorious country. Hoary=headed
                            sires and white= haired infants congregated together this one day out of
                            three hundred and sixty=five, to demonstrate by their presence their
                            love of country. The little boy who is so filled with patriotism and
                            enthusiasm that he can scarcely express it, knows why we hold in
                            reverence this day, almost equal to the holy Sabbath, although he can
                            scarcely carry the book which tells him all about it.</p>
                        <p> In gloomy contrast with what once was, let us contemplate what now is
                            the condition of affairs in our country. All are well aware of the <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000004402_0100" n="89"/> dist struggle now going on
                            between different sections of a once united nation. The sword, instead
                            of peaceful debate and logic has been made the arbitrament of a few
                            political differences. Generals have been substituted for statesmen, but
                            these, of course, can do nothing without the assistance of the populace,
                            who, knowing the justness of our cause, and comprehending the greatness
                            of our peril, have nobly responded to their country's call whenever
                            made. Upon this continent we now have two great armies arrayed in
                            hostile attitude, and contending for a mastery; one to assert the
                            supremacy of the National Constitution to <add hand="author" place="top"
                                >over</add> those of a State, and a consequent filial regard for the
                            National instrument, no matter what a local law may teach them. Upon a
                            different basis, the other army <del hand="author">

                            </del> professes to be based, deluding themselves with the idea that the

                                entity="DSSR_000004402_0101" n="90"/> I will not longer indulge in
                            these general features at present; enough to know that the contrast
                            between now and former times is indeed painful. How others are spending
                            the day, I know not, but those in camp here experience a dull time. This
                            evening, however; through the agency of some of the boys of Co. A, a
                            dance was gotten up, and was kept up until late bed-time, an arbor being
                            constructed of green boughs for the purpose. Numbers right merrily
                            joined in, and tripped the light fantastic toe "over the velvety carpet

                            Plenty of good music could be had for the asking, any quantity of the
                            sterner sex, but none of the other part of creation, gentle woman. How
                            dull, how uninteresting is every place without her presence to charm,
                                <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0102" n="91"/> her smiles to gladden, her
                            beauty to adorn, her devotion to animate. To speak of practical affairs,
                            how useful to cook your victuals, mend your clothes, and a thousand
                            other things, which you prefer to let go undone because of apparent
                            insignificance, and suffer inconveniences there from; and how neatly,
                            quickly and systematically done. To deprive us of woman's society, we
                            are too much like the odd half of a pair of shears, or a knife without a
                            fork. ~ And while we are contending for this Union of States, let us
                            bear in mind with what intense interest our actions are regarded by the
                            hundreds and thousands of blue, and hazel, and soft brown eyes possessed
                            by the loyal fair maidens of the land. Let us hope, too, that with the
                            restoration of this Union, and our return home, another happy Union may
                            await each and every one of us, as it most assuredly will, if we but
                            denisan <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0103" n="92"/> ourselves properly.
                            Were it not for the encouragement we receive from fair ones at home,
                            accompanied with advices and solicitous fears as to our safety and wel=
                            =fare, the army would be much less effective. Those who have so
                            strenuously excited themselves to provide for the sick and wounded of
                            our army, will be remembered for generations, and posterity will look
                            back with pride upon the maidens and matrons of our day.</p>
                        <p> But I commenced with the 4th of July, and here I am wandering off into
                            distant regions, and talking upon all sorts of subjects as they occur to
                            my mind.</p>
                        <p> Well, let this suffice for this 4th. but hope another may find us in the
                            enjoyment of peace, and plenty, that enemies may become friends, that
                            the sword may be turned into the plowshare, and the spear into the

                        <p> Having thought a visit to Pack's Ferry, where four companies of the 23rd
                            are stationed, might be of advantage, I started this morning in an
                            ambulance, and reached this place this evening, traveling today about
                            twenty miles over roads that might be better, and the sun beating down
                            unmercifully. I am staying with a Mr. Upton, an old Union citizen who
                            has resided here a number of years. This Jumping Branch is the same
                            place that witnessed such a grand 'skedaddle' of 'secesh' last February,
                            at the approach of a greatly inferior force of our men. This subject is
                            mentioned on Page 31 of this book, and I will not enter into a

                        <p> One of the horses attached to the ambulance in which I was yesterday
                            riding, having suddenly taken sick after we had stopped last evening,
                            and died in the night, I was obliged to trudge my way from Jumping
                            Branch here this morning, distance seven miles, over a very good road,
                            but really a hot, sultry morning. This Ferry is one of the principal
                            ones across New River, and is named after Mr. Pack, who first
                            established a crossing here many years ago. When Floyd retreated from
                            Cotton Mountain last November, he diverged from the main road at Shady
                            Springs, and crossed the river at this place, which is about 200 yards
                            wide, and deeper and less rapid than in most places. A prominent
                            characteristic of this stream is its rapid flow, the numerous rocks
                            roughly strewn over the bed of the stream, and rising in many places
                            above the surface, and its transparent, clear, pure waters. <pb

                            this point, they have opened up communication with Monroe county, on the

                            does not descend, only to describe the arc of a circle. The boat was

                            the same, have been subjects of some concern for some time. It was
                            decided to remove to some point where water was better and more
                            abundant, and, after searching, it was settled that we encamp some two
                            miles east of Jumping Branch, and 15 miles from here, where the supply
                            of the best of water was greater than the demand. The Reg't. marched

                            general health of @ camp, Diarrhoea, had become so marked, as to attract
                            more than usual attention as to the cause productive of such undesirable
                            results. The location of our camp is gen= -erally conceded to be a
                            healthy one, and the water we use is most excellent. Our supply of
                            palatable food seems to be ample, of course, consisting only of the
                            regular army diet, but yet, this properly cooked, affords wholesome and
                            nutritious edibles, such as an epicure might not fancy, but he who seeks
                            after the substantials of life might.</p>
                        <p> It is well known though, that, at this season of the year, vegetable
                            productions come in vogue, and if they can be had they are much sought
                            after, as, from continual confinement to one diet for months; a change
                            to something fresh and sweet, would be most welcome. The trouble is,
                            that, after so long an isolation, the attempt to govern or restrain
                            one's self when <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0111" n="100"/> when we have
                            gone as far as prudence would recommend, is difficult or futile. I think
                            that is this latter fact may be found the cause of the prevailing
                            Diarrhoea; an over= =indulgence in eating food to which we are not
                            accustomed. There are no alarming cases, but a great many are of such a
                            nature as to deter them from performing the usual duties incumbent on @
                            soldier; and to prove @ source of annoyance both to themselves and the
                            Surgeons.</p>
                        <p> Vegetables and fruit are rarities in this community; the former, from
                            the fact that a large proportion of the people have left the country,
                            and what are left raise little more than enough for themselves: the
                            latter, because but little attention was ever paid to the culture of
                            fruit trees, in this country, so that there is now but little fruit, and
                            that very inferior. Spontaneous productions, such as blackberries and
                            whortleberries, abound in profusion, and of the largest kind and most
                            luscious quality. These are a common product of Western Virginia.</p>

                        <p> From the length of time intervening between each entry of this diary for
                            the past month, and the uninteresting contents therein, the inference is
                            easily drawn that but little noteworthy, has transpired h with us of
                            late. A general calm <add hand="author" place="top">has</add> prevailed
                            in our pleasant little community lately, and nought has occurred to
                            disturb the monotony, and dispel that spirit of <hi rend="underline"
                                >ennui</hi> which is an unfailing companion when the mind is
                            unoccupied.</p>
                        <p> This evening a man was brought to the Hospital, having received a
                            contusion in the face, from having a horse, which he was riding, fall
                            upon him, it being shot by a concealed foe, supposed to be some
                            bushwhackers. This man belongs to a company of the 2<hi rend="super"
                            >nd.</hi> Va. Cavalry, stationed a couple of miles from here on the Blue
                            Stone road, as an outpost. This has occasioned some little <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000004402_0113" n="102"/> excitement and bustle amongst
                            the soldiers, and there is some speculation as to what "coming events"
                            might be, as they are said to "cast their shadows before," the shadows,
                            in this case, being @ little more than usual preparation and precaution.
                            Rumors may not always be lies, and it may be, that some venturesome and
                            enterprising represent= =tatives of Secession are somewhere in our
                            vicinity. There are undoubtedly guerillas about, and there may be a
                            force of the enemy not far from us. It is known that Gen. Heath's
                                Brigade<ref n="14" target="n14">{14}</ref> is in Monroe county, within
                            a days march of us, but not in sufficient force to attack us in open
                            fight, though abundantly able to retard our advance South, with the
                            force now on Flat Top.</p>
                        <p> This little bit of excitement has a rather salutary effect, in arousing
                            many from an apathy, into which we could not help fall, when quiet
                            reigned supreme.</p>

                        <p> A sad event took place a while before sunset this evening, the death of
                            a young man, Frank Burrell, from Diarrhoea, it being, of short duration.
                            He had been in Hospital but a few days.</p>
                        <p> I am told he leaves a young wife and child in Ohio to mourn his loss.
                            How many like her have mourned the death of beloved ones far away, who
                            have pined away in camp, or have been stricken down on the battle-field,
                            when in the prime of life. These are some of the mournful results of
                            this accursed and unnatural war.</p>
                        <p> The Diarrhoea is not so bad in camp as some days ago, gradually on the
                            wane.</p>

                        <p> This morning everything presented an unusual appearance. Horses were in
                            harness, as though a move was to be made, although no orders were
                            received so to do. This did not long remain an unexplained mystery. The
                            booming of artillery in the direction of Pack's Ferry, indicated that
                            something had broken loose in that hitherto quiet region. Under the
                            circumstances, it seemed prudent to be on the alert here, and thus may
                            be explained the unusual appearance of things in general.</p>
                        <p> The cause of the cannonading, at Pack's Ferry, has since been learned. A
                            detachment of rebels advanced last night to Pack's Ferry, on the
                            opposite bank from where our men were encamped, and this morning opened
                            fire with musketry and artillery on our men, before they were aware of
                            the presence of the rebels. The exposed <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0116"
                                n="105"/> situation of the encampment, made it necessary for our men
                            to fall back a short distance under cover, a cannonading being kept up
                            on both sides during the fore= =noon. The only damage done our men, was
                            a few perforations in some of the tents, (which had been left standing,)
                            materially aiding in ventilation. The rebels withdrew, and proceeded
                            back up the river in the afternoon. What their object was, in not known.
                            Our men occupy their old encampment to- -night.</p>
                        <p> An accident occurred today which well nigh proved of fatal termination.
                            An apple-tree was struck with lightning, the electric
                            <unclear>fluid</unclear> following the roots which ran under the tent,
                            being attracted thither by the metallic substances inside, took effect
                            on half @ dozen or more persons inside, stunning them so completely,
                            that two of them were dragged out for dead. <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000004402_0117" n="106"/> Fortunately, all will get
                            over it, although it appears miraculous, that any should have escaped.
                            Some two or three, had cartridge-boxes torn to pieces, and the contents
                            (40 rounds cartridges,) burned up, with no other damage to the
                            individual than a bruise or burn.</p>
                        <p> A slight rain this evening, cooled the air, and made it much more
                            pleasant.</p>

                        <p> Now that some hours have elapsed since the excitement of yesterday, and
                            it having subsided effectually, and given us sufficient time for mature
                            consideration as to the designs of the rebels in their attack on Pack's
                            Ferry yesterday, it is generally supposed that their object was twofold,
                            that of destroying the ferry-boat at Pack's Ferry, and also of drawing
                            our attention from other points which they might make demonstrations
                            against, if they were thought to be insuffi= =ciently guarded. They
                            partly accomplished <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0118" n="107"/> their
                            mission, that of the destruction of the ferry=boat, which our own men
                            sunk to prevent falling into the hands of the rebels when our forces
                            retired from the river bank. The perceptions of our own officers, was
                            sufficiently acute to see that our little force at Pack's Ferry and
                            vicinity was amply provided for the reception of those of the enemy who
                            had as yet made their appearance, and to provide for emergencies, the
                                30<hi rend="super">th</hi> O. V. I. was ordered to our support from
                            Flat Top, this latter without materially weakening the forces or the
                            points guarded. The 30<hi rend="super">th</hi>, after coming as far as
                            Jumping Branch, was ordered back, they being no longer needed.</p>

                            finely, one of the worst cases having reported for duty this morning.

                        <p> An expedition was set on foot yesterday, consisting of @ portion of the
                                23<hi rend="super">rd.</hi> Reg't, and about 20 of Gillmore's
                            cavalry, all under command of Capt. Drake, for the purpose of destroying
                            @ salt manufactory on or near New river on the east side, in Monroe
                            County.</p>
                        <p> It was hazardous for a small force to undertake such a project, but they
                            did so, and were successful to the extent desired or intended. The
                            distance from this camp, is probably not less than 26 miles, over such
                            roads as Western Virginia alone can boast. The infantry, of course, were
                            not intended to march this distance in the short time set apart for the
                            accomplishment of our purpose, (less than 24 hours,) but only to proceed
                            a portion of the way, and act as @ support to the cavalry, should they,
                            in the prosecution of their designs, bring <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000004402_0120" n="109"/> on an engagement, or be
                            likely to get into difficulty. The infantry marched over half the
                            distance, when they were halted, and the cavalry pushed forward rap=
                            =idly; this, be it understood, after night, after the hour when it is
                            supposed all honest men in civil life, should be in bed. A little after
                            midnight, our little band of cavalry hove in view of the salt works,
                            rendered con= =spicious by its being in full blast, and every building
                            illuminated. Knowing that every moment was precious, they thundered up
                            the stony road, but, on their approach, the workmen all fled, and when
                            our boys arrived, not a man was visible, neither workmen nor guard, if
                            any, as was supposed, all having gone, not "on the order of their going,
                            but at once," being deceived, no doubt, into the belief that a large
                            force was attempting to surprise them, from the noise made in their
                            approach. <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0121" n="110"/> Finding no
                            immediate resistance, half the men dismounted, and forthwith bent their
                            exertions to the work of destruction <ref n="15" target="n15">{15}</ref>,
                            which could only be accomplished by considerable manual exertion. The
                            powerful engine used to work the machinery, and then at high speed, was
                            assigned to Serg't McVey of the Cavalry, he fully understanding engine=
                            =ering, while the rest, in all haste, gathered all the inflammable ma=
                            =terial at hand, and piled against the four buildings used for the salt
                            works, for the purpose of rendering certain their destruction, as, from
                            long usage, all the timbers had become so saturated with salt as not to
                            readily ignite. In thirty minutes the whole concern was in a blaze, our
                            boys having carried out their scheme thus far uninterruptedly, when they
                            re= =tired from the vicinity of the bright-blaze, and from their
                            unobserved position <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0122" n="111"/> had the
                            satisfaction of seeing one concern which afforded material aid &amp;
                            comfort to the rebels, crumble to atoms.</p>
                        <p> Without long delaying, they started on their return. They were not
                            destined, however, to get back without a morn= =ing salutation from
                            bushwhackers. A little after daylight this morning, as they were riding
                            along leisurely, the sharp crack of a number of rifles aroused them from
                            the lethargy into which they may have fallen from loss of sleep.
                            Fortunately, however, no other damage was done than the wounding very
                            badly of three very good cavalry horses.</p>
                        <p> The cavalry having rejoined the infantry, they all moved back to camp
                            this forenoon, many of the men and all the horses much exhausted from
                            their arduous march, loss of sleep, and over-exertion; but rendering
                            full satisfaction to our commander. <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0123"

                            property of disloyal citizens as would be beneficial to the Army, in

                            accompanied by Capt. Gilmore with a small body of cavalry. In pursuance
                            with instructions from the Commander of this Regiment, Capt. Drake
                            entered the border of Boone County, the second day out, and proceeded to

                            was obtained would, at the end of the war, furnish good evidence of his

                            were entirely successful, although Tho. Caldwell loses considerable
                            personal property, but he preferred living in peace to uncertainty. He

                        <p> This evening, all is bustle and confusion. Orders have been received to
                            march early in the morning, and all are active and busy with prepara=
                            =tions. Camp fires shine bright, cooks are busy preparing rations, and
                            the men are chatting and surmising as to the designs of the projected
                            move, &amp; where we are going, some supposing we are going no great
                            distance, but by far the greater seeming to incline to the opinion that
                            we are destined for some point on the Potomac, or probably to be
                            consolidated with the "Grand Army of Potomac." Such a picture as can be
                            seen here tonight without cost, our friends at home would pay a price
                            for a view of. But a frequent ex= =perience with such sights and scenes,
                            has rendered them less impressive than formerly. There is romance about
                            this, but stern reality soon wears off the gilding.</p>
                        <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0126" n="115"/>
                        <p> It is probable, from indications, that we are going somewhere into more
                            active service than we have seen this summer. The fact is, we have been
                            playing soldier for months, and have seen easy times, much better than
                            we may see in the army soon again. We have had the advantage of good
                            camps, good water, sufficient protection from inclement weather, and
                            light duty for nearly three months uninterruptedly, with scarcely a
                            noticeable event to break the monotony. Besides, we have not been
                            discommoded by a large body of troops crowding us, but we have had
                            plenty of room. Active service is what all have been sighing for, for
                            weeks, they may now get their satisfaction. But how fervently we hope
                            that the necessity for this army may not much longer exist.</p>

                        <p> Reveille beat at an unusually early hour this morning, and we were all
                            obliged to "turn out" long before day, and prepare for our march. At
                            daybreak, we were on the move, the detachment at Pack's Ferry forming a
                            junction with us on the main road. Soon after starting, rain commenced
                            falling, which was all very well, had it not continued until we were
                            pretty thor= =oughly drenched. However, on these hot August days, it is
                            preferable to have rain-water dropping, than to be swimming in
                            perspiration. At Shady Springs we joined the Flat Top force, and halted
                            for dinner. Without incident worthy of note, we reached Raleigh about an
                            hour before sundown, and camped a mile north of town, traveling 20 miles
                            today. Everything looks quite familiar.</p>

                        <p> This evening we encamp on the borders of Fayetteville, where last winter
                            we spent many a day floundering about in the mud and water, which, I
                            might remark, is peculiar to Western Va., at that season of the year,
                            and, I might also say, like bushwhackers, apparently indigenous. Thank
                            fortune, we are spared some of the disagreeable scenes of last winter.
                            But today was an excessively severe march upon all. A march of
                            twenty-four miles on a day as hot as August generally affords, is a task
                            which few have any inclin= =ation to accomplish in twelve hours, but it
                            was well performed today, but few straggling, and those falling back
                            from sheer exhaustion. Last night was cold and chilly, and tonight
                            promises to be the same. Such a wide difference in the temperature of
                            day and night, is extremely disagreeable at best, but, now <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000004402_0129" n="118"/> that we are obliged to sleep
                            exposed at night, it is much more so.</p>
                        <p> Huddled together in as small a compass as possible in order to
                            discommode every one to the greatest extent (so supposed,) and in as
                            mean and inconvenient a camp as could be selected, the men are busily
                            preparing their suppers, or laying down to snatch a few hours' repose as
                            best they can. All will soon be hushed in silent and peaceful slumber,
                            the blue and overarching canopy above, dotted here and there with stars
                            and constellations, being our covering.</p>
                        <p> What an impressive scene is this, and what a subject for the poet. How
                            suggestive of thought and speculation as to what may be the destinies of
                            those by whom we are surrounded, and, what ones, of all these robust,
                            brave men, may soon sleep the "sleep that knows no waking," and render
                            "earth unto earth, and dust unto dust." These are solemn <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000004402_0130" n="119"/> thoughts, and although
                            unpleasant ones, they will suggest themselves continually, despite our
                            exertions to the contrary, as <add hand="author" place="top">we</add>
                            sit by the bright camp fire and meditate upon things past and present,
                            and upon the uncertain future. How fleeting, how much in doubt is this
                            which is called life. We abide but temporarily here, a few more years,
                            and the clods of the valley will cover us all.</p>
                        <p> An accident occurred in camp about sundown this evening, which, it is
                            singular, was not much more serious. As it was, a man of Co. A, was
                            slightly wounded in the shoulder with a musket-ball. A gun in one of the
                            stacks went off by some means, and, by some singular turn of affairs,
                            did not result in anything serious. The men were all huddled together
                            like sheep, as before stated, and, indeed, we have cause for
                            congratulation that it <add hand="author" place="top">did</add> not
                            result more seriously.</p>

                        <p> This morning was but a repetition of the two previous ones, reveille
                            long before day, a lighting of camp fires, a bustle, hurry, and
                            confusion, a general shaking off of drowsiness, that had just had time
                            to creep upon us so securely. The fabled God, Morpheus has centered upon
                            her the affections of all in camp at this time, but few there are who
                            have a chance to court her favors, with any degree of satisfaction.
                            Daybreak found us on the road, and we reached the summit of Cotton
                            Mountain before the heat became oppressive. The ascent of this mountain
                            is difficult, but, as we had the cool of the morning for it, the task
                            was easier. Before noon, we struck the river, and down its banks we
                            traveled eleven miles, under the influence of a broiling sun, the steep
                            hills on either side shutting out the air, so that no breeze fans <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000004402_0132" n="121"/> us, but we go plodding along
                            at mid= =day, literally roasting with heat. At 3 o'clock P.M. we reached
                            this place, and encamped. The village, or what passes as such, is on the
                            opposite (north) bank of the Kanawha. From the fact that considerable
                            Cannel coal is dug, and exported from here, this village is named
                            Cannellton. This place is above the head of navigation, at low stages of
                            water, but, when the river is up, boats can run above some six or eight
                            miles. At present, navigation for ordinary boats ceases at Camp Piatt,
                            nearly 20 miles below.</p>
                        <p> Soon after our arrival in camp, some of the soldiers observed on the
                            river bank, two or three barrels, which, upon being opened, proved to be
                            excellent hams. A general rush, and seizure of the prize, was made,
                            despite all fear of authority or law. This proved a windfall for us, in
                            our hungry state. We marched, today, some 23 miles.</p>

                        <p> We left Cannellton long before day this morning, so that, by daylight,
                            we had reached Clifton, six miles down the river. Thus far, we had stood
                            the mornings march remarkably well, but, as the day advanced, the heat,
                            becoming more oppressive, began to tell upon all, although our pace was
                            not slackened. But this hard march, under the circumstances had become
                            so toilsome, that all were bound to admit they could not endure this
                            much longer. A little after noon we reached this place, fatigued,
                            footsore and almost worn out. The distance marched today (18 miles) with
                            the previous three days march, makes 85 miles in three and one-half
                            days, and as hot days as there are in August generally. This, we cannot
                            but regard as a remark= =able march, and are vain enough to believe that
                            unbiased persons will coincide with us. Be that as it may, we have
                            performed the task, and are glad it is over with.</p>

                        <p>Quite a number of steamboats are laying here for our transportation.
                            Troops are constantly embarking, and baggage is being loaded as rapidly
                            as possible. It is supposed that we leave this evening, or early in the
                            morning. I should have stated that a portion of Col. Crook's force
                            joined us here, coming down the river on the north bank, they having
                            been laying at Meadow Bluffs, near Lewisburg, Greenbrier Co., all
                            summer. It might be in place here to state what troops are left in our
                            rear at the head of the Kanawha Valley, for it's protection, for the
                            acquisition of this same valley will furnish great and to the rebels, in

                            Fayetteville is but lightly garrisoned, but has excellent fortifications

                            reason, Cos. H, I, V &amp; K, did not leave until about six or seven
                            this morning. We all embarked on the steamer "Henry Logan," which,

                        <p> At 4 P.M. yesterday we had arrived at the mouth of the Great Kanawha,
                            and for the first time in months, and to some for more than a year, our
                            eyes viewed the soil of our native State, the glorious Ohio. As the
                            "Logan" rounded to at Point Pleasant, and commenced ploughing the waters
                            of the Ohio, a loud cheer broke the silence, coming spontaneously from
                            the soldiers on board, who felt that the occasion was certainly an epoch
                            in their lives. An hour or so after entering the Ohio, we neared
                            Pomeroy, the county-seat of Meigs Co., Ohio. On touching at the wharf,
                            we were greeted with hurrahs and cheers, together with more substantial
                            proofs of kindness and patriotism; a shower of cakes, pies, and fruit,
                            miscellaneously thrown amongst us. This, the gift of the good people of
                            Pomeroy to entire strangers, is regarded as an earnest of their
                            patriotism &amp; loyalty. The incident has made an impress <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000004402_0138" n="127"/> upon all concerned, which
                            will not soon be forgotten, nor can we speak of the citizens of Pomeroy
                            without awakening pleasant thoughts in the minds of those, who were
                            recipients of the edibles, and had such kindness shown them by the
                            Pomeroy people. We will not soon forget such. Long may they live, and
                            happily.</p>
                        <p> At dark, we left Pomeroy, and proceeded gradually up the river, and a
                            short time after night we 'tied up,' as it was said the river was so low
                            in places as to be difficult of passage, even with the aid of daylight.
                            At dawn this morn= =ing we were again on the way, but had proceeded but
                            a short distance before we were compelled to lighten the boat in order
                            that she might pass over the shoals opposite here. As a matter of
                            course, this was done by the soldiers getting off, and going above on
                            foot. It being difficult for the boat to pass over, we had plenty <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000004402_0139" n="128"/> of time to stroll about this
                            pretty little village, and converse with the denizens, who were quite
                            friendly and communicative. They gave many of us excellent breakfasts,
                            and uniformly treated us kindly. Such manifestations of kindness will
                            touch the heart and feelings of the roughest Soldier, as they do. How
                            often have I heard the contrast drawn by numbers that within a day or
                            two past we have been the recipients of more kindness than in our whole
                            Western Va., campaign, from Western Virginians.</p>

                        <p> We proceeded slowly today in consequence of the low stage of the water.
                            Without incident of note, we gained this point about the middle of the
                            afternoon. At Buffington's Island, a short distance below, there are a
                            number of boats endeavoring to come up. It will require time and labor
                            to succeed. Most of the citizens here are very kind, <del hand="author">

                        <p> At 10 A.M. we left Portland, our boat having but just worked over the
                            shallow water at Buffington's Island. The citizens of Portland and
                            vicinity showed us great generosity, and proved their friendship for a
                            needy soldier, as most of us, by the remissness of the Paymaster were
                            minus funds, and our rations had run short, consequently we were
                            dependent, in a measure, on charity. And this quality the Portlanders
                            understood, as we had ample evidence. They have our good wishes would
                            that their kindness could be better repaid.</p>
                        <p> At 2 P.M. we reached the foot of Blennerhassett's Island, six miles from
                            here. Here we were obliged to land, and <del hand="author">
                                <hi rend="line-through">obliged</hi>
                            </del> march to Parkersburg. The road was dusty, and weather hot, but we
                            were in Ohio, and that helped the matter, as the change from Western
                            Virginia hills, hovels, and interminable forests, to which we have so
                            long been used, to Ohio's fine farms and residences, would certainly be
                            a remedy. <pb entity="DSSR_000004402_0141" n="130"/> On page 17. of this

                            <add hand="author" place="top">walk</add> up the river, we stopped at a
                            fine country mansion, and were <add hand="author" place="top">by the
                                proprietor</add> invited into his orchard and house, where we
                            received a cold lunch, which was gratefully received, and plenty of
                            rich, ripe peaches we got for the picking. As we were about leaving, it
                            was announced that we had been treated so generously just then by Wm.
                            Pitt. Putnam, a grandson of Old Israel Putnam, of revolutionary memory.
                            It was proposed that we give three cheers for this patriotic descendent
                            of @ patriot, which was heartily responded to, when three more were
                            given for the ladies of the house. The only brother of Mr. Putnam is @
                            colonel in the Confederate army, but this gentleman is a staunch
                            Unionist. What a dark phase is this, in this unhappy war. But friendship
                            and the ties of consanguinity are nothing to country; our country before
                            our friends.</p>

                        <p> At six P.M. we crossed the Ohio River to Parkersburgh, and marched
                            through it over a mile to a grove out of town where we encamped for the
                            night. This morning, on taking a walk through town and looking around a
                            little, I came to the conclusion that my opinion of Parkersburg, as
                            expressed on Page 17 was wrong; that it is quite a considerable of a
                            town, and has not obtained a notoriety solely from it being the terminus
                            of the N.W. branch of the Balto. &amp; O. R. R. The town is well
                            built, and considerable business is transacted. But many of the people
                            are Secession sympathizers, as can easily be seen, but, fortunately they
                            control nothing.</p>
                        <p> Preparations are going forward for our departure. We will embark on the
                            cars towards evening. Troops are leaving as fast as cars can be
                            procured. - Many of the Soldiers proved superior to martial law today,
                            by getting whisky, despite orders to the contry <!--[contrary]-->, and
                            are exceedingly patriotic &amp; jubilant in consequence.</p>

                            to the Parkersburg depot, and 'shipped' on board a freight train. I say
                            'shipped,' for we were assigned to certain <add hand="author"
                                place="top">cars</add> with so many occupants to a car, similar to
                            carring stock. Rough seats were made for us, but sleeping accomo=
                            =dations were poor. As it was, we were obliged to lay down on the floor,
                            on and under the seats, and run the risk of being tramped upon, or
                            falling off the seat. By this means, we partially obtained rest.</p>
                        <p> The cars moved off soon after our embarkation, and proceeded slowly all
                            night. This morning at daybreak we were within 14 miles of this place,
                            and about 65 from Parkersburgh. On the 27<hi rend="super">th</hi> of

                            service. From that time to the 1st of January, 1862, we got a foretaste,

                            service. Although we saw no fighting, we marched and scouted over @

                            Government buildings erected within the year, this being a depot for
                            Government supplies. Clarksburg, although small and insignificant, and
                            formerly obscure, has, like many other unimportant towns, obtained @
                            notoriety since the war commenced, on account of its position, and
                            consequent selection as a base for supplies.</p>

                        <p> We leave here the Balto. &amp; O. R.R., being within 9 miles of
                            Baltimore, its eastern terminus. We 'switch off' here at what is usually
                            called Washington Junction, and immediately cross the Patapsco, over a
                            fine arched bridge. An accident occurring at Berlin, 5 miles east of

                        <p> Yesterday afternoon, Paymaster Newell gave us a visit, and, before
                            leaving presented all of us with some "green backs," which come very
                            convenient just now.</p>
                        <p> McClellan's grand army<ref n="21" target="n21">{21}</ref>, direct from the
                            Peninsula, landed at Alexandria today, and marched out in front of town,
                            in the direction of Manassas. They look as though they had seen hard
                            service, as their thinned ranks will testify. The "Grand Army" which
                            was, six months ago, our pride and boast, comes back to us after a hard
                            summer's campaign among the malarious swamps of the Chickahominy, a mere
                            remnant; defeated, but not conquered. - In searching for some
                            acquaintances, I walked over three miles directly out of the city, and
                            camps, as thick as they could be, lined the road on either side, the
                            entire way, and as far as I could see.</p>

                        <p> We marched here today, eight miles from Alexandria. The greater part of
                            the force around Alexandria moved also, and a battle is imminent in
                            front. We passed numerous forts and defenses, all well manned, designed
                            for the protection of Washington. We are within half a mile of Munson's
                            Hill, the same distance from Hall's Church, a station of the Loudon
                            &amp; Hampshire R.R.; and between that Road &amp; the Orange and
                            Alexandria. This is famous soil now, not because it is so 'sacred", but
                            from the fact of its being disputed territory for some time, and
                            subsequently the 'base of operations' for the Army of the Potomac.</p>
                        <p> The country bears the marks of former thrift and luxury, but a vast
                            change has been effected. Hardly a fence can be found, former fine

                        <p> All day yesterday a cannonading was kept up in the direction of
                            Manassas, and in the afternoon it sounded terrible in the extreme. Hard
                            fighting took place, but who got the better of it, is not yet known. The
                            report was circulated today that Stonewall Jackson with 18,000 of his
                            men was captured, but the story sounds too incredible. Jackson is too
                            wary a fox to allow himself to be bagged so early. The report was, that
                            our forces were in his front, and rear, and that he was thus 'hemmed
                            in,' but this sounds so little like Jackson's policy, that we await a
                            confirmation of these reports before believing _</p>
                        <p> The campaign in Eastern Virginia has, thus far, been far from
                            encouraging, and what little we have gained, has been mostly abandoned
                            or retaken. Washington must have been menaced, and our army reduced to
                            straits, when we were obliged to abandon the Peninsular. What avails
                            those noble lives sacrificed in battle or by disease on the Peninsular,
                            and who is to blame for gross mismanagement?</p>

                        <p> The armies of Pope &amp; McDowell having, on Saturday been badly
                            defeated, fell back, and today arrived here and encamped. It would be
                            untruth to say they were com= =pletely demoralized, but truth demands
                            that the statement should be made that effect of bad generalship is
                            plainly perceptible throughout the ranks. Not one who has served under
                            McDowell have the least confidence in him, and his bad planning and
                            gross mistakes have become so common that the matter ought to be seen
                            to. It is reported that he is under arrest. If true, it grieves no one
                            but himself. ---Our troops fought bravely on Saturday, and on the
                            identical ground where McDowell was defeated thirteen months ago. The
                            forces engaged on our side were of the right material; conspicuous among
                            them were the broad-shouldered, hardy sons of the West, who, on more
                            than one occasion, have proved superior to vaunting Southern chivalry.
                            But the best of instruments are ineffective, when improperly <pb
                                entity="DSSR_000004402_0155" n="144"/> handled. I do not speak thus
                            to disparage the merits of troops from other portions of the country, I
                            only repeat what has almost become @ by-word.</p>
                        <p> Our forces were compelled to aban= =don the field, together with
                            hundreds of our dead and wounded, to the mercies of the foe.</p>
                        <p> The "Army of the Potomac," after a six months' arduous campaign, have
                            gained nothing, and suffered much. All the territory they have fought
                            for and won in Eastern Virginia they have had to yield, and withdraw
                            under cover of the defenses around Washington. But they have labored,
                            and have suffered. They have accomplished wonders, but all in vain, they
                            are now where they started, and in a much worse condition.</p>
                        <p> Somebody must be to blame. His own army does not condemn McClellan, but
                            is enthusiastic in his praise. He has had to contend with Northern
                            politicians as well as Southern fire-eaters. </p>
