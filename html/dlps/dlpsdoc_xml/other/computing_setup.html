<h1>Computing Setup for New Staff Members</h1>

<p>This document describes the steps needed to set up the computing
environment for new staff members in Digital Library Production
Services (DLPS), University of Virginia Library. It is intended for
use by internal DLPS staff.</p>

<a name=""><h2>Unix Environment Setup</h2></a>


<a name=""><h3>Unix Accounts</h3></a>

<ul>
<li>Request a Unix account for each new staff member. Library IT
Systems (LITS) handles the creation of accounts; they have a web form at

<a href="http://staff.lib.virginia.edu/systems/libsys/help-request.php" target="_blank">http://staff.lib.virginia.edu/systems/libsys/help-request.php</a>

for submitting such requests.

  <ul>
<li>Provide the new user's UVa computing ID (email ID)</li>
<li>Request that <code>dlpswg</code> (DLPS working group) should be
  the new user's default Unix group</li>
<li>Request that the new user get added to the <code>htaccess</code>
  permissions for web-based tools/documentation under
  <code>/www/doc/dlps/dlps-only</code> on <code>pogo.lib</code>
</li>
<li>If (and <em>only</em> if) this staff member needs to run
  the <code>dlps2ReadyRepo</code> script, then request that this user get
  added to the Unix group <code>repo</code>

  <div class="important">
<span class="important">IMPORTANT</span><p>Adding a user to <code>repo</code> grants that
  user write permissions (including delete permissions) to the entire
  repository hand-off point under <code>/cenrepo/ReadyRepo</code>.
  Only request this if you're certain it is needed. If in doubt, don't
  add the user to <code>repo</code> initially; this request can always be
  made later.</p>
</div>

  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When the account is created, LITS will notify you that the
account is ready and tell you how to proceed. Normally the first step
is to have the new user log onto <code>viva.lib</code> and change the
default password.</li>
<li>At this point the new user should be able to log into the
Library's Unix servers, including the Linux server we use for our
digital production work, <code>pogo.lib</code> (also known as
<code>alioth.lib</code>).</li>
</ul>





<a name=""><h3>Environment Variables</h3></a>

<p>To work effectively from the Unix command line, each user needs
to set a few environment variables:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have the new user log in using his/her username and
password. After login, you should be in the user's home
directory.</li>
<li>Using Jove (or some other text editor), open the user's
initialization file. Normally you'll want to edit the
<code>.variables.ksh</code> file, since <code>ksh</code> is the default
shell (command interpreter).</li>
<li>Add the following lines at the end of the initialization file:
<pre>
# add DLPS bin directory to path
PATH=/shares/admin/bin:/shares/admin/bin/text:/shares/admin/bin/image:${PATH}

# set umask to 002 to grant group write permission on new
# files/directories; this sets default permissions to 664 (rw-rw-r--)
# for new files, 775 (rwxrwxr-x) for new directories
umask 002
</pre>
</li>
<li>Save and close the initialization file.</li>
<li>Log off and then log back in (necessary for the new setup to
take effect).</li>
<li>To test the new settings, enter:

<pre>echo $PATH</pre>

You should see a colon-delimited list of paths, starting with the
paths you added to the initialization file in the preceding
step.</li>
</ul>

<a name=""><h2>Other Setup</h2></a>


<a name=""><h3>DLPS Tracking System</h3></a>

<p>Write the DLPS tracking system administrator (Greg) to request a
username and password for the tracking system.</p>
