<h1>Rimage Workflow for Batch-Reading Archival Discs</h1>

<p>This document describes the workflow for reading a batch of
archival discs using the Rimage system at Digital Library Production
Services (DLPS), University of Virginia Library. It is intended for
use by internal DLPS staff.</p>

<p>This workflow makes it possible to transfer large sets of data from
CDs or DVDs to a hard disk (or any disk or server accessible to the
Rimage PC) with minimal effort.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This documentation pertains to version
6.5 of the Rimage OfficeNet software.</p>

<hr>
<a name="d3"><h2>Set Up</h2></a>
<ul>
<li>Open the Rimage System Manager (Start → All Programs →
Rimage → Rimage System Manager).</li>
<li>Check the current setting for media type:

  <ul>
<li>Click the main <b>Settings...</b> button near the
  picture of the Rimage 2000i (or the picture of the Desktop 1500, as
  the case may be).</li>
<li>In the <b>Bins/Media</b> tab, under the
  <b>Media:</b> section, check the <b>Media type</b>
  setting. It will be set to either DVDR or CDR.</li>
<li>If the setting already corresponds to the type of discs you will
  be burning, then just click <b>OK</b>. If it doesn't, you
  <em>must</em> set it to the type of media you will be using:

    <ul>
<li>Click <b>Cancel</b> to close the settings
    window.</li>
<li>Pause the Production Server by clicking its "pause" button
    (looks like a VCR pause button with the || symbol).</li>
<li>Click the main <b>Settings...</b> button near the
    picture of the Rimage 2000i (or the picture of the Desktop 1500,
    as the case may be).</li>
<li>In the <b>Bins/Media</b> tab, under the
    <b>Media:</b> section, change the <b>Media
    type</b> setting to DVDR or CDR as appropriate.</li>
<li>Click <b>OK</b> to save the settings and close the
    settings window.</li>
<li>Click the "resume server" button for the Production Server
    (looks like a VCR play button with a green triangle).</li>
</ul>

  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pause the production server (if you haven't done so already in a
previous step) by clicking the "pause" button (looks like a VCR pause
button with the || symbol).</li>
<li>Click the <b>Settings...</b> button for the Production
Server.</li>
<li>If the <b>Server</b> and <b>Reading</b> tabs are
not visible, click the <b>More&gt;&gt;</b> button.</li>
<li>Set the following options:<br><br>

<tr>
<th>Tab</th>
<th>Option</th>
<th>Setting to use</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Server</b></td>
<td><b>Operating Mode</b></td>

<td><b>Automatic Bulk Read</b></td>

<td>This puts the Production Server in automated batch-reading
mode.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Server</b></td>
<td><b>Use FIFO mode</b></td>
<td>Checked, if disc order is relevant</td>

<td>If maintaining the original sequence of the discs is important,
check this checkbox to enable first-in-first-out (FIFO) mode, so that
the discs are output in the same order by which they were input. If
the original disc sequence is irrelevant, you can leave this checkbox
cleared to increase the overall speed of the process.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Reading</b></td>
<td><b>Base Folder for Images</b></td>

<td>Any valid path, such as <code>C:\temp</code> — though
normally you will want to use an external drive with plenty of free
disk space, typically <code>E:\</code>
</td>

<td>This is the location to which folders and files from the disc
will be copied.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Reading</b></td>
<td><b>Use Volume ID ... as Image Folder Name</b></td>

<td>Checked</td>

<td>For each disc, a new folder with the same name as the disc name
will be created to contain the folders/files from that disc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Reading</b></td>
<td><b>Extract ISO9660 Images to Folders and Files</b></td>

<td>Checked</td>

<td>As each disc is read, the data from that disc will be copied as
actual folders and files, rather than as a single large disc image
(.img) file containing the entire contents of the disc.</td>

<hr>
<a name="d4"><h2>Read Discs</h2></a>

<ul>
<li>Load the input bin with the DVDs or CDs to be read. (On the
Desktop 1500, the input bin is the one with the three prongs to hold
the discs. On the 2000i, the input bin is the left bin.)

<div class="tip">
<span class="tip">TIP</span><p>If you have enabled FIFO (first-in-first-out)
mode (see above for details), you can place the discs in the input bin
in reverse order, and when reading is complete they will be in the
desired order. For example, if you have three discs to read, put disc
1 on the bottom of the stack, disc 2 in the middle, and disc 3 on
top. Disc 3 will be picked up and read first, and placed on the ouput
spindle first. Disc2 will be output second, and disc 1 will be output
last, so that it is on top of the output stack. That way, the discs
are in the correct order at the end of the process.</p>
</div>

</li>
<li>To begin reading discs, click the "resume server" button (looks
like a VCR play button with a green triangle) for the Production
Server. The arm of the Rimage will place a disc in each of the two
CD/DVD drives and begin reading the discs.</li>
<li>While the discs are being read, you can click the
<b>Server Orders</b> tab to view the status of the current
discs, and for any error messages.</li>
<li>When all discs in the input bin have been retrieved, the Rimage
System Manager will display an error dialog saying that there are no
more discs in the input bin. If there are more discs to be read, put
them in the input bin and click <b>Retry</b>. If you're
finished, click <b>Stop Line</b>.</li>
<li>When you're finished reading all discs, return the Production
Server to its normal state:

  <ul>
<li>Click the "pause" button (looks like a VCR pause button with
  the || symbol) for the Production Server.</li>
<li>Click the <b>Server Settings...</b> button.</li>
<li>On the <b>Server</b> tab, set the <b>Operating
  Mode</b> to <b>Normal</b>. Click
  <b>OK</b>.</li>
<li>Click the "resume server" button (looks like a VCR play button
  with a green triangle).</li>
</ul>

</li>
