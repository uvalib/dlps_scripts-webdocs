<a name="d3"><h2>Quick Start</h2></a>

<p>The basic steps for making archival DVDs are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify the files to be archived</li>
<li>Set up the input bin</li>
<li>Run <code>rimage.pl</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The details for these steps are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify the files to be archived and copy them to any disk
accessible to the Rimage PC (typically the E: drive).</li>
<li>Load the input bin with new recordable DVDs (or CDs). (On the
Desktop 1500, the input bin is the one with the three prongs to hold
the discs. On the 2000i, the input bin is the left bin.)</li>
<li>Check the current setting for media type:

  <ul>
<li>Open the Rimage System Manager (Start → All Programs
  → Rimage → Rimage System Manager).</li>
<li>Click the main <b>Settings...</b> button near the
  picture of the Rimage 2000i (or the picture of the Desktop 1500, as
  the case may be).</li>
<li>In the <b>Bins/Media</b> tab, under the
  <b>Media:</b> section, check the <b>Media type</b>
  setting. It will be set to either DVDR or CDR.</li>
<li>If the setting already corresponds to the type of discs you will
  be burning, then just click <b>OK</b>. If it doesn't, you
  <em>must</em> set it to the type of media you will be using:

    <ul>
<li>Click <b>Cancel</b> to close the settings
    window.</li>
<li>Pause the Production Server by clicking its "pause" button
    (looks like a VCR pause button with the || symbol).</li>
<li>Click the main <b>Settings...</b> button near the
    picture of the Rimage 2000i (or the picture of the Desktop 1500,
    as the case may be).</li>
<li>In the <b>Bins/Media</b> tab, under the
    <b>Media:</b> section, change the <b>Media
    type</b> setting to DVDR or CDR as appropriate.</li>
<li>Click <b>OK</b> to save the settings and close the
    settings window.</li>
<li>Click the "resume server" button for the Production Server
    (looks like a VCR play button with a green triangle).</li>
</ul>

  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open a command-line window and run the
<code>rimage.pl</code> Perl script, providing the paths to the
directories to be burned to DVD:

<pre>perl C:\DLPS\rimage\rimage.pl E:\myFiles</pre>

where myFiles is a directory on disk E: containing files and/or
subdirectories to be burned to DVD.

<div class="note">
<span class="note">NOTE</span><p>Open the command-line window using Start →
Programs → Accessories → Command Prompt. If you use Start
→ Run... to run the Perl script, the window will close
automatically as soon as the script is finished running, and you will
not be able to see any final status or error messages that may have
been displayed.</p>
</div>

</li>
<li>After all discs have been burned successfully, copy the log
files to the DLPS workspace
(DLPSadministrative/03archivaldisks/rawfiles), then import the log
files into the DLPS tracking system.</li>
</ul>

<a name="d5"><h3>Rimage system</h3></a>

<p>The Rimage system (Rimage is the name of the manufacturer; see
<a href="http://www.rimage.com/" target="_blank">rimage.com</a>)
is a combination of hardware and software that facilitates
transferring large sets of data to DVD or CD media. (It also has an
auto-loader feature for reading large sets of data from existing DVDs
or CDs, but that's a different workflow.)</p>

<p>The Rimage system produces a disc by first creating a disc image (a
single file containing all of the data to be burned to disc) and then
burning that image to the media (DVD or CD disc) as many times as
necessary to produce the number of copies requested. The process of
creating the disc image is referred to as "imaging" and is handled by
the Imaging Server. The process of burning the image to one or more
discs is referred to as "production" and is handled by the Production
Server.</p>




<a name="d6"><h3>rimage.pl</h3></a>

<p>The Perl script <code>rimage.pl</code> does the work of
determining how many files will fit on a disc and how many discs are
required to encompass the entire set of files. It is not necessary to
make that determination yourself, arrange the files into any
particular directory structure, etc.</p>

<p>The only argument required by <code>rimage.pl</code> is the
path to the directory containing the files to be burned to DVD. So the
simplest way to run <code>rimage.pl</code> would be:

<pre>perl C:\DLPS\rimage\rimage.pl E:\myFiles</pre>

where myFiles is a directory on disk E: containing files and/or
subdirectories to be burned to DVD. Alternatively, the script allows
more than one directory to be specified:

<pre>perl C:\DLPS\rimage\rimage.pl E:\fileset1 E:\fileset2 E:\fileset3</pre>
</p>

<p>The script has several switches to further control how the discs
are made:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="6">
<tr>
<th>Switch</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Default</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-b</td>
<td>base ID</td>
<td>Base ID to use when determining disc ID</td>
<td>Off; defaults to the current date as a 6-digit date in yymmdd format</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-c</td>
<td>copies</td>
<td>Number of copies to make of each disc</td>
<td>2 (The default is 2 because it is standard DLPS practice to burn
2 copies of each disc and store them in separate locations.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-k</td>
<td>keep</td>
<td>Keep disc image (.img) files after producing the discs</td>
<td>Off; default is to delete each disc image when burning from that image is complete</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-l</td>
<td>label</td>
<td>Informal name of label template: allowed values are "DLPS", "FKL", "TBRC" and "THDL"</td>
<td>"DLPS" — uses the standard DLPS label template</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-m</td>
<td>media</td>
<td>Type of disc media: allowed values are "DVD" and "CD"</td>
<td>DVD (In practice, DLPS does not use CDs for archival storage.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-t</td>
<td>test</td>
<td>Report how many discs will be needed and what their IDs will be,
but do not create any editlists, log files, etc. and do not actually
burn any discs</td>
<td>Off</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-v</td>
<td>verbose</td>
<td>Display all status messages (in addition to error messages)</td>
<td>Off; only display error messages</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-I</td>
<td>imaging only</td>
<td>Only create disc images; do not produce discs</td>
<td>Off; create disc images and produce discs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-P</td>
<td>production only</td>
<td>Only produce discs from existing disc images; do not create disc images</td>
<td>Off; create disc images and produce discs from those images</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>On the command line, the switches must appear before the path
argument(s). For example:

<pre>perl C:\DLPS\rimage\rimage.pl -c 1 -v E:\fileset1</pre>

tells the script to produce only one copy of the data (one set of
discs) and to display all status messages.</p>

<p>When using the -P (production only) switch, the path argument
should be the path to the directory containing the existing disc
images to use (not the path to the original data, as would normally be
required).</p>




<a name="d7"><h3>Log files</h3></a>

<p>The <code>rimage.pl</code> script generates log files that
record important information about each disc, including a list of the
files contained on the disc. These log files are originally written to
the C: drive of the Rimage PC, but they need to be copied to the DLPS
workspace for long-term storage and also imported into the DLPS
tracking system for searching.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the DLPS workspace, go to directory
<code>DLPSadministrative/03archivaldisks/rawfiles</code>. If there is
a directory indicating the project for which these discs were created,
use that directory. Otherwise, create a new directory, and name it in
a way that indicates the project for which these discs were
created.</li>
<li>Copy the log files for the discs produced (there will be one log
file for each disc) from <code>C:\Rimage\Logs</code> on the Rimage PC to
<code>DLPSadministrative/03archivaldisks/rawfiles/<i>[subdirectory]</i></code>
where <i>[subdirectory]</i> is the directory from the
preceding step.</li>
<li>Log into the DLPS tracking system. In the navigation bar along
the left, under <b>Archival Discs</b> click <b>Import
Rimage log file</b>.</li>
<li>Using this form, import each log file. Use the
<b>Browse...</b> button to locate each log file to be
imported. In the <b>Project label</b> field, enter the name of
the directory (from the preceding step) from which you are
importing.</li>
<li>Under <b>Archival Discs</b>, click <b>Search for
archival discs</b>. Use the first part of the disc ID (which is a
six-digit date in yymmdd format) to get a list of the discs
corresponding to the log files you just imported. Make sure all log
files have been imported.</li>
</ul>
