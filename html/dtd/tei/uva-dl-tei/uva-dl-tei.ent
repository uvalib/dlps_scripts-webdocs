     Version 1.58
     2008-11-03

     One of two extension files (see also uva-dl-tei.dtd) constituting a customization of TEI P4,
     following the method described in the TEI Guidelines, chapter 29, "Modifying and Customizing
     the TEI DTD".

       http://www.tei-c.org/P4X/MD.html

     This DTD is used for initial document production (keyboarding vendor encoding and subsequent
     in-house post-keyboarding processing) by Digital Library Production Services (DLPS),
     University of Virginia Library.

     1.0.2    2003-04-14  Added TEI.dictionaries additional tagset. Changed type attribute on stage
                          element from REQUIRED to IMPLIED.
     1.0.3    2003-04-28  Changed n attribute on cb to REQUIRED.
     1.0.4    2003-05-12  Enumerated vocabulary for 'type' attribute on <head>.

     1.0.6    2003-05-23  Added "related" to enumerated values for 'type' attribute on <title>.
     1.0.7    2003-05-27  Added "divisional-title" to a.divtype; needed for composite texts, as in
                          group/text/front/div1 type="divisional-title".
     1.0.8    2003-06-26  Added "afterword" to a.divtype.
     1.0.9    2003-06-27  Changed <dateline> to allow note references and notes.
     1.0.10   2003-07-07  Added customized declarations for the %formulaContent; and
                          %formulaNotations; parameter entities to allow informal, textual
                          representation of mathematical formulae.
     1.0.11   2003-07-16  Added "series-title" to a.divtype. Added "edition", "series", and
                          "volume" to the enumerated vocabulary for attribute 'type' on <head>
                          (useful for <head> types within <div1 type="half-title">).
     1.0.12   2003-07-17  Changed datatype of 'resp' attribute from CDATA to IDREF on elements
                          <note>, <reg> (orig element has been suppressed), <sic> (already changed
                          on <corr>), and <unclear>, and on attribute class a.pointer.
     1.0.13   2003-07-22  Added "no-indent" to a.rend.indent (for use when a paragraph etc. is not
                          indented, but surrounding paragraphs are).
     1.0.14   2003-07-28  Added "series" to enumerated vocabulary for attribute 'type' on <titlePart>.
     1.0.15   2003-07-29  Added "text" to a.divtype.
     1.0.16   2003-08-01  Added "script" to enumerated vocabulary for 'rend' on <hi> (for
                          handwriting-like typefaces).
     1.0.17   2003-08-11  Added 'type' attribute to <date> with enumerated vocabulary (e.g. birth,
                          death, flourished). Changed 'certainty' attribute datatype from CDATA to
                          enumerated vocabulary.
     1.0.18   2003-08-21  Added "part" to enumerated vocabulary for attribute 'type' on <title> (to
                          correspond with MARC field 245|p, the cataloging designation for the title
                          of a part/section of a work). Added "resp" to enumerated vocabulary for
                          attribute 'type' on <titlePart> and changed it from default "main" to
                          IMPLIED. On <pb/>, removed attribute 'rend' for VENDOR.
     1.0.19   2003-08-29  No actual changes; reworked organization and presentation of modifications.
     1.0.20   2003-09-29  Restored <orig> to POSTKB mode only and changed its 'resp' attribute from
                          CDATA to IDREF.
     1.0.21   2003-10-27  Added "open" to a.rend.hi.
     1.0.22   2003-11-04  Changed content model for <figure> to allow m.chunk rather than just <p>.
     1.0.23   2003-11-11  Added new element <frontispiece>, which is a <figure> that can occur
                          within m.divtop. <figure> itself cannot be added to m.divtop because
                          doing so creates an ambiguous content model, since <figure> is allowed
                          further down in the div. Added <frontispiece> to x.divtop.
     1.0.24   2003-11-24  Added "alternate" to enumerated vocabulary for attribute 'type' on <title>.
     1.0.25   2003-12-10  Added vendor convenience elements for the types of gaps encountered when
                          encoding newspapers (Cavalier Daily project): ad, cartoon, comicStrip,
                          puzzle, wireArticle, wirePhoto (VENDOR mode only).
     1.0.26   2003-12-16  Added "uniform" to enumerated vocabulary for attribute 'type' on <title>.
                          Added to a.divtype types of divisions needed for encoding newspapers
                          (Cavalier Daily project): classifieds, ad (VENDOR only), op-ed
     1.0.27   2004-01-05  Added 'epistle' to a.divtype.
     1.1      2004-01-07  Added <byline> to content model for <figure>, for marking credits for
                          illustrations, photos, etc.
     1.2      2004-01-17  Enabled elements <add> and <del> (POSTKB only). For <add>, made attribute
                          'resp' required. For <del>, made 'resp' required and changed 'status'
                          from default value "unremarkable" to IMPLIED. Added value "desc" to
                          enumerated vocabulary for attribute 'type' on <title>.
     1.3      2004-01-20  No changes. Renamed extension files from uvalib_kb.ent and uvalib_kb.dtd
                          to uva-dl-tei.ent and uva-dl-tei.dtd to better reflect their role not only
                          as a keyboarding vendor DTD but also as the post-keyboarding DTD used for
                          the remainder of the document's lifetime (post-keyboarding processing at
                          DLPS through inclusion in the Digital Library).
     1.4      2004-01-27  Added 'figure', 'nameplate', and 'filler' to a.divtype. (These div types
                          are mainly needed for encoding newspapers: 'figure' is needed when a photo
                          between articles requires its own div; 'nameplate' is used for the main
                          heading/name of the newspaper at the top of the first page; 'filler' is
                          for a short blurb, usually enclosed enclosed in a box, that fills the end
                          of a column.) Added %m.editIncl; to the content model of <front>, <body>,
                          and <back> to allow gaps within these elements.
     1.5      2004-02-02  Added feature selection entity NEWSPAPER to allow newspaper-specific
                          parts of the DTD to be included or excluded by the document instance as
                          appropriate.
     1.6      2004-02-09  Changed content model of <figure> so that <byline> (added previously: see
                          1.1, 2004-01-07) occurs at the same level as <head>, not the level of <p>
                          and other chunk elements. This follows the example of m.divtop in div#
                          elements and is how <byline> should have been added in the first place.
                          Added feature selection entity DICTIONARY to allow dictionary-specific
                          parts of the DTD to be included or excluded by the document instance as
                          appropriate.
     1.7      2004-02-20  No substantive changes. Improved handling of feature selection switches
                          VENDOR and POSTKB, such that enabling POSTKB in document's internal
                          subset automatically disables VENDOR (so VENDOR does not have to be
                          explicitly disabled).
     1.8      2004-03-18  Added attribute 'altEntity' on <pb>, to be used in cases where page
                          images are bitonal and a grayscale or color figure image exists for a
                          full-page figure. In such a case, the bitonal page image's base filename
                          is the value of the 'entity' attribute; the color/grayscale figure image's
                          base filename is the value of the 'altEntity' attribute. Also removed
                          attribute 'rend' on <pb> for POSTKB (already had been removed for VENDOR).
     1.9      2004-03-24  Added 'ref' to a.divtype.newspaper (NEWSPAPER only); needed for isolated
                          headlines/blocks of text that refer to another section, with no
                          accompanying article.
     1.10     2004-03-29  Changed controlled vocabulary of 'status' attribute on <availability> to
                          UVa-specific terms (public | uva | viva | restricted).
     1.11     2004-03-31  Changed content model for <body> to allow <pb> (NEWSPAPER only). Needed for
                          cases where page break occurs in midst of a series of gaps (ads, comic
                          strips, etc.) such that there is no div to contain the pb.
     1.12     2004-04-23  Added feature selection entity STANDALONE_HEADER to allow validation of
                          <standaloneHeader> documents. These documents are analogous to <ihs>
                          (independent headers) documents (except that the content model of <ihs>
                          allows one or more <teiHeader> elements, while the content model of
                          <standaloneHeader> allows exactly one <teiHeader>). Because the ihs DTD is
                          not extensible, any customization of TEI header-related elements cannot be
                          applied to <ihs> documents. For this reason the ability to validate
                          standalone headers has been incorporated into this DTD, rather than using
                          the TEI ihs DTD.
     1.13     2004-04-26  Added attribute 'altType' on <title>. It is intended to be used in the TEI
                          header when type="alternate" (corresponds to MARC field 246) to indicate
                          the type of alternate title.
     1.14     2004-05-20  Added "issue" "date" and "former" to enumerated vocabulary for attribute
                          'type' on <title>.
     1.15     2004-08-31  Dispensed with attribute 'altType' on <title> and instead moved values
                          "portion" "parallel" etc. corresponding to MARC 246 2nd indicator into
                          enumerated vocabulary for attribute 'type'.
     1.16     2004-09-23  [Changes not implemented]
     1.17     2004-10-08  Added "sort" to enumerated values for 'type' attribute on <title>. The
                          "sort" title is the main title with nonfiling characters moved to the end
                          - e.g. "Cavalier Daily, The " (4 nonfiling characters). Removed "gmd"
                          from enumerated values for 'type' attribute on <title>.
     1.18     2004-10-15  Added feature selection entities TRANS and NONTRANS to allow using this
                          DTD to validate non-transcription (page-image-only) TEI documents.
     1.19     2004-10-25  Added <biblScope> to <titleStmt> and <seriesStmt>. Needed for TEI headers
                          for issues of a serial or volumes of a multi-volume set, to specify scope
                          of item in hand, e.g. volume number, issue number, or issue date.
     1.20     2004-12-09  Changed <fileDesc> to allow more than one <seriesStmt> as requested by
                          Metadata Steering Group (changed from ? to *). Also removed <table> from
                          content model for <row>. (Nested tables are still allowed within <cell>.)
     1.21     2004-12-13  Removed <cb/> and <pb/> from content model for <row> and <cell>. (Column
                          and page breaks are allowed between table rows, but not within them.)
                          Also removed values "date" and "issue" from allowed values for attribute
                          'type' on <title>, since these values are no longer being used
                          (see 1.14, 2004-05-20 above).
     1.22     2005-01-07  Changed content model of <front> to allow zero or more <pb/> elements at
                          the beginning of <front> (POSTKB only). Needed for cases where the first
                          several page breaks are the front cover, spine, back cover, etc. These
                          pb's should be placed directly within <front>, rather than in a div1,
                          because they are not part of the "content," which for our purposes means
                          transcriptional content.
     1.23     2005-02-02  Changed content model of <front> to allow one or more <pb/> elements, with
                          no other content. Needed for cases where the front matter contains only
                          page breaks for the front cover, spine, back cover, etc.
     1.24     2005-02-18  Changed attribute 'type' on <titlePage> from CDATA to enumerated
                          vocabulary. Reverted 'resp' on <corr> from REQUIRED back to its original
                          status of %INHERITED; (when converting existing markup to this DTD, you
                          don't always know who made the corrections).
     1.25     2005-02-25  Added feature selection entity MANUSCRIPT to allow manuscript-specific
                          parts of the DTD to be included or excluded by the document instance as
                          appropriate.
     1.26     2005-03-24  Added 'pid' attribute on <pb> and <figure> elements, to facilitate
                          delivery of TEI documents containing unparsed entities for page images
                          and figure images.
     1.27     2005-03-31  - Changed <fileDesc> to allow more than one <publicationStmt> as
                            requested by Metadata Steering Group (changed from one to +).
                          - Added new elements for encoding manuscript letters: <postmark>, <to>,
                            <from>, and <stamp> (MANUSCRIPT only). These are allowed within
                            <opener>; they are needed for identifying the addressing information
                            found on the envelope accompanying a manuscript letter (or written on
                            the back of a folded letter page, etc.). Added 'enclosure' to a.divtype
                            (MANUSCRIPT only - for enclosures accompanying manuscript letters).
     1.28     2005-05-02  Added 'announcement', 'report', 'resolution', 'roll-call', and 'statement'
                          to a.divtype for use with meeting minutes (namely Board of Visitors
                          minutes). Also added 'memorandum' to a.divtype.
     1.29     2005-05-06  Changed 'hand' attribute on <add> and <del> from %INHERITED; to #REQUIRED.
                          Also reverted 'resp' attribute from #REQUIRED back to its original TEI
                          status of %INHERITED;. Reading the TEI Guidelines (element reference)
                          reveals that for <add> and <del>, resp "signifies the editor or
                          transcriber responsible for identifying the hand of the deletion", whereas
                          hand "signifies the hand of the agent which made the deletion" (which is
                          what we were erroneously using 'resp' for previously).
     1.30     2005-06-16  Added figure element to x.common (thus adding it to m.common class).
                          Previous versions of the TEI DTD files included <figure> in m.common, but
                          the current version (dated 2004-07-15) does not. It is appropriate to
                          allow <figure> to be in m.common - so that, for example, figure can be
                          the one and only child of a div. Similarly added <figure> to x.inter and
                          x.tpParts, for the same reason. Also removed <figure> from m.Incl. The
                          current version of the TEI DTD files includes <figure> in m.Incl, but we
                          view <figure> as a content element, not as an element on a par with <pb/>,
                          <gap/>, etc.
     1.31     2005-07-07  Relaxed 'type' attribute on <lg> from REQUIRED to original TEI status of
                          IMPLIED. Reason: The type of a line group is not always obvious,
                          especially to encoding vendors, and requiring it was leading to heavy use
                          of type="group", which is meaningless and should be avoided.
     1.32     2005-07-21  Restored 'level' attribute on <title> for POSTKB mode only.
     1.33     2005-07-29  Added 'altRend' attribute on <gap/>; used when reason="editorial" and
                          print source has a specific manner of rendering editorial omissions, such
                          as multiple asterisks, multiple em dashes, etc.
                          Also changed 'place' attribute on <add> from CDATA to enumerated
                          vocabulary (using the values suggested in the TEI Guidelines) and changed
                          from IMPLIED to REQUIRED.
                          Also added values "inscription" (for signatures, handwritten dedications,
                          etc.), "obituary" (for death notices), "insert" (for loose or bound pages
                          added into a book), and "page" (for any single page of content, typically
                          a manuscript page) to a.divtype.
     1.34     2005-08-08  Added "addenda" to a.divtype.
     1.35     2005-09-21  Added 'pid' attribute to <frontispiece> and <ornament>, because these
                          elements have 'entity' attributes, like <figure> and <pb>. ('pid' had
                          previously been added for <figure> and <pb>; see 1.26, 2005-03-24 above.)
     1.36     2005-10-26  Added 'type' attribute on <dateRange>, for consistency with same attribute
                          on <date>.
     1.37     2005-11-18  Added "unknown" as a value for 'reason' attribute on <gap/> (POSTKB only).
                          Mainly useful for migration projects where the reason for an omission
                          really is unknown.
     1.38     2006-01-13  Added feature selection entity OCR to allow OCR-specific parts of the DTD
                          (markup features designed for use with electronic transcriptions created
                          via OCR rather than double keyboarding) to be included or excluded by the
                          document instance as appropriate.
     1.39     2006-02-09  Added 'canto' to a.divtype.
     1.40     2006-03-22  Changed 'agent' and 'extent' attributes on <damage> to REQUIRED. Also
                          added <damage> to content model for <stamp>. (These changes apply to
                          MANUSCRIPT only.)
     1.41     2006-04-04  Changed to allow <gap/> at the beginning of <front> (in addition to <pb>).
     1.42     2006-04-05  Added <note> to content model for <signed>. Reason:
                          Notes should be allowed wherever note references (ref or ptr) are allowed. But
                          adding <note> to m.loc (which is part of m.phrase) is not possible because doing so
                          creates an ambiguous content model (conflicts with <note> in m.inter, I suspect),
                          so we have no choice but to add <note> directly to the content models of those
                          elements that need it.
     1.43     2006-04-28  Changed to allow <figure> (in addition to <pb>) within <div1> for NONTRANS texts.
     1.44     2006-06-05  Changed 'type' attribute on <seg> to REQUIRED, with an enumerated vocabulary.
                          Also added <figure> to content model for <docImprint> and <closer>. (We have
                          excluded <figure> from m.Incl [see 1.30, 2005-06-16 above], but in the
                          case of <docImprint> and <closer> there is a genuine need for <figure>.)
     1.45     2006-06-06  Added feature selection entity RUBY to allow ruby markup. Added ruby-specific
                          elements, based on the W3C Recommedation: http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby/
     1.46     2006-06-12  Added <note> to content model for <closer>, <salute> and <byline>. (See
                          comment for 1.42, 2006-04-05 above.)
     1.47     2006-09-18  Added 'argument' to a.divtype. Yes, there is an element <argument>, but
                          there are times when an argument is preceded by a preface, prologue, etc.
                          that must be marked as a div. A div cannot be followed by an <argument>
                          element. For this reason, 'argument' is needed as a div type.
     1.48     2006-09-27  Added feature selection entity VERSE. This switch does *not* enable the
                          TEI base tag set for verse. Instead, the base tag set for prose remains
                          in effect and a limited number of verse-related features are enabled -
                          namely, the <caesura> element is available. In the TEI P4 class system,
                          <caesura> is a phrase-level element (member of m.phrase) that can occur
                          just about anywhere. To limit the use of <caesura> to <l>, which is what
                          we want, it will be necessary to use an external QA mechanism (XSLT QA
                          stylesheet).
     1.49     2006-10-25  Added values "before" and "after" to enumerated vocabulary for 'certainty'
                          attribute on <date> element.
     1.50     2006-12-15  Added 'contract' and 'manuscript' to a.divtype. Added 'envelope' to
                          a.divtype.manuscript.
     1.51     2007-01-16  Make <extent> repeatable (change from zero-or-one to zero-or-more) in
                          biblFull (thus affecting sourceDesc, but not fileDesc); add 'type'
                          attribute on <extent>. These changes are needed for sheet music, which
                          has both physical dimensions (MARC 300) and playing time (MARC 306). Also
                          reverted 'id' attribute on <language> from REQUIRED back to IMPLIED. This
                          is needed in cases where a language is used in more than one way - for
                          example the same language is declared twice, once for usage="main" and
                          again for usage="accompanying material" or other use.
     1.52     2007-04-18  Add <stage> to content model for <lg>. There is a case where <stage> is
                          legitimately needed within <lg>: verse drama. <stage> is, of course,
                          allowed in <sp>, and there is no reason why it shouldn't be allowed if
                          the verse speech happens to be divided into line groups.
     1.53     2007-06-08  Added "parent" to enumerated values for 'type' attribute on <title>, as
                          requested by Cataloging (Erin Stalberg) for use in TEI headers
                          representing a work (short story, poem, etc.) that is part of a larger
                          monographic work (collection, anthology, etc.). The larger work (parent)
                          will be identified (in the header for the child work) using
                          <title type="parent">.
     1.54     2007-06-24  Added 'decree' and 'postscript' to a.divtype. (pdr4h)
     1.55     2007-06-27  Added 'anon' to enumerated vocabulary for the type attribute on seg.
                          A <seg> with this type is analogous to <ab>, existing inline instead of
                          as a block. (pdr4h)
     1.56     2008-01-11  Changed attributes on <teiHeader>: Changed 'type' attribute from CDATA to
                          enumerated vocabulary and made it REQUIRED. Changed 'creator' attribute
                          from CDATA to enumerated vocabulary. Changed 'status' from default value
                          "new" to IMPLIED. See declaration of <teiHeader> for additional comments.
                          (gpm2a)
     1.57     2008-01-18  Changed 'type' attribute on <title> from default value "main" to IMPLIED.
                          This reverts to out-of-the-box TEI. Default attribute values are evil,
                          and I don't know why we added one here. If a <title> has no 'type'
                          attribute, it makes no claim as to its type; it cannot be assumed
                          (especially in teiHeader) to be the main title.
     1.58     2008-11-03  Reverted content model for <note> to out-of-the-box TEI, which allows
                          phrase-level markup or block-level markup or both. Previously we had
                          allowed block-level markup only (no phrase-level markup except initial
                          <seg type="note-symbol"> for note symbol). There are many, many cases in
                          which a <note> contains only a phrase and cannot reasonably be considered
                          to require a <p> or even an <ab>. The <note> itself is a block. What we
                          really want to is to allow either phrase-level or block-level but not both
                          simulataneously, but this is not possible in a DTD because it causes an
                          ambiguous content model. Enforcing that requires an external
                          post-validation QA check.

     This DTD is intended for use in two distinct ways: as a keyboarding DTD used by third-party
     keyboarding vendors, and for post-keyboarding in-house processing. The VENDOR and POSTKB
     "switches" allow invoking the DTD for either purpose. By default, the switches are set for
     use as a vendor DTD. For use as a post-keyboarding DTD, the POSTKB switch must be enabled in
     the document's internal subset, like so:

     This DTD can be used to encode electronic texts derived from books, newspapers, or

     default. When encoding newspapers, the NEWSPAPER switch must be enabled in the document's
     internal subset:

     When encoding manuscripts, the MANUSCRIPT switch must be enabled in the document's internal

     This DTD can also be used to encode dictionaries using the TEI tagset for printed dictionaries.
     The DTD requirements specific to dictionaries are disabled by default; when encoding

     This DTD accommodates ruby markup. "Ruby" is a feature common in Japanese and other East Asian
     texts in which a short span of text (the base text) is glossed by a short annotation (the ruby

     http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby/

     As the W3C Recommendation explains, there are two main kinds of ruby markup: simple and
     complex. This DTD allows both kinds.

                (a) disallows arbitrary rend values ("italics", "italic", "ital" for same feature)
		(b) only allows values for alignment and indentation (not typographic changes)
		(c) requires typographic rendering to be indicated within structural markup
                    (e.g. <p><hi rend="italic">...</hi></p> not <p rend="italic">...</p>).
                For elements that need other 'rend' values, a.global will not be used; instead
                a.global.no_rend will be used and 'rend' will be declared with a different
