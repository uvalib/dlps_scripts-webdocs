  uva-tei-spoken.ent

  One of two extension files (see also uva-tei-spoken.dtd) constituting a
  customization of TEI P4, following the method described in the TEI
  Guidelines, chapter 29, "Modifying and Customizing the TEI DTD".

    http://www.tei-c.org/P4X/MD.html

  This DTD is intended for use with documents containing transcriptions of
  speech, such as a transcript of an audio recording. It was created for use by
  the University of Virginia Library in connection with faculty digitization
  projects.

  2009-08-05: gpm2a: Changed the definition of a.divn to include a.timed
  attributes. This allows <div#> elements to carry @start and @end attributes,
  which allows structural/semantic divisions (groups of utterances) within a
  transcription of speech to be temporally situated just like utterances.
